        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>i&#39;ve had a couple people who were overseas tell me some crazy stuff that was really going on with our military overseas....what really caught my attention was how heroin and opiates recently became extremely popular in my town (no ghetto)...a few years ago i never would know where to get it, now i can get it just as easy as weed.</p>

<p>my younger brother along with several other friends close to me have had their lives taken over by heroin. everyone i knew started with oxycodone, which in my area goes for $15-20 per 30mg IR tablet. eventually after you don&#39;t even realize how much you&#39;re taking them and then later how you need to start buying more than one, you eventually have to other choice to switch to the cheaper alternative, heroin (black tar where i am. west coast)....i&#39;ve done it several times if my friends offered to smoke me out, but eventually i realized how bad they were and if i kept up doing it with them i would be right where they are. thankfully i realized what path i was on before it was too late.</p>

<p>my best friend was fired from his job from stealing. first doing it in well-planned out ways, but eventually so desperate he was doing it in ways he was bound to get caught. then my brother who even hated when i would smoke weed eventually got to the age where he tried weed and was doing that for a while with no problems, but that group of friends started doing oxy&#39;s which if you are too young to know what kind of road you&#39;re going down you don&#39;t see much wrong with it. before you know it he&#39;s stealing from us (finally we had to kick him out...i don&#39;t wanna hear posts like i&#39;ve heard before along the lines of that we don&#39;t care, didn&#39;t try hard to help him, etc...we did. we gave him 5252552343 chances, always offered to send him to rehab, get him any help it would take to get better, etc...but enough was enough he was uncontrollable, he would flip and get to the point where it would get a bit scary). we sent him to nice rehabs several times but he always walked out after just a couple days. he later got theft and shoplifting charges, and he was officially a full blown addict. for a while my parents were in denial about how bad it was, but i told them what this **** does to people and even then it took them a while to fully see it. as much as he stole from my family (which is A LOT. computers, video games, any electronics or anything that could be pawned) i can&#39;t be mad at him. at first i wanted to do nothing more than knock some sense into him, which i went after him one time and he was so twacked out psychologically he called the police saying i went after him, and lied and said i had a gun....i told him they&#39;re not gonna believe a drug addict...he took off and me and my mom explained the truth and how he was a drug addict . after that i realized how at this point it was the drug taking him over and i couldn&#39;t get mad for his actions.</p>

<p>sure he shouldn&#39;t ever try something like heroin, but i can&#39;t say too much since i messed around with for a bit. i&#39;ve always done hard drugs every now and then, just used in moderation and had self control...but some people can&#39;t do it as easily, or they&#39;re already sucked in too deep once they realize it what is happening to them. i&#39;ve seen my brother withdrawling from opiates and i feel terrible, opiate withdrawls (especially at his time/amount of use) are described by many users that they would rather be dead when they&#39;re sick. he would cry, throw up, be curled up in a fetal position, and just be feeling miserable. it was hard to watch.</p>

<p>anyone who has battled with an opiate addiction, or someone close to them has, only you truly know how bad it is. me just doing it a few times was i could tell how much addiction potential was there....i can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like doing it for years.</p>

<p>that&#39;s a very brief background info that has caused nothing but stress, anxiety, and anger among my family.</p>

<p>anyways here are some pretty crazy pieces of information regarding the corrupt things the US government is currently doing:</p>

<p>rogan explains how heroin production has increased a tremendous amount since we we have been in afghanistan. also talks about what we are doing over there (talks about same stuff that military people have told me) like how we control the crops now, and how CIA members are transporting them, and even selling them. and some other stuff</p>

<p>here is also a recent article, &quot;CIA Plane Crash Lands With Four Tons Of Cocaine&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would encourage you to read about the Sassoon/Rothschilds connection to the Opium Wars in China and how Hong Kong was founded. Then read Salvador Astucia&#39;s writing about the &quot;Opium Lords&quot; and the Golden Triangle this tells a lot about what happened before, during and after the Vietnam era. Then read Gary Webb&#39;s &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; about cocaine and I think you will begin to see how this all connects and works. The whole Afghanistan thing is still evolving, but it is the Usual Suspects. </p>

<p>You can a kind of a quick internet search on all three areas to begin to see the big picture. But man it is a deep rabbit hole. </p>

<p>After the British established Hong Kong as a colony in the aftermath of the Opium Wars, local merchants felt the need for a bank to finance the growing opium trade with China, so they established (by special permit from the British) the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation - HSBC today - &quot;The World&#39;s Bank&quot;.</p>

<p>This is the same bank that almost 30 years ago built the world&#39;s most expensive building as their head office in Hong Kong - 1 billion US dollars.</p>

<p>If I didn&#39;t know better I&#39;d guess that Big Pharma is in bed with whomever in the US govt is bringing all of the heroin in...after all, you gotta admit that Oxycontin/Vicodin are the perfect gateway opiates!</p>

<p>I know what opiate addiction is like first-hand and I truly wish your brother and your family well.</p>

<p>Please research Suboxone and try to get your brother on board...it really is a miracle drug for opiate addiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s true.  Under the Taliban, opium production was relatively low...at least compared to what it&#39;s been since we took over the poppy fields.  The increase is some astronomical number I can&#39;t even remember.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We always heard about the Afghan fighters fighting each other all the time but never wondered what those guys were fighting over since the country was basically a rock garden. They were fighting over control of the mountain passes that drug dealers had to use to get their product to sea and to the rest of the world. </p>

<p>The Taliban almost extinguished the opium trade after they gained power in Afghanistan. You can google the opium trade before 9-11 and after and while almost non-existent before bush &amp; Co. arrived, the production goes back to full swing shortly after we arrived. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also interesting to note, for those who claim they need that product to survive, when wheat went through the roof a few years back and grain became expensive, those same opium farmers planted wheat and did very well. When the price of wheat dropped, they went back to their most profitable crop, opium. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi this is kind of off-topic, but it could potentially help those around you who are addicted to opiates. There&#39;s an Indonesian plant called kratom (or mytragyna speciosa), which is an opioid that has been used for hundreds of years by local farmers. It gave them strength to work all day while feeling both relaxed and alert/clear headed. </p>

<p>The effects of kratom are both stimulant-like and sedative-like. Stimulant in small dosages, sedative in large dosages. A bit of both in mediocre dosages. </p>

<p>My point is that this opioid isn&#39;t limited to recreational or traditional usage. It&#39;s also used by opiate addicts trying to gradually beat their addiction. Or for pain relief in those who experience chronic pain. So it&#39;s very useful for varying purposes, it&#39;s dirt cheap, legal in most places and  can be purchased on the internet.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s too late or you&#39;ve already looked into this option, but kratom is currently helping people I personally know to beat an addiction to opiates. You should look into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a public service reminder, if you&#39;re going to use opiates please be responsible with them. They&#39;re very insidious, it&#39;s what makes them so addictive. However, it is very easy to control your use if you set limits for yourself and agree to never cross them under any circumstance. For me, I use opiates no more than once a week(I prefer them to alcohol as my &quot;hard&quot; drug of choice), if I catch myself rationalizing breaking my rule I force myself to take at least a month off. I find this is the best way to avoid physical dependence. All drugs can be used responsibly and with relative safety with the right information, be safe everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how we&#39;re all blaming the government now for poor life choices. Heroin was a huge problem in my hometown as well, and I lived in a wealthy, predominantly white suburb of NYC. Even if the military is responsible for a drop in the price of heroin, blaming the government for your friends&#39; heroin usage is stupid, and you should realize your friends are the one to blame. If you reflect on your experiences, you will see that everyone generally starts using OxyCodone first, and I would be willing to bet access to pharmaceuticals is a necessary precursor to heroin addiction. Maybe we should reconsider our drug education strategies and severely limit the amount of opiates available medicinally. </p>

<p>I guess the point is, heroin isn&#39;t like pasta sauce at the grocery store. Just because there is a great deal on it doesn&#39;t mean you need to buy some. There are many things to blame the government for, but your friends&#39; heroin addiction isn&#39;t one of them, sorry.</p>

Just remember your average first time drug user has never dealt with a drug dealer before but your average drug dealer has dealt with many first time users.  By prohibiting drug use and declaring with much fanfare a decades long war on illicit drugs the government does indeed have an obligation to the community to regulate the unscrupulous and criminal actions of drug dealers and suppliers on unsuspecting members of the public.  What the fuck are you talking about Velium?</p>
