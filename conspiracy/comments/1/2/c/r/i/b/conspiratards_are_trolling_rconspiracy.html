        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have proof that conspiratards are trolling r/conspiracy. just read this thread in it&#39;s entirety.
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/12bat4/misandry_conspiracy/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/12bat4/misandry_conspiracy/</a> </p>

<p>you will see that there a couple of users who keep on sending messages that to refute my argument that don&#39;t make sense at all. check their post history and you will see that at least one of them was trolling r/conspiracy. I remember reading that conspiratards aren&#39;t allowed to post/troll on r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>so i checked r/conspiratard and what do you know this shows up, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/12cltp/get_the_popcorn_out_theres_some_kind_of/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/12cltp/get_the_popcorn_out_theres_some_kind_of/</a>.</p>

<p>Also this too,<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/122jze/us_israel_hold_largestever_joint_military_drill/c6rrgud">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/122jze/us_israel_hold_largestever_joint_military_drill/c6rrgud</a> about my post on false flags then conspiratards posted this,<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/12384g/whos_to_say_the_they_did_plan_a_false_flag_attack/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/12384g/whos_to_say_the_they_did_plan_a_false_flag_attack/</a>. 
   So comrades remember don&#39;t make the same mistake that i did and feed the troll for 4 fucking hours. Stay vigilant and kick these disinfo scum out of our subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re asking. In general though for a vaccine to work either some part or the whole thing that you&#39;re trying to vaccinate for has to be in the vaccine in order to teach your body how to recognize it. A virus can, for instance, have its genetic code removed, thus rendering it unable to reproduce, and then put into people where their immune system learns to recognize it for a future date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, to stimulate an immune response, thus building antibodies and defending you in the future.  The vaccine is supposed to have dead virus cells or (idk the word, but basically sluggish, near dead, easy to pick off ones) that you&#39;re WBCs easily attack.  So, you may get a cold/mild symptoms because you are actually being injected with the virus, just not a healthy virus.  </p>

<p>The conspiracy part comes in when people say the government is giving us live, healthy virus cells so we guaranteed get sick.  Little crazy IMO, I dont understand what giving people the flu does (other than create conditions for a possible pandemic).  Whatever though, fuck flu shots.  I&#39;ve never gotten one, never intend to.</p>

<p>Of course this ignoring the fact that conspiracy, is well conspiracy... and is such will attract some truly ridiculous conspiracies. Many of the things posted here are reasonable and actually make sense but you&#39;ll never see you little bitches linking to those. Mostly because you try to prove the entire apple is bad by pointing out a rotten part.</p>

<p>In fact, it shows that most people in conspiratard are deeply disturbed by the idea that some conspiracies might be real. They can&#39;t really debate it so they just cherry pick and mock the most stupid things in the subbreddit. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a nice solution for this anyway... it&#39;s called browsing with the new feature instead of top comment. I do this this in this subreddit because the xenophobia can sometimes obscure good commentary.</p>

<ol>
<li>You must admit believers in conspiracy theories have some very convenient rhetorical trap doors, such as claiming that any reputable source is biased and controlled by a malicious group.</li>
</ol>

<p>True. But human thinking in general suffers from this. For example the &quot;reputable sources&quot; you are talking about are not as reputable as you think. Rather, you have been socially conditioned to believe these sources are reliable. A major western news network, think tank or university is little more reliable then a youtube video or blog. Both are produced by people with definite agendas. The difference is the &quot;reputable sources&quot; have money and power behind them, and of course social identification. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many of your objections are valid, but when you discuss conspiracy this crap is going to happen. Things which are hidden from the public are not meant to be out there in the reputable sources. Naturally when you attempt to discuss things that are obscured, the discussion may be... obscured.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you guys were really willing to discuss conspiracy theory, as you say, then you would actually be discussing it instead of cherry picking the most retarded things to mock.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I would love it if conspiratard had more substantive discussions, hell I might even start posting there. Anyways I have some papers to write and stuff so I am done discussing it. I have said everything necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, what he was explaining was the concept of privilege. Note that the male stereotype is positive - able to take a beating and keep on ticking! - and the female stereotype is negative - too weak to beat a <em>real</em> man!</p>

<p>The privilege is that male stereotypes are, by and large, positive ones (tough, strong, logical, successful in business, etc.) whereas the female stereotypes are negative (weak, emotional, clueless in the real world, need a strong man to protect them, etc.). The thing is, I&#39;ll agree that both sides are hurt by these stereotypes, as will 90% of modern feminists. This is what they mean when they say &quot;the patriarchy hurts men too.&quot; I&#39;m not particularly manly, I&#39;ve had some mental health issues in the past, and my girlfriend rather assertively wears the pants in our relationship -- all of which I&#39;m looked down on for by society. But the fact that I&#39;m expected to wear the pants, be mentally blemish-free, and be a butch lumberjack are all parts of the patriarchal gender narrative. So is the idea that men can take a hit to the balls from a woman, but a woman could never take a hit to the vag from a guy.</p>

<p>You&#39;re fighting the same thing I am, you just don&#39;t see the other side of the coin.</p>

<p>ETA: Note that he never said he found the guy getting hit in the balls hilarious - he said it is <em>considered</em> funny.</p>

<p>I remember reading that conspiratards aren&#39;t allowed to post/troll on r/conspiracy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not allowed to troll. Posting is fine. Cross-trolling subs is prohibited for the same reason that cross-trolling was prohibited back in the Golden Days of Usenet newsgroup - because otherwise it turns into a perpetual flame war. Nobody wants that. Even trolls don&#39;t want that because it forces out all the non-trolls.</p>

<p>Look, nobody is stopping you from posting on r/conspiratard. Just be polite and argue your case, and you&#39;ll quickly find out that (a) there are people there who will gladly talk to you politely and (b) there are people there who will gladly yell and scream and swear at you. In other words, it has idiots and gentlefolk just like other else. Talk to the mods if you really think that somebody is cross-trolling.</p>

<p>Also, I won&#39;t ruin your fun of looking through my posting history. Go right ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I have posted there and I read it on and off. It&#39;s my opinion that a lot of conspiracists take themselves far too seriously and need a remedial course in logical fallacies, but it&#39;s also my opinion that the point-and-laugh mentality of a lot of people on r/conspiritard is mean and utterly cowardly. I&#39;ll gladly tell somebody to their face that they suck (well, not so gladly - I&#39;m not big on aggressive confrontation - but you get my point), but find talking about people behind their back reprehensible.</p>

<p>I have three comments, if you permit me.</p>

<p>1) Moderators aren&#39;t on 24/7. Give them some time to respond before you start convincing yourself that you&#39;re in a hole with no way out.</p>

<p>2) Just because somebody disagrees with you, doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re trolling you. Even if that person is a troll in other regards, doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re not being honest in this case. There are very, <em>very</em> few people are able to troll in everything they say. It&#39;s possible that a mod doesn&#39;t think that they person is trolling (though I think the mod would say something).</p>

<p>3) Go do something else for a while. It&#39;s a lot easier to deal with a problem when you&#39;re not as emotionally vested in it. Trust me - I&#39;ve been in your position before and not once has flying off the handle ever helped me. Trolls troll in order to get an emotional reaction - kinda like one you&#39;re giving right now. The last thing you want to do is be turned into a lolcow i.e. somebody who can be milked again and again and again by trolling because they can&#39;t help themselves.</p>

<p>See, you guys have a problem here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and I think most of you are aware of it, or... you see the problem from a bit of a different perspective.</p>

<p>The problem is do you want this place to be a circlejerk? Slinging the ole butter on each other making everyone feel happy cause they have a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Or, do you want this place to be a real base of information, a place to hone a theory, and gain more information for it, and help others with theirs.</p>

<p>If you want the first option, then just ban anyone who ever dissents. It&#39;s that easy. Ban all who don&#39;t coddle OP, and move along.</p>

<p>If you want the second one however, then accept that you are going to have to back up things with knowledge, and evidence, and you will accept criticism head on, and accept or deny its validity, based upon reality. Not based upon.....</p>

<p>but but but.... guuuuuys!!! These guys said I might be wrong!! They must be disinfo nazi muslim tards!! </p>

<p>What happened here was nothing more than Youdoneit showing his true face. Someone spoke up in disagreement, quite cordially I might add, and instead of using his brain, using any type of intellect at all, he went on a little kiddy warpath of insults and namecalling, utterly ignoring multiple attempts to explain the opposing theory.</p>

<p>If you choose the second option I listed up above.... it would be people like him that need to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hahahahaha - when did I say male on female violence is ok?</p>

<p>I suggested that <em>possibly</em> we are predisposed to finding female on male violence amusing. Perhaps that is due to the idea that women generally can&#39;t harm men? That&#39;s seems more likely to me than brainwashing due to America&#39;s Funniest Home Videos (it wouldn&#39;t be a show if it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> already funny).</p>

<p>You see, I&#39;ve been incredibly reasonable. I know this for a fact, because I&#39;m usually incredibly unreasonable. Like most of the time I would just call you dumb and make up stupid questions that would make you look dumber - but I actually took the time to explain why you don&#39;t understand feminism and you just reject it with <em>literally</em> no thought.</p>

<p>You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Really - why would a feminist <strong>not* care about male on female violence. That&#39;s basically the **dumbest</strong> thing I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

<p>If you are wondering why I keep responding it&#39;s because maybe you will kill yourself, or at least stay off the internet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny in the Airforce chart how enemy propaganda only slips into social media, when there is a ton of evidence of propaganda being pushed by the media.  Anybody remember how the KGB said AIDS was created by the CIA in a lab?  Now, I&#39;m not taking the KGB&#39;s word that this revealed fabrication of theirs couldn&#39;t possibly be another form of disinfo, but it is very reasonable to assume intel agencies have a long history and continued use of agents and assets in media to push out their fabrications.</p>

<p>A good read on the subject is the book series, &quot;KGB: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow&quot; a series of conferences transcribed and published in the early 1990&#39;s.  Be warned though... the conferences were funded by George Soros (subject of many anti lefty conspiracies, still an interesting read.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seen this before, but will watch again, thanks.  </p>

<p>As far as &quot;ex-intel&quot; operatives/agents/assets go for info sources... I always look into their info and claims with a bit more skepticism than most sources because of their tendency to be recruited into disinfo campaigns and other nefarious activities.  They still drop many tasty breadcrumbs which I note and try to get around to researching.  One problem with research is the trustworthiness of info sources, lol.  For example, in the KGB books I mention it is said around half of KGB was media... fucking half.  That, combined with US disinfo, UK disinfo, Euro, Asian, African... the combined world&#39;s disinfo campaigns... researching shit is just weird.  Gotta rely a bit more on logic than data... but have nothing to analyze without data.  </p>

<p>The world of conspiracy research is fucking weird.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government Trolls?
Do you really believe that or are you just exaggerating as this thread seems to have gotten a little out of hand. 
Healthy debate is healthy. Hate and the exchanging of abuse is not. 
I subscribe to both subreddits as I find them both interesting perspectives the problem is threads often fall into exchanges of insults and nothing else which is the problem. 
I really don&#39;t think this subreddit or even this topic is worthy of anyones attention in the Government, the sad fact is r/conspiracy is no threat to the Government or established order it would simply be a waste of time and resources for them to employ people to Troll this subreddit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m posting because it&#39;s incredibly amusing, and believe it or not, the idea that I&#39;m a paid troll kinda bothers me because it&#39;s not true. It is amusing, but only in the context of your complete idiocy. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine how you would react to a real troll instead of someone that actually offered you patient arguments and tried to convince you. I get it, we don&#39;t agree. But you don&#39;t have to have a fit over it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did I say it was a juxtaposition? You are mistaking me with someone else, I&#39;m pretty sure. If you can find a quote of me saying it - I&#39;d be glad to address it. </p>

<p>So does my answer to this question determine whether or not I&#39;m a shill? Is this one question that you know the answer to <strong>so</strong> well that you could never be wrong? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think most people find &quot;male on female violence&quot; (as if that was just like an exact descriptor of something, like &#39;oh, I&#39;m watching the male on female violence channel&#39;) amusing because in most cases you&#39;d think the female would be fairly defenseless of such actions. </p>

<p>Though, I don&#39;t think your comparison is fair. You act is if people would laugh watching a woman savagely beat on a man. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. Yeah a guy getting kicked in the nuts is funny, regardless of whether or not a female did it to him. Sure, a slap to the face can elicit a laugh in a movie, but that&#39;s fairly contextual. And I think fewer and fewer people find that acceptable every day. Some of that work is due to the MRA guys, and some due to feminists as well. Unless you think feminists think it&#39;s ok to hit guys?</p>

<p>So really, why are your panties in such a <strong>goddamn</strong> bunch??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d laugh if a dude kicked a dude in the balls and maybe not every time, sometimes I&#39;d grimace. Depends, sometimes it can be funny if it&#39;s a little kid. It basically has nothing to do with the female. Although, are you aware there is a type of porn where guys do like to get kicked in the nuts? What do you think about that??</p>

<p>But I already said that. So clearly you can&#39;t fucking read. You are also a moron because you&#39;ve mixed me up with everyone else, like the people on conspiratard laughing at you. It&#39;s not one person. It&#39;s a bunch of people. You really come off that stupid - try and fucking think before you post.</p>

<li><p>I did not call you a little bitch, if you look closely I referred to the broad group of the subreddit, not you personally. However, you see what you want to see. I do thank you for coming here to discuss this in a reasonable manner though. </p></li>
<li><p>We really aren&#39;t anti-jew. There is a small and active portion (linked strongly with stormfront) that is very active and posting and upvoting things here. Most of the important discussions don&#39;t even have to do with Israel and Jews anyway. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>There&#39;s a nice solution for this anyway... it&#39;s called browsing with the new feature instead of top comment. I do this this in this subreddit because the xenophobia can sometimes obscure good commentary.</p>

<ol>
<li>You must admit believers in conspiracy theories have some very convenient rhetorical trap doors, such as claiming that any reputable source is biased and controlled by a malicious group.</li>
</ol>

<p>True. But human thinking in general suffers from this. For example the &quot;reputable sources&quot; you are talking about are not as reputable as you think. Rather, you have been socially conditioned to believe these sources are reliable. A major western news network, think tank or university is little more reliable then a youtube video or blog. Both are produced by people with definite agendas. The difference is the &quot;reputable sources&quot; have money and power behind them, and of course social identification. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many of your objections are valid, but when you discuss conspiracy this crap is going to happen. Things which are hidden from the public are not meant to be out there in the reputable sources. Naturally when you attempt to discuss things that are obscured, the discussion may be... obscured.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you guys were really willing to discuss conspiracy theory, as you say, then you would actually be discussing it instead of cherry picking the most retarded things to mock.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I would love it if conspiratard had more substantive discussions, hell I might even start posting there. Anyways I have some papers to write and stuff so I am done discussing it. I have said everything necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re asking. In general though for a vaccine to work either some part or the whole thing that you&#39;re trying to vaccinate for has to be in the vaccine in order to teach your body how to recognize it. A virus can, for instance, have its genetic code removed, thus rendering it unable to reproduce, and then put into people where their immune system learns to recognize it for a future date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, to stimulate an immune response, thus building antibodies and defending you in the future.  The vaccine is supposed to have dead virus cells or (idk the word, but basically sluggish, near dead, easy to pick off ones) that you&#39;re WBCs easily attack.  So, you may get a cold/mild symptoms because you are actually being injected with the virus, just not a healthy virus.  </p>

<p>The conspiracy part comes in when people say the government is giving us live, healthy virus cells so we guaranteed get sick.  Little crazy IMO, I dont understand what giving people the flu does (other than create conditions for a possible pandemic).  Whatever though, fuck flu shots.  I&#39;ve never gotten one, never intend to.</p>
