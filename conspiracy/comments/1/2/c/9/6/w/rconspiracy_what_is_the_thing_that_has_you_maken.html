       Well for the first 24 years of my life i didn't really care what happened, if shit hit the fan i could take care of me and my own just fine. Then my son was born and i realized all the bullshit i could ignore before meant something far more. I always knew what we were meant to believe was bullshit, i didnt need some ground breaking article or conspiracy facts, it was logic from the get go only this time i had someone who mattered to depend on me for his future.

       Always "felt" things were wrong on this planet ever since I was a kid.  Never watched the news on tv or listened to it on the radio because even as far back as then it simply "felt" wrong on an intuitive, gut level basis.  This is also the reason I've never once voted in my life.  It's all a sham.  I've literally always known this intuitively even though at the time I couldn't necessarily spell it out or explain it intellectually.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few short years ago, I discovered that various experiences I had when I was quite young coincided significantly with what many have described in contact experiences with possible off planet beings.  Researching and investigating further, I understood rather quickly that not only is this cosmos absolutely full of such entities (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">

        alone

       ), but as I began delving into just WHY a discovery of this monumental level of unprecedented magnitude has been keep under wraps on this planet, I began uncovering the huge level of collusion existing amongst some of the top people on this planet in the government, military, and civilian sector.

       Waking up is not in an instant, at least not for me, and I also believe that it isn't for others. I don't know if you even can ever truly wake up.

       Its more like, Hmmm... I was taught to believe X happened, but it looks like Y Z may have been factors. wtf.  all well...   Then the same cooky shit happens with other investigations. Appear to be coincidences, but when you further look into what other people are uncovering, it really makes you stop and think.  Its a gradual transition into not believing all the BS that is spoon fed to you by the people you think are in charge.

       I think eventually some people go off the deep end and try to find holes in EVERY story they hear from the distrust accumulated over the lies told from previous conspiracies.

       Reading The Illuminatus Trilogy at about the age of 12 introduced me to the concept that things could be a little different than they appear on the surface.  I knew at the time, of course, that this book was fictional, but it got me interested in parapolitics and deep events and history in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, the next really big one was 9/11.  That set the precedent for my researches into what the hell is really going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a few weeks ago I was introduced by a friend to the book series History: Fiction or Science which as opened my eyes even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to say that any one thing has cause me to wake up.  It's hard to even know what that means any more, as the more I learn, the less I am sure of what I learned before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is the point, though - a lot of conspiracy type researchers, like the Jesuit Alex Jones, are simply there to throw you off the trail.  You have to try to get close to the sources, and view any pseudo-mainstream conspiracy researchers with a bit of suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have found some to be more reliable than others, though - Joseph P. Farrell, Anatoly Fomenko, and a handful of others.  Don't believe me, though, because just like anybody else interested in the hidden world, I could be here to deceive you.  Make up your own mind.

       I would say that the single thing that "woke me up" was doing the research and learning the FACT that Israel perpetuated 9/11 for its own monetary and political gain--with, of course, the assistance of various sayanim and "closet Zionists" here in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I learned this truth, it opened me up to seeing how nearly EVERYTHING terrible that happens in the world somehow has that little rogue terror state's money behind it.

       How rational people can see a threat from Iran but not from "America's closest ally" is something that is inexplicable to me.

       It's not my job to defend myself to you. I believe what I believe and was simply answering a question. I don't feel the need to defend my beliefs to demanding ignorant people. Just a waste of my time. So instead of demanding proof from someone who doesn't feel like humoring you,  look for yourself and believe what you want just don't be an asshole. Faggot
