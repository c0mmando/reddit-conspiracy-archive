        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay, so we see a lot of posts here concerning smaller issues that are part of the vast conspiracy that has our society completely upside down.  I have no problem with detail.  However, I feel like a lot of people around here are missing the main idea when it comes to the collapse of society.  This post is not intended to be 100% fact or true.  I simply ask that you read what I wrote and provide me your thoughts.</p>

<p>Alrighty.</p>

<p>Whether or not you believe in the &quot;Illuminati&quot; or &quot;NWO&quot; or whatever ritualistic cabal is running this planet, a few things are fairly consistent.  Our society and this planet are completely going to shit.  Our financial model is totally unsustainable, and will require more than reform or restructuring in the relatively near future.  Most people here realize that the proverbial shit will hit the fan in their lifetimes.</p>

<p>The question is why?</p>

<p>If these people have so much control over our society now, why would they want it to collapse?  Of course they don&#39;t want it to collapse.  It&#39;s just the inevitable result of raping our civilization economically for many many years.  That very well may be true, but I&#39;m here to talk about why it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that this coming collapse is totally planned.  People often look at Alex Jones and wonder why he&#39;s allowed to say the things he does.  Why wouldn&#39;t they just kill him?  Because he has a job to do.  Alex Jones is just one cog in the machine of propagating revolution and systemic collapse.  It&#39;s always &quot;the bankers&quot; or &quot;the government&quot; that&#39;s responsible for these things.  It&#39;s the &quot;corporations&quot; that have to go.</p>

<p>While these things are all true, they are not the main source of the problem.  The main problem is the elite cabal which dictates policy in every aspect of our civilization.  Mainstream conspiracy would have you believe that these are high people in high places of government, financial institutions, and large corporations.  However, these people don&#39;t make the plans.  They simply execute them.</p>

<p>To get to the point... This collapse is coming because they want it to come.  It&#39;s designed that way.  Why?  Because people are learning more and more about how fucked the world is, and there will be more and more dissent as time passes.  A revolution is basically inevitable.</p>

<p>How do you stop a revolution that can&#39;t be stopped?  You defeat the enemy yourself.  You collapse the economy.  Along with it the government and all the major businesses sink to the bottom of the ocean, so to speak.  Just as the people think they have won, you deceptively suggest and implement new solutions which sound good on the surface, but are very manipulative.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no 1984 coming.  It&#39;s never going to be a worldwide police state for very long.  Overt oppression has never worked, and it&#39;s never been a tool of the cabal.  They like to set up systems that deceive people, and get people to believe and buy in.  It is my opinion that this is the root of the New Age movement.</p>

<p>In essence, this new &quot;utopia&quot; that the cabal wants to create through this process is simply more of the same.  It&#39;s the same kind of manipulation and deceit that&#39;s been going on for centuries, only now with a new label and a slightly different flavor.</p>

<p>Anyone else have any thoughts?  Agree or disagree?</p>

<p>EDIT:  Guys I just want to thank everyone for contributing to this discussion.  This isn&#39;t about whether or not you agree with me.  I just want to talk about this stuff.  I don&#39;t really believe anything.  I just have a set of theories based on a continuous stream of information through my own research.  I&#39;m always looking for more information and insight that differs from what I have seen.  I will sweep through later and give upboats.  I&#39;m at work and its hard for me to do a lot on reddit ATM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nothing is by coincidence. there are some freak incidents, but the big truman show is running according to a fixed plan. It is easily a 50-150 year plan they are following. You see this easily by looking at how 911 was coordinated with Saturn&#39;s orbit. 1971 built, 2001 destroyed both times Saturn in Gemini....and he takes 30y for one orbit.</p>

<p>The collapse deliberately coincides with the conscious shift that is occuring around 2012. It is meant to keep us in fear. This is the reason WHY it is being done NOW. You will see that the dollar/fed self destruction will occur exactly 100 tears after its founding in 1913. It has been long planned this way.</p>

<p>What to do? Be aware of things, but step out emotionally. Whatch it as a neutral spectacle, thus it will die off quicker. it is electric, male focus combined with magnetic, female emotions. They use this as &quot;black magic&quot; but it is a neutral technology.</p>

<p>YOU create. This is also why they allow AJ to fearmonger. It helps the plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree that the financial collapse is engineered. there were steps that could have been taken to &quot;repair&quot; the broken economies, but all the actions taken by governments and central banks are only making the problem even more severe. i disagree with your statement &quot;There&#39;s no 1984 coming&quot;. in many ways, it&#39;s already here. the NSA has vast surveillance program that monitors damn near everything; including our posts. i assume that a financial collapse and strong police state is necessary to continue the elite agenda of controlling the globe. when people are desperate, they will resort to violence. this will justify brutal police tactics, and swelling prison numbers. if you want to control the masses, you cannot have an open debate on policies (foreign or domestic), the trend is that more people are becoming aware of the manipulation of government, finance and the gross inequities in the utilization of the planets resources. if this continues, the evidence of corruption (that has already been exposed) will become mainstream, and there will be a unified demand for justice and reform. as you said, &quot;a revolution is basically inevitable&quot;, and in order to make sure they can maintain control, they are trying to make it a violent revolution rather than a peaceful one. in a violent revolution, the elites have the advantage. in a peaceful revolution, they are exposed. so, yeah, i pretty much agree with your take on things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I said there is no 1984 coming, I worded it poorly.  Of course there is a police state mentality going on right now, and lots of things that were predicted in 1984 have come true on local and national levels.  However, I really meant to say that there is no global 1984 police state coming.  Where we will be under a one world government police state, and everyone is subject to its control via oppressive means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A certification or title is no substitute for self education.  However, self education is certainly a substitute for an official certification or title.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems with our world today is that people simply believe what people say based on what their title or position is.  If they seem qualified to make a decision, they must be telling the truth.  Inversely, if someone has very little or no credentials, there is no way they know what they are talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;there were steps that could have been taken to &quot;repair&quot; the broken economies, but all the actions taken by governments and central banks are only making the problem even more severe&quot;</p>

<p>Notice he doesn&#39;t give any suggestions for these steps?  Because he doesn&#39;t know them.  He&#39;s heard this claim before and is just parroting it.  There were certainly issues with lack of regulation in US banking which contributed to the recent GFC but to claim the central banks orchestrated it is to ignore pretty much every other central bank and government outside the US.  It&#39;s also assuming the central bank had a roll to play in the problem when it was more a government regulation and consumer issue.</p>

<p>People on this subreddit are very quick to dismiss the idea of a private central bank without understanding why its needed or why they are structured the way they are(Much like a separation of Church and state is important to a free society, having a government separate from economic considerations when considering policy is important too).  </p>

<p>They spit in the face of tens of thousands of trained and very clever economists and decades of economic research when they do that.   Because very few people know enough to call them out on being wrong and it sounds kind of right enough to be believable the same wrongness continues to be spread.</p>

<p>The collapse of society does not in any way benefit the elite.  A content, happy society is far easier to control for your purposes than a collapsed society with no real economy.</p>

<p>The elite don&#39;t need people in prison to work for them.  They don&#39;t need you to be broke to follow them either.</p>

<p>A disappearance of USD for example would hit a lot of them very hard, just like the recent GFC did(something like half a dozen billionaires from the US and Europe have had to go bankrupt since the GFC and a lot more have lost hundreds of millions).</p>

Alrighty.
The world is just too big to be controlled by any small cabal of rich people. I do think that a few people like to pretend they do, people like the illuminati or the Bilderberg crowds, Some of the guys on &quot;Wall Streets&quot; in western capitols or what have you.
I don&#39;t think that the financial collapse is being engineered because it would be really bad for everybody even the Rich. And as you&#39;ll see they&#39;re doing very well and building their mansions, yachts and bunkers and buying everything they need and it&#39;s far better for them to keep the system going For as long as possible, for 1000 years! for forever!. And as you see rich people rely on currency and fungible assets, The real rich spend some money on Tangible assets the real money Is in banks and financial markets.</p>

<p>This is your basic argument - to put it in more simplistic terms.  When looked at in this way, you&#39;re actually not saying anything that is to any extent profound.  To put both statements together into one, you&#39;re saying &quot;The collapse of society has always been planned because people are learning more and more about how fucked the world is, and there will be more and more dissent as time passes.&quot;</p>

<p>What?  How does this make it &quot;planned&quot;?  Sorry, man, but that makes no sense.  I&#39;m not saying that the collapse ISN&#39;T planned.  It very well may be.  However, your explanation, when broken down to its most basic elements...doesn&#39;t actually make sense.</p>

<p>Thank you for acknowledging this.  It is appreciated.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>When you combine the spread of information with the fact that we are suppressed, the statement you made seems very correct indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There will need to be a massive reorganization of our civilization in order to move forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not disagree with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question really is &quot;What is involved in this reorganization or reconstruction of society?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a very, very big question that involves MANY different aspects of existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is my opinion that although possible for us to create a utopian society, the elite will use this desire to manipulate humanity into setting up a society that suits THEM rather than us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That certainly seems fair to say.  Those members of the elite that function in this way (seems to be most of them) are very ignorant of the fact that their power would actually be exponentially INCREASED if, instead of using their abilities to suppress the masses and sequester information, they used it to actually help lift people up and create a strong and vibrant society.</p>

<p>The elite that exist on this planet, therefore, are a DARK CABAL elite - an <em>ignorant</em> elite - not a wise, bright, and illuminated one (even though they are sometimes, erroneously enough, called &quot;The Illuminati&quot;).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not unlike today, they will attempt to centralize control, and confuse people through the media, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not hard to make certain deceptive policies sound good. The problem is most people will view these new solutions as genuine in intention, when they are not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all correct as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did that help? Thanks for your thoughts.</p>

<p>It sure did sir, and it was indeed very well articulated.   I would not say that you are not the best at articulating your ideas, as this was a pretty successful rendering.  Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s like in chess... you give up a piece, in order to achieve a greater goal. Something the simple minded can&#39;t realise, they will just think &quot;yay, a piece&quot;.</p>

<p>IMO, it&#39;s all about misdirection. Assuming there&#39;s really a small group of people that rule the world, they must be really smart to do that and keep that for years / decades / centuries. It baffles me to think that a group like that is simply losing control. Like the elections... some things about Romney started appearing (even linking him to the Bildeberg group), and then everyone says &quot;we must not let him win. Vote Obama!&quot;. And then Obama won, but is it really a victory? Or was this all orchestrated so we think we&#39;ve won (thus we think we&#39;re in control of the situation), but in reality, it&#39;s all been planned.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Everything is planned, we&#39;re misdirected to think we&#39;re free and we have the power to change things. Democracy is an illusion, we&#39;re just peons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had these exact same thoughts. Why was it broadcasted that Romney had ties to the voting machines companies, why were people conditioned to think that all he did was bankrupt companies(and thus America) ? Misdirection. Obama has been their guy all along. If it really is a secret group controlling things, it makes sense. Don&#39;t waste time changing out the government when your puppet is doing everything you wanted; not to mention the public loves him... </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure it has to do with our economic system being based on infinite growth and our planet having finite resources.</p>

<p>The current system will need to collapse because it will occur sooner/more violently if left unabated. So it is either we completely exhaust our resources and burn out in a traumatic fashion, or catch ourselves, encourage a more graceful collapse sooner so we have something left of the old systems and infrastructure to use rationally in order to be able to build something new and more sustainable.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is infighting as to which is more preferable. More graceful managed collapse in an attempt to minimize collateral damages or the most deadly and chaotic collapse that can be mustered maybe to satisfy some weird obsession with trying to bring about &quot;The Apocalypse&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they deliberately crashed the economy, considering what, over 80% of people own guns? If a violent revolution did actually occur, it would be a disaster whether the economy was collapsed or not.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get why people pit this perfect scenario where the economy collapses, the entire country is in shambles, but yet everyone is still bending over backwards to listen to people who have money that simply doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>If a country-wide mass revolt happened, it would just happen. There are a <strong>lot</strong> of people who don&#39;t care though. Until something impedes their comfort levels, they simply won&#39;t care. We live in a selfish society, from the very top, all the way to the very bottom. People want to look out for them, and only them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your point of view. Made me reconsider some things I believed.</p>

<p>Now, I think that it&#39;s a risky scenario. They could certainly forge a big collapse, but they don&#39;t know the outcome(or they do, if you believe in the alien-technology stuff). But anyways, it is uncertain and risky. </p>

<p>You could have mass riots, people shooting each other, and eventually these guys going underground protect themselves in the bunkers, which could in turn be good actually if they waited for some years(patience is what they surely have). Coming back from that kind of destruction and chaos with tools, technology and resources would make them once again leaders. </p>

<p>Now, the other possible scenario is that they throw shit on the fan, and people actually look up for them(which is also possible, I mean, we are still a big minority and if movements like Occupy stay peaceful* nothing is gonna be accomplished).</p>

<p>But I still think that they are smarter than that. I strongly believe one of their choices do unite the world is to create a common enemy for EVERYONE, which would be or global warming or aliens. </p>

<p>If you went to the holographic technology stuff, from what I saw they are pretty advanced at it, and I think they are going to fake an alien invasion. So we all have the aliens as the enemy and they can do whatever they want to &quot;fight the enemy&quot;.</p>

<p>Some are gonna say I&#39;m crazy but well, who isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>*I&#39;m not saying that they should start rioting and putting buildings on fire, but that&#39;s a fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But I still think that they are smarter than that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the crux of the issue for me. It&#39;s pretty hard to tell how smart they are, given the fact that despite their attempts at complete non-transparency, we still find out about so many things as a public.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met quite a few people who believe that they would be able to succeed due to a strong military presence backing them. That is something equally hard for me to believe simply because while their may be some brainwashed idiots currently in the military, it&#39;s still a volunteer thing. Despite that they aren&#39;t actually doing it; I&#39;m sure nearly all military men and women signed up under the guise of actually protecting the U.S., protecting the constitution, and wanting to make people in the U.S. safe.</p>

<p>If there was a wide-planned collapse and the hyper-elite .0001% of people went to hide while the rest were left to suffer, it may be chaotic at times, or in the beginning. But especially with how today&#39;s technology/news spreading works, it would be found out, via a stark realization, or simply a &#39;leak&#39; from a higher-up who wasn&#39;t included in the hide and seek game, and people as a collective would realize who has been behind it all.</p>

<p>People may not be in complete unity, but in an event like that, I personally believe they would ultimately unite. Which would to me, once again be a selfish thing, I don&#39;t believe people would unite because it was the correct thing to do, but simply due to having a common enemy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see a full-fledged collapse turning into any sort of &#39;Book of Eli&#39; scenario, I&#39;ve lived in &#39;collapsed&#39; cities/towns where people eat what they can grow and local businesses are all but non-existent. It would definitely shake those who have built their lives around the comfort of our current economic system. Until people were literally dying of starvation and thirst, I don&#39;t think it would result in massive riots where people start turning on each other, because people would look to blame someone. </p>

<p>And who do you blame in that scenario? People of power, which to me becomes a cyclical point, because at least <strong>one</strong> person who would know that plan would be left out of it. There&#39;s so much information out there that if suddenly all the hyper-elite were in hiding, we know that there are underground bunkers, we know that they would just be waiting for the storm to end. </p>

<p>Not only would we have the majority of people behind, but as I pointed out above, the military they&#39;ve spent so long building/training/supplying would majorly be against them as well. </p>

<p>Not to continue to parrot, but I still just believe that everything will continue in it&#39;s path until people lose complete comfort and everything in their daily/normal lives is shaken and disrupted. If that happens via a controlled collapse, the hyper-elite (in my opinion) would be in more trouble than anyone else, because they would be who the &#39;mob&#39; blames for all of it. People always look for someone to blame, and those who run everything and yet had no answers would be the first people to look for.</p>

<p>I could sort of see this, but the technology still isn&#39;t perfect from everything we&#39;ve seen in terms of holographic technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I certainly agree with you about the collapse.  When I speak of collapse, I am not talking about Day Z or Book of Eli.  I&#39;m mainly talking about the structures of our society falling to the ground, and us having to rebuild.  Will there be some chaos for a little while?  Sure.  But it&#39;s not going to be this post-apocalyptic wasteland.  I certainly don&#39;t believe that.</p>

<p>As far as technology goes, sure the commercial technology we have seen is not good enough to fake such an event.  Of course, we are not sure of the capabilities of the cabal on a technological level.  They very well may be on the same level as what the rest of the world knows about, but they could also be 100 to 200 years ahead or more.</p>

<p>I was going to save this for another time, but I believe that the &quot;alien&quot; phenomenon is actually a well designed hoax to get people to believe that either A) an other-worldly savior is coming to help or B) an other-worldly threat is going to mandate putting weapons in space.  I&#39;m not really sure yet.</p>

<p>I do believe that these &quot;aliens&quot; or extraterrestrial phenomena are essentially the demons and fallen entities we have heard so much about from our ancestors&#39; writings.  They&#39;ve just modernized the explanation to fit inside our technological frame of reference.</p>

<p>At the end of the day though, if some alien intelligence comes down... I wouldn&#39;t trust it any further than I could throw it.  Unless it&#39;s really tiny, then I could probably throw it much further than I could trust it. :)</p>

<p>Yeah, which is what I&#39;m really getting at because it seems like the New Age movement isn&#39;t really strong enough to do something like that.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not planned, as in they have written a date down when the collapse occurs. It&#39;s like an apple hanging from a tree, growing and growing, but you know it will fall eventually. </p>

<p>I agree with you that the only thing of real action that is possible right now is to further push the agenda. I am sad Obama is elected again, because I think under Mitt Romney&#39;s rule this game would go much faster.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the <em>real</em> shit will hit the fan in our lifetime. That is, what is the shit? Hasn&#39;t the shit hit the fan already? The whole world is at war, people die, get tortured and raped all day, every day. Shit has hit the fan.</p>

<p>Then what would be the shit hitting the fan? That&#39;s what TPTB want, to have us always waiting for something to happen. Never take action. If you look at it, we&#39;ve been really grown up to never take action. Waiting for the war with Iran to happen, waiting for a new president, waiting all while shit has hit the fan already and things are awaiting your response. </p>

<p>And we&#39;ve been grown up to be scared. Scared to lose what little we have now. Scared for the collapse, while that&#39;s the only thing that can bring us salvation. The collapse could bring us peace, but also death, but I think our lives are worthless if we would accept what is happening to us because we fear what would happen if we stood up to it.</p>

<p>I do agree with the collapse coming because they want it to. But the people are not learning anything at all. I believe this same trick (power) has been played since mankind has ever existed. And it won&#39;t go away in a couple of years. It&#39;s really how we&#39;re built, it&#39;s our genes.</p>

<p>So if it can&#39;t be stopped, can&#39;t be changed, what should we do then?</p>

When I studied politics in college I learned that you have to analyze these systems as rational actors competing for limited resources, Just as in nature some people are very good at competing for resources some people are very bad. And with intelligent rational actors competing on various fronts (competing for space, food, medical services, contrary dark age beliefs, tribalisms, class identities) some people get played as game pieces. And as you saw on the last couple of elections even people on the fringes, Who always think that only they have the truth, Can be used as pawns in the big political game.

It would be like if all your blood was unable to be moved through your body.  Or if all of the oil in your car suddenly dried up and wasn&#39;t there anymore.  The rest of the parts just wouldn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blood is real. Money is not. Blood is tangible. Money is just an agreement a social contract. Even though the concept of a monetary system collapsing is irrational there are even more irrational measures that will sustain the corrupt economic system. Money is always transferred from one entity to the next. Fleecing of the hurd happens in the business cycle. </p>

<p>The status quo is the real prison that results from wage slavery. The status quo will always have just enough money to have hope and look forward to trampling on somebody on black Friday. Look forward and never in the past to realize justices is not being served to banksters.
The status quo is what keeps the American a sleep and dreaming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Will the US Econemy Collapse in the near future(5 months -3 years)?</p>

<p>Yes i think so</p>

<p>With the FED its only matter of time,also a crash could come if country&#39;s decide to not choose the dollar as trade currency.</p>

<p>Why would they want collapse the econemy?</p>

<p>They have money that is not what want.
They want power and bring a world goverment that will be a mix between 1984 &amp; Brave new World!</p>

<p>Are the Globalists leaking some information intentional?</p>

<p>Sure they want create chaos.
Alex Jones isn&#39;t a disinformant agent,they don&#39;t kill him because that would underline his information too much like William Cooper they can&#39;t do that anymore with the internet.</p>

<p>if you read this two books now it is stunnig how much they implied already.</p>
