       A few years ago I was like many of you; I believed that if I could just convince enough people to think like me, that I could save the world.  Most people were blaming the politicians, but I "knew" it was the central banks; and if only they would see the light everything would get better, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I started trying to "enlighten" family and friends.  Most people probably thought I was batshit insane; maybe I was.  Simply blame these people, not those people; that's the alleged solution?  Start thinking like me if you want to save the world!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize how this can lead people to believe you're insane?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I've realized the importance of personal responsibility, I find it difficult to complain about anything, at least not seriously.  I find it damn near impossible to blame anyone for anything.  I no longer consider the questions: "who dropped the ball?" and "why me?"; if these thoughts enter the mind, I immediately change the topic to "what can I do?".  Not what can "we" do, but what can I do?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't "saved the world", but I saved myself.  Fuck saving the world, if people want to save themselves there's more than enough out here on the web to enable them to do so.  If someone doesn't want to save them-self, is there anything I could do to convince them otherwise?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're interested in personal responsibility, I think you'll like this youtube channel:

       Yes, we alone are very limited in what we can do, perhaps, but we are all that we have. I still think that talking to people is important. But there are a lot of things in this world that we can not change easily. We can revolt, but they will put it down. So the only place left is among ourselves and in our minds.

       What do you mean?  Meditation and shit?  If so, fuck that noise!  I only got so much time here, and I ain't sitting around being bored as fuck like that.  Maybe some people think it helps them, but I find it to be about as boring as possible.

       Revolt against taxation with representation.

       They can only put the resistance down due to having a numerical and technical advantage (with all those misguided soldiers at their command).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this numerical advantage doesn't have to be in their favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we build an army bigger than their's?
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we shrink their existing army?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if we were really smart and efficient, armies would be bypassed and the real leadership of the ZOG would be taken out.

       If you're afraid to use violence, well...  At least that means you're not a psychopath so congratulations.  However, I would suggest that everyone reread the first few Protocols to understand the vital role of violence in the JEW WORLD ORDER.  If victory is desired, violence will be unavoidable due to the nature of the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So prepare yourself at the very least.

       It is not the numbers. We are the 99%. It is the technology. This is the big difference between, say, 1940s and now. The other problem is the mindset. People are so mind-controlled and sucked into the system, that there is nothing that you can do to break them free of the matrix any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to take out ZOG, you would have to identify who the real leaders are. Some are well-known to be sure, others not. Even known leaders are not easy to take out. They are protected by police and military with better guns and radios than we can get. All of our communications are monitored. You might get lucky for a while, but they would eventually wake up to you and make your job harder. Even if one generation retires, the next generation awaits. Even if one nation ends, there are other nations waiting in the wings to take over. Removing ZOG is not such an easy thing to pull off.

       Whenever I connect to people on this level I can't help but think ts like were're just simulating a game in our minds. Listening to the radio and talking just becomes a circle jerk full of people who want to take something from you. Mind money, matter its all the same, the question is how to stay whole and sane while everything slowly breaks down and drags us along into hell. Really I just don't know how to connect on that level of "this is important, let's be serious and address it with focus" its all just lalalala hurr durr hahaha and its very demeaning between friends and family and I become the target of hate but I keep pushing as much as I can regardless of how much spit is in my face but it does take its toll and we haven't even really entered hell completly yet, we are just past the gate.

       Nope you were right it is the Zionist banksters. It is rule by USURY, compound interest, and financial manipulation. It is just a step up from divine rule and chattel slavery. This is why we have endless wars, it is to force this system upon everyone. It basically robs everyone of the fruits of their labor.
