<p>But, the electoral college was created because it was easier to send representatives who would vote for a big group.  It was a technological and geography concern that created the electoral college.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worst president, ever? Says who? The status quo and comedies? What about Obama? Carter? Nixon? Reagan? Hoover? Harding? Common mann..don&#39;t be a shallow thinker</p>

<p>Plus, what&#39;s up with hating on people? Ya they fucked us over...But hating on them?</p>

<p>How bout... you realize that your emotions create your thoughts and reality and stop spreading negativity?</p>

<p>But then they win? We need to stand up for our rights? Ha! hahahahaa.</p>

<p>Our rights aren&#39;t given by a government and they can&#39;t be taken by a government. Our rights are divine.</p>

<p>Whether you believe in God or not, you need to realize that your consciousness will exist after death and the only way to create a better situation for yourself while alive is not to hate on past presidents and play the blame game.
Sounds gay, but you have to change if you want the world to change. How will other people be positive if you don&#39;t spread positive emotion. Negativity is an emotion that locks you into fear, anger, or both.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let your emotions live you. Create your reality with positive thoughts, no expectations, and unconditional love.</p>

<p>PS. i really dont care if a troll comes along and says something like, &quot;okay....hippy.&quot; And now, because I said that, there will probably be a comment saying those exact words. Because everyone is so hilarious when they don&#39;t try to understand your point view...or they just down vote.</p>

<p>Facts. Was in command as our multi billion air defense system failed completely allowing the worst terrorist attack in US history. Started two unfunded and unfounded wars. Cut taxes during war which is beyond stupid. Drove up the national debt. Expanded executive powers to a place they&#39;ve never seen. Gave no bid contracts to his VPs company. Crashed the economy to its worst conditions since the Great Depression. Signed off on TARP and the PATRIOT Act. The country was losing hundreds of thousands of jobs when he left office. Need I go on?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not shallow thinking. I&#39;m not going to apologize because I &quot;expect&quot; our elected officials to act in the best interests of his people and not his crony buddies. There is a reason Obama&#39;s &quot;hope and change&quot; campaign worked so well and he won in a land slide. </p>

<p>But with all that said I feel bad for GW, because I think he meant well but wasn&#39;t really in control and was just afraid to stand up to his puppet masters. </p>

<li><p>Support a Third Party Canidate like Gary Johnson (he will don&#39;t win obviously this year but runs 2016 again)</p></li>
<li><p>Get into politics on a local level</p></li>
<li><p>Try to inform people in your Environment</p></li>
<li><p>Find Like mineded people for activism/protest maybe <a href="http://planet.infowars.com/">here</a> is a good place.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t advocating violence, I was using &#39;revolution&#39; in the mentality of people sense. Something has to happen to shake up what we consider normal. A law has to be made that goes too far, a document has to come to light that shows the shady work of politicians, a catalyst of some sort that brings unity to the citizens. </p>

<p>“People shouldn&#39;t be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.”   I love this quote because as of right now, IMO, the government isn&#39;t scared of us at all because they have control. Look at The Occupy Movement. I think it was in SF, they shut down wireless connections for phones to slow, if not stop people from protesting with Occupy. They bring up laws for all the tech surveillance so they can track our movements and make sure we stay in line. If you stray from what&#39;s acceptable, they switch up the game to make it illegal. We have rights as long as the government isn&#39;t threatened by us having and using them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly it&#39;s very unlikely that either Romney nor Bush Jr would even make it onto a ballot box in most European countries.</p>

<p>International polls have repeatedly shown us this.</p>

<p>However, America is different and very diverse, there is a large core of the population who the Republican party appeal to.</p>

<p>In 2000 there were voting irregularities raised, but the race was tight, and Al Gore was not a good candidate.</p>

<p>The 2004 election was probably more shocking, Bush was starting to do badly in the polls, was deeply resented abroad, but Iraq had not yet become the absolute quagmire and Kerry was seen as aloof by many. Fundamentally people just vote for a candidate that they like. Bush got in again. Incredible.</p>

<p>For those who criticise the two party system, bear in mind that in Belgium they have a very democratic multiparty system, but none emerge as strong enough and the country was without an effective government for over a year.</p>

<p>Centuries of nonstop warfare and religious interference and violence has generally made us Europeans all very wary of anything akin to the Republican party in the States. We view candidates like Bush and Romney with horror, but that&#39;s the way the US is - one half stuck in the 15th century the other half something we&#39;d consider normal.</p>

<p>Not much of a conspiracy theory, but just the way things are.</p>

<p>The Article is written by Alexander Benesch a german journalist its only published by Infowars i think the article brings it on the point.</p>

<p>Yep Alex is sometimes over the top but i like his guest and his analysis is good when he isn&#39;t ranting.</p>

<p>Maybe you should look into his &quot;Nightly News&quot; where some one else from the Infowars Team is moderating the News without ranting and better presentation they are free on Youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the term &quot;Americans are too naive to understand how this can happen.&quot; is more accurate. At least the average Redditor has a decent baseline of awareness about what is going on. </p>

<p>I saw a video of a guy on the front page the other day asking people about the election results of several days ago (yes, he was working on a false pretense the election was over). </p>

<p>The responses were ridiculous ... from &quot;yes, I voted on election day&quot; to lies about voter turn out volumes at the polls to &quot;pretending and playing along&quot; that they knew anything about what the guys w/ the mic and cam were asking them about. The bravado, bullshit and ignorance of the &quot;average Joe&quot; is absolutely horrifying. It is obvious why I have such disdain and lack of trust and faith in society as it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody doesn&#39;t like our heresies about their false god.  I keep getting downvotes here.</p>

<p>My problem with the Gnostics is that they have mixed their Indo-European belief system (ie Greek thought) with the alien, and quite repugnant, Semitic system, put the blender on &quot;puree&quot; and poured it into a mold.  While I appreciate their exploratory nature and reluctance to accept the world precisely as it is seen by other Middle-Eastern schools, I also have the suspicion that their beliefs were just as stagnant and codified as any other religion that possesses an official dogma.  The Gnostic texts I have attempted to read are interesting for a while, but they operate on the same type of delusional thought that is embodied in all the Abrahamic religions.</p>

<p>Angels dancing on the head of a pin, anyway.  Not to insult those that subscribe to these kind of warmed-over Zoroastrian / Semitic meatloaf type blended religions, but they are not my cup of tea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can appreciate what they have, as a philosophical exercise.  Their ideas (seemingly borrowed from Zoroastrians) about the true nature of good and evil are very much worth pondering.  The troubadours of medieval Europe also had some very interesting ideas, partly inherited from the Gnostics but many of them directly imported from pre-Islamic Persia, which they kept alive through a process of Christianization, but without changing the allegorical meaning of their stories.  If you enjoy the Gnostic writings, I would suggest you look into their European descendants as well.  The Cathars are an interesting group, that was eliminated through genocide (their final demise is tragic and gave us the phrase &quot;Kill them all and let God sort them out&quot;) but their mythology was kept alive by the traveling minstrels, whom I believe have a direct tradition stretching back to the Celtic bards.</p>
