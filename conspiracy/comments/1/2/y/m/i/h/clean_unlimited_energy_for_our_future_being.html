<p>How to assemble a 12 vdc system </p>

<ol>
<li>You gotta have 12- 4&quot; 3/4&quot; copper piping. take each piece of copper and tape the tops with 1&#39;&#39; masking tape. </li>
<li>Now using RED LACQUER spray paint (Which you can buy at any hardware store), Paint the outside of the copper all around. ( DO NOT PAINT THE INSIDE.) let air dry for 24 hrs. Now remove 1&quot; masking tape. </li>
<li>Take the copper pipe outside to the area that you are going to use. use a hammer and hammer each one Into the ground up to the 1&quot; copper exposed top. do not let the exposed copper touch the earth in the final placement. Dirt should be moist. Not real dry. </li>
<li>Now remove each pipe and place a thick piece of plastic on bottom of copper pipe to cap it. LET IT BE LOSE, DO NOT TAPE IT. YOU WANT RAIN WATER TO BE ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM EACH PIPE, Do not let exposed outside copper touch the earth.</li>
<li>Now hammer each pipe back Into the same holes. place each 2&quot; piece of zinc rod ( or a long bolt, most bolts are zinc plated ) into the center of each pipe. The zinc Is the NEGATIVE and the copper is the + POSITIVE.</li>
<li>Now connect them in series to get 12 volts, use clip wire or solder them. If you are going to leave It outside for a long time then make sure connections are soldered and then painted to protect them from the weather. The rain will replenish your earth batteries. Top get more amaperage with this type simply add more copper and zinc rod cells USE 3&#39; PIECES OF COPPER PIPE INSTEAD OF 4&quot; PIPE. THEN CONNECT EVERY ROW OF 12 PIPES IN PARALLEL.. ADD AS MANY ROWS AS YOU NEED UNTIL YOU GET THE DESIRED AMPERAGE YOU WANT. ( THINK BIG! ) This can be a very powerful free energy system for your home or other. Not only will you get an earth battery effect, but you will also be collecting earth currents from ether /static and under ground radio waves as well. </li>
<li>The deeper you go with the copper pipe, the more amperage and voltage you can get.</li>
</ol>

<p>some people just dont understand chemistry, you mean copper and zinc with an electrolyte can make a battery? no way... eletronegativity not ether/static current  magic. read a book.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the details of it, but they use the earth bellow your house to heat your home. Now it still uses electricity, but a lot less than your average heating appliances and it heats your whole house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course.  It&#39;s very, very hard to prove a negative.  That said, we can prove that the observable phenomena that would be associated with most aether theories simply don&#39;t occur (the Michelson-Morley experiment being the most famous example).  Modern physical models accurately describe the workings of nature without using the aether as an explanation, so it is generally considered an unnecessary complication.</p>

<p>Some theories do use the aether to attempt to explain the way the world works, but they haven&#39;t gained any kind of widespread support because of the unnecessary complications that they introduce.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a lot in that forum to dig through, but after reading it for a good 30 min or so, I kept seeing a number of recurring problems. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;String theory requires the vacuum of space to be totally empty.&quot; Um, no, that&#39;s wrong. Not just sort of wrong. Completely wrong. String theory does a fine job explaining and allowing for spontaneous virtual particle/anti-particle annihilation that occurs in a vacuum. Not sure where y&#39;all are getting that idea, but it isn&#39;t correct. </p></li>
<li><p>This is in reference to what you said; &quot;Both theories are trying to account for the same thing.&quot; No, they really aren&#39;t. The Aether tries to explain why light can travel through a vacuum, where there appears to be no medium for it to travel through. This hypothetical medium is called the &quot;lumineferous aether.&quot; As it turns out, though, there&#39;s no use for this theory anymore. Once it was discovered that magnetism and electricity were simply two different expressions of the same principle force, there was no longer any need, much less a plausible model, for such a medium. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>String theory, on the other hand, among other things, is a mathematical model of how fundamental particles work, what their symmetries are, and even makes predictions about particles we haven&#39;t found yet, including the particles of supersymmetry. The great thing about string theory is that it is an incredibly flexible theory. The model is basic enough that it can apply to a wide range of possible models of quantum mechanics. This nonsense about the aether and vacuums, however, has nothing whatsoever to do with this discussion. You are being either dishonest or delusional when you say &quot;Many physicists are ready to drop string theory and go back to aether theories.&quot; Oh really? How many? In what fields? Where are their published, peer-reviewed papers on this apparently very impressive version of an out-dated theory? </p>

<p>The thing is, many cosmologists and particle physicists are simply not yet ready to accept string theory in full, and for good reason. Many aspects of string theory would only be observable at the Planck scale, and we currently do not have any instruments capable of generating the amount of energy it would take to probe at that level. You would need a particle accelerator approximately the size of the orbit of Neptune to even get close. So, for now, string theory will remain a very powerful hypothesis, and we&#39;ll just have to settle for making predictions about particles we <strong>can</strong> observe. Hopefully, this will generate enough evidence to make more decisive statements about string theory&#39;s validity. However, to the best of my knowledge, no serious papers promoting the idea of an &quot;aether&quot; in the classical sense have been published in the last thirty years, and no evidence of such an aether has been generated in nearly forty years of particle collision testing. These experiments have yielded results heavily in favor of the Standard Model of Quantum Mechanics, a model which has no need whatsoever for an aether.</p>
