<p>Two times with President Bush, I can believe, but now these candidates are quite different, (they may have the same NWO values) their approach is different, their culture is completely different and yet the people in America are almost evenly divided on these two candidates?
Does anyone else find this strange?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t call the 2008 election essentially a tie, but I see what you&#39;re getting at: you&#39;re wondering why there hasn&#39;t been something like a 2:1 blowout or greater recently.</p>

<p>What it comes down to is that the two parties are more or less evenly matched adversaries, and it takes a series of colossal blunders to push the popular vote ratio to 3:2 let alone 2:1. Now in the digital age, there are systems in place beyond primaries, pundits, etc that can better warn a campaign when they&#39;re in danger of totally losing control and advise them on how to right the ship.</p>

<p>The system of long election campaigns with constant sources of feedback throughout makes a series of outcomes relatively close to 50-50 not coincidental, but rather expected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>/What are the odds of that?</p>

<p>Very high. Candidates, parties and political factions do not operate in a vacuum. If altering their political platform will allow them to net more votes and garner more support, they will. This is why a political party may be very different dependent upon regional factors. Etc. Until the candidates reach a Nash equilibrium. Also coming into play is Madison&#39;s public weal, The general entrenchment of the dual parties coupled with the unfavorabilty of third party candidates/positions,and regression to the mean.</p>

<p>Also the two thousand four election had Obama at Ten million votes ahead of McCain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very good point. Eliminate the electoral college and it now becomes a good strategy to go to a &quot;stronghold&quot; (like NYC for the Dems) and rally votes there. In our current system if Obama wins NY by 5 percent or 30 percent doesn&#39;t matter - which probably depresses turnout in these areas.</p>

It&#39;s just a suspenseful charade.</p>
