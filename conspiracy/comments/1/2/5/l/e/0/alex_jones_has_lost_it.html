    <div class="md"><p>Yup, because a goat head necklace is definitely automatically referring to an obscure demon. Pull the other one it has bells on. Also, the upside down cross is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_St._Peter">christian symbol</a> known as the Cross of St. Peter, with the origin being that St. Peter was supposedly crucified upside down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that the popular upswell of resentment against Christianity (and that is the main target) didn&#39;t just happen, it was engineered in the media. Those who accepted this hostility against &quot;religion&quot; (really against Christianity) didn&#39;t come to this conclusion on their own, they merely adopted a pre-existing viewpoint in the media, and by extension in their peer group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is part of the global elite&#39;s plan to control Western populations. By having this guy constantly spouting off baseless shit like Satanic Illuminati, anyone who listens is distracted from the <em>real</em> truth - that the elite are non-religious but solely use local religions to control local populations.</p>

<p>Everything that Alex Jones says is meant to lead truth-seekers off the path to real knowledge. Every insane topic he comes up with is a red herring, and the global elite use that to their advantage. Are people about to come upon the real truth of something? Here, let Alex Jones distract everyone while we cover up our trail.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how people don&#39;t see it. There are real conspiracies going down all the time, but it&#39;s <em>so</em> clear that most everything AJ says is nothing more than a distraction from the truth. I mean, seriously... Satanists? Who the fuck buys into Satanism, let alone the global elite? And why Satanism anyway? Why not Hadesism? Why not Baal worship? Why not Paganism? It&#39;s because most people who listen to Alex Jones have a Christian background, so Satanism is scary. Argh! It&#39;s just such transparent bullshit, and I don&#39;t know how the fuck people buy into it!</p>

<p>EDIT: I don&#39;t mean to say Alex Jones is necessarily &quot;installed&quot; by the global elite but that he is useful to them. This is why they keep letting him do his thing. Real movers and shakers get locked up or killed if they gain to large an audience.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Sure, I pick on your guys&#39; god and get all kinds of downvotes. You guys are as fair and balanced as Fox News.</p>

There are a few things in the overall conspiracy I haven&#39;t quite bought into. the whole HAARP thing is one of those. Last three major quakes were blamed on that. There was a radar image of one hurricane that showed something like HAARP being used to turn the storm. Might be able to find it on youtube with the right search. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I never said weather manipulation wasn&#39;t a real thing, I made specific reference to HAARP, the Ionosphere and tectonic plates. Personally, I find cloud seeding to be pretty interesting and I do enjoy researching it casually. Keep building those strawmen though, the practice will come in handy for when you have a conversation in real life.</p>

<p>We dont know much about HAARP but it does have the possibility to change the weather.
I did have listen to Alex Jones on friday (DOWNVOTES NOW!) Alex didn&#39;t say that HAARP created Hurricane Sandy.
He did say <strong>maybe</strong> Hurricane Sandy could be produced trough HAARP. Big Difference but OP freaks out like a little girl.</p>

<p>If you still don&#39;t belive me Weather modification doesen&#39;t exist:
