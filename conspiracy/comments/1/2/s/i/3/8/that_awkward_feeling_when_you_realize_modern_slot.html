<p>Hiding problems away in the dark doesn&#39;t solve them. Putting them in the sunlight does. It&#39;s very hard to intimidate voters when everyone knows that you&#39;re trying to intimidate voters. It&#39;s very easy to steal an election when nobody knows who voted for what. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok since you seem to only be able to think on a national scale.</p>

<p>Say Gangster A wants the official thats in their pocket elected(or the one in the pocket of EvilCorp who is paying them).  They send their thugs door to door  in your neighbourhood to tell you who you are going to vote for.  With non-anonymous voting they can then come back later and teach you a lesson for voting for the wrong person.  With the receipt system they can make you provide a receipt showing you voted for their candidate.  They don&#39;t care that vote tampering is illegal they are already gangsters.</p>

<p>The cure for vote tampering isn&#39;t removing the security of anonymous voting.  It&#39;s providing more oversight on the polling stations and vote counting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sixty percent of the country now supplies voters with optical scanners. To use them, voters shade in their choices on paper ballots (similar to how they would take an SAT test) before feeding it to the machines. These optical scanners, while not exactly a brand-new technology, are the state-of-the-art for both their accuracy in processing votes and their security against tampering.</p>

<p>But the same cannot always be said for the alternative, e-voting machines (direct recording electronic machines, or DREs), which are used in about 25 percent of the country. These are lined up in places like Georgia, Maryland, Utah, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Texas.</p>

<p>E-voting machines come in three variants: push-button machines sporting a keypad; LCD touch-screens; and machines that use a rolling wheel to select and confirm a vote onscreen. All of these register votes on an electronic ballot. The absence of a paper trail, which is preserved by the optical scanners, has caused concerns since the inception of the machines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you could lower that expense but you&#39;d end up with a more crooked product. All the companies competing for state voting contracts have to provide some sort of cost figures. Honest companies would lose out compared to crooked companies like Diebold and ES&amp;S. Even if those companies spent lots of money putting back doors in their machines they would put out low figures to come in as the low bid and achieve their true goal of stealing democracy. In other words, as long as there are crooked players, there is no profit to be had in the voting machine industry. I&#39;d rather pay much more to assure a true vote. </p>
