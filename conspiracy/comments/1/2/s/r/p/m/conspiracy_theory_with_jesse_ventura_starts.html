       The Gulf of Tonkin was a conspiracy but its hardly a theory since McNamara admitted the attack never happened years later.

       Jesse's legit, but his show is a bit of a cartoon circus.
Its way too sensationalistic, not about the topic of the shows, but about everything else going on. In particular, I hope that voice-over guy is gone, or they write him some non 3rd-grader pro-wrestling type dialog.

       One thing I can't stand about him is how he swaggers around telling anyone who'll listen that he's a "former governor".  That seems a bit pathetic.

       Great show. Totally milquetoast to all of us seasoned veterans of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but a n00b would learn a ton. Plus, it's great to help introduce this stuff to the masses. They also do a lot of entertainment stuff to keep the plebes interested. That irks a lot of us, but it's necessary to snap people out of the matrix.

       I agree. I like Ventura as a person and I believe in a lot of the stuff he says and stands for, but I feel he took this show to get his message out, but the sensational style of the show just caters to the reality show generation. There's like 5 min of actual info in each program and the way it's portrayed allows people to watch it while also writing it off as crazy.

       that's the economic policy that keeps us out there in the world attacking countries so we keep our war machine revved up. Teaches us that cash in  our pockets is just an IOU for the real money gold and that is the reason Gaddaffi was killed

       Absolutely it did! I did not believe it either, but I looked, it was deleted - I saw it with my own eyes. I had DirectTV at the time, so they sent out a signal on the satellite to nuke all copies. I was recording the whole season, and that was the only one that disappeared....

       The fact that the police state episode is available on YT and the fact that you cant figure out how to operate your DVR is irrelevant to the fact that this particular episode was marked for termination on every cable service it was broadcast on. whatever. further, Im sure they prefer you to watch it on yt where they can track identity of both people who give a shit...

       Watch out, I think there is a cableman peeping through your window.

      <p>
       Oh man, you aren't watching "Ancient Aliens", are you?  The Cable-illuminati hates that show too.  For a second viewing violation, they break in and just steal your DVR.  By the way, I heard Jesse Ventura is co-hosting next week.

       Are you actually this stupid? You think this is what I am saying? Seriously. Are you just an asshole or are you really this stupid? Obviously the network pulled the episode, because of a complaint. This happens. This is how it works. Welcome to the world. There is nothing crazy about it, except you are a fucking paranoid nutcase. Seriously GO SEE A DOCTOR. THEY HAVE MEDS THAT CAN HELP YOU KID! TALK TO YOUR PARENTS. TELL THEM YOU NEED HELP! We are behind you! You can do it!

       Sorry to say, I agree with you. That's how i feel about all whistleblower and "supernatural" shows. If they really found green men, big foot, or point to undeniable evidence to a group or established person, the industry would simply not air it. I feel were to ignorant to handle news like this, which why part of me agrees with the government censoring, a SMALL part that is.

       I like him as a person. The show is shit. It's sensationalized crap TV documentaries that reek of reality show writing. 10 minutes of information in the entire program.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like he had to do it to get the message out, but these shows are so intentionally out there I think it hurts the cause; people feel safe watching his show because it's just a conspiracy theorist nutbag and he's portrayed that way.

       oh he didn't...seriously? God I have some buddies who do the local documentary night here that are actually showing a David Icke film. One of them claimed that even if I didn't believe the reptilian stuff, he was spot on about the connections between the powerful elite. WTF?!

       At work, I was suprised to walk in and see some people watching the "Reptilians" episode this evening...
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I was pissed that he was doing an episode on reptilians, as that "theory" is pretty ridiculous, but by the end I thought it was a good episode, after he tore David Icke a new one for making 2 million bucks a year on something that can't be proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       The episode ended with him saying something to the effect of: Evil forces are conspiring to run our world and take our freedoms, but they're human..
      </p>
      <p>
       So, he didn't lend any credibility to the reptilian theory, he just admitted a lot of people buy into it.   I see nothing wrong with that, and I like the show, even though it's a little over the top.

       That's a new one for me but I confess that I stopped listening to him a few years back except for guests like Dr. Pieczenik (when AJ got
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       nervous when Zionism was brought up).
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole Infowars enchilada is NOT owned by Alex Jones. It is owned, wholly paid for, and controlled by rabid Zionist Jeffrey R. Smulyan, CEO of Emmis (Hebrew for 'truth') Communications of Indianapolis, Indiana.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Smulyan not only cuts the payroll checks...in fact, when AJ "infiltrated" Bohemian Grove it was Mr. Smulyan's invitation he was riding in on. Mr. Smulyan is a yearly participant in the "Cremation of Care" ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Smulyan also tells Jones what to say, when to say it, and what adverts for shady gold vendors and sketchy vitamins go in between. NOTHING is said without Smulyan's pre-approval...ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought you'd like to know. Never, ever, ever send that guy your money my friend. AJ is not only entertainment, he's also controlled opposition and has VERY close ties to the CIA. Google it up.

       Your information is incorrect.  AJ's show is broadcast on the
       <a href="http://www.gcnlive.com/faq.php">
        Genesis Communications Network
       </a>
       , which is owned by Ted Anderson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ted also owns Midas Resources, which is why he's always on the show selling gold and silver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emmis is also a communications network, but they don't "own" Infowars.  That's not really how radio works.  They broadcast a syndicated AJ show on Sundays.  Just because a radio station broadcasts a show does not mean they own it.  By your logic Emmis also owns Rush Limbaugh's show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infowars and PrisonPlanet are owned by Alex Jones.  I doubt he cares who owns the radio stations who choose to syndicate his show, as long as his message gets out.

        In fact, KLBJ AM is owned by Emmis Communications, (”Emmis” is the Hebrew word for “truth”), which operates radio stations in the nation’s largest markets, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The Founder and CEO of Emmis Communications just happens to be a well-connected Jewish American broadcast mini-mogul named Jeffrey H. Smulyan — the kind of Jewish American who would doubtless have strong allegiance to Zionist Jewish organizations like the ADL — and whom the ADL likes to support in return.

       Your own links disprove your statement.  Yes, Emmis owns KLBJ.  They air a syndicated show of AJ on Sundays.  That doesn't mean they own the show or have any editorial oversight on its content.
      </p>
      <p>
       His show is broadcast on Sirius Satellite radio on Saturdays as well.  Does that mean Sirius owns his show?  No, although you'd like that to be true, especially considering that Sirius is owned by...
       <em>
        gasp
       </em>
       ...a Jew.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Where is your proof of this?  Saying that Emmis owns a station that pays syndication fees to broadcast InfoWars on Sundays is in no way evidence that they "wholly own" his show.

       Yeah there is a 15% chance ill check it out. I've seen them in the past and they are mostly garbage. I imagine there isn't too much dis info he could give about the gulf of tonkin incident, but everybody's probably better off looking it up online or reading about it if they're interested.

       I saw ventura's show on 9/11. Same old crap. Sure there are unanswered questions, but constantly banging on about a conspiracy plot that doesn't exist helps nobody.
It makes people who have legitimate questions and concerns seem like part of the tinfoil-hat brigade. 
It's light entertainment at its worst.

      <p>
       I have just watched the video. I agree with the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Iraq not resistant to weapons inspections"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Saddam offered contracts to US in exchange for lifting of sanctions"
      </p>
      <p>
       "US intelligence agencies where warned about an attack on WTC"
      </p>
      <p>
       ...SO FUCKING WHAT!
      </p>
      <p>
       She says herself that her handler (richard Fiusz) ASKED HER to approach the Iraqi ambassador for information on the attack. That was the CIA searching for intel, which does not support the notion that
they were involved in the attack. It doesn't disprove it. But it doesn't support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence services may have received warnings about an attack on WTC. 
If the CIA was hunting for information about the attack they were obviously not in a position to prevent the attack from taking place. If you could prove they did in fact have the details, then you would have a case.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very most you have an argument for the Intelligence services attempting to conceal their incompetence.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the information that Lindauer provides in the first half of the video relates to her involvement with the Iraqi administration prior to the attacks in 2001. I don't see how this is relevant to anything, other that to make her later assertions seem more plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did President Bush attempt to use the WTC attacks to bolster support for the invasion of Iraq? Yes, but again this does not tell us anything about their involvement in the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lindauer then begins to make assertions as to what she "THINKS" happened. She fails to mention what basis she has for her opinion, and she provides no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       She states;
      </p>
      <p>
       "I think...Mohammad Atta was a CIA Assett" - No supporting evidence, no reason why.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The hijackings were a cover for a controlled demolition" - no supporting evidence, no reason why.
      </p>
      <p>
       "the WTC was rigged with thermite" - Not this again!
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no evidence to support the use of thermite at the WTC. every source making this claim has been heavily debunked. The use of thermite was an argument given to explain the melting of the steel structure inside WTC in order to cause the collapse.
We now know that the beams did not need to melt but merely become weakened in order to cause collapse. Footage of the WTC clearly showing the inward sagging of the beams supports this and is consistent with the way in which the towers fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       She then states that the planting of thermite could only have been accomplished with the help of military services, thus linking the US Govt to the incident - but there isn't even a link between thermite and the WTC!
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion:
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing here to support the idea of a false flag attack on the WTC as claimed by Jesse Ventura. 
Lindauer has no invovlement with counter-terrorism activities and provides no information or citations which even begin to support this idea.
She merely talks about her involvement in private negotiation with the Iraqi administration - none of which is relevant to the WTC.
       <br/>
       She follows up with her opinion as to how the attack transpired - she doesn't tell us what led her to this conclusion, she doesn't provide evidence and she doesn't give any sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       What bewilders me about you guys is that nobody has ever been able to disprove that the attacks were a result of Islamic-fundamentalism.
There is a wealth of supporting evidence to show that the attacks were designed and orchestrated by Ayman al-Zawahiri and financed by Bin-laden. They had the means and the motive and confirmed that they carried out the attack. As far as I am concerned - Game over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wish the Truth movement would let people get on with their lives and show some fucking respect to the families instead of having idiots like Ventura making dumb-fuck shows.

       Look, she states they are involved but she doesn't say they specifically did it, if you know anything about the incident , simply put its Mossad. Why them? because they are linked to Rothschilds, and they are linked to Federal Reserve, World Bank, IMF, the groups that control the world and its wealth.

       You have a Kenysian economic policy that has put the American people in debt , to a degree that they cannot repay. And all those that don't repay such as Hitler , find themselves in severe and compromised situation. It's no surprise that when Saddam and Muammar Gaddaffi refuse american dollars for oil , rightfully so because its worthless paper that they die. And then lets not forget JFK was going to do away with the federal reserve E.O.11110 . I fail to see how such an intelligent thinking individual such as yourself doesn't take note. That is unless you are ignorant of the facts, please fact check what I am saying here and then get back to me.

      <p>
       Just to be clear; I am rejecting the idea of a controlled demolition of the WTC and the claim that the towers were not attacked by Muslim fundamentalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we begin talking about general US Foreign policy the waters get very murky.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this time I see no conclusive evidence for direct US/Israeli  involvement in the collapse of the WTC.

       Yeah, this idiot thinks "thermite paint" is how "they" did 9/11.  Zero credibility.  He got out-debated by two high-school dropouts and a (barely) state school grad on a dick-joke radio show, so bad he threatened them, walked off, and still won't come back, years later.

       That's a new one for me but I confess that I stopped listening to him a few years back except for guests like Dr. Pieczenik (when AJ got
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       nervous when Zionism was brought up).
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole Infowars enchilada is NOT owned by Alex Jones. It is owned, wholly paid for, and controlled by rabid Zionist Jeffrey R. Smulyan, CEO of Emmis (Hebrew for 'truth') Communications of Indianapolis, Indiana.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Smulyan not only cuts the payroll checks...in fact, when AJ "infiltrated" Bohemian Grove it was Mr. Smulyan's invitation he was riding in on. Mr. Smulyan is a yearly participant in the "Cremation of Care" ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Smulyan also tells Jones what to say, when to say it, and what adverts for shady gold vendors and sketchy vitamins go in between. NOTHING is said without Smulyan's pre-approval...ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought you'd like to know. Never, ever, ever send that guy your money my friend. AJ is not only entertainment, he's also controlled opposition and has VERY close ties to the CIA. Google it up.

       Your information is incorrect.  AJ's show is broadcast on the
       <a href="http://www.gcnlive.com/faq.php">
        Genesis Communications Network
       </a>
       , which is owned by Ted Anderson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ted also owns Midas Resources, which is why he's always on the show selling gold and silver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emmis is also a communications network, but they don't "own" Infowars.  That's not really how radio works.  They broadcast a syndicated AJ show on Sundays.  Just because a radio station broadcasts a show does not mean they own it.  By your logic Emmis also owns Rush Limbaugh's show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infowars and PrisonPlanet are owned by Alex Jones.  I doubt he cares who owns the radio stations who choose to syndicate his show, as long as his message gets out.
