    <div class="md"><p>In public, no.  No need to let the sheep see the truth.  BO&#39;s decision not to prosecute anyone from 2008 crisis, LIBOR, MFGlobal, or the Facebook IPO, each of which had documented fraudulent activity occur, shows anyone keen enough to look that he still had wall streets back. This is very much appreciated by the wall street elite.  Sheep brokers and lower level employees may be upset about BO, but top brass couldn&#39;t be happier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corzine was a top campaign bundler for Obama.  At MFG, his credentials didn&#39;t meet requirements to hold the position he held, SEC didn&#39;t stop him, neither did FINRA.  His transfers in the final days were in strict violation of the multiple laws, JPM knew about that, and even requested a written letter claiming the funds received weren&#39;t customer funds, which they never got.  There is an intimate connection between wall street and the white house and the fed. Everyone is to blame, but the SEC can&#39;t do anything if the attorney general won&#39;t prosecute.  Attorney Gen can&#39;t act if Obama doesn&#39;t agree, cuz then he gets the boot.   People making money in the rat race on WS donated to Mitt, while their bosses continue to use their power to commit fraud, worldwide, with a safe zone in NY</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because what Obama wouldn&#39;t do. Obama would not destroy the governments revenue steam in their benefit in the face of trillions in debt and a recession. Reducing the governments revenue steam at this moment is not a good idea. We can&#39;t deal with our problems under the current revenue stream.</p>

<p>Romney, however, campaigned upon an idea that would have benefited Wall Street and no one else. We all see what Wall Street is concerned with, and it ain&#39;t the governments revenue stream, nor the average worker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also gave them Bernanke, who is providing them with liquidity  every time they act like idiots and freeze the money supply(I don&#39;t even think the last QE was reported in the news much), he has provided them trillions in interest free loans at taxpayer expense, as well as rapid  capital infusions when they were at risk of having their bluffs called on bad bets and their debts called in.</p>

<p>The liquidity is the biggest thing, it&#39;s grease on the bearings when the machine seems to be slowing. The result is that due to the excess capital, new investments continue to be made, the market continues a false expansion, and wall street continues to reap profits which I&#39;m sure it is not reinvesting anywhere near the dollar considering the dollars value has to have greatly become decoupled from the money supply. Eventually they&#39;ll be reconciled and wall street will be sitting fat having acquired profits under the false value and traded them for other assets.</p>

<p>The analysts cut their estimates because a Facebook executive who knew the business was weak told them to.
Put differently, the company basically pre-announced that its second quarter would fall short of analysts&#39; estimates. But it only told the underwriter analysts about this.
<strong>The information about the estimate cut was then verbally conveyed to sophisticated institutional investors who were considering buying Facebook stock, but not to smaller investors</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re argument is that because BO isn&#39;t the attrny gen, he has no input into who gets prosecuted?  If the chief of police/ DA is not prosecuting or arresting marijuana users, what do you think would happen if one of the officers arrests someone using mmj?  The case gets dropped or disappears, even though the chief / DA isn&#39;t out there making the decision to not arrest drug users.  They won&#39;t allow them to be prosecuted, and the officers learn to not arrest users.  Chain of command. Either he told them not to prosecute for financial crimes, or he is content allowing the regulatory agencies to ignore criminal activities by allowing them to keep their positions in spite of overwelming evidence that they have failed as an agency.  It all falls on BO, any way you slice it.  Throw in there the connections between the white house and Goldman Sachs, Corzine, Paulson, Geithner, or draghi, not to mention the mountains of fraud committed internationally from the city of London every day.  Ireland is still arresting bankers from 2008 for their fraudulent debt accumulation which was later forced on the population. Greece is still screwed from GS deals way back in 2001.  These are serious crimes that go unchecked, and BO is the next in a long line of presidents who look the other way when it happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s awful. Though I think there&#39;s a misconception that Drone attacks are his idea. This is just the next weapon/tool for the military. It&#39;s here to stay and will continue to be used way passed this administration. I&#39;m sure the idea behind Drone attacks is to reduce the actual number of troops on the ground we need, and protect the lives of our soliders. While i&#39;m with the idea in spirit, I&#39;m not okay with military operations that are more imperialist than pre-emptive strikes.. </p>

<p>I think the tech will probably get better in a few years, the drones will be more precise, you&#39;ll see less civilian casualties. I have a bigger problem with why we are there in the first place, than the technology itself. Drones were inevitable, shit, we dreamed about it in sci-fi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To some extent, that&#39;s true. Sheldon Adelson only gave $2,500 directly to Romney&#39;s campaign, even though he gave millions to pro-Romney PACs.</p>

<p>But he <em>is</em> on record giving to Romney and not somebody else. It would be very surprising if the pattern of giving for SuperPACs was very different from the direct campaign contributions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.</p>

<p>Well, i dont have much time, but i can lay out some basics.</p>

<p>Notice before a campaign gets started, a presidential candidate has tightly held beliefs, there are various videos out on the internet pointing these stances out (saw a bunch with romney), and as elections gets closer, and polls start coming out, those tightly held believes start to get altered.  If a candidate is in need of money, or financing, he will have to change his stance to bend to his financial benefactors.  If you invest 50 Million Dollars into a Presidential Campaign, your not giving that money away to just be a nice guy.  These days are long past.  No, these super-pacs, businesses, large donors, financiers, help support a presidential campaign because they need something in return, and usually they need it in the form of washington vetos, votes and fillabusters, and other words that go on inside washington.  If you can create a bill or amendment or law saying that only your company can transact business - that law could be worth billions.  Anyways, here are some examples below.</p>

<p>Example #1:</p>

<p>Candiate #2: &quot;We need to pull the troops out now!&quot; </p>

<p>Campaign Adviser: sir your poll numbers are slipping and the military industrial complex called us and needs to perpetuate this war to pay the bills and create jobs, they are willing to give your campaign $20 Million Dollars and run ads against your opponent.</p>

<p>Candidate #2: What i meant to say was, we need a stronger military!</p>

<p>Example #2</p>

<p>Candidate #2:  I say we need more banking regulations and laws to help stop these bad loans and high interest rates by the banks.</p>

<p>Campaign Adviser: sir your poll numbers are slipping and the banking guys say you would kill their business and lose jobs if you suggest more regulations on the banks.  They are willing to donate $100 Million dollars to your campaign if you take a different stance.</p>

<p>Candidate #2: I might have suggested that more regulations on the banks would help this economy, but in actuality what i was really saying was we need to keep a better eye on our finances.  Its an effort we all must take on.</p>

<p>The list goes on and on of examples, i just popped in real quick and saw an orange box, had to answer it but you can easily find examples from abortion, to taxes, to unions, to manufacturing... look at candidates pasts or find examples of the old switcharoo on their stances. Sure people change, and money does things to people in bad ways.  They change.</p>
