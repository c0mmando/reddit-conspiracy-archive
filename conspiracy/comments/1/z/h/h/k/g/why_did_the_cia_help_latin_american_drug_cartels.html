    <div class="md"><p>As if they ever stopped.  The CIA is responsible for most, if not all, cocaine that&#39;s on the streets today.</p>

<p><em>My question</em> is why they&#39;re poisoning it with Levamisole!</p>

<p>That&#39;s why all the party kids are sick so much of the time -- because the blow is subtly poisoned.  </p>

<p>And just like how they gave so many young adults Parkinson&#39;s disease in the 1970&#39;s by dusting marijuana fields with Paraquat -- and disabled entire communities with Crack in the 1980&#39;s -- they&#39;re making today&#39;s youth sick with Levamisole.</p>

<p>Blow is so easy to get because they want young strong people to be weak and sick.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to assume Levamisole is in the molly too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s been a couple of stories posted here of recent CIA planes that have crashed that were full of nose candy.</p>

<p>As for the heroin, it&#39;s all made in Afghanistan, The army has been protecting it. So it&#39;s all being processed and now as part of the &quot;move out&quot; strategy a bunch of it will be brought back via the empty containers that contained all the gear and stuff they used up over there. There will be high ups moving the bulk of it but also grunts bringing back a kilo or so each.</p>

<p>Then they&#39;ll give some to their friends when they get back here. &quot;Hey, sell it to some freak you know, maybe make some cash, I&#39;m back!&quot; and some people will sell it and some might try it but they find that they like it and it&#39;s cheaper than buying Oxycotin so they all start shooting up and slipping on bill payments and the kids start doing it..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was there as a contractor a few years ago rebuilding their ATC centers all over the country.  We were often alone and told to never work after dark.  The airstrips were used at night by drug runners.  We were told that they weren&#39;t crazy about ATC centers being brought back online.  They had nothing to worry about though, because the systems that we were installing didn&#39;t really work.  I remember being confused at the time as to why I was installing radio systems that weren&#39;t designed to work in mountainous regions like that (short range, low power VHF, UHF, no HF, no satcom relays, no stable electrical, one phone line that often didn&#39;t work).  Once this came out, it made a lot more sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just incredibly silly to assume even a small portion of the middle class will start using heroin just because it&#39;s legal.</p>

<p>Most drug users don&#39;t even use heroin, and the legality of drugs has no bearing on their decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said it would be legal?</p>

<p>Most of the middle class is already on prescription drugs. Some are already shooting their prescription drugs so to make the jump to heroin wouldn&#39;t be hard especially if it were cheaper and felt way better than the legal stuff.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you think the middle class wouldn&#39;t be effected. The middle class loves a good escape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh.  Suffice to say the middle class have disposable income for heroin at almost any price.  It may not be worth it to them, but the option is there.  I think it is remarkably silly to assume that heroin becoming cheaper would destroy the middle class, not least because the middle class will exist even if everyone currently classified as such sucked a tailpipe.</p>

<p>Assuming that price is the only factor in determining heroin use is doubly inane, as it ignores factors such as... &quot;Not wanting to do heroin, ever&quot;.  Plenty of people go their whole life without a trace of intoxicant, legal or otherwise. I personally would not do heroin if I was paid to do so, why would I start just because it was cheap or even free?</p>

<p>I mean, there really is so much wrong with the presumption that I can&#39;t even begin to know where to start.  Could you share what mechanism causes people who have never done heroin to suddenly try it at a certain price-point?  Particularly the middle class, which wouldn&#39;t miss a rent check if a single dose cost them even as much as $500</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re not taking in to account the rising cost of food and pretty much everything else.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking down the road a little, think after the next economic crash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it is remarkably silly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How come you&#39;re always using the word silly? Were you taught to keep using the same phrase when using the 4 D&#39;s? So the slaves would take your side because you said &quot;silly&quot; more and are therefore right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to assume that heroin becoming cheaper would destroy the middle class, not least because the middle class will exist even if everyone currently classified as such sucked a tailpipe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not because it&#39;s cheaper it&#39;s also because it&#39;ll be readily available. It&#39;s also because legal prescription drugs would be more expensive. They&#39;ll find the heroin high is where it&#39;s at and tell all their friends.</p>

<p>If everyone in the middle class sucked a tailpipe and died the poor would fill some of their jobs but most jobs today aren&#39;t &quot;required&quot; McDonalds doesn&#39;t need someone to take your order, you could do it to an ATM machine. Also self driving cars and other things are coming out that basically made the need for a middle class disappear which helps because they&#39;ll be dying due to heroin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assuming that price is the only factor in determining heroin use is doubly inane, as it ignores factors such as... &quot;Not wanting to do heroin, ever&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the bulk of the middle class will be dragging people down with them those that don&#39;t do heroin will end up in the poor end of the spectrum anyway. Most people will probably do it for the escape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plenty of people go their whole life without a trace of intoxicant, legal or otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Plenty? I think you&#39;d be surprised how many substance virgins are out there. Even the religious drink wine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally would not do heroin if I was paid to do so, why would I start just because it was cheap or even free?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you&#39;re bored and desperate and everyone else seems to have a good time doing it. Besides, not like you have a job tomorrow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, there really is so much wrong with the presumption that I can&#39;t even begin to know where to start. Could you share what mechanism causes people who have never done heroin to suddenly try it at a certain price-point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the price point comment was more about how it&#39;ll spread easier if it were cheap and for people who are paying more for their medication.</p>

<p>Someone just up and trying heroin will probably do it because everyone else they know is doing it, that kind of thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Particularly the middle class, which wouldn&#39;t miss a rent check if a single dose cost them even as much as $500</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re thinking upper middle class. Most of the middle class lives pay check to pay check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can totally see how one could anticipate such affects on the impoverished, but this is too strange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really, I gave you a link to China&#39;s opium war. Heroin has been used to topple nations. That&#39;s the plan for America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other way around, Congress had prohibited funding for the Contras, the cia wanted to continue their support and thus resorted to illegal ways to do so. </p>

<p>From the iran-contra wiki: &quot; During the¬†Reagan administration, senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to¬†Iran, the subject of an¬†arms embargo.[2]¬†Some U.S. officials also hoped that the arms sales would secure the release of several¬†hostages¬†and allow U.S. intelligence agencies to fund the Nicaraguan¬†Contras. Under the¬†Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah basically. It allows them to do black listed activity without any money trail. The only evidence of them doing such a thing was iran-contra. I think the cia is still moving drugs to fund things, why stop doing something that works? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;reason&#39; is that the Sandinista government in Nicaragua was unfriendly to US business interests. So the CIA, initially under Jimmy Carter and later under Reagan, created, trained and funded Contras in Nicaragua (death squads) to overthrow the government there. </p>

<p>Congress was fickle about appropriating money for the Contras however, and at certain points in the 80&#39;s made it illegal for the CIA to fund them. During these periods the Contras massively expanded their cocaine trafficking operations because their funds were low. The CIA, under the direction of Oliver North of Reagan&#39;s NSC, sold weapons to Iran to get more funding for the Contras, and approved of their drug dealing as it allowed them to get more funds off the books. The CIA interfered with DEA investigations and in Oliver North&#39;s diary you can actually read about drug deals going down that he knew about. The Kerry Committee in 1988 issued a report illustrating the CIA was complicit in drug trafficking.</p>
