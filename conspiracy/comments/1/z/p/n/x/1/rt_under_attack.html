        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m seeing <em>a lot</em> of discussions calling for the banning of RT on Reddit and discrediting saying it&#39;s state owned propaganda etc.</p>

<p>However, state-owned media is nothing new, far from it. Almost, if not all of the global powers have state-owned media outlets, but why is RT the only bad guy in this story? Because they are the only ones critical of the US and who call out the USG&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not Russian, or pro-Russia. I look at things objectively and what I see is Russia being the only ones that are not calling for war but the opposite, and when you get in the way of an economic power that thrives on war, this is the result.</p>

<p>This is the response from <a href="http://rt.com/usa/rt-government-broadcasting-radio/">RT itself</a> regarding the issue:</p>

<hr/>

<p>RT has been accused of being &quot;state-run&quot; or dismissed as influenced by the Kremlin because it receives state funding.</p>

<p>­To boot, from GlobalMediaWars.com:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Its motto is &quot;question more,&quot; but it’s clear who supplies the answers to many of the questions on RT: the Kremlin.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Glenn Beck on Fox News referred to RT as <em>&quot;state-run&quot;</em> and the <em>&quot;Pravda of today.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And people have used this as a way to dismiss RT’s content, along with its mission of news with a Russian perspective. NPR &quot;On the Media&quot; host Bob Garfield’s remarks:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Though they have the look and the feel of maybe BBC or CNN International, just &#39;cause it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck doesn&#39;t make it a duck.&quot;</em></p>

<p>But let’s look at the mission and funding of the BBC.</p>

<p>According to its charter, its goals include representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities and bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK. </p>

<p>While BBC World Service, which broadcasts to the world on radio, on TV and online, providing news and information in 32 languages, is funded by a government grant, it also recently received a significant sum of money from the US government according to reports.</p>

<p>And what about other international networks?</p>

<p>France 24’s mission is <em>&quot;to cover international current events from a French perspective and to convey French values throughout the world&quot;</em> and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the public-funded holding company Audiovisuel Exterieur de la France (AEF)</p>

<p>The German Deutsche Welle’s goal is to <em>&quot;promote understanding of Germany as an independent nation with its roots in European culture and as a liberal, democratic, constitutional state based on the rule of law.&quot;</em> It’s budget is made up of funds allocated by the federal government from German tax revenues, according to its website.</p>

<p>And here in the US, it’s the Corporation of Public Broadcasting that provides funds to public TV and radio stations. According to its website, <em>&quot;when Congress created CPB, it declared that developing public media is…&quot;of appropriate and important concern&quot;</em>  to the federal government. By law, 95 percent  of CPB&#39;s appropriation from the federal government goes to support local television and radio stations, programming and improvements to the public broadcasting system.</p>

<p>Funding for PBS programs, for example, comes from a variety of sources, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and government agencies.</p>

<p>And outside the US, it’s the Broadcasting Board of Governors that transmits its message. The board encompasses all U.S. civilian international broadcasting:  Voice of America(VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL),Radio Free Asia (RFA), Radio and TV Martí, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN)—Radio Sawa and Alhurra Television.</p>

<p>It broadcasts in 59 languages to an estimated weekly audience of 165 million people via radio, TV, the Internet and other new media. </p>

<p>While its principles include being &quot;consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States, and the capability to provide a surge capacity to support United States foreign policy objectives during crises abroad,&quot; according to it’s website.</p>

<p>So call RT <em>&quot;state-funded&quot;</em> if you must, but if you want to &quot;call a duck a duck,&quot; as NPR’s host so eloquently put it, you might want to consider the pond we’re all swimming in.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now with the recent ban that was lifted regarding US propaganda in the US, why is <em>this</em> not news or even brought up?</p>

<p>Obviously the United States is hypocritical in demonizing everybody else for using propaganda, when they use propaganda themselves.</p>

<p>They are hypocrites on just about everything else too, illegal detention and torture, illegal wars, financial crimes, drug trafficing, and everything else they do that gets normal citizens thrown in jail.</p>

<p>If you need specifics provided as to how the USG is hypocritical, then you must know nothing about the USG.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed it, so I&#39;m posting again:</p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing <em>a lot</em> of discussions calling for the banning of RT on Reddit and discrediting saying it&#39;s state owned propaganda etc.</p>

<p>However, state-owned media is nothing new, far from it. Almost, if not all of the global powers have state-owned media outlets, but why is RT the only bad guy in this story? Because they are the only ones critical of the US and who call out the USG&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not Russian, or pro-Russia. I look at things objectively and what I see is Russia being the only ones that are not calling for war but the opposite, and when you get in the way of an economic power that thrives on war, this is the result.</p>

<p>This is the response from <a href="http://rt.com/usa/rt-government-broadcasting-radio/">RT itself</a> regarding the issue:</p>

<hr/>

<p>RT has been accused of being &quot;state-run&quot; or dismissed as influenced by the Kremlin because it receives state funding.</p>

<p>­To boot, from GlobalMediaWars.com:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Its motto is &quot;question more,&quot; but it’s clear who supplies the answers to many of the questions on RT: the Kremlin.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Glenn Beck on Fox News referred to RT as <em>&quot;state-run&quot;</em> and the <em>&quot;Pravda of today.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And people have used this as a way to dismiss RT’s content, along with its mission of news with a Russian perspective. NPR &quot;On the Media&quot; host Bob Garfield’s remarks:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Though they have the look and the feel of maybe BBC or CNN International, just &#39;cause it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck doesn&#39;t make it a duck.&quot;</em></p>

<p>But let’s look at the mission and funding of the BBC.</p>

<p>According to its charter, its goals include representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities and bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK. </p>

<p>While BBC World Service, which broadcasts to the world on radio, on TV and online, providing news and information in 32 languages, is funded by a government grant, it also recently received a significant sum of money from the US government according to reports.</p>

<p>And what about other international networks?</p>

<p>France 24’s mission is <em>&quot;to cover international current events from a French perspective and to convey French values throughout the world&quot;</em> and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the public-funded holding company Audiovisuel Exterieur de la France (AEF)</p>

<p>The German Deutsche Welle’s goal is to <em>&quot;promote understanding of Germany as an independent nation with its roots in European culture and as a liberal, democratic, constitutional state based on the rule of law.&quot;</em> It’s budget is made up of funds allocated by the federal government from German tax revenues, according to its website.</p>

<p>And here in the US, it’s the Corporation of Public Broadcasting that provides funds to public TV and radio stations. According to its website, <em>&quot;when Congress created CPB, it declared that developing public media is…&quot;of appropriate and important concern&quot;</em>  to the federal government. By law, 95 percent  of CPB&#39;s appropriation from the federal government goes to support local television and radio stations, programming and improvements to the public broadcasting system.</p>

<p>Funding for PBS programs, for example, comes from a variety of sources, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and government agencies.</p>

<p>And outside the US, it’s the Broadcasting Board of Governors that transmits its message. The board encompasses all U.S. civilian international broadcasting:  Voice of America(VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL),Radio Free Asia (RFA), Radio and TV Martí, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN)—Radio Sawa and Alhurra Television.</p>

<p>It broadcasts in 59 languages to an estimated weekly audience of 165 million people via radio, TV, the Internet and other new media. </p>

<p>While its principles include being &quot;consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States, and the capability to provide a surge capacity to support United States foreign policy objectives during crises abroad,&quot; according to it’s website.</p>

<p>So call RT <em>&quot;state-funded&quot;</em> if you must, but if you want to &quot;call a duck a duck,&quot; as NPR’s host so eloquently put it, you might want to consider the pond we’re all swimming in.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now with the recent ban that was lifted regarding US propaganda in the US, why is <em>this</em> not news or even brought up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, because RT does put out A LOT of blatant propaganda pieces. If you&#39;re unable to see that then you&#39;re just flat-out idiotic or unwilling to see the truth. I mean, even when they&#39;re telling the truth, or just presenting the other side of the story, their bias is INCREDIBLY thick and has only gotten thicker recently.</p>

<p>BBC/PBS/NPR don&#39;t really compare, while they can have bias, it&#39;s not even close to RT&#39;s. All you need to know: RT reporters have stated, on the record, that they are not allowed to criticize Putin or the Kremlin on air (they claim this is the <em>only</em> thing they&#39;re not allowed to say, but I doubt that). Do you think the BBC can criticize Cameron? Can PBS/NPR criticize Obama? Of course, and they do all the time.</p>

<p>VOA and those international, American involved stations are much more comparable to RT. But no one posts VOA news articles on Reddit either, because it&#39;s obviously very biased. </p>

<p>I&#39;m very puzzled/concerned about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s defense of RT and Russia in general. Russia is literally everything this sub claims to despise (corruption, government stepping on civil rights, violation of freedom of speech, propaganda, etc.). That&#39;s an objective fact, nearly anyone with any intelligence is able to understand Russia is fucked up. Yet, it seems like a lot of people here hate America and our government so badly that they&#39;ve actually convinced themselves that Russia is a good place.</p>

<p>You do realize BOTH America and Russia can be in the wrong, right? </p>

<p>Regardless, I&#39;ll trust BBC/PBS over RT any day of the week, I&#39;ll even trust CNN over RT, which is saying quite a lot. </p>

<p>RT aligns itself with anti-american sentiment to gain the trust of the cynical viewer. Your trust is their goal so that their propaganda is less scrutinized.

<p>Right or wrong, it&#39;s a product of domestic media not doing enough to criticise it&#39;s own government. People turn to things like RT to vent anger and frustration at not getting the full brunt of criticism from indigenous media which it should be doing. The media is supposed to be our watchdog and a guardian exposing corruption to the full extent.</p>

<p>The BBC has been accused by academics for yielding to political pressure on it&#39;s own reporting and relying on people to give talking points who are the ones under scrutiny.</p>

<p>Considering the <a href="http://www.jonesreport.com/articles/270207_bbc_lost_response.html">BBC mucked it up</a> (at best) on the largest news day in decades (9/11/2001), and <a href="http://www.ufo-blogger.com/2012/05/syria-bbc-caught-red-handed-in-syria.html">has been accused of generating propaganda</a> for a Syrian intervention....and <a href="http://www.secretsofthefed.com/cnn-busted-producing-fake-news-from-first-gulf-war/">CNN has been caught</a> numerous times staging fake news events, I find that you are, in fact saying alot because you are trusting those outlets over RT.  </p>

<p>What you are saying is, you believe in western propaganda.  Enjoy the kool aid.</p>

<p>Understand the bias of your sources and their agendas and you will know who is reliable in which situation. Theres no reason to ban ANYONE, and mods doing so only lend more credibility to RTs western reporting, which as I said is intended to piss westerners off but ive never seen or read anything dubious from them on western articles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems funny timing to have a strong opinion for or against RT, with the current tension going on. I propose that anti-RT people have existed before this current tension, but pro-RT people have not. People have criticized RT for being super biased and asked for its banning from major subreddits since always. Now that there is real world tension going on, several people pop up to support RT. Seems a little fishy.</p>

<p>I think some may miss your sarcasm there. RT is obviously very bias and pounces on any and everything that is negative towards the US. They are quick to report things like the US&#39;s inside 9/11 job, because of this bias. They also really twist some other stuff to further this biasness. This makes them far less than hardcore truth tellers, for issues that don&#39;t show negatively on the US or can be manipulated into being framed as so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i tend to lend more credibility to aljajzeera these days than any other media outlet. rt is interesting. the newscaster resigning did damage their credibility pretty bad in my view.  and the fact that rt is funded by the Kremlin does lend credibility to it being state sponsored propaganda machine much like xinhua in China or faux news. cnn bbc etc. i like to think rt offers insight from a purely Russian perspective. like one side of a two sided coin. and i have no doubt Putin uses it to his advantage. it is Russia after all. Putin is a dictator trying to disguise himself as elected leader but who is he really fooling?  propaganda has been used for centuries by governments to sway public opinion. Problem is it mostly works. I think if more of us could think critically and read between the lines... well draw your own conclusions.</p>

And then there are the angry bloggers – a shadowy army of Russian nationalists who are active on western newspaper websites, including the Guardian&#39;s Comment is free site. Anyone who dares to criticise Russia&#39;s leaders, or point out some of the country&#39;s deficiencies, is immediately branded a CIA spy or worse. &quot;They [the Kremlin] are coming to realise that information matters and that control of information internationally matters even more,&quot; says Evgeny Morozov, a Yahoo! fellow at Georgetown University&#39;s institute for the study of diplomacy.</p>

<p>Why are you saying that like she was on my &quot;team&quot; or something.  I don&#39;t have any vested interest in RT.  I couldn&#39;t care less.  So yeah, you are looking dumber by the sentence.</p>

<p>RT aligns itself with anti-american sentiment to gain the trust of the cynical viewer. Your trust is their goal so that their propaganda is less scrutinized. They&#39;ve done stories on 9/11 as an inside job. That gives the cynical viewer like those here on our sub reason to trust them. Now, they are regarded as a source for truth, by some, because they said something that their viewers believe. Now they can lie and do so with ease and efficiency.</p>

<p>This <strong>exactly</strong>. It is soooo fucking blatantly obvious when they try to kowtow to, as you say, America&#39;s &quot;cynical&quot; youth. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxfxconVoNM">This ACTUALLY aired on RT, not too long ago</a> I don&#39;t know how people can&#39;t see the agenda there. Even if you believed that 9/11 was an inside job, that&#39;s an entirely inappropriate way to present the news. </p>
