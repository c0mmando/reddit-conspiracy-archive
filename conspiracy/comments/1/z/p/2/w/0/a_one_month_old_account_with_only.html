        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1zo1k7/russia_today_anchor_resigns_live_on_air_i_cannot/cfveo24">Here&#39;s</a> the comment. (Check his account too. If you find anything other than anti-Russian comments since the incident sprung up, e.g. a post in <a href="/r/aww">/r/aww</a>, I&#39;ll give you gold). Please don&#39;t vote-brigade.</p>

<p>The propaganda tug-of-war has been ramped up astronomically this past week. Most of it should be attributed to the Ukrainian revolution itself, but the anti-Putin content is taken to an entirely different level, especially on the internet. Which I find unnecessary and irrelevant to Ukrainians toppling their government. Meanwhile, <strong>literal Nazis</strong> in office is not newsworthy. </p>

<p>I usually don&#39;t get affected by the nuclear fear-mongering of people like Jones and Tarpley, but I hate to say that I&#39;m seeing a worrying pattern of events that supports their world-view. Especially Tarpley&#39;s. (If you don&#39;t know about it, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H02w1bp4TcU">here</a> is a shorter monologue, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIedEzO3pn0">here</a> is a longer presentation.) </p>

<p>The Ukraine hoopla seems to be more opportunistic than direct western meddling as some reports have claimed (IMO), but it still fits in the grand scheme of &quot;the Brezinski agenda&quot;. They&#39;re poking and prodding the bear more and more for each day, and it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s stopping <a href="http://www.airforcetimes.com/article/20140305/NEWS08/303050034/U-S-sending-F-15s-tanker-patrol-Baltic-airspace">anytime soon</a>. The catastrophic American economy doesn&#39;t make things better either. </p>

<p>Am I insane to think that it was natural for Putin to defend his docked- and exposed naval fleet in Sevastopol? I&#39;m no Russian apologetic, I hate a lot of aspects of their culture, but Jesus Christ, this is so obviously not a forced military occupation. The Crimeans themselves aren&#39;t even objecting, so why should anyone else? And why is Poland all of a sudden acting paranoid?</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not trying to sound like a Russian mouth-piece, but it&#39;s impossible when they&#39;re acting reasonably, while their actions are misconstrued as &quot;literally Hitler.&quot;</p>

<p>Am I biased without knowing it? Someone please prove me wrong if you think I am. </p>

<p>Edit: didn&#39;t mean to go off-topic here, so if you only want to address the headline, that&#39;s fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Especially given that most NPR stations receive very little, if any, funding from the Federal government. </p>

<p>In 2012, my local NPR station received in funding:</p>

<p>$0 directly from the Federal Government. </p>

<p>$226,390 from Public Broadcasting Entities</p>

<p>$613,625 from business</p>

<p>$1,038,915 from donors.</p>

<p>My local station also used to be mostly Classical music, but the listeners voted to have it switch to two stations (news on the main feed and classical on an hd one). They have expanded their budget to produce multiple shows unique to my area. It&#39;s pretty solid.</p>

<p>The listeners of public radio are the ones that pay for it, in general. </p>

<p>To be fair, PBS/NPR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your opinion on those outlets is noted, but I happen to disagree.  Based on what I&#39;ve heard they are far from unbiased.  In fact, NPR was one of the first out the gate to call Snowden a leaker instead of a whistleblower.  Oh sure it&#39;s low key and hardly an MSNBC or CNN, but that&#39;s what makes it a more effective for propaganda....you have these loud yahoos on the left, these loud yahooos on the right, and here is little NPR carrying the white house water jug...albeit quetly.  Amid all the rickata racketa, they seem tame by comparison...yet their bias is readily apparent to anyone who is paying attention.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no such thing as an unbiased news organization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would invite you to see how many stories NPR has on such &quot;luminaries&quot; like Philip Roth... it&#39;s like the &quot;left&quot; leaning version of Commentary Magazine without such an overt Neocon perspective that is none-the-less still very much present.</p>

<p>Instead of criticizing the Middle East over their &quot;aggression&quot; towards the U.S., it&#39;s simply through their lack of feminism, their religious ideology... etc... </p>

<p>NPR and PBS are surely better than much of U.S. mainstream and corporate news, however the bias is surely there. And I invite you to look at the background of its staff members. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2014/03/05/propaganda-rules-news-paul-craig-roberts/">I think Paul Craig Robert&#39;s latest piece really hit the nail on the head</a>;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entire story that the presstitutes have told about the Ukraine is a propaganda production. The presstitutes told us that the deposed president, Viktor Yanukovych, ordered snipers to shoot protesters. On the basis of these false reports, Washington’s stooges, who comprise the existing non-government in Kiev, have issued arrest orders for Yanukovych and intend for him to be tried in an international court. In an intercepted telephone call between EU foreign affairs minister Catherine Ashton and Estonian foreign affairs minister Urmas Paet who had just returned from Kiev, Paet reports: “There is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovych, but it was somebody from the new coalition.” Paet goes on to report that “all the evidence shows that the people who were killed by snipers from both sides, among policemen and then people from the streets, that they were the same snipers killing people from both sides . . . and it’s really disturbing that now the new coalition, that they don’t want to investigate what exactly happened.” Ashton, absorbed with EU plans to guide reforms in Ukraine and to prepare the way for the IMF to gain control over economic policy, was not particularly pleased to hear Paet’s report that the killings were an orchestrated provocation. You can listen to the conversation between Paet and Ashton here: <a href="http://rt.com/news/ashton-maidan-snipers-estonia-946/">http://rt.com/news/ashton-maidan-snipers-estonia-946/</a></p>

<p>What has happened in Ukraine is that Washington plotted against and overthrew an elected legitimate government and then lost control to neo-nazis who are threatening the large Russian population in southern and eastern Ukraine, provinces that formerly were part of Russia. These threatened Russians have appealed for Russia’s help, and just like the Russians in South Ossetia, they will receive Russia’s help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since I am shadowbanned in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> here is my comments about the Crimea vote for independence and I have to say, it gets me very worried what are we witnessing now. </p>

<p>Do not try to talk &quot;seriously&quot; re: Ukraine on reddit. We are witnessing prime theater of absurd and it is quite upsetting to see. A classic, text-book coup was orchestrated. I mean, we have leaked phone conversations, we have funding info who supported Ukraine&#39;s &quot;opposition&quot;, and numerous other evidences. All of it is being ignored, FLAT OUT. Nazi in new Ukra government are treated like legit govt members and Kerry meets with them, does not even blink an eye.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, anti-Russia hysteria reaches peak that has not been seen since 70s or 80s. USA comes up with all sorts idiotic statements, i.e Kerry, promotes more hysteria, pumps up neurotic Baltic states and Poland (that btw no one will take if they&#39;ll even pay them) and all hell breaks lose.</p>

<p>Crimea has a right to not recognize Ukra coup government. It has a right to vote and fight for independence. The anti-Russia campaign has to stop, and the idiotic PR stunts like that cunt anchor quitting, should stop too. It is 2014, for fuck&#39;s sake. Information is accessible to everyone, anyone who is not brain dead and knows a little about critical thinking could easily see what is going on in Ukraine. Yet, people (redditors especially) behave like indoctrinated zombies repeating endlessly &quot;Russia=bad, US=good&quot;</p>

<p>p.s. I would LOVE to see Fox or NBC anchor quitting over war in Iraq on air, hard to imagine, right?</p>

<p>And this allows there to be a bubble around the country and everything tends to come from within, media-wise. As soon as you leave that bubble, you realize. And I have been out of it for years on end now.</p>

<p>Most countries, even Russia, share borders, and while they are nationalistic and patriotic like us, they still have a bigger &quot;world-view&quot; than the average US citizen.</p>

<p>Making it very easy to fool us with propaganda. The people defending Russia a lot of the time are not even bot or spooks, they are <em>real</em> people from neither country just trying to get the facts straight because as far as reddit.com goes, you are basically <em>in</em> the US when you are on this site during its peak hours.</p>

<p>People here are so brainwashed that they don&#39;t even know where the propaganda begins and ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A hypothetical question:</p>

<p>Suppose for a moment that there was a group of legislators who wanted to slip a bill through Congress, say Iran sanctions for example, without anyone noticing, largely because they would soon be drowning in lobbyists&#39; money if they were successful. Suppose also that some of the lobbyists in question represented groups which had numerous covert operatives planted throughout another volatile region, and could create a crisis on demand.</p>

<p>What might the media surrounding this look like, and how might it play out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s taking place in practice already regarding Russia <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/kerry-russia-sanction-ukraine/2014/03/02/id/555541">here</a>. Media is dead silent on what this idiotic move could lead to, and I&#39;m sure they wont need the people&#39;s approval for it. If congress is required, they&#39;ll be too overwhelmed with disinformation to vote against it, similar to how the Patriot Act was approved. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why they would agitate Russia like this. There&#39;s nothing to gain from it, even if it would mean the end of them. It&#39;s like the military machine has malfunctioned and running the entire world into the ground without a reason what so ever, besides maybe to prevent an American revolution. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Russia would fire their ICBMs before capitulating, but it could really go either way. Regardless, Russia&#39;s potential surrender wouldn&#39;t affect America in any way what so ever. The end-goal for Obama is war, not winning it seems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My strong suspicion is that this is a sideshow to provide cover for the Israeli and &quot;defense&quot; lobbies to turn up the heat on Iran (via the sanctions that Netanyahu and his lobbyists are trying to buy from Congress). Bibi, himself, is in town for the annual AIPAC convention, and they, along with quite a few other Israeli lobbyists announced months ago that they&#39;d be turning on the heat about now.</p>

<p>In other words, keep your eye on the Middle East, I think this is a shell game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen to me, there is some serious shit going on in Ukraine right now. Russia is trying to get popular opinion on its side so it can invade other Ukrainian Territories. Upvoting posts or downvoting posts like this actually plays a small part in this war. And this is a war of ideas.</p>

<p>RT is Russian government Controlled. There is a lot of Russian propaganda  right now about Ukraine that is not true. This is making a lot of people upset and why the comment in world news got so many upvotes. Do not confuse RT&#39;s ability to be objective about USA to being objective about Ukraine. RT today can report some accurate stuff about America, but this is not its shining glory this month. You heard about how an American Anchor resigned on Russia Today live ? She did that for a reason. Here is her live on air resignation <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/abby-martin-becomes-viral-voice-dissent-kremlins-rt-230969">http://www.newsweek.com/abby-martin-becomes-viral-voice-dissent-kremlins-rt-230969</a></p>
