    <div class="md"><p>Its only coming to light recently.  Honestly this stuff isn&#39;t uncommon, and as soon as someone figured out how, the bitcoin community needed to respond by changing security.  You can&#39;t keep using the same thing after you are hacked.  some changed and became more secure, some didn&#39;t and continued to have problems. </p>

<p>Also, at least some of the hacks are completely made up bullshit.  Its almost completely accepted at this point that Silk Road was only hacked in a minor fashion and the owner of the site took that opportunity to take a cut out of bitcoins on the site himself. </p>

<p>Bitcoin, like all money, is only as secure as the security apparatus supporting it.  some sites are more secure than others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>interesting question......I don&#39;t know much of bitcoins, but it seemed it went from an interesting viable new currency concept to crap in months....even the mega-rich ultra hipster Sir Richard Branson was on that train.......but now, to me seems like a scam....and like I said, I know really as minimal of the bitcoin world as one could....and as a side question....does bitcoin relate directly to Dogecoin? meaning will the crash of Bitcoin boost Dogecoin or take it all down?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s difficult to say. Most cryptos are tied to bitcoin one way of another. </p>

<p>That beings said Dogecoin can by bought directly with fiat via certain money exchanges like Vault of Satoshi. That helps insulate against the price changes of bitcoin but as of right now all cyrpto are connected via bitcoin price one way if the other. This can change though. </p>

<p>So bitcoin might crash and burn one day but the won&#39;t spell the end of cyrpto in general.  Even if it&#39;s out right banned services will pop that will make it possible to use it.  </p>

<p>You can&#39;t put the genie back in the bottle. Cryptos are here for better or worse.  </p>
