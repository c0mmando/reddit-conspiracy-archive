        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I THINK THE RAPTURE WILL PROBABLY BE ON ASCENSION DAY, MAY 29, 2014</p>

<p>There are two Raptures coming up. It seems to me that the First-Trump Rapture may be next Ascension Day. May 29 is also Iyar 29, Ascension Day in both Eastern and Western churches this year. This is the last time they will fall on the same day before the date I think will be the Second Advent on April 9, 2016, Sat. Nisan 1, 5776, the first day of the Sacred, Regnal and Jubilee years. </p>

<p>The last Rapture will be on the Day of God&#39;s Wrath, probably Tishri 1, 5776, Sept. 14, 2015. Those people will get out of here by the skin of their teeth, just before the asteroid impacts, one in the NE Mediterranean Sea, the other at Babylon (Rev. 8:8-11). Damascus and Babylon will cease to be cities. Babylon will probably end up being the Lake of Fire. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Ascension">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Ascension</a> </p>

<p>Ascension Day commemorates the Ascension of Jesus into heaven. The date in the churches is 39 days after Easter. To the Jews, that will be the 40th Omer, because Resurrection Day, Firstfruits, the day after the Sabbath, is Omer one. </p>

<p>DATE OF ASCENSION DAY IN THE CHURCHES </p>

<p>May 29, 2014 (Western)
May 29, 2014 (Eastern) </p>

<p>May 14, 2015 (Western)
May 21, 2015 (Eastern) </p>

<p>May 5, 2016 (Western)
June 9, 2016 (Eastern) </p>

<p>Charles posted on Five Doves that he dreamed three times that the Rapture would be on Thursday. The Crucifixion was on Thursday, Christ&#39;s resurrection was three days later, on Sunday. The churches always keep Resurrection Day on Sunday and Ascension Day on Thursday. </p>

<p>To figure Easter, the Western churches go by the Gregorian Calendar. The Eastern churches go by the old Julian Calendar. It seems like a miracle that both will keep Ascension Day on the same day this year, May 29, our daughter&#39;s birthday. </p>

<p>ASCENSION DAY </p>

<p>Acts 1:6-11 says, &quot;When they (i.e., the disciples) therefore were come together (i.e., on Ascension Day), they asked of him, saying, Lord (i.e., Jesus), wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? 7 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. 8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you (i.e., 10 days later, on Pentecost): and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. 9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, HE WAS TAKEN UP; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, TWO MEN (i.e., MOSES AND ELIJAH) stood by them in white apparel; 11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? THIS SAME JESUS, WHICH IS TAKEN UP FROM YOU INTO HEAVEN, SHALL SO COME IN LIKE MANNER AS YE HAVE SEEN HIM GO INTO HEAVEN.&quot; </p>

<p>Since the Lord often taught by example, Ascension Day would be a good day for us to go up to Heaven in the Rapture, and a good day for Moses and Elijah to appear. Jesus will bring them with him at the time of the MID-TRIB first Rapture. </p>

<p>Rev 11:1-4 says, &quot;there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, RISE (i.e., this is the MID-TRIB RAPTURE of I Thess. 4:16,17 and Rev. 4:1), and measure the temple of God (we are the Temple of the Holy Spirit, and can be measured; they cannot be measured in the second Rapture, Rev 7:9), and the altar, and them that worship therein. 2 But the court (i.e., of the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa Mosque) which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months (the last half of the Tribulation). 3 And I will give power unto my TWO WITNESSES (i.e., Moses and Elijah), and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days (i.e., during the 42-month Great Tribulation), clothed in sackcloth. 4 THESE ARE THE TWO OLIVE TREES, AND THE TWO CANDLESTICKS STANDING BEFORE THE GOD OF THE EARTH.&quot; </p>

<p>Zec 4:2-4 says, &quot;And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof: 3 And TWO OLIVE TREES by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. 4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?&quot; </p>

<p>They are Moses and Elijah, who stood before Christ at His Transfiguration and probably at His Ascension. The Transfiguration represented the Rapture. </p>

<p>Mar 9:1-4 says, &quot;And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till THEY HAVE SEEN THE KINGDOM OF GOD COME WITH POWER. 2 And after six days (i.e., representing 6000 years) Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them UP INTO AN HIGH MOUNTAIN (i.e., Heaven), apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them. 3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them (i.e., as he will look in Heaven). 4 And there appeared unto them ELIAS WITH MOSES: and they were talking with Jesus.&quot; </p>

<p>When did Moses and Elijah, who lived centuries apart, appear together? ON TRANSFIGURATION DAY, and probably ASCENSION DAY in 30 AD. When will Moses and Elijah appear in the future? Mid-Trib (Rev 11:3,4). </p>

<p>THEN WHEN WILL THE FIRST-TRUMP RAPTURE TAKE PLACE? ON THE MID-TRIB ASCENSION DAY? It sure looks like it to me. </p>

<p>John_6:62 says, &quot;What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?&quot; </p>

<p>In John_20:17, Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.&quot; </p>

<p>Jesus took the Old Testament saints to Heaven on Resurrection Day, and came back the same day. After that, he could be touched. Then Jesus ascended on Ascension Day, probably foreshadowing THE DAY OF OUR RAPTURE. </p>

<p>How will the First-Trump Rapture happen? Quickly. We are are given an example. </p>

<p>Acts 8:39 says, &quot;And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away (harpazo, to catch away, take by force, i.e., raptured) Philip (an apostle and elder of Rev 4:1-4), that the eunuch saw him no more&quot;. That was fast. </p>

<p>WHERE WILL WE GO? </p>

<p>2 Corinthians 12:2-4 says, &quot;I knew a man (i.e., Paul himself, he didn&#39;t want to boast) in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up, (harpazo, to catch away, take by force, i.e., to be raptured) to the third heaven (1) Mars, (2) Jupiter, (3) Saturn)...4 How that he was caught up (harpazo, raptured) into paradise (paradeisos, a park, an Eden, a place of future happiness, i.e., Heaven), and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.&quot; </p>

<p>Adam&#39;s Eden was a paradise on Earth. Our paradise is in Heaven where Jesus/God sits on his throne (Eze 1:1,26-28). </p>

<p>THE FIRST-TRUMP RAPTURE </p>

<p>1Th 4:13-18 says, &quot;But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus (i.e., like Moses, Elijah, and my husband Ed) will God bring with him. 15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent (phthano, precede) them which are asleep. 16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be CAUGHT UP together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.&quot; </p>

<p>Next Ascension Day is special. It falls within the last tetrad of Total Lunar Eclipses on Feast days for over 800 years. The first eclipse in this tetrad will be on Tue. April 15, 2014, Nisan 15, 5774, the Feast of Unleavened Bread. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hebcal.com/converter/?hd=15&amp;hm=Nisan&amp;hy=5774&amp;h2g=1">http://www.hebcal.com/converter/?hd=15&amp;hm=Nisan&amp;hy=5774&amp;h2g=1</a>
15th of Nisan, 5774 = Tue, 15 April 2014
29th of Iyyar, 5774 = Thu, 29 May 2014 </p>

<p>I am looking for the First-Trump Rapture on Thursday, 29 May, 2014. It looks like Moses and Elijah are to come down as we go up. That makes good sense, because all the saved will come with Christ, get their resurrection bodies, then ascend with those that are to be raptured. Only Moses and Elijah will stay here during the shortened Great Tribulation. </p>

<p>THE LAST-TRUMP RAPTURE </p>

<p>Rev 11:12-15 says, &quot;And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, COME UP HITHER. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 13 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. 14 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. 15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.&quot; </p>

<p>WE WILL BECOME IMMORTAL WHEN THE LAST-TRUMP SAINTS JOIN US IN HEAVEN </p>

<p>1Co 15:51-54 says, &quot;Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point, however you&#39;re ignoring the most important factor.
The Bible is both a reliable historical document and a profoundly unique supernatural manuscript. How many books never contradict themselves? How many short story collections written by 66 different (human) authors are consistent with one other despite being written in four different languages, hundreds of years apart?</p>

<p>Think about it for a moment. Suspend your doubts and let the facts sink in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my hobbies involves studying archeological reports as they are being made available to the public. I can speak about the experiences of scientists who are conducting digs and dig sights with more than a lay person&#39;s authority. So, now I&#39;d like to tell you about the proven track record concerning the geographic accuracy of various Bible accounts.</p>

<p>Over 100 statements from the Bible, once the subject of speculation have been verified by archeologists in the 20th Century alone. My own individual scholarship has uncovered two, which confirm the reliability of the most contentious book outside of the Book of Genesis. The Book of Revelation has the most imagery and the most frightening content for unbelievers, so I&#39;ve been &quot;lucky&quot; enough to discover the validity of two apocalyptic passages printed there. My work has comforted me greatly, because to be a Christian these days, you are required to grow some pretty thick skin.</p>

<p>Again, what is your point? This does not conflict with anything I&#39;ve said. Which one of the 100 verified statements in the bible makes you think there is a being who controls our universe and created it out of thin air?</p>

<p>Conflict, it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t say anything that conflicts; Jesus said He came down to this world to divide family members against one another. Unity is not a societal value, because it stifles out any legitimate dissent and debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;ve just said. Let me give you an example. The City of Dacapilus is mentioned in the Bible. Archeologists etc, looked and looked many years for any sign related to the existence of City of Dacapilus without luck. Secular and antichrist authors boldly announced the Bible was nonsense, because they couldn&#39;t locate any sign, or any ruins of Dacapilus. In the late 80&#39;s early 90&#39;s a group of surveyors stumble over some rocks 10km from where Jesus grew up in the Galilee. Low and behold archeologist find the name of the city is Dacapilus. </p>

<p>A more cynical group of Liberal academic theologians attacked the Gospel of Luke, the physician over what they said are geographic impossibilities. It seems Luke had placed a ruin east of the R. Jordan when they thought it was clearly located west of the river. It takes 30 years of Luke bashing before it was discovered that Luke had it right from the jump. There were two locations that shared the same name.</p>

<p>Anyway, the whole world loves &quot;the Jesus Project&quot; because if this so called Jesus is just a man, they are not required to alter their lives to follow His example of holiness. Just like you, if there&#39;s no God, you don&#39;t have to treat people with charity, mercy and sacrificial love.  </p>

<p>Every single confirmation proves the inherency of God. I know God is real, because of the effect that God has upon people; degenerate, evil people. When they let God in, they are transformed from the bottom up. You&#39;ll have to admit that you&#39;ve met someone at some time in your life that was extra special, set apart and holy. They are rare, but you just sense their state of grace, peace &amp; charity; they just can&#39;t hide it.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t help but respond when you grow closer to the Almighty, He&#39;s God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to let scripture interpret scripture. A search in the Holy Bible generates 13 references for &quot;false prophet, here are the quotes in chronological order below; part 1.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 5:31
the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule at their direction; my people love to have it so, but what will you do when the end comes?</p>

<p>Jeremiah 23:9
[ False Prophets of Hope Denounced ] Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of the Lord and because of his holy words.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 27:15
I have not sent them, says the Lord, but they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.”</p>

<p>Lamentations 2:14
Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions; they have not exposed your iniquity to restore your fortunes, but have seen for you oracles false and misleading.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 13:1
[ False Prophets Condemned ] The word of the Lord came to me:</p>

<p>Ezekiel 22:28
And her prophets have daubed for them with whitewash, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord God,’ when the Lord has not spoken.</p>

<p>Matthew 7:15
[ A Tree and Its Fruit ] “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.</p>

<p>Matthew 24:11
And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.</p>

<p>Matthew 24:24
For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.</p>

<p>Mark 13:22
False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of them testify of both the Bible&#39;s inerrancy and it&#39;s supernatural power that works to change human lives for the better. Did you know the Big Book of AA fame was a copy of the Holy Bible? Until, AA was the subject of lawsuits in our secular and PC world. </p>

<p>Conflict, it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t say anything that conflicts; Jesus said He came down to this world to divide family members against one another. Unity is not a societal value, because it stifles out any legitimate dissent and debate. </p>

<p>Are you familiar with the principle that governs the Earth, the Moon and our Sun to create a world, which is habitable? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;ve just said. Let me give you an example. The City of Dacapilus is mentioned in the Bible. Archeologists etc, looked and looked many years for any sign related to the existence of City of Dacapilus without luck. Secular and antichrist authors boldly announced the Bible was nonsense, because they couldn&#39;t locate any sign, or any ruins of Dacapilus. In the late 80&#39;s early 90&#39;s a group of surveyors stumble over some rocks 10km from where Jesus grew up in the Galilee. Low and behold archeologist find the name of the city is Dacapilus. </p>

<p>A more cynical group of Liberal academic theologians attacked the Gospel of Luke, the physician over what they said are geographic impossibilities. It seems Luke had placed a ruin east of the R. Jordan when they thought it was clearly located west of the river. It takes 30 years of Luke bashing before it was discovered that Luke had it right from the jump. There were two locations that shared the same name.</p>

<p>Anyway, the whole world loves &quot;the Jesus Project&quot; because if this so called Jesus is just a man, they are not required to alter their lives to follow His example of holiness. Just like you, if there&#39;s no God, you don&#39;t have to treat people with charity, mercy and sacrificial love.  </p>

<p>Every single confirmation proves the inherency of God. I know God is real, because of the effect that God has upon people; degenerate, evil people. When they let God in, they are transformed from the bottom up. You&#39;ll have to admit that you&#39;ve met someone at some time in your life that was extra special, set apart and holy. They are rare, but you just sense their state of grace, peace &amp; charity; they just can&#39;t hide it.</p>
