       The idea of the twin towers being an inside job is famous; destroyed by the Americans themselves to justify their own agendas. But why take down a third building, giving it no publicity at all? What was the point?

       It's most commonly speculated that it was brought down to destroy documents or evidence that might be stored there. It's an interesting list of tennents.

       Also possibly used to steal/obfuscate the location of the gold that was stored there.

       But of course, no one really knows for sure.

       Also, it was most likely part &amp; parcel of the entire WTC insurance scam.  Had it been left standing, someone would have probably noticed it was rigged to fall, so they had no choice but to destroy the evidence.

       Evidence, evidence, evidence. Pre-9/11 insider trading. Gold under the building. Documents detailing financial corruption. Documents detailing how the US imploded the Soviet economy in covert economic warfare (edit: this was called "Project Hammer"...look it up!)
      </p>

       I could be way off on this one, but I think there's a very strong possibility that the Shanksville plane was meant for WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though TPTB knew they were going to get away with 9/11, I
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       think they planned on bringing down a 47 story building, what would've been the largest building in
       <em>
        33 states
       </em>
       , without something crashing into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think something went wrong with the Shanksville plane and it was terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, there was
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       too much important shit in WTC7 for them to leave it standing.

       so likely WTC7 was targeted for the SEC and other govt files. WTC4 is the building that most say contained the bullion.

       my evidence is with history and facts. your theory has no substance or facts. you try to connect dots when there is no connection. we have a digital money trail from the middle east to the terrorists in the u. s. we have fight records and boarding passes we have cell phone calls from passengers saying that terrorist have taken over the plane, we have voice recordings of this as well. evidence. you have nothing but thoughts.

       I've heard theories suggesting WTC7 was supposed to have been hit by a plane but things did not go to plan. 
It would make sense since they already had the building rigged to implode. The collapse without the plane was their goof, and our smoking gun.

       I've always been curious why, if $15 million was recently spent on security upgrades on Rudy's "command center, located in #7... why when there was an actual emergency, Rudy never went to his command center and commanded? Instead he chose to parade around outside with a handkerchief over his nose. Fire captains said it made coordinating more difficult because the top decider wasn't in the deciding room.

       They WTC had already been a target and terrorists had already said they would try again... Rudy refused to locate his command center anywhere else but WTC... a silly idea in hindsight. Plus, they're claiming it was all that fuel the center had stored on the roof t use for power that caused the extreme fires.... way to go, Rudy.

       In addition to what is already posted in this thread, I remember a theory that it was the perfect area in which to control everything happening then demolish the evidence. There was a huge security room with all the makings for controlling the planes (if they were drones) and whatnot, then the room and all the documents that were also heard in the building could simply be destroyed.

       The question "why?" is the singular most unanswerable question. We will never truly know why until we hold those guilty accountable. All we know is what we know. That the 9/11 Commission Report is full of lies. That George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, George Tenet, and several other prominent political figures lied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking why, though it can be a interesting thought experiment, is the best way to derail a "conspiracy theory". Debate over motive, or why something had to occur in the way that it did, can never end, and no one can be proven correct or wrong. I don't know why, and frankly, I don't care to know at this moment. What I do know, for a fact, is what we've been told of the events is absolutely untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen people begin to accept the truth, only to be derailed by the question of "why?" Are the people who rule this nation truly evil? Do they wish to see innocent people killed for their own gain? Were they naive pawns (useful idiots) in a grander scheme of global importance? Were they covering up previous discretion? There is no right or wrong answer, at least for now. The most important thing to convince people, rather than try and state why something occurred, is to make sure they understand that it didn't occur the way they've been told.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, it's very interesting when you start connecting the dots.

       If the official story is not true, then IMO the most important targets on 9/11 were building 7 and the section of the Pentagon that was hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 93 bombing the entity that sustained the most damage and loss: the NY office of the Security and Exchange Commission.

      <p>
       In 2001 the newly relocated SEC office suffered a total loss of their data and backups.

       In many ways what truly happened on 9/11 is still very much a mystery to me, I don't have a strong enough understanding of the facts to have formed a conclusion, but I mentioned both building 7 and the Pentagon because it seems logical to follow the money-- what would be gained by eliminating years of SEC data, what would be gained by eliminating an investigation into missing Defense Department funds and who would benefit from this?

       None of the trade center buildings  survived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucky Larry  had a 99 year lease  he got with financing through the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank  at the time, Peter G. Peterson 'In association with' Henry Kissinger. under the auspices of the Blackstone Group.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On April 26 of 2001 the Board of Commissioners for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey awarded Silverstein Properties and mall-owner Westfield America a 99-year-lease on the following assets: The Twin Towers, World Trade Center Buildings 4 and 5, two 9-story office buildings, and 400,000 square feet of retail space.
       </p>
       <p>
        The partners' winning bid was $3.2 billion for holdings estimated to be worth more than $8 billion. JP Morgan Chase, a prestigious investment-bank that's the flagship firm of its kind for Rockefeller family interests, advised the Port Authority, another body long influenced by banker and builder David Rockefeller, his age then 85, in the negotiations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The lead partner and spokesperson for the winning bidders, Larry Silverstein, age 70, already controlled more than 8 million square feet of New York City real estate. WTC 7 and the nearby Equitable Building were prime among these prior holdings. Larry Silverstein also owned Runway 69, a nightclub in Queens that was alleged 9 years ago to be laundering money made through sales of Laotian heroin. 4

       Great points.  A question I have never seen posted is: Why weren't there more fatalities on 9/11?  On average there was 100,000 people that worked at wtc one and two on a daily basis.  I don't mean to sound morbid but I would think there would be significantly more deaths in something so catastrophic.

       except the WTC7 maintance manager guy, the one who escaped from there with another, claims the lobby stairs were blown up with a bomb, bodies everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       yet no fatalities in the official record for WTC7, yet we know that large chunks of plane and/or WTC1 went flying through the air and penetrated WTC7 when the 'plane' hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       if WTC7 was occupied, you would expect a few deaths and some injuries, but we never have heard any reports from the people who were supposedly working at WTC7 on that day, almost like WTC7 was empty at 9am in the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       the WTC7 lobby bomb, as with the other lobby bombs at the various WTC buildings, made it next to impossible for firefighters to get to and fight the fires, that and the underground bombs destruction of the water mains and sprinkler systems.

       You could put that bit down to just publicity-fishing but not using the custom made room in the building across from the disaster zone is just ridiculous.

       They WTC had already been a target and terrorists had already said they would try again... Rudy refused to locate his command center anywhere else but WTC... a silly idea in hindsight. Plus, they're claiming it was all that fuel the center had stored on the roof t use for power that caused the extreme fires.... way to go, Rudy.
