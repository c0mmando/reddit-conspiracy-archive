<p>It absolutely doesn&#39;t, it favours the rule because the rule has promoted better discussions and reduced useless insult disputes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This isn&#39;t about a rule to stop people insulting one another, it is about stopping a rule that is insulting to the community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that&#39;s how you see it then so be it, as far as the rule goes it clearly states about personal attacks against others and these AFAIK are not discussion material at all, they are at best macho fights that just promote drama. </p>

<p><del>Let&#39;s not forget that this rule also prevents that certain outsiders come to this sub to post racist material using alt accounts in order to use it as means to label this subreddit a racist sub.</del> This was wrong as it is related to rule 1, not rule 10.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether the rest of the users want it or not, they aren&#39;t going to change it. This issue comes up multiple times daily. Right now, better than half support a change and I see this happen all the time. What it boils down to is selective enforcement. I was straight up called a shill yesterday, I reported it and guess what. The comment is still there. I have seen an entire thread straight up calling out a dozen members as being shills and guess what. Not only is it still there, a mod participated, acknowledged that it was a violation of the rules, and said he would ignore the rules that time. The mods use this rule against us. Guess what. Me pointing that out is a violation of the rules, according to the mod I am referring to. It&#39;s bullshit. This place isn&#39;t about non-censorship, it&#39;s about stroking the mods ego.</p>

<h2>No doubt that all of those accounts (one user?) will call for this post to be deleted based on rule 10 but they certainly don&#39;t want the rule to apply to them.</h2>

<p>The guy points out that all of these users are new. he then links twice to specific users and then says here&#39;s a hint of what they are and links to the Greenwald story about shills. He implies that all of us are the same person. THE OP HIMSELF even says that he broke the rule by making this post. It doesn&#39;t get much more obvious than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny how the internet is such an amazing communication device for our species and at the same time it can make simple communication next to impossible sometimes. </p>

<p>I would like to say that I would also like to hear from the mods, but sadly, I already know what to expect from them. I had enormous faith in them over these last three years that I&#39;ve been here. When our new mods were elected I was ecstatic about the choices because I thought they were wonderful. Since then I have lost all faith in them. I have been attacked by them countless times. It blows me away that the people that I defended 100% as long as I have been here have treated me the way that they have, but in the end I guess it&#39;s my own fault for having so much faith that these people would be better than people have always shown themselves to be.</p>

<p>The comment calling GoyzIIMensch a shill was never reported (but it has now been removed) in spite of his claim. GoyzIIMensch then made another comment in that thread attacking the mods for not removing a comment that he never reported. Very deceptive.</p>

<p>So yours doesn&#39;t need validation but mine does because you say so. This discussion isn&#39;t biased at all.</p>

<p>As I stated before, it is just my opinion, if you feel that it was unfair or insulting in some way then report it, if not them it would be better to stop trying to make me change my opinion, it&#39;s not going to happen.</p>

<p>Rules are rules and for every rule there will be people that are against it and others that are in favour. So far the voting balance of this thread reveals a neutral result with half for and half against.</p>

<p>Wether you disagree with me or not, or I disagree with you or not, makes no difference. We expressed, we both didn&#39;t provide anything to validate their statements, and we vote. There&#39;s no reason to continue beating this horse.</p>

<p>I am finding fascinating, however that from the 22 votes in this thread, only 3 users are actually commenting. It&#39;s not as if it is possible to request a vote call, create multiple accounts and rig that same vote call in order to earn manipulated acceptance and finally have something worth using against the mods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rule 10 isn&#39;t going to change. It gives the mods much more power to control the content of this sub and to punish users as they see fit. I have posted undeniable proof of being attacked by a mod, regular users showed up and supported me and in the end the mod pretended like he was in the right. I have seen entire posts that were direct violation of rule 10 and the same mod participated in the thread and never mentioned the fact that the thread itself was a blatant violation of rule 10. In that case, said user was agreeing with the mod. When I pointed out what was going on the mod said he was going to make an exception that one time and allow the rule to be broken. When other users pointed out the hypocrisy of that, he agreed and did it anyway.  I&#39;ve been here in this sub for almost 3 years now and can honestly say that I have watched it be turned into a joke. I completely regret voting for and supporting these new mods as fiercely as I did, because I am now quite sure that they have an agenda. For a sub that is always against the banning of certain crap websites because it&#39;s censorship it seems strange that they are all for the censoring of words. I don&#39;t understand when we have stories acknowledging that there are trolls all over the internet, yet we have rules saying we can&#39;t call it like it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I saw that.</p>

<p>All Rules, aside from Rule One, are superfluous, that is to say, unneeded and unwanted, serving only to strengthen censorship.</p>
