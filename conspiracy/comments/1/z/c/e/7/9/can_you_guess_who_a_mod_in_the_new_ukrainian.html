<ul>

<li><p>why do we automatically assume Snowdens a hero? </p></li>

<p>-you should be x/posting good links here to the main subs.. e.g <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1z9pnq/fbi_cia_lied_to_911_commission_on_bin_laden_ties/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1z9pnq/fbi_cia_lied_to_911_commission_on_bin_laden_ties/</a></p>

<p>final edit: check out <a href="/r/LimitedHangouts">/r/LimitedHangouts</a> .. don&#39;t just believe Glenn greenwald&#39;s reporting because you think he&#39;s a pain to TPTB. <strong>SNOWDEN--&gt;GREENWALD--&gt;BILLIONAIRE</strong> .. and.. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> keeps his article stickied for 6+days.. why?</p>

<p>to open your mind to the possibility that snowden might just not be who you think he is</p>

<p><strong>if he&#39;s on the front page of the new york times, he&#39;s not revolutionary</strong></p>

<p>if you dont know what <strong>LIMITED HANGOUTS</strong> are.. heres the definition</p>

<p>Limited Hangout = A limited hangout, or partial hangout, is a public relations or propaganda technique that involves the release of previously hidden information in order to prevent a greater exposure of more important details.
It takes the form of deception, misdirection, or coverup often associated with intelligence agencies involving a release or &quot;mea culpa&quot; type of confession of only part of a set of previously hidden sensitive information, that establishes credibility for the one releasing the information who by the very act of confession appears to be &quot;coming clean&quot; and acting with integrity; but in actuality, by withholding key facts, is protecting a deeper operation and those who could be exposed if the whole truth came out. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>How long is Greenwald&#39;s article going to be stickied? so its saying shills exist (no duh), but now new rule 10 we can&#39;t call them on it? yeah, the major subs are &quot;controlled&quot;.. but so is this one. whose <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a> , what do they do here?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For the &quot;definition&quot; of what a &quot;limited hangout&quot; is, see the sidebar and posts in this sub. </p></li>
<li><p>There are not a lot of new articles on &quot;limited hangouts&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>To aid in fully understanding &quot;limited hangouts&quot;, read/listen to Naomi Wolf and Webster Tarpley. These two should spark some thought and you can take care of the rest</p></li>

</ul>

<p><em>you</em> should know who <strong>OMIDYAR</strong> is, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Omidyar, the son of Iranian exiles, certainly has had some highly suspicious business associates at Paypal. Here are a few of the most influential of Omidyar’s Paypal colleagues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Max Levchin, a co-founder of Paypal, has openly stated his support for NSA spying on Americans. Alex Karp used the Paypal framework to start Palantir, the most important company providing spying technology to the NSA. Palantir’s advisors include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet. The word Palantir refers to the seeing stones used primarily by the dark lord Sauron in The Lord of the Rings novels. From 2005 to 2008 the CIA was Palantir’s patron and only customer. Peter Thiel has some interesting right-wing connections. Thiel started his career working for the CIA-linked law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and then Credit Suisse Group. In 2009, Thiel said, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,”</p>

<p><strong>Here is an example of a shill talking about why you should fully trust them</strong>: &quot;It seems the people supporting this ridiculous idea are people who <strong>haven&#39;t fully read the documents</strong>, or they do <strong>not understand the implications of said revelations</strong>&quot; </p>

<p><strong>How someone was convinced Snowden/Greenwald is limited hangout</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I call it &quot;the limited hangout theory&quot; for its overarching explanation, but its more like the leading hypothesis because of the minimal information that we have been exposed to. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been sitting on the fence for a while now, honestly trying to view this situation without any bias and hoping for future &quot;revelations&quot; to convince me that Snowden was a genuine whistle-blower (because the leaks kept showing up periodically). Prominent people that made me curious about the &quot;limited hangout&quot; idea were Webster Tarpley and Naomi wolf:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/06/18/309609/how-to-identify-cia-limited-hangout-op/">Tarpley&#39;s article</a></p>

<p><a href="http://naomiwolf.org/2013/06/my-creeping-concern-that-the-nsa-leaker-is-not-who-he-purports-to-be/">Wolf</a> </p>

<p>And <a href="http://publicconspiracy.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/rconspiracy-links-for-snowden-limited-hangout-op/">here&#39;s</a> a collection worth mentioning of other bloggers that someone gathered. (Edit: seems to be <a href="/u/ObeyTheCowGod">/u/ObeyTheCowGod</a>. Thanks for the links).</p>

<p>Their biggest argument was that we have only seen garbage revelations heretofore, which benefited the NSA and not the other way around. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t entirely convinced, so I looked into it. The best timeline of the &quot;leaks&quot; I&#39;ve found is <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/multimedia/timeline-edward-snowden-revelations.html">Al Jazeera&#39;s</a>. I don&#39;t think you need to doubt its validity, since it&#39;s a collection of mainstream articles anyway. </p>

<p>You can follow the timeline for yourself, and you would find that the most incriminating article is from <a href="http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/10/ministerio-das-minas-e-energia-esta-na-mira-de-espioes-americanos-e-canadenses.html">Globo</a> that showed how companies in Brazil were being spied on. The big catch? It&#39;s the only leak showing that it was perpetrated by the Canadian intelligence agency, not the NSA (besides monitoring Canadian citizens in airports). There is another one that tells us the NSA <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/how-the-nsa-and-gchq-spied-on-opec-a-932777.html">spied on OPEC</a>, a collection of <a href="http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/25.htm">Arab countries and Venezuela</a>, most of which have had their sovereignty compromised anyway. A worthless leak. Spying on Iraq is supposed to be big news after the entire country has been leveled to the ground?</p>

<p>Those who doubt the Snowden charade also say that the NSA&#39;s main motive is to make people aware of the fact that they&#39;re being monitored. Sort of like sending a clear message of &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot;. The diplomatic leaks fall under this category as well, but they also imply a serious threat to the nations&#39; autonomy, like intercepting the calls of Germany&#39;s Merkel. Nothing came of it, but people are now a tiny bit more accustomed to the idea of a one world government.</p>

<p>Besides these leaks, it&#39;s all garbage. Many were waiting for anything on 9/11, but all they got was that the NSA was pushing its spokespeople to promote the official 9/11 narrative, in order to <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/30/revealed-nsa-pushed911askeysoundbitetojustifysurveillance.html">to justify the program</a>. An idea so prevalent in society that it&#39;s used as satire in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOh-rpvjYg&amp;amp;t=0m46s">cartoons</a>. </p>

<p>Some articles are even used as a mouthpiece for the NSA, like how <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-documents-detail-al-qaedas-efforts-to-fight-back-against-drones/2013/09/03/b83e7654-11c0-11e3-b630-36617ca6640f_story.html">&quot;Al Qaeda&quot; are trying to hijack the drones</a>. You should also know by now that anyone even using the words &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; is full of shit.</p>

<p>The spark that lit the fuse for me was the leak released today: <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/02/18/snowden-docs-reveal-covert-surveillance-and-pressure-tactics-aimed-at-wikileaks-and-its-supporters/">Wikileaks and other activist groups being monitored</a>, which by the way was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1y86j0/glenn_greenwald_topsecret_documents_from_the/">top post</a> in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> a while ago. The article clearly shows how the NSA was <strong>only</strong> targeting foreign activists like Anonymous. An organization that doesn&#39;t include domestic activists, as we all know. My BS-detector went haywire after that, which made me write this post. (Tarpley mentions Wikileaks as another limited hangout operation, which I&#39;m undecided about).</p>

<p>Another argument for it is that Snowden has received a lot of attention from the MSM. This only hints to him being controlled, it&#39;s not proof. But it still makes you consider why.</p>

<p>Does it mean that Greenwald is part of it as well? I have no idea. There is a possibility that he naively releases the leaks without being compromised. That&#39;s for you to decide, and I would love to hear your opinion on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly relevant?</p>

<p>Haaretz:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.577114"><strong>The ex-Israeli soldier who led a Kiev fighting unit</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Delta, who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s, moved back to Ukraine several years ago and has worked as a businessman. He says he joined the protest movement as a volunteer on November 30, after witnessing violence by government forces against student protesters. </p>

<p>“I saw unarmed civilians with no military background being ground by a well-oiled military machine, and it made my blood boil,” Delta told JTA in Hebrew laced with military jargon. “I joined them then and there, and I started fighting back the way I learned how, through urban warfare maneuvers. People followed, and I found myself heading a platoon of young men. Kids, really.”</p>

<p>The other ex-IDF infantrymen joined the Blue Helmets later after hearing it was led by a fellow vet, Delta said. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like Israeli interests are being well represented in the Ukraine, and this might help to explain BPB&#39;s interest in molding public opinion on the matter.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM:</p>

<p>Why might the Israelis have an interest in the unfolding events in the Ukraine? One thought that comes to mind is last summer&#39;s standoff between Israeli/US and Putin over Syria following the chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds near Damascus.</p>

<p>Netanyahu was first out of the gates to charge Assad with the attack and to demand that the US &quot;punish&quot; Assad with a direct assault. Obama, Kerry and a number of US politician were quick to join in the chorus, and the US soon had a fleet of ships off the coast, bristling to launch an attack. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, information soon came to light that <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Syrian-rebel-forces-trained-by-West-are-moving-towards-Damascus-324033"><strong>cast serious doubts</strong></a> on whether Assad had in fact launched the attack, and evidence emerged that may have been perpetrated as a &quot;false flag&quot; by forces who sought to see Assad deposed. </p>

<p>Much of the evidence casting doubt on US/Israeli claims against Assad came from <strong>Russia</strong>, and the &quot;usual allies&quot; such as Britain soon got cold feet, as did the American public, and before long Israel and Obama were faced with prosecuting a campaign based on specious &quot;evidence&quot;, and with the support of virtually no one aside from a handful of AIPAC-friendly US politicians (oh, and France, but they don&#39;t really count. lol!).</p>

<p>At this point Putin&#39;s government proposed a compromise to the standoff that would allow Obama and Netanyahu to (partially) save face: In spite of denying responsibility for the attacks, Assad agreed to surrender all chemical weapons to &quot;neutral&quot; international bodies, and in return, the US would not attack Assad.</p>

<p>The US had little choice but to agree, and this was of course a major slap in the face for Israel, who had hoped to draw the US into the fight against Syria - Israel&#39;s long-time enemy and close ally of the super-villain Iran.</p>

<p>Of course there are many factors at play in the &quot;Ukrainian Revolution&quot; (oil, natural gas, regional politics, etc), but given the <strong>anti-Russian propaganda blitz</strong> that we witnessed during the Olympics, there is an overriding stench of vindictiveness on the part of US and Israeli interests that seems to permeate the whole affair.</p>

<p>To me, it would seem foolish to discount the possibility that Russia - who is friendly to both Iran and Syria - is not specifically being targeted by the propaganda machine and by political skulduggery - to demonize and weaken Putin, thereby preventing Russia from effectively mucking up USraels plans in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Just a hunch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you 100%.  It is very important to refer to &#39;Zionists&#39; and not &#39;Jews&#39; when exposing their frauds.  Using the word JEW does indeed sound anti-semite because one cannot be sure if the person is refering to the entire race in general.  Unfortunately, when we hear stories of bankers and conspiracies ... there are often references to the &#39;Jewish&#39; elite.</p>

<p>Many Zionists are not Jewish, and many of those that claim to be are not &#39;true&#39; Jews. Refering to these chacals as Jews give them a title they do not deserve, and of course allows them to hide (as always) under the false cover of racism.</p>

<p>Zionism is a disease, a mass delusion  and one does not pin a disease on a specific race. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a heads up for anyone not already aware - neither <a href="/u/LimitedHangouts">/u/LimitedHangouts</a> nor his sub of the same name existed before the latest Greenwald piece.</p>

<p>Snowden has been in Russia for months now, and this theory of a limited hang out has been floating around since the first link. </p>

<p>Only when the activities of JTRIG were exposed did u/LimitedHangouts decide to make the account and the sub.  He&#39;s been spamming <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with links to his sub and pushing his point of view as hard as possible ever since. </p>

<p>Considering the timing and his sudden dedication to this goal, I&#39;ve found it hard to see this account as genuine in it&#39;s intents and purposes.  </p>

<p>Again, Greenwald released the article on Feb. 24.  Six days ago.  Now please look at the age of <a href="/u/LimitedHangouts">/u/LimitedHangouts</a>.  Also six days old.  </p>

<p>To clarify, this isn&#39;t an attack, just an observation of surprising coincidence and stunning dedication over the past week.  </p>

<p>I would encourage everyone to look into this account and it&#39;s intentions here, and to come to their own conclusion.  What happened six days ago that made this person so vocal and dedicated to casting doubt on Snowden and Greenwald?  </p>

<p>Could this be an attempt at the exact same type of character assassination that Greenwald was talking about in his latest article?  </p>

<p>Who would benefit if we all stopped trusting these leaks?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we&#39;ve long known the stories and the claims of whistle blowers saying much the same things that Snowden is - which is a strong argument for his sincerity in the leaks.  These previous whistle blowers were ridiculed and marginalized without mercy by those in power, so few people listened to them.  </p>

<p>Now, Snowden comes out with the proof of these actions and, in doing so, redeems the first person who was brave enough to tell us these things.  </p>

<p>It seems to me that the very notion of granting credibility to these conspiracies, which were long held to be laughable, would be the very last thing that a limited hangout would want to do.</p>

<p>We <em>knew</em> all of these things, but who among us could prove it before now?  </p>

<p>What do you believe would be the point in admitting and providing proof to the whole world of all the nasty little things that we&#39;ve long thought to be true?  </p>

<p>So far, I only see the Snowden leaks encouraging more and more people to ask questions about what those in power are actually up to.  I fail to see this as a bad thing.  </p>

<p>These leaks have given the conspiracy theorists a huge opportunity.  Suddenly the world is having a hard time laughing us off, it&#39;s becoming easier for everyone to question the official story of events. </p>

<p>The government that spent decades turning conspiracy theorists into a joke certainly does not want <em>even more</em> people asking questions. </p>

<p>Limited hangouts are specifically for keeping the bulk of the story safe from questions.  Think of it as cutting off the arm (the limited hangout) in order to keep the body safe (secret).  </p>

<p>What then, would you propose the real &#39;body&#39; of this story to be?  </p>

<p>See, to me, if this were a limited hangout then the obvious conclusion to be drawn would be that there is much bigger and far more sinister truths being concealed.  Yet I do not see you looking for the story hidden behind the hangout.  </p>

<p>I only see you trying to cast doubt on the sources of these leaks, a tiresome go to utilized most often when the argument presented is too strong to be attacked directly.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a bit of investigation and found that Snowden enlisted in the Special forces in 2004. He was discharged after four months due to breaking his legs. It was said he received no training, but I looked online at the 18x special recruit training and they go through a super rigorous 3 month training before doing airborne (parachute) training whichperfectly accounts for the 2 broken legs and his subsequent discharge (if there even was one)
Why do I bring this up? Because special forces units are used in unconventional warfare , information operations, and psychological warfare.. Also it&#39;s stated Snowden worked in Japan on a US base(Haven&#39;t found a source for actual city so this may be a stretch) but The special forces first group is stationed in okinawa Source[1]
Now honestly I don&#39;t believe this is all part of some huge cover up. for something aimed at the American public. It&#39;s most probable that Snowden is working with our intelligence agencies to give disinformation out to our political enemies. Maybe he went to Russia with some already pre-made stuff in his briefcase we knew the russians would get a hold of eventually .
Counter intellligence at it&#39;s finest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post, one must wonder why in a country so controlled by media, Snowden seems immune from censorship.</p>

<p>Of course people will argue that the Snowden stuff is coming through because &quot;the people want it&quot;, etc...</p>

<p>But I personally believe the media control is much complex than that and one must question why Snowden and crew have been, very deliberately, pushed into the public consciousness.</p>

<p>Because nothing they have &quot;leaked&quot; is that revolutionary. Not really. Just confirmations on things that most of us assumed people were smart enough to figure out on their own without having to be told.</p>

<p>Am I glad the general public now understands more about reality, yes. Have I actually learned anything shocking or new from Snowden and Greenwald?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<li>grounding of morale&#39;s plane.. sets a precedent that america can do that type of thing (definitely illegal), and it makes the world seem like usa is so desperate to catch him</li>
</ul>

<p>but..</p>

<p>keep an open mind</p>

<p>remember... a billionaire is financing greenwald now</p>

<p>But unless they reveal something epic, very soon, I will always be skeptical.</p>

<p>I was thinking, Greenwald now has an organization with instant &quot;street-cred&quot;. Which in today&#39;s digital world, can go a long way since the common idea is not to trust a source as far as you can throw it.</p>

<p>Cue the emergence of <em>The Intercept</em> as a &quot;proven&quot; source that will seemingly give it to you straight, despite what the governments of the world want.</p>

<p>But is everything as it seems?</p>

<p>Hard to tell at this point. Very hard to tell.</p>

<p>That being said there is obviously a huge pro-Ukrainian bias and probably is not the most objective source either. So what I would suggest is to get a brief overview go to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> or <a href="/r/ukrainianconflict">/r/ukrainianconflict</a> (while I dislike most of the posts and comments in the actual subreddit, the live feed they have is actually quite good), but to get a Ukrainian perspective go to <a href="/r/ukraine">/r/ukraine</a> and really compare both sides and make a decision for yourself. Try to get material that comes from the protestors and not reinterpretations from mainstream media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately my view point wouldn&#39;t be the best source (I live in London) and I get most of my news from my family still in Donesk and Lviv. </p>

<p>What I can say though is <a href="/r/ukrainianconflict">/r/ukrainianconflict</a> and the mainstream media are playing out this &quot;east v west&quot; &quot;bring of war&quot; nonsense way too much. Yes tensions are tight but I do not think this will come to open war, nor do I think that Crimea will secede or be annexed with Russia. The Crimeans&#39; have always made their opinion clear on what they consider themselves. Keep in mind while most ethnical Russians and pro-Russians are being vocal, they all realize they will not have the same liberties and freedoms in Russia as they have in Ukraine. Not to mention they all consider themselves Ukrainian citizens. The only people wanting to separate are the older generation who are mostly ex-military, ex-kgb etc etc. </p>

<p>As I posted below, this is the best summary of my view points and if you want to get a quick understanding of what is actually going on (this guy also is a lot more coherent than my ramblings): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ0N95qGsyo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ0N95qGsyo</a></p>

<p>The Yugoslavian conflict was more like &#39;Christians vs Muslims, when in reality it was the Serbians fighting out the Bosniaks and Croats.</p>

<p>The Syrian Civil War however tells us how it is all &#39;Shi&#39;a vs Sunni&#39;, when in reality this notion doesn&#39;t even come close due to an infinate amount of factors and battalions involved.</p>

<p>Similarly, this particular conflict is labelled &#39;East vs West&#39;, just to get better ratings, it is more about getting the most viewers than informing people.  </p>

<p>There is no difference between Bosniak and Muslim in the context you give (or between Serbian and Orthodox, Croatian and Catholic). It&#39;s difficult to understand if you&#39;re not from there, but they are the same people speaking the same language, divided during various times in history by politics.</p>

<p>What the hell has <a href="/u/BipolarBear0">/u/BipolarBear0</a> got to do with Ukriane? I could almost understand him being a mod because maybe he has good moderator skills, but actually being an approved submitter to the live news feed? He isn&#39;t there on the ground with anything new to add! He isn&#39;t even Ukrainian!</p>

<p>Since &quot;he&quot; is moderator on 75+ subs (<a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1z4c85/rworldnews_moderator_bipolarbear0_was_previously/cfqk73g">partial list</a>), it&#39;s pretty clear the account is handled by a team at an agency. I just doubt it&#39;s a PR agency. More likely a psyops / propaganda team at an intelligence agency, see <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">JTRIG</a>.</p>

<p>Also note that reddit admins don&#39;t bother to do anything about &quot;him&quot;. &quot;He&quot; isn&#39;t even forced to change accounts. That tells you everything you need to know about reddit. It&#39;s one huge psyops tool, controlled by the usual suspects. It&#39;s fine to use it to look at pictures of cats. Anything related to news, politics, or history is firmly in hand and steered / discredited as necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>K so I&#39;m gonna break this down one more time: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bbear has things called &quot;friends&quot;, and &quot;friends&quot; will help each other out when shit hits the fan. When I&#39;ve hit similar straights my homeboys back me up all the same. </p></li>
<li><p>My previous account was Mallardlyupset, and I freely admit that I have many alt accounts. Bbear says often that he doesn&#39;t do alt accounts. </p></li>
<li><p>My posting history is vastly different than bbear&#39;s mostly because I don&#39;t care about news or politics on reddit and mostly stick to my personal subreddit or gaming/ drama subs. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s easy to get confused sometimes, that someone shows compassion and care for another person. I know you folks here have difficulty with that, what with lacking human emotion and connections. </p>

<p>I dunno, man. Seems to me if he was a real paid professional shill it would be easy to just have him &#39;step down&#39; and resume activities under different accounts (probably with a less visible role and a little docked pay for giving too much away and causing a ruckus).</p>

<p>Seems more likely to me that he gets away with this objectionable behaviour because at the end of the day removing him would cause the admins more headaches than letting him continue. I mean who would you rather have coming at you, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or BPB&#39;s entire hate brigade?</p>

<p>That&#39;s two accounts plus one potential sock puppet so if one gets banned, they are still in control. And you can see what they did in <a href="http://pastebin.com/LTdMza13">this letter from one of the former organisers, /u/RTFMicheal.</a> BPB was all nice and helpful and then when DouglasMacathar shown up, he started to execute the plan to escalate his position into the group demanding access and passwords, threatening people, never revealing his identity, changing passwords and demanding they take money from people without explaining what it would be used for.</p>

<p>The only people that would do this in a protest movement are trouble and I saw other people saying that they made the movement passive, ineffective and mis-managed it. And that&#39;s what it was for, so it never took off. Who sabotages a protest movement?</p>

<p>More here including a threat by an alt at <a href="/u/KingContext">/u/KingContext</a>. Really? So you get threatened for discussing this? It seems to go against the idea that there is nothing to it.</p>

<p>Many of the Pro-Russian side were paid to be there, or are actually from Moscow sent there as provocateurs. Many of them are what are known as titushki. Search Youtube, there are plenty of videos in Ukrainian/Russian which are translated that show them admitting to being paid. </p>

<p>And to answer your question, no I am not aware of any Maidan protesters being paid to be there. Its an on-going joke where people ask &quot;how much have you been paid&quot; since the Russian media continuously accuses the people of being there because of US involvement. </p>

<p>Anyone that is following Ukrainian politics longer than 5 days could tell you about who will come into power, this isn&#39;t a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this part of Optors playbook</p>

<p>Optor was part of the 2004 Ukraine color revolution which was organized and funded by US NGOS? </p>

<strong>Colour Revolutions in Georgia (the Rose Revolution in 2003), In all of them the West has played a key role by financing local NGO&#39;s and student movements, all of which helped to organize the revolutions. The main sources of Western financial support were the United States and the GeorgeSoros Foundation. Through Western NGO&#39;s and USAID etc. these funds were distributed to the local opposition organizations and student movements.</strong></p>

Also, from what I have read, Crimea is the bit of land they want back because circa 60% of the population are Russian heritage and the Russians have a big tactical naval base in Sevastopol.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok Ill clarify. </p>

<p>In KIEV: Pro-russian protestors are paid by the Russian government. Many were brought to Kiev from Russia/Eastern Ukraine and paid to cause problems and discredit the Pro-Eu Pro-Western movements. </p>

<p>In Crimea: Most of the Pro-Russian protestors are ex-berkyut, ex military, old school Russians and Russian Provocateurs (They guy who took down the Ukrainian flag in Crimea is from Moscow for fuck sake) I&#39;ve said this before, yes the majority are Ethnically Russian, but the majority of Crimeans do NOT want to re-join Russia. People at the protests on TV only represent a loud minority of the region (not to mention only the Urban population) </p>

<p>Putin does NOT want to take over Crimea. He wants to discredit the current Ukrainian government. Remember Crimea is already essentially Russia&#39;s puppet state. </p>

<p>Honestly at this point though, I think Klitschko has the best shot at coming into power. Despite his recent critics he still has a following and he is the one with the most ambition to get the position. </p>

<p>Ukraine will not be split east and west. As I have said before, this division is highly superficial and an oversimplification. Which is exactly why you should stay away from Youtube and mainstream media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not here to defend US politics or foreign policy so I have no comment on that if you are referring to Syria. If you are referring to US involvement with the protests, I can assure you that is not the case. Ukrainians are sick and tired of having a corrupt, gangster government in charge of our country who has stolen 70 billion dollars over three years from the treasury. If the US was involved (which I deny and require a high burden of proof to support this claim), I would like to see where the money went, especially since hospitals and reconstruction in Kiev is in dire need of finance and I have not spoken to a single protester who has made money off of this protest. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>How does this benefit Israel in anyway? Most Jewish leaders have condemned Ukrainian nationalists... </p>

<p>Quite frankly if you think this, you don&#39;t know very much about Ukrainian history and Ukrainian Russian relations. Ukrainians want to be more European, it was a very obvious response that they would protest if Yanik made a deal with Putin.</p>

<p>I agree, the US government doesn&#39;t really care about Ukraine (mind you I spoke with a Marine here on reddit and he and Im sure other US citizens genuinely want to protect Ukraine) and obviously this is a proxy war between Russia and the US. But that does not mean that the US is funding this protest. </p>

<p>EDIT: Even if he was paid off the politicians have played such a minute role in this protest. Most protestors don&#39;t even support any politician or political party. This is a grassroots revolt this is nothing like the orange revolution. </p>

<p>I am sure there are some who had an idea of leadership, but that being said the majority of protestors are distrustful of ANY politician and for good reason. This in my opinion is going to be a problem going forward. There is a lack of direction going forward after the protest and there isn&#39;t really a political leader in the forefront. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t see how this would support this idea. If anything its the opposite considering the general distrust of any politician.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make the mistake of thinking the people of Ukraine are in power right now and overthrowing their government was for them. It wasn&#39;t for the people of Ukraine, the reason the government was overthrown was for the transport of natural resources to Europe, just like Syria (through Turkey and into Europe). Putin made Obama look like a fool for that. Now &quot;The West&quot; or NATO ex-Russia and China, is going after Ukraine. This is and never has been about the people of Ukraine, the protestors on both sides (Pro-EU and Pro-Russia) have been duped and the people of Ukraine will ultimately suffer in either case. It&#39;s important to remember that Putin doesn&#39;t want all of Ukraine, just strategic portions. </p>

<p>Nope, I never once said this once. Power is in transition now. Even the temporary government does not have power. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#39;t for the people of Ukraine, the reason the government was overthrown was for the transport of natural resources to Europe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um I beg to differ. This was entirely about the overthrowing of a corrupt government. If you have anything to support this claim, I would suggest you present it. Yes EU would benefit from a pro EU government, but that in no way means that they a. instigated it or b. was the primary reason the government fell. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is and never has been about the people of Ukraine</p>

<p>Yes it is, it is about having a functioning government in the country. There are obvious consequences to this protest and obviously benefits to third parties, but you can&#39;t claim these assertions unless you actually have proof. Especially when, no offense, you are behind a keyboard in the United States. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Putin made Obama look like a fool for that</p>

<p>And Putin will be made to look like a fool when the dust settles in this situation. </p>

<p>I agree that at the end of the day Ukraine will suffer. But what are we to do? Sit back and let our ganster government control the country? Hardly. That has never been the Ukrainian way. Look at our history, we always revolt. </p>

The numbers on this site are huge. <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> has got 2.3 million subscribers for example. Some news stations on TV would be lucky to get that kind of exposure. It&#39;s the reason why you see posts about McDonalds and Coke or people giving away free XBox Live in huge quantities. Free advertising and reach to a lot of people.</p>

<p>If you censor news or anything else, then those people are having their perception of the world narrowed into how the mods want it. It doesn&#39;t effect everyone but then you can say that for the regular TV news as well.</p>

<p>This is the only thing I feel the need to refute, its a default subreddit, all new accounts are auto-subscribed to it.  The actual uniques per day is much much lower, about 10% of total subscribers.  For reference, Fox pulls in well over a million per day and MSNBC over 350K.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point but the fact still remains that the people subscribed have the potential to be a regular visitor and they will pull in higher numbers when big stories break. I remember the mods making jokes at people when they banned RT and basically laughed in peoples faces and changed the banner mocking people who had questions about it.</p>

<p>Honestly at this point though, I think Klitschko has the best shot at coming into power. Despite his recent critics he still has a following and he is the one with the most ambition to get the position. </p>

<p>Ukraine will not be split east and west. As I have said before, this division is highly superficial and an oversimplification. Which is exactly why you should stay away from Youtube and mainstream media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not here to defend US politics or foreign policy so I have no comment on that if you are referring to Syria. If you are referring to US involvement with the protests, I can assure you that is not the case. Ukrainians are sick and tired of having a corrupt, gangster government in charge of our country who has stolen 70 billion dollars over three years from the treasury. If the US was involved (which I deny and require a high burden of proof to support this claim), I would like to see where the money went, especially since hospitals and reconstruction in Kiev is in dire need of finance and I have not spoken to a single protester who has made money off of this protest. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This has CIA and Israeli meddling written all over it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does this benefit Israel in anyway? Most Jewish leaders have condemned Ukrainian nationalists... </p>

<p>Quite frankly if you think this, you don&#39;t know very much about Ukrainian history and Ukrainian Russian relations. Ukrainians want to be more European, it was a very obvious response that they would protest if Yanik made a deal with Putin.</p>

<p>I agree, the US government doesn&#39;t really care about Ukraine (mind you I spoke with a Marine here on reddit and he and Im sure other US citizens genuinely want to protect Ukraine) and obviously this is a proxy war between Russia and the US. But that does not mean that the US is funding this protest. </p>
