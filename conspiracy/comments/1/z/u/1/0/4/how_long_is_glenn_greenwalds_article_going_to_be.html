       So were supposed to believe everything Glenn Greenwald says about Snowden's leaks? Snowden gave all of his 'stuff' to Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras (if you don't know who poitras is, you don't know much about Snowden). Naturally, we have to be skeptical about this. Ask questions, trust nothing 100%

        Limited Hangout: A limited hangout, or partial hangout, is a public relations or propaganda technique that involves the release of previously hidden information in order to prevent a greater exposure of more important details.
It takes the form of deception, misdirection, or coverup often associated with intelligence agencies involving a release or "mea culpa" type of confession of only part of a set of previously hidden sensitive information, that establishes credibility for the one releasing the information who by the very act of confession appears to be "coming clean" and acting with integrity; but in actuality, by withholding key facts, is protecting a deeper operation and those who could be exposed if the whole truth came out. In effect, if an array of offenses or misdeeds is suspected, this confession admits to a lesser offense while covering up the greater ones.
A limited hangout typically is a response to lower the pressure felt from inquisitive investigators pursuing clues that threaten to expose everything, and the disclosure is often combined with red herrings or propaganda elements that lead to false trails, distractions, or ideological disinformation; thus allowing covert or criminal elements to continue in their improper activities.

       I have a ton of respect for Binney and Drake. They are great whistleblowers who acted very heroically.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, they revealed far less information than Snowden has, and they provided no proof whatsoever of their allegations. That's why it was easy for the state and the media to marginalize them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Binney and Drake didn't talk about the NSA blackmailing dissidents over their porn habits, like Snowden and Greenwald revealed. They didn't talk about the NSA infiltration of organizations and social media on the internet, and spreading disninfo, working to discredit people etc. They didn't talk about how JSOC and the CIA are using NSA metadata to send drone strikes at PHONES not even knowing who is there.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may have suspected the NSA was doing this before (pretty much everyone here probably did) but there was no proof until Greenwald/Snowden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden/Greenwald have revealed a lot, and I absolutely think most of the people calling them limited hangouts haven't actually read all the stories and documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without question the state uses limited hangouts all the time, frankly however, there is nothing limited about these revelations.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If its on the front page of the New York Times or the Washington Post, its not revolutionary"
      </p>
      <p>
       makes no sense. MKULTRA was first revealed in the NYtimes. Pentagon papers were first published in NYtimes. CIA blacksites and torture under Bush was first exposed in WAPO by Dana Priest. James Risen at NYtimes wrote about NSA installing narus devices at AT&amp;T to collect all their traffic (though NYtimes cowardly sat on the story for over a year, to your point)
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely there are lots of problems with Wapo and NYtimes and the rest of the mainstream media, but there are a (very) small number of incredible journalists working for those publications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a (still incomplete) list of some of the Snowden revelations

       I think the important thing is keeping your mind open to possibilities, at least that's how I look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true that Snowden and Greenwald have revealed some amazing stuff, and perhaps there is still a shred of credibility left with major publications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is to hold and consider two seperate points of view or scenarios at the same time.  Consider all possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       The entire point of a limited hangout is that you will never know what's NOT being revealed because you are intentionally being "sated" with enough juicy, authentic details.

When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting—sometimes even volunteering—some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and damaging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further."

       all that, with more stories coming every week, in order to cover up some other heinous activities? Because I have to tell you, I don't think that makes any sense at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Do you think Wikileaks is also a limited hangout? Was John D. Marks book on MKULTA a limited hangout also? Alfred W. McCoy? Gary Webb? Hastings? Seymour Hesh? Watergate? I'd love to know where you draw the line between courageous journalists and whistleblowers and nefarious limited hangout?

       Note:  I'm being told that my reply is too long by the bot.  I'll split it into two or more parts.  This is part 1.

      <p>
       Thanks for the opportunity to clarify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your "EDIT" questions first, to briefly get them out of the way:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Was John D. Marks book on MKULTA a limited hangout also? (sic)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In fact:
       <a href="http://speedydeletion.wikia.com/wiki/Operation_Dormouse">
        Operation DORMOUSE
       </a>
       was launched by the CIA to make MKULTRA a limited hangout, yes, for the much more damaging Operation ARTICHOKE.  This doesn't necessarily reflect on the Marks book itself, but the operation, bad as it was, wasn't the Full Monty.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Alfred W. McCoy? Gary Webb? Hastings? Seymour Hesh? (sic)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The notorious fascist CIA legend
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jesus_Angleton">
        James Jesus Angleton
       </a>
       was famous for a quote that
       <em>
        reality is a "wilderness of mirrors"
       </em>
       .  What Angleton meant was that "direct proof" means almost nothing and can be staged; "
       <em>
        indirect proof
       </em>
       " such as that identified via secondary evidence and "mirrors" often offers more authentic forensic evidence about the nature of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, nobody is to be trusted except through a thorough vetting using indirect authentication -- and even then, within the intelligence world, the CIA classifies their own patsies as "Witting Accomplices" and "Unwitting Accomplices".
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, all of these names are left open to personal &amp; subjective interpretation.  I personally value &amp; trust each of the names you've listed here as vitally important.  But I have my own system of determining trust; I always leave room for doubt; and, in a serious analysis, trust can be partial; sometimes accomplices are unwitting and unaware of poisoned information they've been given.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets complicated.  With everybody.
      </p>

       Our judgement of where to "draw the line" on each person will vary.  My personal opinion is that anti-fascism is paramount; does each person's information/actions enable fascism, or hinder it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes that answer requires a broader scope of vision -- for example:  sometimes a president, such as Obama, can appear to be anti-fascist &amp; pro-democracy in his words and occasionally his deeds, but at key points (banking reform, intelligence community reform), he "accidentally" drops the ball.   What does gay marriage matter, if he let the Operation Paperclip Nazis in the CIA get drones &amp; warrantless wiretapping &amp; unhindered freedom to stage banking meltdowns?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes red flags appear &amp; questions arise for a person who seemingly, ostensibly, is a reformer or a crusader or whistleblower.
      </p>
      <p>
       The important issue is:  How do we handle those red flags &amp; questions?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Do we simply disregard red flags?  Does the greater balance of their contributions weigh in favor of justice?  Even if their contributions weigh in favor of justice, is there a poison pill present that has been intentionally planted?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Such is the nature of the dark world of corrupt intelligence agencies -- and rogue shadow factions secretly working inside these agencies -- that we unquestionably live in -- a world where we probably need to ask these questions.

       But, first, I'm not the only one who has noticed many questions &amp; red flags concerning Snowden &amp; Greenwald -- both of whom have done some great services to the cause of freedom.  That doesn't preclude the possibility that they (a) might be
       <em>
        Unwitting Accomplices
       </em>
       who are being used to present a piece of theatre, as intelligence communities so often do; or (b) that there may be red flags present
       <em>
        which we should be aware of
       </em>
       in their own personal motives or backgrounds or associations -- each of which, incidentally, are all measures of information that intel analysts would use against both them and us in their own analysis.

       If Snowden is a limited hangout, or Greenwald, does this mean "they're in on the trick"?  Not at all.  Snowden, in particular, was certainly given unprecedented access &amp; security clearance based on a very strange background.  His background, like Greenwald's, also suggests that of a zealot, a true believer -- exactly like Zacarias Moussaoui, with a higher IQ.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the pattern of CIA/FBI assets/patsies, true-believers like Snowden &amp; Greenwald are honeypot-trapped and cast without their knowledge in a public stage play that is manipulated into producing specific outcomes desired by intelligence agencies.  Past examples include
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacarias_Moussaoui">
        Zacarias Moussaoui
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       People like Snowden are identified &amp; shepherded through a tour of secrets that will be certain, according to Snowden's psychological profile &amp; political beliefs, to offend him to a crisis point where his sense of self will not be able to reconcile the contradictions of his profession.  He is given unusual access to things he can steal, like Bradley Manning was given, things that he would otherwise never have a security clearance for due to his psychological profile.  The parameters of how a Snowden or Manning will act are well-known in advance.  The secrets he is given can be limited hangout.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been many glaring pieces of evidence why this is a black-op:  Pentagon officials absurdly making a display of being indiscreet in expressing their desire for his death, ludicrous &amp; impossible claims that
       <a href="http://www.kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2013/12/20/18683.shtml">
        "Snowden stole literally everything"
       </a>
       -- leaked by a Pentagon official specifically to the
       <em>
        Daily Caller
       </em>
       website -- and preposterous, breathless hyperbole that he is a
       <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/16/5216212/snowden-gained-nsa-document-access-through-skill-alleged-coworker-says">
        "genius among geniuses"
       </a>
       -- all designed to build-up the Snowden legend, covering-up the
       <a href="http://digwithin.net/2014/01/01/snowden/">
        high-school-dropout security guard who was given a security clearance
       </a>
       , create a phantom menace so dangerous that it sparks Beltway leverage against legitimate whistleblowers past &amp; future, damage the U.S. tech sector &amp; stimulate impetus toward a privatization of U.S. intelligence agencies into the unaccountable private sector, as well as stimulate domestic "terrorist sympathizers" who see Snowden's actions as heroic.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I begin to see items in the media such as the NSA claiming Snowden was
       <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/16/5216212/snowden-gained-nsa-document-access-through-skill-alleged-coworker-says">
        "a genius among geniuses"
       </a>
       -- which is so over-the-top considering Snowden's backstory that one must pause and wonder why Snowden didn't create his own startup business but rather was content to work in security -- or DOD officials claiming that Snowden
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;amp;q=snowden+took+everything&amp;amp;oq=snowden+took+everything&amp;amp;gs_l=serp.3..0.134672.136497.0.136677.15.5.0.10.10.0.98.372.5.5.0....0...1c.1.32.serp..1.14.296.32LOD5jORIE">
        "took literally everything"
       </a>
       -- again, so over-the-top that it smells like the creation of a CIA-type "legend" -- it would be irresponsible to take things at face value and swallow the Snowden affair without questioning &amp; considering all possibilities.  Those two descriptions of Snowden do not square with reality, and Pentagon/DOD/NSA/CIA officials have
       <em>
        never before
       </em>
       taken time to

        announce their "feelings"
       </a>
       about any public or private individual.  We ought to explain this inconsistency.  When has any Pentagon official -- who are among the most secretive and close-lipped on earth -- ever before stopped to
       <em>
        announce their feelings
       </em>
       ?  This is just one red flag among many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose Snowden succeeds in taking down the NSA.  What would it be replaced with?  Carlyle Group-associated privatized intelligence firms beyond even a pretense of accountability (since the pretense is apparently all we have left with Congress, but it still is enough to get used by Congress if there's ever any public pressure).  Think those privatized intelligence firms will have any checks &amp; balances?  Think the public cops are bad?  Just wait for the privatized ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Snowden motivated to attack the public sector, and advance privatization?  Yes:
       <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116253/edward-snowden-glenn-greenwald-julian-assange-what-they-believe">
        http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116253/edward-snowden-glenn-greenwald-julian-assange-what-they-believe
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA is indeed being weakened -- but also the justification for a
       <em>
        stronger
       </em>
       police state is being simultaneously
       <em>
        immunized
       </em>
       .  The table is being set for privatization &amp; unaccountability (which Congress still legally has for government agencies, even though Congress is not now using it), and the stimulus is being administered to the "cult of Snowden crazies" as it will be called when they find a few of them to give explosives to and call "domestic terrorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, be careful of generalizing about "the CIA" or "the NSA" when talking about such an operation.  It could be institutional, OR,
       <em>
        it could be a rogue network within these institutions that is loyal to its own agenda -- or a foreign government's agenda.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Like most intelligence operations, there would be multiple goals of the operation, on multiple levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could be the takedown of the NSA itself, to be supplanted with a privatized NSA that can never be held accountable by Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       A second but more likely goal will be passing new laws against all whistleblowers, including previous NSA whistleblowers who did not go directly to the press, but went to Congress first, and went through legal channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a foreign government is involved, there could be a motive behind the takedown of the U.S. tech sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there evidence for a foreign government's involvement surrounding (if not directly connected to) Snowden/Greenwald?
      </p>

       Really excellent analysis of the Snowden situation, thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the problems with the term "limited hangout" when applied to a whistleblower is that people assume the individual must be complicit, when the opposite is far more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is one event which makes me believe that Snowden is not just an actor of conscience, but also a non-facilitated whistleblower.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the grounding of Bolivian President Morales's official plane in Austria, on the orders of the United States.
      </p>

       This was a huge diplomatic gaffe by the US and entirely unnecessary if Snowden was a limited hangout. The US clearly really wanted to capture Snowden and took an absurd risk in doing so. Why?

       All operations are compartmentalized.  When some people aren't privy to an operation, they react.  This is also a predictable benefit to the operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even presidents may not be privy to the operation.  Even presidents who are themselves an operation.  This is all about the Big Show.  It's public theatre.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I wrote, we shouldn't consider black-ops to be NSA operations even if they use NSA machinery.  Shadow factions within agencies can put their own pawns into the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks to me like part of the Snowden operation was to get a Latin American "Leftist" government to give Snowden asylum, building a further case for demonization &amp; operations against that country.  A U.S. attack on Latin America is coming anyway.  Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia &amp; Brazil have all considered granting asylum to Snowden.  To their credit (beginning with Correa), they smelled a trap.  The Morales grounding was a "push" to try to get Morales to react with asylum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asylum for "anti-imperialist icon" Snowden would've been a superficial "badge of honor" for any of those nations.  The Morales grounding only makes Snowden look even more like an operation.  They dangled candy in front of the South Americans.  Then they pushed.  Expect to see more of this.  Humala &amp; Kirchner are next.

       Thanks for the response - this article has fleshed some things out for me re; DORMOUSE:

       Albarelli Jr. is quite interesting, I'm gonna have to read his book.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New Republic article is basically from the perspective of the state, attacking Greenwald/Snowden/Assange for being anti-state, so I don't find it compelling, but I'm going to read the other articles you posted and do some more browsing and think more about this. With that said, however, in fairness to Marks regarding DORMOUSE, he gives an extended discussion of ARTICHOKE in his book The Search for the Manchurian Candidate (1979)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in regard to Omidyar, I definitely think the guy is incredibly dangerous and has many worrying connections. But I also think Jeff Bezos who owns the WashingtonPost is incredibly dangerous, yet they recently hired Radley Balko, who is another journalist I think does  important work. For sure the people who own these companies are working closely with a variety of government agencies, but I still believe there are good journalists out there, even at rotten institutions. I also don't believe the CIA and other agencies in the IC or DOD are as competent as they'd have to be in order to manage all the leaks that get out. They're not omnipotent after all, and you have to believe among the tens of thousands who work for them, at least a few of them have a conscience, or end up growing one. But you definitely make some good points regarding different possibilities and the importance of asking questions even when you think you know the answer. Especially when you know the answer.

       Also, the key difference between DORMOUSE and Snowden, it seems to me, is that DORMOUSE was a response to manage existing leaks, whereas Snowden came out and revealed a bunch of stuff nobody was really looking for.

       I completely agree with this;
      </p>
      <p>
       "they resort to admitting—sometimes even volunteering—some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and damaging facts in the case."
      </p>
      <p>
       But not;
      </p>
      <p>
       "The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further."
      </p>
      <p>
       Significantly less so that point, because after all it's not "the public" pursuing these matters in any challenging fashion.

       Victor Marchetti was the deputy director to Richard Helms, CIA director.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marchetti's book was the first public use of the term "limited hangout".  Subsequent declassified documents + Nixon tapes also reveal use of the phrase "limited hangout", but Marchetti's was the first public use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marchetti, of all people, would know what he's talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, it's worth speculating whether Marchetti's book was a limited hangout, or whether his disclosure of the term "limited hangout" was itself part of a limited hangout.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to disagree that limited hangouts do not use juicy material is, indeed, making yourself look
       <em>
        less skeptical
       </em>
       and not more skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to dispute Marchetti's use of the term "the public" is either disingenuous, or an artifact of youth to not recognize that "the public" was once synonymous with "We The People" and the Congress -- especially during the 1970s.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may disagree with him as you wish.

       I think limited hangouts use juicy material
       <em>
        when they have to

       . Throwing out thousands of top secret documents with juicy material coming out every week exposing illegal activity, constitutional violations, etc is not 'limited' in any shape or form.

       Precisely! The blackening of Snowden's name is no different to what happens to every US whistleblower. Don't believe the smears without evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Snowden's case I have seen him accused of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a financial opportunist
       </li>
       <li>
        a spy for the Russians
       </li>
       <li>
        a spy for the Chinese
       </li>
       <li>
        a Limited Hangout
       </li>
       <li>
        a CIA asset (triple agent)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Face it, there is no concrete evidence for any of these accusations, so maybe they have been dropped into the public discussion deliberately to turn the people who would naturally applaud a conscience whistleblower, against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       My philosophy is that Snowden has done the world a favour, he has not personally benefited from his actions in any obvious way (far from it!), and he deserves the benefit of the doubt.

       Snowden can be a limited hangout operation without ever being aware of it.

       Especially since 9/11, there is a long track record of intelligence agencies finding &amp; identifying true believers (zealots), then giving them explosives.  Snowden &amp; Greenwald are nothing if not

       Absolutely agree, and of course this possibility is one that the MSM and government don't mention, which gives it additional credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear to me that some of the material that Snowden "liberated" is disinformation (eg all the stuff relating to the ludicrous Abbotabad raid). This disinfo is kept on NSA files because only a very few, maximum clearance individuals would be privy to the real story.

       All things considered, I find it comforting that shaping public opinion and framing the narrative is still on the agenda at all. If they're willing to expend all this effort then maybe they're willing to go one step further and stop being such shitdicks?

       Frankly that article by Tarpley is absurd. He claims Wikileaks and Ellseburg were limited hangouts too. He seems to think anyone who exposes a real conspiracy, with real documents, is a limited hangout, but people who make unsubstantiated assertions about JFK and 9/11 are the real deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely the ones screaming 'limited hangout' at everyone who reveals something real, and then promotes theories which, true or not, they provide absolutely no proof for and they sound crazy to the general public, are the ones trying to discredit real conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I may not believe the official stories from the government about 9/11 and JFK, but that doesn't mean I'm going to just believe the most aggressive accusations without any proof, just because it sounds good and fits my preconceived notion about how vicious and amoral the government is

       Tarpley himself is a bit of an interesting character.  He's made a name for himself in the past few years as a fairly intellectual voice with seeming 'insider' knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I remember he rose to prominence through Alex Jone's media and was even legitimized on network television with appearances on the Colbert Report.
      </p>
      <p>
       He himself may in fact be the limited hangout, I still don't know for sure...  But his points definitely make you think.
