        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>**EDITED AT 8:52 p.m. Monday 3/10 CST....</p>

<p>probably the last update i give on this subject.....  I think the data in this will show you what happened to the plane to make it disappear anyway.  I cant tell you where it is now but...</p>

<p>I saw this guy mention my theory on Aljazeera</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3np77dWerLs&amp;feature=youtu.be">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3np77dWerLs&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>I found two documents about this which I hid at</p>

<p><a href="http://www.keepitwooden.com">www.keepitwooden.com</a></p>

<p>another one that lays it out.....</p>

<p><a href="http://www.planetanalog.com/author.asp?section_id=3229&amp;doc_id=562657&amp;">http://www.planetanalog.com/author.asp?section_id=3229&amp;doc_id=562657&amp;</a></p>

<p>so they actually did probably using the 20 employees use this technology to hide the plane... and take it somewhere.....  crazzzzzyyyyy </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScjOkEp0mf8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScjOkEp0mf8</a></p>

<p>The Oil wasnt from an aircraft..... what was it from?  is there a boat at the bottom of the ocean?  Oh they are extending the area so the plane can be found in Vietnam, great.... expect to hear that pretty soon.  Remember when they said the plane was trying to turn but provided no video radar evidence because the radar didnt indicate that because its not in Vietnam?  I am guessing... Vietnam, Signapore or Thailand is where we find the plane. It was so they can find the plane in vietnam......</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe what I am finding out here.  the people who may have died were not top management, their management team is in Austin, and the people who may have died were all Malaysian and Chinese employees.  It is sad these employees died, but they didnt alter the course of the company with their deaths.  The stock isnt going to crash tomorrow, these people dont let that happen. This company is positioned to make alot of money during the next war.  Pay close attention Share this story, lets try and break the cycle!</p>

<p>and here we go to war.... oh Mr. Ali bought the tickets in the island of Fuck It!!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/missing-jet/iranian-bought-tickets-fake-passport-passengers-report-n49016">http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/missing-jet/iranian-bought-tickets-fake-passport-passengers-report-n49016</a></p>

<p>please note that NBC cites FT.com as their source and when you go to FT.com, its mentioned in the story but it is a very small piece of it.</p>

<p>Continuing the war agenda theory ....  they wanted us to beleive the plane around when the radar said otherwise so that they can find the plane to the west!</p>

<p>I looked into freescale, and their wikipedia page is actually pretty good information.  There is alot more to this company than meets the eye.  There are a number of lawsuits for patent infringement, the IPO is under investigation.  Blackstone and crew bought out the company in 06, then they went public in 2011, the IPO is being investigated because they inflated there numbers on the IPO due to FUKUSHIMA- see bloomberg link below</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freescale_Semiconductor">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freescale_Semiconductor</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/05/26/freescales-ipo-and-the-3-billion-hole/">http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/05/26/freescales-ipo-and-the-3-billion-hole/</a></p>

<p>from the journal, in 2011 started off $3 billion in the whole, WSJ said they looked dumb, the next year a passport is stolen, then a second one the following year.  Beginning of this year the stock price begins to rise against the trend for no reason, Blackstone never sold their shares in the IPO, the other two of the three big shareholders must have bought them back at some point.  It is looking more and more shady but I am getting more and more downvotes....</p>

<p>Oh look they were also investigated for profiting off the Fukushima disaster....  wow I had no idea this would lead down this road.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;tkr=1FS:GR&amp;sid=axxV2sAk7vDI">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;tkr=1FS:GR&amp;sid=axxV2sAk7vDI</a></p>

<p>The company out of Austin, I have been investigating their business, and they make technology that could have hidden MH370.     <a href="http://investors.freescale.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=175261&amp;p=irol-irhome">http://investors.freescale.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=175261&amp;p=irol-irhome</a></p>

<p>these are some investor documents you can look at.....  They also just signed a huge refinance deal with Citibank.</p>

<p>The underwriters on the stock are the big bankers and boom look at this <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/charts/charts.asp?ticker=FSL">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/charts/charts.asp?ticker=FSL</a></p>

<p>looking at a year trend line <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/charts/charts.asp?ticker=FSL">http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/charts/charts.asp?ticker=FSL</a></p>

<p>Look at also the top three owners of the stock
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carlyle_Group#History">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carlyle_Group#History</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPG_Capital">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPG_Capital</a></p>

<p>The stock has risen $8 since they got in at 12/31/13 it looks like, this would net them $1,569,095,160.00 in that time, thats each....  of just the top three (clarification here)  Blackstone held its shares from IPO other two must have bought back... not clear right now (original figures are wrong)  may be more or less than 1.5 billion....</p>

<p>here is Yahoo&#39;s page <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=FSL+Major+Holders">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=FSL+Major+Holders</a> </p>

<p>I am not sure what the percent out indicates, but you can see Black Rock, Black stone, most of these companies are owned by each other is the funny thing....  thats who the bankers stay off the Forbes rich list.  Blackrock has about 4 trillion and assets 75% being owned by 3 banks JP Morgan, merrill and PNC.  They were instrumental in the mortgage backed securities deal... but we bailed them out..... it is evident the bail out was not even needed, just a ploy to allow them all to merge together.</p>

<p>They have ties back to many political and financial figures including AIG Kuhn and loeb etc......</p>

<p>alot of other notable named increased their position in this company at the same time </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fsl/institutional-holdings/increased">http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fsl/institutional-holdings/increased</a></p>

<p>This is where I find the holders of the stock <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fsl/institutional-holdings">http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fsl/institutional-holdings</a></p>

<p>another large stock holder also underwritten by Citi and Goldman... so large investor has an IPO written by CITI and goldman, then Freescale secures a refinance also issued by CITI</p>

<p>Another large investor is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Investments">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Investments</a> who were once run by peter lynch who wrote a book with John Rothchild...  though that may be the wrong spelling of Rothschild, this rothschild was associated with blackstone </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Rothschild,_4th_Baron_Rothschild">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Rothschild,_4th_Baron_Rothschild</a></p>

<p>here are some product brochures... <a href="http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/brochure/P1010APPBRF.pdf">http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/brochure/P1010APPBRF.pdf</a></p>

<p>with expansion they may have been able to prevent wireless communication from things like oh idk a plane?----relating to that I found this:</p>

<p>It seems like this guy <a href="http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/content.do?id=10061">http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/content.do?id=10061</a> is another &quot;chairman&quot; of Free Scale.  He is also involved with Cypress Semiconductor which make this product <a href="http://www.cypress.com/psoc4/?source=CY-ENG-HEADER">http://www.cypress.com/psoc4/?source=CY-ENG-HEADER</a> </p>

<p>The website says there are signal issues when you get it around certain systems..  pretty strange.</p>

<p>looking at this... they are perfectly positioned to make money off of RF technology during the next war.  RF I would assume relates to RFID, and I would also be making another assumption saying that they probably can set up something to knock out all cell phone/electronic signals that operate on a wireless or satellite capacity.  link here:</p>
