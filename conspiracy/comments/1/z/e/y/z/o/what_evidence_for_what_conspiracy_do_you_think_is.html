       Maybe you should take the time to do research instead of believing random out-of-context internet pictures some idiot pasted text over. There is literally a video showing that guy still wearing the backpack after the explosion and then you see him put the backpack away in his truck. You are going to claim "100%" on that random internet picture that you didn't even decided to fact check?

       In order to believe the government version of either this bombing, or Sandy Hook, which is classified  for some bizarre reason or 9/11 you have to bend over backwards repeatedly giving the government the benefit of the undeserved doubt.

       I'm a subjectivist : I believe objectivity is a lie or at best an ideal to strive towards when reporting events.
      </p>
      <p>
       We keep fighting over evidence and proof but no amount of proof will convince a believer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted this opinion of mine is dishonest because I personally don't care about proof : I don't investigate, I merely collect theories and pickup the ones I like best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even so, events give evidence to my theory that subjectivity is what drives us more than "proof" or Reason ever do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time and time again the presence of truth proves not to be enough to sway public opinion, what shows to be mattering instead is the willingness and readiness of said people to look at said idea without flinching.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is terrible, gigantic proof of pedocriminal networks being supported and covered up by the authorities of all countries. Do we go there? No, because we're not ready nor willing. Only a minority is, and it fights in the desert.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you want to rule over a people you don't do it with evidence, you do it by setting the norms beyond which said people wont dare to look at what you want to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I want to be further pessimistic I'll remind you that a quarter of the population of Belgium marched in its Bruxelles capital to bring the pedo networks criminals to justice against the coverup of the authorities. It didn't happen. So even when the people are ready and willing, it's still not enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's keep mooing and baaing (because that's what we're in fact doing here), pay our taxes and give our children to Moloch.

       You're right. It's the programming, the collective mindcontrol we're up against. Not only in others but also in ourselves. I feel like a radfem. "We may have to go further than we thought we would".
      </p>
      <p>
       Deprogramming oneself, deprogramming others, it's a bigger task than we thought possible. And we need other tools than we thought.

       The fact remains that the backpack that exploded matches the ones carried by the Craft International personnel not the one carried by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  and that you can see the Craft person carrying such a backpack into the bombing area. You do not see it carried by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

       Why would the government go out of its way to conspicuously destroy WTC 7 on 9/11?  If they had left it alone it would have been demolished anyway like three days later, when WTC 4, 5, and 6 (which had all been similarly damaged) were demolished.

       Yeah yeah, I've heard about the "they had to get rid of documents pertaining to investigations of this and that" but it doesn't explain why they couldn't have just torn down the building three days later when they tore down WTC 4, 5, and 6.  It's not like they were about to let people go in and retrieve the documents while the building was in danger of collapse and the entire site was off-limits to non-emergency personnel.

       Well in the real world when you're trying to demonstrate guilt, you're obligated to speak to motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Addressing the big issues like motive and capacity to commit the crime also helps us avoid nitpicking the scientific minutia.  Because most of us aren't expert scientists so it doesn't really matter what "adds up" in our minds.  There's no sense in splitting hairs over the details of things we don't understand, especially when we can find "expert" voices on either side of the issue.

       That's when crimes are investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       911 was never investigated as a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bush admin setup a congressional commission more than a year after the act and tried to appoint arch-war-criminal Henry Kissinger at its head. Several members of said commission later went public denouncing its bias and absence of following of normal investigating rules : testimonies weren't even looked for, evidence wasn't gathered, conflicts of interest abounded and so on (don't ask me for sources, I'm going from memory).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the real world there are crimes that are not investigated because the rulers who would be ordering the investigation happen to be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when debating 911 we're not talking about a crime that's been officially investigated. When proponents of the official theory require that we abide by legal rules it's the pot calling the kettle black.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need to explain motives for blowing up building 7, we just need to give evidence that it was blown up or evidence that it didn't collapse due to the damage caused by the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are indeed in a comfortable argumentation position but it's the ruthless fascist cunts in power who gave it to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do have many motives for them blowing up building 7 BTW : command center was there, records were there, security firms were there. But we don't need to bring them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another tangent, I'd like to interject that the shills won this debate on alt.conspiracy 10 years ago. This is why we're here, politically. Citizen Joe Blow with an internet connection didn't win the fight.

       Gotcha. I just always felt that was one of the top 2 or 3 most compelling things about the whole story. They take testimony from one of the highest ranking officials in the airline industry that day and don't even mention his name, only paraphrase him and insert words into his testimony to change the meaning.

       what conspiracy? the bush cabinet was in a frantic, paranoid mindset after 9/11 and jumped the gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       if 9/11 was in inside job, then why was it not perpetrated by iraqi al qaeda members? why would the premise not place the blame on where they really wanted to go?
      </p>
      <p>
       the premise for iraq was based on intelligence briefings from the cia and other secret agencies (from the UK and germany).
      </p>
      <p>
       the only one that was proven to be false was the 'yellow cake uranium' order from nigeria (interestingly enough, inspectors did find yellow cake uranium in iraq in 2008). However, this led to the Valerie Plume leak scandal (and subsequent charges), which subsequently revealed how little the cabinet was aware of the intelligence reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       the bush cabinet did not personally create the false report in order to go into iraq. any real conspiracy would have had iraqi terrorists, rock solid reasons and reports, etc.

       Ahmed Chalabi, international banking criminal and Bush's drinking buddy, fabricated the 'evidence' against Iraq.

       The Pentagon objected at the time to reliance on such a non credible source but W. insisted.

       Chalabi was our only intelligence source from Iraq at the time since the 6 CIA spies there were caught and executed.

       Chalabi  and his henchmen, the 'Iraqi National Congress' who had been promised control of Iraq's new government when Saddam was defeated, are the "cheering Iraqi crowd" seen on television news coverage  of the destruction of the statue of Saddam Hussein.

       The bush cabinet was in a paranoid mindset because they just watched more americans perish in front of them then any other administration. in the months following the attacks, there were anthrax scares, thousands of intelligence reports of threats and the cabinet was right in the middle of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       in fact, there was one instance in the weeks after 9/11 where the white house was sent a supposed  laced letter. Bush, Rice, and a few other members were in China, and during a video conference, Cheney told the others that they may all have been fatal exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally, all of them were dealing with these sorts of realities while being fed multiple lines of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why was it not a conspiracy? Because the 'fabrication' was not literally made up out of thin air in order to go into Iraq. There was an ambassador who went to nigeria to look into the possibility of trade for nuclear materials (which was also based on the fact that there was up until the first gulf war)
      </p>
      <p>
       Further intelligence used to justify the war was offered by defectors from Iraq and other, less reliable sources. The bush cabinet was not privy to the information either. Every member of congress did (or could have) read all of the same information to justify voting to go into Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       These sorts of intelligence issues do not imply a conspiracy. There was no coordination between the providers of the bad intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, the government (the white house and congress) were out for revenge, and their emotional state, blended with faulty intelligence, muddled up their judgement (including the rest of the world save france and russia, who supported the iraq invasion).
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think 9/11 was an inside job. I think it is stupid to think that it was orchestrated in order to go into Iraq. there is a gaping disconnect in the logic.

       There was no conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that they were in a bloodlust type state of mind. Multiple threats on the white house reported by security agencies catered to a mindset that there was a sort of all out aggression towards the USA. There were many more security concerns and intelligence reports than the public knew about [which later came to light].
      </p>
      <p>
       With the threat of further attacks and a constant fear of a mushroom cloud over a major city, they felt it practical to engage an enemy that had a nuclear weapons program - according to their reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       The administration did not create the reports, and there was no coordination between the sources of the catastrophic intelligence failure.

       For me, its the fact that debris from 9/11 Flight 93 was found literally miles from the crash site. There is no way in hell that plane wasn't shot down.

       The story about the passengers rushing the cockpit was just to give the families some comfort, but I'm 100% certain its a lie.

       Allegedly the airphone was connected to someone in a call center at the airphone company or something. But to me it seems unlikely that an operator would be able to make that out unless it was spoken directly into the handset.

       Not sure, I haven't looked into it too much as to me it just seems so obvious that the plane was not downed by the passengers!

       Note that I'm not saying I believe the plane to have blown up in mid-air, but rather that a bit of debris fell off when it was shot and then the rest of the plane continued onwards while it descended the rest of the way and then crashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There wasn't much debris found away from the site, IIRC, but there were significant pieces. If it completely blew up in mid-air, the debris field would be much, much bigger.

       Associated Press item dated May 30, 2002.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The morning of Sept. 11, Sen. Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss were
doing what the two intelligence committee chairmen frequently do -
having breakfast together at the Capitol. With them was then-Pakistani
intelligence chief [Mahmud Ahmad]. [General Ahmad's] task was to
persuade Afghanistan's Taliban leaders to hand over terror suspect
Osama bin Laden. As the three men talked over the knotty problem, an
aide handed Goss a note saying an airplane had hit the World Trade
Center. A few moments later the Capitol would be evacuated, and the
following month [General Ahmad] was fired."
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the Times also revealed that on September 11 -- while the attacks were in progress -- the two current Co-Chairmen of the Joint-Intelligence Committee investigating the 9/11 attacks, Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) and Representative Porter Goss (R-FL), met for breakfast with the ISI Chief who had ordered $100,000 wired from Pakistan to terrorist leader Mohammed Atta in the days immediately preceeding the attacks.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the FBI, Indian Intelligence and several press reports, the ISI Head was instrumental in providing financial support to the 9/11 terrorists. General Mahmoud Ahmad had allegedly ordered the transfer of $100.000 to the presumed 9/11 ring-leader Mohamed Atta.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       How fitting that this is the same House Intelligence chairman Porter Goss who was having breakfast in D.C. on 9/11 with Pakistan's security chief, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad—who was later revealed to be hijacker Mohammed Atta's bagman.

      <p>
       A Times of India (10-12-2001) story by Manoj Joshi revealed that Pakistani ISA Director-General Lt. General Mahmud Ahmad sought retirement after the U.S. attacks -- confirmed by top sources in India, because of evidence produced by India showing his links to Mohammed Atta, the terrorist hijacking leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Times said that "U.S. authorities sought his [Ahmad's] removal after confirming the fact that $100,000 was wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by Ahmad Umar Sheikh on the instructions of ISI Lt. General Ahmad." Senior [U.S.] government sources "have confirmed that India contributed significantly to establishing the link between the money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief."

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Presidential candidate Senator Joe Biden admitted meeting with the chief financier of the 9/11 hijackers in the days after September 11 after being confronted by We Are Change founder Luke Rudkowski in the press room following Sunday's Democratic debate in New Hampshire.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the FBI and as confirmed by various news reports at the time, Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad instructed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the alleged assassin of Daniel Pearl, to wire $100,000 to alleged lead hijacker Mohammed Atta in the summer of 2001.
       </p>
       <p>
        Arriving exactly one week before 9/11, the general met with Pentagon, White House National Security Council and CIA officials, including George Tenet and Marc Grossman, then U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the very morning of 9/11, Ahmad was at a breakfast meeting on Capitol Hill hosted by Senator Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss, the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence committees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two days after the attack on the twin towers and the Pentagon, on September 13th, Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with the ISI chief.
       </p>
       <p>
        No adequate explanation has been forthcoming as to why top government and intelligence officials were meeting with the money man behind the alleged hijackers before and after 9/11.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shortly after the Democratic debate had finished on Sunday, Prison Planet reporter Rudkowski was able to get access to the CNN spin room and confront presidential candidate Biden about his 9/11 meeting with the Pakistani General.
       </p>
       <p>
        We asked him the question - what was he doing with the head of the Pakistani ISI General Mahmoud Ahmad, said Rudkowski, he told me - he admitted that he met with him - he met with the head of the Pakistani ISI.
       </p>
       <p>
        He said I told them not to do it, I told them not to wire the money - I told them to stop supporting the Taliban, which shows he had foreknowledge of them supporting him."
       </p>
       <p>
        "I told him - sir, he funded the hijackers, you did business with him, you let him go - he's free," said Rudkowski, to which Biden responded, "Get a life kid," after which Rudkowski was pushed away by Biden's security staff.

       On the morning 11 September, 2001, Goss and Graham were having breakfast with General Ahmad.[9][10] Ahmad's network had ties to Osama bin Laden and directly funded, supported, and trained the Taliban[11].

       Was it an ‘intelligence failure’ to give red carpet treatment to the ‘money man’ behind the 9-11 terrorists, or was it simply ‘routine’?

       The reason we have the same government in power is the mathematical illusion they call voting. We don't vote. and thus they can easily control the elections and make more and laws and create more and more systems to benefit themselves and the global militant corporate empire.

       I love a conspiracy as much as the next person, but it really pisses me off when I see someone post a link to Reddit that has, somewhere int he title, the words "100% proof", or something similar, but really all it does is link to a conspiracy website which circles back to other conspiracy websites and has no actual proof at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's something fundamentally wrong with people who believe in a conspiracy that has absolutely no validated reference material and take these things for granted without question

       doesnt work like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       what you're calling a "logical, rational person" is in fact a believer in authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       you're asking for a stronger authority in order to supplant the rulers' authority in a person's mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       that's not the point. The point isn't to switch to another topdog nor to follow "reason" because we are not creatures of reason nor objectivity : the idea that we are such creatures is an illusion as reason is just a tool and objectivity is a pipedream.
      </p>
      <p>
       what you can hope to achieve is leading people to drop their belief in authority and to instead accept entertaining the possibility of contrary viewpoints being real, valid or at least fruitful to entertain in their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is about letting the rock of "reality" go which is in fact a consensus-belief, in order to navigate the waters of self-directed beliefs and examinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       basically you believe in shit just because you're told to. And so do I. Are you willing to look at that, to accept it and do something about it ?
