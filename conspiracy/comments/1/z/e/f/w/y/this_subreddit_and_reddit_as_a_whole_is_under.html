       I would have thought that the love of fossil fuels and nuclear power would be mutally exclusive, given nuclear power is the only credible drop-in replacement for baseline power for the current silly fossil fuel usage.

       If you want to protect the organic curation of content you have to realize that reddit as a medium does not represent that ideal, which means you have to fight for it. Spend time in the new queue and be vigilant as to JTRIG tactics being employed in comments and things slowly can start to get better.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's absolutely fucked that the standard being upheld in the defaults tends to be veiled removals and manipulative bullshit, but that is a sign that reddit as a medium is gone. We can protect little corners of her, but she is not coming back. At this point we're just waiting for the inevitable reddit v2.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really have a lot of faith in an idea I was discussing yesterday with regards a blockchain based aggregates as the future. But for now the aggregates must be protected as they stand.

       That's a damn good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think sticky posts were the first move towards that, but one time Erik Martin went into
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       to promote an
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1sh3i0/ask_the_authors_of_double_down_mark_halperin_and/cdy9qr0">
        AMA via a sticky and people called bullshit over it.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, you have to remember that
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzKH8r0O-TM">
        reddit inc was literally pointing and laughing as digg fell
       </a>
       and Paul Graham ain't Kevin Rose ;).
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea, my image of reddit v2 is some company making that same video of the last snoo falling from the walls of a run down san fran building, as the office in Brooklyn moves on to other ventures, while Advance Publications reflects on how it's 18 million dollar investment in the spin-off either paid off or went down the drain.

       Posts like this divert the sub away from its purpose- to bring to light conspiracies. We can do little more to counteract shills. The most powerful attack on the shills is to bring a conspiracy to light. Let's get to it.

       But you're not. Virtually ever conspiracy theory has numerous competing and contradictory explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing you could conceivably agree on is that you reject the mainstream explanation, which isn't really much of substance as a unifying factor.

       The objective truth is the objective truth. The facts surrounding different conspiracy theories is what is done in this sub. You can argue objective truth but that won't likely be very constructive from a subjective perspective. But discussing subjective interpretation of information can be very constructive.

       Yes, they are relentless. But usually they're quite easy to spot. Ignore them, downvote them, debunk them if you must, but don't get so deep into the argument that it distracts from the larger message, or discourages you.

       You are fighting a losing battle. Reddit is being obviously manipulated but the majority of users do not really care.

       This place is a losing battle and a timesink to try and fightback againat the manipulation.

       I think the time energy and effort being put in with regards to manipulation could be better utilized.  Where or how I don't know but reddits a lost cause in my opinion

       I want to say it's already lost. They're also not necessarily powerful people. Some of these so called shills are just conspiratards trying to harass us and skew how others view us. I also personally don't think bipolarbear0 is a government shill. More likely it's some dude with way too much time on his hands that loves the attention he can get with a little charm, some google research and a target to bully.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's many different groups battling for control of what we think, some more sinister than others. I think when it comes to this specific sub, conspiratards are more of a threat than anything else.

       What's sinister is the organized and intentful force that breeds and inspires people like bipolartard to unconsciously spread misinformation and attack truth. They are patsies. No clue they are literally part of an intended ongoing psyop.

       First of all, I wouldn't call you a shill for disagreeing with me. This is an absurd statement and no one does that. Like I said, this is a ridiculous excuse used by people who have something to hide otherwise they would make better arguments and not cause suspicion.

        says otherwise.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A person who uses a conspiracy debunking site as an argument *has no argument, instead relies on material created in opposition to what we are supposed to be doing here; debunking narratives and not our own theories. This is a weak argument that needs strenghtening.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the narrative can stand up to scrutiny and the narrative is 100% bullet-proof, then we can consider reviewing the theory. Shills like to invert this, preferring to debunk
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       and poke holes in
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       theories. People who do this are suspicious in my point of view.

       This is contained within the first two paragraphs of the first section "Osama &amp; Arabs".  As a matter of fact there is evidence that some thought about this and there was the potential for gain within the military industrial complex if they failed to act to stop it.  There was also the potential for gain with insurance claims as well as stock market reactions.

       I'm not covering for anything.   I was building off of your own hypothetical example which you didn't seem to find any way out of except to call someone a shill.  Which is an even weaker argument than posting a link to a debunk site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why calling someone a shill or a troll is against the rules and will continue to be against the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just another form of name calling.  If we are going to let you call people shills then we are going to let people call you a retard.  Then the conversation never progresses beyond a 3rd grade name calling fight and this subreddit is effectively reduced to a bunch of "poo poo heads".  Which is exactly what they want.

       A shill is not capable of providing facts, sources or knowledge that any other person can't also provide or argue against.  It doesn't matter if shills exist! They don't have magic powers!  And if we start calling everyone a shill who doesn't automatically accept our theory then the shills win!

       Calling people shills does not defeat the shills!  It helps the fucking shills!

       And calling people a shill cause you don't agree with them doesn't fix any of that. Hell the shills are most likely on here calling people shills....  they even said they would do that in the leaked documents!

       Being smart enough to do some research and have a solid argument does.

        First of all, I wouldn't call you a shill for disagreeing with me. This is an absurd statement and no one does that. Like I said, this is a ridiculous excuse used by people who have something to hide otherwise they would make better arguments and not cause suspicion.

       Need that explained a 4th time little guy?

       So stop using this stupid argument. You understand English, correct?

       Because we have access to top-notch propaganda material elaborated by top minds of the goverment for the purpose of discrediting conspiracy theorists? Oh wait, we don't. They do.

       You made me repeat myself 4 times. It makes me wonder if you speak the language. Or are you just playing dumb as an excuse to use the same unfounded argument in hopes it will eventually stick? Pro-tip: It won't.

       So... we don't even have to explicitly call them shills, the mods just have to bend the rules enough to make the accusation fit now?
