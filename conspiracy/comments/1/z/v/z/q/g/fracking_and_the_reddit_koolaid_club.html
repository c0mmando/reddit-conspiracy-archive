       Top post "this could be a good thing, right?" and multiple other posts minimising or denying how potentially stupid and dangerous the practice is.

       Sorry this is somewhat low effort, but worth a look to read the incongruency of the situation and it's implications.

       In the comments section it is repeated that wastewater injection allows the release of tectonic pressures. I don't dispute this. Sorta like how grease minimizes friction in mechanical things.
      </p>
      <p>
       What isn't mentioned anywhere is what triggers the release - not a single word about fracking.

       I'm not sure exactly what you're asking but I'll give it a try.  Pump waste water at very high pressure into the shale which causes it to fracture.  Gas and fluids come out of those fractures, leaving a void.  Depending on the operation, these voids can be filled with sand, also a very high pressure.  Sand in theory is supposed to fill the void while letting fluids through due to its high porosity.  If this is not done properly (or at all), then you are going to have fractured shale on top of a void.  Not a good time.

       I've been around the oil field for most of my life and there are two issues here. One is waste-water (or salt-water) injection which doesn't
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       result as a fracking operation. Sometimes injection wells are an ongoing strategic operation to extract remnants from an existing-but-depleted field. This was actually far more common than modern fracking for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fracking, on the other hand, is the result of a belligerent mindset when they've drilled a bad well... i.e., they didn't find a good, producing well... so they frack, in an effort to force a release of a payoff. I mean, hell, may as well frack while you've got all that drill stem equipment in place. Sometimes (often enough, I guess, to be a good cost balance) they'll get a gas well as the result of the fracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       This latter, fracking, which is belligerent destructiveness without regard for the ramifications, is what is currently being discussed ... except they're restricting the discussion to waste water injection and strategically avoiding mention of fracking - which would bring bad press.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: "waste water injection" keeps the discussion on the process of extracting petro-chemicals (we're just doing our jobs to keep your car running), "fracking" brings bad press. it's ok to discuss the former, because everyone is conditioned to hate the latter - and rightfully so.

       No worries. Fracked wells last about 5% as conventional wells. In 15 years, fracking will be over.

       By pumping petrochemicals into the ground.  Polluting the water supply.  Down low in aquifers.  It's reckless, unnecessary  behavior.  How could you possibly support it?  On what physical or moral grounds?  This should be interesting.

       I'm all for job and wealth creation but fracking is something else. There is a huge amount of shale gas and natural gas that can be tapped and refined all over the place in North America. There really just isn't a  need to open these spent wells again. I mean, frig, the consequences are just not worth it at all.

       Not really.  We need to hurt to really push for alternative energy solutions.  There are potentially viable options already here are that need serious innovation to perfect and mass produce.  Oil can fall to bring a sideline source.

       edit oops that figure is incorrect. 25-40% from gas. 70% from fossil overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       wind is handy, when it blows. January was good for us, nearly 50% here and there from it. But our huge hydro plant is fairly insignificant now (though appreciated) and our daily shortfall really appreciates the nuclear in Britain  and France.
