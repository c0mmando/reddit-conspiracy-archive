<p>But, it does have people crying Nazi a lot.</p>

<p>Which seems like it&#39;s disrupting the flow of good information in this sub.</p>

<p>EDIT: It&#39;s been pointed out (below) that, technically, in the purest definition of Limited Hangout, they&#39;d be covering up more sensitive information <em>about Hitler</em>. So, I&#39;ve added this edit to point out that, at minimum, this appears to be a well-timed distraction from more important topics (Ukraine?), which coincidentally seems to be fueling the use of Nazi as a buzzword. I don&#39;t want to dilute the meaning of Limited Hangout, and I apologize if this submission trod dangerously close to that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I pretty much agree. Everything the government releases ON ITS OWN, without being prompted or forced, is gonna be a limited hangout. Stuff released due to FOIA request or whistleblowers, court documents, etc is where you can sometimes find the real meat. Even congressional investigations and reports can be useful, such as the Kerry committee in 1988 exposing CIA complicity in drug trafficking 8 years before Gary Webb (who&#39;s real contribution was tracking where the drugs went).</p>

<p>Then maybe it isn&#39;t, technically, a Limited Hangout in the purest definition. </p>

<p>In a broader sense (quoting from wikipedia)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in order to prevent a greater exposure of more important details</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it isn&#39;t restricted to just the specific topic. It goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It takes the form of deception, misdirection, or coverup </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realize there&#39;s an implication (although not explicitly stated in what I&#39;ve read) that a Limited Hangout is probably covering up information within that one topic, so I&#39;ll edit the above post to reflect that it may simply be a strategically timed sideshow distraction (red herring isn&#39;t even accurate, technically - but still...).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think this story is fascinating and incredibly instructive. It shows how easily an enormous number of people can be led to believe a particular version of events with little or no evidence.</p>

<p>One of the main psychological barriers for many people to re-evaluating the official story of 9/11 is that they believe it is impossible to fool so many people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re talking about the Hitler escape theory, I agree to a limited extent. The claim that &quot;no one saw him commit suicide&quot;, however, doesn&#39;t hold a lot of influence with me. Were they expecting him to have it filmed for posterity? Still, it goes hand in hand with the bin Laden raid, whisked away in a media frenzy, his body dumped at sea in accordance with a non-existent Muslim law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not attacking the theory of Hitler&#39;s possible survival. Rather, I&#39;m pointing out the suspicious timing of the release in conjunction with the recent rash of &quot;Nazi&quot; claims surrounding the Ukraine conflict.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>On the topic of the released Hitler documents...</p>

<p>This is new <strong>data</strong>, not necessarily new <strong>information</strong>. It is new data which matches some previous data, from which a specific theory about Hitler&#39;s survival has been formulated.</p>

<p>Data, Information,... what&#39;s the difference? Well...</p>

<p>the last remaining people who could have fought in WW2 in 1945, started collecting their pensions in the 90s, very few of the rest are alive now.
