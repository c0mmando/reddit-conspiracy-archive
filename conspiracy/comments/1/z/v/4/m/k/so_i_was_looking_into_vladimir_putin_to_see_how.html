      <p>
       So after seeing all the bad press Putin receives, I decided to have a little look at the scary Russian President.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple look here:(
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin
       </a>
       ) found some interesting results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some key points I'd like to point out.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) First of all he removed all the corrupt politicians from office. He also created the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Russia_People%27s_Front">
        People's front of Russian
       </a>
       . It was designed for everyone to work together for a better future. On the list of the ONF founders there were 480 people, including trade union activists, workers, scientists, culture workers, athletes, businessmen, farm and medical workers and politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) He put all businesses under some governmental control (be it total or in the form of shares). This meant that companies were more transparent in their business dealings. It also meant that minimum wages were increased for workers, and workers got better treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)He told large companies that while they can profit from their businesses, they must work together for the betterment of the people. E.G. Technology and science businesses working together on research.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)In 2001, Putin obtained approval for a flat tax rate of 13%; the corporate rate of tax was also reduced from 35 percent to 24 percent; Small businesses also get better treatment. The old system with high tax rates has been replaced by a new system where companies can choose either a 6-percent tax on gross revenue or a 15-percent tax on profits. The overall tax burden is lower in Russia than in most European countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Putin chose the Russian Defense Minister to be
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoliy_Serdyukov">
        Anatoliy Serdyukov
       </a>
       who Since 1985 had worked in a furniture shop and from 1995 to 2000 was the director general of Furniture Market, a furniture company in Saint Petersburg.
      </p>
      <p>
       6)Putin and Anatoliy Serdyukov (defensive minister) together did a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_reform">
        military reform
       </a>
       and a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_police_reform">
        police reform
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note here that these reforms were made public on the internet, and Putin welcomed open debate from the Russian people. In fact they made several changes to it to include the popular suggestion of the Russian people!
      </p>
      <p>
       The reforms meant:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) Every serviceman was re-evaluated. Any serviceman with a black mark on their record, was automatically removed. No matter the title of that man/officer. It removed corruption and the "bad apples" from the mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       b) All servicemen (police/military) got a pay rise, as many were doing police work AND second jobs to make ends meet.
      </p>
      <p>
       c) All servicemen were given a decent pension, as well as affordable housing.
      </p>
      <p>
       d) The original "militia" was renamed to "police".
      </p>
      <p>
       e) The military was restructured, reorganised and made the entire military perminately arm-ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       f) According to the new police reform any detainee will receive a right to make a telephone call within 3 hours of the detention. They will also receive the right to have a lawyer and translator from the moment of their detention, and the police must inform the detainee of their rights and duties. The police will lose its right to carry out and demand checks of a company's financial and business activities. The police may also no longer detain a citizen for an hour just to find out their identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) He boosted the economy and managed to pay off all the Soviet debt in 2005. He was able to restart economic growth for Russian in just over a year after the 2008 economic crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       8) He pumped money into education, hospitals, housing, welfare to help his people. He created jobs and made sure the workers were looked after.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, during his time the economy has grown, the middle class came back and grew, the population increased for the first time in years. Quality of living increased. People are spending money.
      </p>
      <p>
       In truth, I think he is somebody to lead the rest of the world forward. I believe he has a human heart and good intentions for his people. I know I can't say that about my government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the choice, Russia sound like a better option than my own country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I am not buy any means denying that he has a shady past, I am mearly showing a flip-side to the anti-Putin campaign. I realise this is a pro-Putin post and not going to be greatly favoured.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had a quick look at the list of his supposed murder victims, but quite a few already had ties with many other unscrupulous people, and some seem to have corruption in their histories (could this even be a reason Putin killed them?). At this point we can only presume the what/if/where/who and how's. But we need to try to view things objectively.

       Can you tell me why you think criticizing Murderer Vladimir Putin is somehow an endorsement for the Murderers at the CIA/Mossad? Putin was a KGB agent then became head of the FSB before becoming a politician.

       The article you posted is entirely based on some Russian government official's version of events. It says so in the first two paragraphs. But a guy working directly for Putin has no reason to lie, right? This is seriously theshittiest, intellectually lazy argument in this thread. Literally read what you've posted.

       I thought the entire point of this subreddit was to question the official report.

       Wouldn't it be nice if we, as a nation were able to point the accusing finger at other "EVILDOERS" (GWB word) without having four fucking fingers pointed back at ourselves?

       You may be a fan of hypocrisy, but I'm not. You may seek to justify what WE do by pointing to the misdeeds of others, but I don't.

       Honestly I don't care about Snopes,but it seems like almost every sitting president has had their share of unscrupulous undermining backhanded bullshit that either got them elected or started unnecessary wars leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands/millions of innocent people or the untimely and unfortunate demise of someone either rallying/testifying or blocking their agenda or path to their agenda. All done in the name patriotism. When a foreign politician does it and IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE USA's agenda said person is a butcher. Putin does what he needs to do for his people and if he has done any of the shit he is accused of that's on the Russian people. We elect someone every 4 years that does the same shit.

       They're not simply saying so. Did you even read it? The claims about the "Clinton bodycount" are basically a chain e-mail with zero sources or credibility that completely fall apart when looked into at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their stance is that the "Clinton body count" list has no credibility. They have: A) Provided a fairly detailed and rational explanation as to why the "evidence" in this list is lacking, and B) Provided a good deal of sources demonstrating that many of the facts in the list are flat out wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claims like this aren't simply "he said/she said" arguments. Imagine I claim that President Obama was responsible for a number of murders in Chicago in the early 90's, and back it up with a bunch of facts showing that there were murders there, Obama lived there, and find that Obama had some sort of vague connection with several people who were murdered (remember, like Clinton, he's a politician, he's got connections in some way or another to thousands and thousands of people). Afterwards, Snopes puts up an article claiming that I'm full of shit, and that I basically just looked up all the murders in Chicago, and then found a couple of names that I could make a connection to Obama with, and then tossed out a completely baseless accusation. Snopes and I are not now equally likely to be right. Snopes has a reasonable opposition to my accusation, based on solid logic. All I have are unsubstantiated accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton list is based on the premise that if Clinton has any connection to a person who died, then just assume that the person was assassinated on Clinton's orders. If the death doesn't seem suspicious enough, just make some shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that if you don't have much experience in academia, reading a bunch of stuff on websites might seem like you've done adequate research to have amassed damning evidence against former presidents. Simply stating "I've researched" does not improve your credibility. If you really had done good research, you'd think you'd be pretty excited to actually show this stuff you'd found. Provide some sources.

       Care to actually disclose some of this "dirt" you've dug up?

       With my thanks for the links, my response is - so, Putin is Russia's Obama. While I don't think they, themselves, pick and choose who gets killed, I do understand the notion that the mechanism surrounding a prominent official can act, unsolicited, on its behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the killing of Anna Politkovskaya on Putin's birthday seems like it might have been a morbid "gift" to Putin by someone within that surrounding mechanism I referenced above, rather than an actual hit ordered by Putin himself. The Clintons left a trail of bodies in Arkansas on their way to DC; were they hits ordered by the Clintons themselves? Dunno, but plausible deniability is more likely in both instances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Litvinenko was involved in too many spy agencies for his own good. MI5/MI6 isn't "good" just because Britain has a "prim and proper" public image. Snowden, if he's a legitimate whistleblower and is still alive and wants to remain alive, should take heed of this, in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list of journalists has a disclaimer at the top, questioning factual accuracy.

      <p>
       Still, thanks for providing links.

       The difference is, Putin was a KGB agent and then became head of the FSB. He's also a billionaire who has managed to retain power for over a decade in a country where powerful people are murdered all the time. I can see Obama being naive about what's actually going behind the scenes (to some extent) but Putin knows exactly what's up.

       Ok. So maybe he's more like Nixon, who had a tendency to emphatically imply what he wanted. Sure, he knows what's up. I still doubt he gave direct orders for assassination (admittedly, it's a generic doubt, based on my broader examination of politics and political figures).

       I have a question for you- how does one go from being the head of the KGB to one of the richest men in the world? You don't get there by being either honest or a great guy. Here is a Vanity Fair article detailing just how double edged Putin's rule is. By double edged I mean great for him and the same old same old for Russia.

       Guarantee Putin is no angel.  But I also guarantee that the people in the US (you know who) who are demonizing Putin/Russia have as black or blacker hearts than Putin.  They are spinning this thing because they have interest in the Ukraine or in starting a conflict with Russia.  Who knows, Putin may be in on the whole menagerie himself.  It's all theatre for the masses.

       This is basically it. The demonization of Russia is an attempt to make the USA look better. It's an attempt to juxtapose the bad versus the good. Russia is "the bad," therefore the USA is "the good" simply for being on the other side of the conflict.

       Thanks OP, been looking for info like this for awhile myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must admit this seems surprisingly more positive than I might have expected. I feel there must be at least some kind of indirect negative results to some policies that he has implemented, it would be helpful to see those cases just to see a broader scope. Though I'm not as jaded as most and I genuinely believe that sometimes governments can be fair and effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I feel the focus on Putin himself is rather narrow, as political leaders are many times just figureheads for their governments. I'd be more interested to know about the current and recent past government of Russia and if they have some type of equivalent to the corrupt individuals and organizations we have in the US, and the extent of their influence on Russian society for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come to realize the perspective of most Americans and subsequently our media is still heavily indoctrinated by CIA anti-Communist Cold War era propaganda, primarily the Game Theory ideals of self-interested action. It's a very foreign concept for many Americans (especially those on the right) to conceive of politicians and government being trusted and working towards and serving the greater good. With a lengthy history of good reason for suspicion of our own government and the fact that the concept of altruism goes against Capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the simplistic black and white, good v. evil narrative we have been fed, it's incredibly difficult to get an accurate and unbiased account of Russia without someone resorting to some kind of outright demonization, and on the flip-side that same narrative has kept many Americans from accepting or coming to terms with the innumerable atrocities committed by our own government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just haven't seen Russian leadership or their media resorting to the same scare tactics and threats as are used in the US, and I admit that very likely is due to my own limited perspective. The funny thing though, is that Russian politicians and their media don't even have to do anything to make the US look stupid, because they do a pretty good job of that themselves. It's the insecurity and paranoia, it's like letting a crazy person make a ridiculous spectacle of themselves. The Russians probably learned that from watching the delusional insanity of Joe McCarthy which spun out of control and ended his career.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the rumors and gossip about Russian propaganda, I just don't see it or the monolithic bogeyman conservatives have painted no matter how much they rage and scream. There's never any solid objective sources. They point to a couple of small questionable instances of corruption and blow it out of proportion and claim the sky is falling. I've yet to see something major like an Iran Contra Affair or Fast and Furious scandal equivalent, but I admit it all seems to good to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR? I know Russia and Putin aren't perfect, all I want to see is a solid objective account that doesn't degrade into irrational fearmongering.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pathetic and ridiculous that people can't say anything good about Putin or Russia without being called a shill.

       Human beings are really easy to manipulate when you literally define their concept of self. The magnitude of the indoctrination we experience during our formative years cannot be overstated. I think it may be a long time before you can have an objective, rational discussion about any damn thing on a large open public forum such as this.

       They were the enemies of freedom, but a system based on (at that time) oppression of different races and exploitation of the poor that had a government which routinely overthrew democratic, popular and not even that radical regimes and replaced them with tyrannical autocrats were not?

       communists. Many of the people who were hunted by McCarthy's lot were just concerned citizen activists fighting for better conditions for the poor who got demonized as evil agents of an evil empire. Anyone who was left-wing was called a communist.

       Frankly, though, the idea that there is any one ideology which is the enemy/friend of freedom is nonsense.

       excellent, recent, non-biased talk about Ukraine and specifically Putins history, between Ryan Dawson And James Corbett:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/interview-836-ryan-dawson-looks-for-a-third-way-in-the-ukraine-crisis/">
        http://www.corbettreport.com/interview-836-ryan-dawson-looks-for-a-third-way-in-the-ukraine-crisis/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin is not a nice man, but he is a nationalist. He used the Oligarchs to get into power, and then he turned on the fuckers, using his ties to organized crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can shit on Putin all you want, but 92-93 russia was a fucking hellhole, and he definitely changed many things for the better. The Oligarchs would have sacrificed the russian people witout batting an eye and Putin would never do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This podcast really shows how people fall into the trap that they must choose a side; just because I hate the evil that the american government commits, doesnt mean I should side with the other psychopath opposing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should side with people, in this case the ukranians. Putin will probably be a better deal for Ukraine in the long run, but then again he cares about Russia, and its interests, not about ukranians.
      </p>
      <p>
       neither does the EU or the "west" obviously, but its just not that fucking simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       I urge everyone to give this a listen, its a great conversation, lots of history on Putin, Dawson is a fuckin scholar no doubt

       You are kind of falling into the trap of not seeing things the right way. There is no difference between Ukranians and Russians other than the ones Imagined by the western media who do not care and Western Ukranians who frankly just want to blame Russians for everything. Now don't get me wrong I am not advocating take over of Ukraine by Russia they chose self rule and should have the right to live with it however if part of Ukraine like Crimea wants to rejoin Russia after 40 years they should also have a right to do so.

       hmm, Im no expert but I wonder how ukranians would feel about the statement that there "is no difference between ukranians and russians.."
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I know there is actually more russian spoken in ukraine than ukranian, but Im assuming they have their own identity, their relations sure havent always been friendly with russia.

       You cant expect there to be only light without shadows. No one can be perfectly good. He is a good leader. Being a leader means that one must lead not being led.

       It's just stunning to me that a man who controls the government, controls the media, kills his detractors and rules with an iron fist is so revered here, while the exact same people who love Putin complain that Obama is so horrible.

       It is worth noting that Putin also has quite a bit of popular support in Russia. In fact, in the context of world leaders, he is at the very top as far as popular support goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       People seem to overlook the fact that he has done some evil things and that he has undermined the rule of the people, because he has also implemented policies that have been what the people wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, in the West we all view the anti-homosexual legislation as a bad thing. It's a human rights violation, no doubt. However, in Russia this was a very popular policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that people need to realize not everyone shares the same values and many Russians are highly nationalistic. Putin is exactly the kind of leader that many of them want.

       The thing about recent events is this, Russia has been after the Ukrainian land for centuries and many atrocities have happened to the Ukrainian people at the hands of the Russians.
       <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/the-problem-with-ukraine-s-history-the-russian-version-1.2561394">
        Here is a good article discussing some of the higher level aspects of this.
       </a>
       And what of things like the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuev_Circular">
        Valuev Circular
       </a>
       of 1863 that banned the publication of religious texts and educational texts written in the Ukrainian language?
      </p>
      <p>
       While, in my opinion, Putin is a creep, this really isn't about Putin. This has been going on forever. While the situation in the Ukraine is a very complicated one, I think that the Ukrainians should be allowed to sort this out for themselves. We can't let Russia once again swoop in and try to steal the land just because the Ukraine is in a weakened state.

       It isn't that in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new ukraine government is USA backed. They are reports that the original Ukraine protesters were USA backed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Ukraine joins the EU / N.A.T.O, Then that will allow the USA to put their own military bases in Ukraine, which would mean that Russia will be completely surrounded. Not to mention the USA would want a say in the control of the energy lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin has been smart to protect his interests. He knows what the USA has in mind. And as far as I know not a single civilian died while he did it. Could the USA take over a territory without a single death?
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin has opened the doors to Russia's people, to protect them. This is going to get messy, quickly.

       I actually agree with your concern. That's why I specifically stated that the Ukraine should be left alone to deal with the inner turmoil themselves. I mean that in that both sides should stay out.

       Exactly. Yes, their government needs to change and is corrupt, but who's isn't? Heh, Russia... the olympics are a prime example that they suffer from the same corruption. Why build something proper? Instead, we will bring the inspectors into the scam and we will all be kept calling back to fix shit we should have done right in the first place. It's really down to those basics.

       Americans like to twist the "no sexuality displayed in front of children" thing into hating gays. It's perfectly legal to be gay in Russia. You just can't do it out on the streets, where it would disturb most people. You can't expect an entire country with a long, hard, history, with orthodox christain roots, to transform overnight. If you look into the history of it, gay rights have improved dramatically in the past two decades in Russia, and transgender operations are legal. How many years has it taken the USA to get to where we are? Christ, give it some time, they're just becoming economically stable.

       All politics aside, I like to imagine how some other world leaders feel when they get together.  Our politicians are a bunch of lawyers and trust fund babies that bought their way into office.  Putin is a trained KGB agent with proficiency in multiple martial arts.  You can have all the military might behind you but when you stand next to someone who you know can kill you with his bare hands must make you feel inadequate.

       For your #1) All those people who Putin threw in jail were the people who put him in power. He was a pencil pusher for the KGB, and the illegal alcohol, weapons, so on that got in through the corrupt officials came through him. Then they put him into power and he throws them in jail.

       It's pronounced with the D sound. Either spelling is correct in the English translation of the Chinese glyph. My point was the proper variation of the term you intended to use was (in your preferred spelling) Daoist (or, as I said originally, Taoist) mindset. Daoistic (Taoistic) - the 'ic' ending is redundant.
