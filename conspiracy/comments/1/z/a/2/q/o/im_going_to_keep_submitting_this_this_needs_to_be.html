       I've been involved in the vaccine debates for a little over a year. I am also a nurse and have personally seen many adults suffering from serious vaccine injury as well. The most common injury I have seen is vaccine induced MS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue here is actually so much more complex. Some people want you to believe that autism is purely a genetic condition, some that it is purely environmental influences (toxins in our environment, gmo prevalence, etc), and others (the most hated of all) that it is caused by vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is actually an issue of all three. You see throughout the years as medicine gets more and more advanced, more people with genetic abnormalities and autoimmune disorders survive and procreate. Constant exposure to harmful environmental toxins furthers these autoimmune issues by introducing toxic substances into bodies that are no longer capable of properly processing and safely removing them from the system. Then, you have vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a child with a predisposition for autoimmune disease, and then bypass all of the bodies natural defenses against toxins and pollutants (skin,mucous membranes etc) by injecting vaccines directly into the body tissue. Now, this wouldn't be a problem without the mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, and other substances used as preservatives in the vaccines that are now in the child's system. Let's say that the child has mitochondrial disorder and now at a base cellular level the child cannot rid their body of the toxins so where do they go? They stockpile and build up and start to eat away wherever they are deposited through the vessels after absorption from the injection site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend searching for YouTube videos on the affect of aluminum and mercury on brain cells. Autism is brain damage, plain and simple. Some are just more susceptible than others which is why there are some non-vaccinated children that have it. This is also why there remain children that are vaccinated without issue. The problem is, especially with the vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC, by the time you find out your child cannot handle vaccines, it's too late. The damage has been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I did not get vaccinated while pregnant, and will not allow my child to be vaccinated for anything until after 5 years of age. At that point my husband and I will be doing a thorough risk benefit analysis of each individual vaccine and potential side effects, as well as the symptoms and potential complications of the disease to be vaccinated against with its prevalence in our area.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: jennymccarthybodycount.com is in no way a reputable source of information. It is a sensationalist website that cherry picks info from the CDC in an attempt to dissuade those who would choose not to vaccinate. I am honestly sick and tired of seeing this website pop up in this thread so I'm going to discredit it here:
No provable cases of autism caused by vaccines - FALSE (source -
       <a href="http://www.safeminds.org/news/documents/Holland%20Conte%20Krakow%20Colin.pdf">
        http://www.safeminds.org/news/documents/Holland%20Conte%20Krakow%20Colin.pdf
       </a>
       )
The rest of information is simply stating the number of vaccine preventable illnesses/deaths in a given time period, it does not in any way compare data to before the anti-vax movement nor does it show in any way how any of these illnesses or deaths have been caused by those who choose not to vaccinate. 
Please for the love of all that is holy stop posting this website, it's making you look horrendously uneducated.

       Okay, let's talk about the linked PR release. The documents kept "under tight wraps" is from 1997-1999. The press release acts like this is shocking and new information, but it's been known for quite some time. For example, here's a 2005 powerpoint by someone else in the anti-vaccination crowd citing the same information:
       <a href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com/ppp/1-11.ppt">
        Link
       </a>
       . Still, the relative risk of 7.6 cited in the study is indeed alarming. The researchers were alarmed by it too! So more studies were conducted after the cited preliminary one, and you can even read some of their abstracts online:
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14595043">
        Here's one!
       </a>
       They found no connections between Thimerosal and autism. Subsequent studies (the ones recommended by that abstract!) have backed up the no correlation findings.

       Once again, you should have read the article. At the time the information you provided was released there was no knowledge that anyone outside of the researcher was aware of the studies results. The purpose in the article I have posted is to show that the CDC did in fact know of a link. Hence the continual assertions that there have NEVER been studies that substantiate an autism vaccine link are false. 
The point is this information had to be obtained through over 100 requests through the freedom of information act. It is NOT public knowledge.

       The study you and the article are referencing concluded that there was no link. Here's the complete text of the study:

        Conclusions.
        <strong>
         No consistent significant associations
        </strong>
        were found between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Conflicting results were found at different HMOs for certain outcomes. For resolving the conflicting findings, studies with uniform neurodevelopmental assessments of children with a range of cumulative thimerosal exposures are needed.

       In phase one of the study researchers found significant increase in neurological deficits. In phase two, no significant deficits. As pointed out by the president of safe minds in a rebuttal, the CDC used non-mercury containing vaccines and claimed that they did in fact contain mercury, after this was pointed out, the response was essentially -well yes but that doesn't change our findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       'We used documented information on vaccine type and manufacturer to determine the thimerosal content of specific vaccines. The table was meant to illustrate the most common combinations of vaccines and amounts of (estimated) mercury received at several ages. There were a vast number of possible vaccine combinations adding up to various amounts of mercury at different ages. A complete table of all possibilities would have been unwieldy for a journal article.'

       Can you source this? The closest I could find was Verstraeten changing the zero exposure group from only those with no mercury in their system to those with less than 25 mcg in their systems in the second trial.

       It's not that I don't understand your point, and I'm sure you will always be able to provide a study showing that vaccines are completely safe. My point is that vaccines are not safe for EVERYONE. I am not anti-vaccine in the most basic sense. I am pro-safe vaccines. I don't think that anyone will dispute that mercury and aluminum are not completely safe substances. And the point that I am trying to make is that for children who do not have the ability to remove these harmful substances from their bodies the vaccines can cause brain damage due to the substances used to preserve. If this was a completely unfounded claim, the government would not have awarded damages to families in this exact situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as I originally stated, by the time you find out that your child is one of the ones that cannot handle vaccines, it's too late, brain damage has already occurred.

       You and your husband running your own risk/benefit analysis on each vaccine is pretty much the definition of the Dunning-Kruger effect: two incompetents thinking they have the competency to self-evaluate something they are completely unqualified to do.

       Than she is one of the least educated nurses I have ever heard of. It is a part of my job to understand medications, toxins and how the body, healthy or in a diseased state, excretes or fails to excrete these substances. Not to mention it is a part of my job to educate patients on vaccines and many other topics. My colleagues and I frequently read vaccine manufacturer inserts which more often than not directly contradict CDC vaccine recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
       All a risk benefit analysis requires is to look at potential complications and repercussions from either decision and make the choice that one is most comfortable with. I'm sorry if you and your wife are not endowed with enough understanding and reasoning abilities to do this for yourself. However, I am perfectly capable.

       I'm sorry, can you define for me exactly what you mean by "toxin"? Not only does it appear that you use the term "toxin" informally but you also seem to think your personal "reasoning abilities" is somehow scientific.

       You're literally proving my point about the Dunning-Kruger effect, and how you are the poster child of it. You don't define which colleagues you refer to, but I highly doubt they're MDs on the pediatric staff, and frankly, as a medical professional you should re-think your position.

       Actually my 'colleagues' are both MDs and fellow nurses. And since my 'personal reasoning abilities' are supplemented by years of study in both chemistry and physiology, I would say that they are perfectly adequate.

       RNs need an associates degree, but can also have bs, ms, or phd degrees. All of the nurses I work with have either an as or bs degree.

       Also, as evidenced by your history, you admit to graduating a ASN program just a year ago... As a recent graduate from the lowest educational level possible for an RN you feel qualified to judge competency levels of others in the field so quickly? Your educational preperation is very different from my own, as well as your experience level.

       If you look at it that way, neither does being an MD, a biomedical engineer or CDC official. I never claimed to be an expert.

       Ok so I will first link you to a leading neuroscientist at UC San Diego's Autism Center's latest article regarding brain growth and autism:
       <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/Mobile/article.aspx?articleid=196951">
        http://jama.jamanetwork.com/Mobile/article.aspx?articleid=196951

      <p>
       His name is Eric Courchesne and his research is supported by Autism Speaks. I am a vaccine advocate and I am currently doing some work with a documentary that Dr. Courchesne is in. He believes that based on the findings in this particular study, the brain overgrowth begins to occur in Autistic children prior to when they receive vaccinations so that it is impossible for Autism to be caused by vaccines! (Words spoken from his mouth directly and on film).
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article I linked above: " The brain volume increases could also reflect either aberrant compensatory responses to adverse prenatal conditions or deviant biological mechanisms that are first expressed in early postnatal life. Events and conditions, such as measles, mumps, and rubella vaccinations, childhood exposure to environmental toxins or pathogens, or unusual gastrointestinal or allergic reactions to food, that occur after the overgrowth are not logically plausible as causes. Although some may argue that such later occurring events might be important as aggravating factors, the key question remains—what triggers the abnormal brain overgrowth in the first months of life initially?"
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked another poster about personal experience. I have that as well. I survived meningococcal meningitis in 2003. I lost both legs, 2 fingers, have multiple skin grafts, kidney damage, primary adrenal insufficiency, fascial flaps to cover nerves that were exposed by areas of necrosis, cannot have children, and $2 million dollars+ of medical bills to prove it. I had serogroup C, vaccine preventable. The vaccine was not recommended for my age at the time. I have spent the last 11 years debating antivaxers who never seem to quite understand the full story. The amounts of preservatives left in vaccines are negligible- thimerosal is only in the flu and one or 2 others. Do you know what happens when preservatives are not used in injectable drugs? The New England compounding pharmacy fungal meningitis outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a nurse and I am sure you must be concerned with what is best for your family. I have no idea how old you are but you likely have never seen many of the diseases children are vaccinated for today. Some say that vaccines have become a victim of their own success. I truly hope you never have to see a VPD and I hope one never affects your family, but there are many many illnesses that can kill or permanently disable your child in a matter of hours. I had symptoms for about 5.5 hours before I was in septic shock and renal failure with a bp of 60/30. Imagine if something like that happened to your child and you had to live with the knowledge that you could have prevented it. Please reconsider protecting your child.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will leave you with one more link so you can read about how VPDs can affect perfectly healthy,  young children and their families:

       The link I have provided above details why his theory on 'brain overgrowth' is unlikely a feature or cause of autism due to the discrepancy of head size used as the control in research vs the generalized more rapid head circumference growth trend in today's youth.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I can tell this seems to be the basis of most of his theories regarding autism. Since it is based on data that is skewed I will disregard.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thanks, I am protecting my child. We would much rather have a child that is psychologically and mentally independent, than one who is completely whole physically should it come to that. My spouse and I have made peace with the fact that our child may contract one of the diseases vaccines are used to prevent. This is our burden to bear should it come to that. In the mean time, proper hand washing, keeping distance from others who are sick or who have travelled to foreign countries, and not allowing strangers to touch or be near my child will serve as effective means of protection.

       Yes, they become more expensive to produce and maintain and require more caution in storage. Any fungal outbreaks are a result of contamination or improper storage. I will take added cost over the mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde etc. any day.

       My mother is an ARNP. I am well aware of proper hygeine. My family is well off and I do not hang out in questionable places or with questionable people. Did not matter. You do realize that many children do, in fact, end up brain damaged and sometimes severely so from these diseases. I know children who have upwards of 50 seizures a day, have had their brains mapped and parts of their brains surgically removed (which still did not decrease the seizure activity for more than a few months), because of vaccine preventable illnesses. The two I am thinking of were both from pneumococcal disease.

       I was fortunate to have the care I had, when I did. A drug in phase III trials saved my life when I had a 0% chance of survival. (I had Waterhouse Friderichsen Syndrome,  mutiple organ failure,  DIC, and fulminant meningococcemia. I was in a coma and on full life support for almost 3 weeks). The thing is, I was perfectly healthy. There is no way to predict who will go into septic shock from meningococcal disease. Or who will get a secondary infection from something as seemingly minor as chickenpox. Or who will develop encephalitis from measles.

       Dr. Courchesne's paper that I linked was published in July 2013 so as of the time the documentary was being filmed, it was likely the most recent thing out there. I am admittedly a bit behind on my Autism reading this year but I will find some more current research that is peer reviewed and supported by a reputable autism or dd organization, and post it shortly. Autism Science Foundation is the best for up to date, peer reviewed info for scientifically literate people. Autism Speaks has also become a better source for evidence based information over the past few years. I will find some more recent articles (I have full access to medical journals at school) and post the PDFs if they are behind paywalls, later today.

       Since the percentage of people who have complications from vaccine preventable diseases (let alone the number of people who contract them in the US in the first place) is negligible compared to current autism rates in the country (1 in 50 children) I choose to go with the scenario that provides the smallest amount of risk to my child.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am well aware of the enormous efforts to disprove the vaccine autism link, I'm sure that there are literally hundreds of studies that will attempt to disprove a link. However, I find it hard to believe that if such a link were as nonexistent as we are led to believe that the US government would be providing settlements to families specifically because their child's autism was proven to have been caused by vaccines.

       It's hard to yell when the barrels in your mouth...  Her post is incredibly valid.  Now that we have the "outside observer" crowd from the incorrectly named subs ...myths, we get great posts such as this.  I don't know about you, but we see some many people ADAMANT that vaccines are 100% perfectly safe.  On the other side, we see countless.infants that are physically damaged immediately after being vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be foolish to think the two are now related.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have a nurse, a professional in the health industry telling us first hand that she has physically seen the damage they can potentially cause.  Now who seems more believableable? The from out of nowhere, yet perfectly timed internet dissuader, or the woman that is witnessing the information she is sharing with us first hand.

       There are not many shills claiming the dangers of vaccines.  We've seen their clear potential to harm, yet even questioning vaccines labels you as "nutty." They have a dedicated, controlled, and likely corrupted court for handling all vaccine cases.  This tells me much.  You can't have a jury trial if you're damaged.  You must go their route.  This tells me that vaccines are NOT as safe as they claim.  I personally do not find it surprising that this nurse shared personal experience with us.  I'm glad she did.  I would like to hear more first hand accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the flu vaccine, I haven't had one in years.  Guess what else I haven't had in the same number of years.   The goddamn flu.  I'm fairly certain they are providing live viruses in the vaccine, which makes many people sick immediately after their shot.  I don't find it necessary, and with the adulterants and preservatives added, it's incredibly risky to consume.  I feel all should research before pumping their children through needle after needle of unproven and potentially life threatening vaccines.

       Once again - here are cases where the US government has awarded damages to families who's children's autism was absolutely proven to be caused by vaccine injury.

       The vaccine court isn't proof of damage caused by vaccines, since the burden of proof uses the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. All you have to show is a temporal relationship (e.g., you for a vaccine and a couple of weeks later were diagnosed with autism).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an actual court, you have to prove damage beyond a reasonable doubt. But even with this standard, juries were awarding very large damages to families "damaged" by vaccines which, we later found out, couldn't cause the types of damages being argued.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say you're a nurse. Cool, my mom's a nurse, too. But I'm in pharmacy (an intern right now), and I know that even an MS in Nursing Practice doesn't provide sufficient education about vaccines. I know nurses that, to this day, still claim that the Mercury present in the MMR vaccine is responsible for the increase in autism diagnoses, despite the facts that both mercury and the MMR vaccine show no link, and that the MMR vaccine has been mercury free for almost 15 years.

       Meanwhile, you disregard every serious study done into autism and vaccinations and spread bullshit propagated by pornstars.  So yes, consider this an ad hominem attack.  The debate is already over.

       Every 'serious study' which would these be exactly, provide links. Also my information ( if you had bothered to read the article ) comes from the CDC itself and the studies they try to hide. The CDC is aware of the connection and yet you dispute it? You are aware that the American government has awarded settlements to numerous families due to the fact that their child's autism is a direct result of vaccinations.

       For anyone that can't see the article, it is information obtained from the freedom of information act that shows that the CDC has been aware of a 7.9 fold greater risk of autism in children exposed to vaccines for greater than ten years. Yet they continue to adamantly deny any vaccine autism connection.

       I get down voted too, a lot...It's ok, it let's me know I'm on the right track. Being popular usually tends to go with being a weak character. So be proud! There are many people listening, they are just not speaking much (yet)
      </p>
      <p>
       The more shutdowns you get, the more you should speak.

       This is the reason I'm commenting on this thread (something I'm doing because of being discouraged for years.) I knew you would be downvoted for promoting discussion and being real and rational and I absolutely loved your title, keep going!

        Selected vaccine authorities from CDC, FDA, and manufacturers discuss, in a closed meeting, the possibility of neurodevelopment disorders resulting from vaccine components
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: "This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “My gut feeling? It worries me enough. Forgive this personal comment, but I got called out at eight o'clock for an emergency call and my daughter-in-law delivered a son by C-section. Our first male in the line of the next generation, and I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on. It will probably take a long time. In the meantime, and I know there are probably implications for this internationally, but in the meantime I think I want that grandson to only be given Thimerosal-free vaccines."
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: The pro-vax folks' anti-intellectual "nothing to see here" campaign actively blocks and relieves pressure on finding safer alternatives.  I am convinced the industry would move faster to create safer vaccines if people were allowed to talk openly about it and thus demand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This discussion should not be a doctors-only closed-door meeting only made accessible to the public due to a FOIA request.

       I absolutely agree with this, however aluminum containing vaccines can be just as detrimental to neurological development. Both aluminum and mercury degrade and destroy brain cells. Aluminum has been replacing the mercury containing thimerosal as a preservative and should be watched just as closely. Personally I recommend that if you insist on vaccinating that all vaccines given should be 100% preservative free and that NO Tylenol be given afterwards. I know far too many people who post or pre medicate for vaccines with Tylenol which reduces antioxidants and prevents the natural immune response to disease and therefore lowering effectiveness.

       I think heavy antibiotic use should be looked at, too. There are major connections between immune system and neurological issues. Scientists are making a lot of headway in research related to gut bacteria; I'm kind of "long-bug" on this field of research. There's an interesting article about a study where introducing specific gut bacteria in mice reversing autistic-type behaviors here:

       I agree with you on healing the gut. The GAPS diet has helped many families. A huge component of which is probiotics. Our digestive system plays a much bigger role in overall health than most people realize. Thank you for sharing this!

       I absolutely agree with this, however aluminum containing vaccines can be just as detrimental to neurological development. Both aluminum and mercury degrade and destroy brain cells. Aluminum has been replacing the mercury containing thimerosal as a preservative and should be watched just as closely. Personally I recommend that if you insist on vaccinating that all vaccines given should be 100% preservative free and that NO Tylenol be given afterwards. I know far too many people who post or pre medicate for vaccines with Tylenol which reduces antioxidants and prevents the natural immune response to disease and therefore lowering effectiveness.

       Sources are littered throughout this thread. In addition to the sources I have already cited, I am going off of personal experience with multiple patients diagnosed with vaccine induced injuries as are my colleagues.
