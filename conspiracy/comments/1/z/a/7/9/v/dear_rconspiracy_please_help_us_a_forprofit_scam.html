Please follow us on Twitter for more updates: <a href="https://twitter.com/collegetimez">https://twitter.com/collegetimez</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Update #2: Neumont University has shared this page on Facebook and is having all of their people down-vote the story and our comments, as we expected, although it hasn&#39;t worked very well. Anyway thanks again for all your support, r/conspiracy!</p>

<hr/>

<p>Update #3: A former Neumont student&#39;s name previously mentioned in OP post has been removed. The student previously shared his negative experiences publicly across the web, but has apparently had a change of heart about Neumont after starting his own company in Salt Lake City and striking a lucrative recruitment deal with Neumont.</p>

<hr/>

<p>A quick summary of the insanity:</p>

<p>Neumont University was originally started at a shopping mall in Virginia. After abandoning their students in Virginia and moving to an office building in South Jordan, Utah, they found new investors (and eventually a new CEO, Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Levine) from the LDS Church and from Great Hill Partners, an investment group out of Boston. (Note: a few months ago, they left South Jordan and moved into the former Salt Lake Tribune newspaper building in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah.)</p>

<p>These partners originally included Gary D. Kennedy, a powerful businessman from Salt Lake City, Utah, who has been accused multiple times by the Securities and Exchange Commission of accounting fraud and cooking the books at various US companies.</p>

<p>They also had Eric Denna on their board of directors, who at the time was Managing Director of the LDS Church in Utah.</p>

<p>As they sought to expand, they realized that independent websites like ours (CollegeTimes) could not be bought. The negative student reviews on our website were costing them millions of dollars and kept them from scamming thousands of students.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collegetimes.tv/neumont-university/">http://www.collegetimes.tv/neumont-university/</a></p>

<p>At first, they tried to bribe us to delete pages, and then tried buying our website. When that didn&#39;t work, they filed a (2012) lawsuit against us in U.S. federal court, first claiming &#39;business disparagement&#39; and then later that we had tried to &#39;extort&#39; money from them.</p>

<p>When that still didn&#39;t work, their army of powerful lawyers tried to hijack our former web domain, collegetimes.us from Neustar.us (the official domain registrar for .US web domains) by claiming we were a fraudulent company and not a real American entity.</p>

<p>After all this failed, they sent &#39;private investigators&#39; after our family members to stalk them and try to scare them into having our team delete the CollegeTimes website from our servers.</p>

<p>After our families politely told them to fuck off, they tried to sneak in illegal attorney subpoenas to the pending lawsuit filings in order to uncover the identities of dozens of Wikipedia editors, users on Yahoo Answers, and other websites that told the truth about Neumont University such as various Google services, etc (which, predictably, also failed).</p>

<p>CollegeTimes then tried to publish a press release on this scary situation but Neumont&#39;s lawyers quickly pressured PRWeb and Yahoo News to delete our release, and it completely disappeared from the internet...</p>

<hr/>

<p>Where things stand today:</p>

<p>Neumont seems to use brainwashing and cult tactics on their students, many of whom appear to suffer from various personality disorders and have self esteem issues (Update: Yes, this is a broad and unfair statement without proof, but we are not going to name/shame students, check Twitter for one &#39;hacker!&#39; Neumont student who was apparently kicked out of the US Navy, we&#39;d suspect for psych reasons, and then accepted to Neumont...). However, a few students have been brave enough to come forward including Jason Aquino, who has been personally threatened by Neumont University CEO (and President) Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Levine.</p>

<p>Our team has tried hard to keep our website up and going through all of the threats, lawsuits, and subpoenas. However, Neumont has had great success in getting many web pages taken down across the internet using both &#39;legal&#39; and illegal tactics (bullying).</p>

<p>Today, we were shocked and amazed to see that somehow, this Mormon scam school from Utah had convinced Google to delete a key page on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/63nHJL6.png">Yahoo Answers</a> from all Google search results (Update: some datacenters still showing it):</p>

<p><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120206150420AA6AXLz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120206150420AA6AXLz</a></p>

<p>This page reveals a female student at Neumont who was sexually harassed multiple times, which the school tried to cover up. It also reveals how Neumont hosts &#39;pizza parties&#39; and forces their students to sit and write positive things about the school on websites all over the internet. Lastly, it talks about other important consumer protection information such as the fact that Neumont is not regionally accredited, and is connected with the Mormon (LDS) Church in Utah - all of which Neumont is trying desperately to hide.</p>

<p>If you are willing to help us get this story out, we and our families would be most grateful for your support. We expect Neumont will send their army of spammers to this subreddit in an attempt to discredit and vote down the story, but we thought it was worth a try.</p>

<p>Very sincerely and thank you,</p>

<p>CollegeTimes</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">25</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ryanelkins.html">ryanelkins</a> 2014-03-01</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Well, I see my name is being used here rather liberally and I don&#39;t think it is being used entirely accurately so, while I was tempted to just ignore it, I feel like I have to address this.</p>

<p>First things first - I think Neumont is a pretty good school. I&#39;m happy with the education I received there. I run a small tech company and I hire Neumont grads. I did have some issues with some of the leaders at Neumont which all occurred after I graduated.</p>

<p>Since I&#39;m being used as some sort of figurehead I feel my perception of this is relevant. CollegeTimes had a website where people could post reviews of schools. People were posting bad reviews of Neumont. This isn&#39;t really too surprising. The school is pretty tough. It also only offers a BS in CompSci (at least when I was there). How many people started with one major and switched to another? One problem is, at Neumont, you can&#39;t switch if a semester or two in you realize you hate/can&#39;t grok CompSci. Like most private schools, it&#39;s expensive, so people end up dropping out and have decent sized student loans with nothing to show for it. I get how that sucks for those people. I&#39;ve talked to many people over the years about Neumont and I always try to make sure they understand this aspect and that they are SURE about CompSci before they go. </p>

<p>With the above, you can see how people would write bad reviews. I can&#39;t speak for what recruiters may or may not have told people or comment on anyone&#39;s situation but my own, but I can imagine how there are a decent chunk of bitter people out there. I expect less than half the people that started any particular semester graduated. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure what happened (remember, this College Times stuff happened years after I graduated) but students/alumni became aware of the College Times site and started writing their own positive reviews. I posted my own, which was relatively positive (remember, I had my own issues with school execs AFTER I graduated). I know several other people personally that posted their own positive reviews and these were claimed to be shill posts. Believe it or not there are a lot of people that are very happy with the school. Despite my own run ins, I&#39;m also pretty happy with the education I received. </p>

<p>My feeling on a lot of this is that College Times wants this to be more than it is. What I see is a website that allows people to post reviews but College Times has decided that any positive review is a shill and deletes it. Neumont is obviously not too happy with that and are going after them about it. Is that the right thing for the school to do? I have no idea. I would argue that both sides are probably at fault here. </p>

<p>This post is obviously heavily slanted to their side of the story. I want to also address a few things that the post brought up:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Neumont doesn&#39;t &quot;use brainwashing and cult tactics&quot; on students. I don&#39;t know where this came from. It&#39;s absurd to even suggest it.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that Mormons are part of the school founders has no relevancy to this at all other than to act as some sort of conspiracy enhancer. Mormons start all sorts of businesses. I never saw or felt any kind of &quot;Mormon influence&quot; (whatever that even means) in anything the school did. I don&#39;t see any connections to the Mormon church other than the fact that some of the people that started it are members (and obviously have ties to other Mormon business people - the school is in Utah after all). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>With all that being said, if Neumont is doing all this stuff to whoever this College Times guy is, then sure, that sucks. However, I don&#39;t find the information being reported fully credible, so it makes me second guess their claims. </p>

<p>To <a href="/u/collegetimes">/u/collegetimes</a> :</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really appreciate you name dropping me and using me as a representative for your side of the story. I didn&#39;t consent to you using my name and I don&#39;t agree with how you&#39;re handling this situation.  I think you&#39;ve lost objectivity and are simply out to hurt the school as much as possible at this point, regardless of what the truth actually is. Whether Neumont is deserving of it or not, I do not know, but you&#39;re not an innocent victim in this affair. You don&#39;t know me, I don&#39;t know you (you don&#39;t seem inclined write your own real name on this while happily throwing mine around) and we have never talked. You&#39;ve pieced my story together from web posts, Twitter statuses, and old blog posts. </p>

<p>TL;DR : Might be something there, but I doubt it. A lot of BS and trying to make something from nothing. OP uses me as a poster child, I don&#39;t approve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can think for myself thank you very much. I am angry not only because you are shaming a school that I am proud of but I am angry because you are labeling me and my peers something that we are not. We are not brain washed, we are not mormon cult influenced, we are not dumb, we are not victims, we are not idiots, and no one is buying into your lies. We are all smart individuals, we are all bright students, we are all busting our ass off to get a degree that will get us a job, get us money, and get us a life. I&#39;ve left my family, my friends, my social life, and more to drive 800 miles not once but twice every 3 months to come to this school, deal with all the stresses that comes from a rigorous but great curriculum, deal with all of the pain and loneliness of living on my own away from those that I love (and before you use this for your own good I have made great friends at Neumont and I love them to death)... I go through all of this because Neumont gave me a chance, when California schools did not, to work, learn, and make a life for myself. 
My parents did not leave their family behind to move away from Egypt (where we are from) to come here to America, raise a family, pay several 10s of thousands of dollars for my college education only to see some bullshit website to come out of no where and say that I am being brain washed, I am victim of a cult, and that I cannot think for myself. This is not an act of justice that you are doing... what you are doing is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!</p>

<p>Over here at Neumont we are not having a pizza party and bending over to faculty to do there every whim... you know what we are doing? We are reading everything your website says about us... we are reading it and guess what we are doing? We are laughing. We are laughing at the hilarious claims that you are making. We are laughing at all the shit that you&#39;re giving us and our school. </p>

<p>You think by posting here on reddit you are hiding from the school? We know about this... we have reported it to faculty... not because we are there lapdog... not because we are brain washed to report this to them... NO IT IS NOT BECAUSE WE CANNOT THINK FOR OURSELVES BECAUSE WE ARE VICTIMS OF A MORMON CULT! I am doing this because I love my school and I cannot stand to see crap like this being said about it. No one told me to write this and I am not brain washed to write this. I am writing this out of my own free will.</p>

<p>So piss off and waste someone else&#39;s time and money because I would rather my school spend their resources on something that can benefit us over having to deal with assholes like you.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rafik. A Neumont student who is in his 6th quarter, who is not brain washed, who is not a victim, and is not at a pizza party and is being forced to write this. This is a Neumont student who can think for himself and can see through your bullshit lies.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a classmate of Ryan&#39;s at Neumont University in the South Jordan campus.  In fact I, and I think Ryan, started when it was still Northface University.  The two numbered points that Ryan made are spot-on.  The &quot;brainwashing and cult tactics&quot; claim is absurd.  The second point is also very true.  I work in a small office in Midvale, UT, and approximately half of our office is Mormon.  It&#39;s not some huge conspiracy--it&#39;s Utah.</p>

<p>OP was wrong from the very first sentence.  Neumont University wasn&#39;t started in a shopping mall in Virginia.  Northface (now Neumont) was originally in Cottonwood Heights, UT.  I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head, but I think the first quarter of students moved to the South Jordan campus in 2004.  The Virginia campus didn&#39;t open until 2007, and from what I remember was a disaster largely due to zoning issues.  The zoning issues forced Neumont to move to the shopping mall.  Ned Levine wasn&#39;t a part of the picture until the Virginia/2007 time frame.</p>

<p>To <a href="/u/collegetimes">/u/collegetimes</a> :</p>

<p>I&#39;m with Ryan on this one.  If Neumont is doing any of what you claimed, then it has gotten out of hand.  However, given the gross inaccuracy of many of your claims, you are not doing yourself any favors here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was my understanding that the shopping mall fiasco was caused because of zoning issues during the construction of the VA campus.  They ended up using the shopping mall as a temporary space, and cut their losses after a quarter.  As another alumnus mentioned in another reply, the students at the VA campus were offered scholarships to transfer to the South Jordan campus.</p>

<p>I have no doubts that I have missed out on things since I graduated.  My point is that I find your claims about the LDS involvement, brainwashing, and cult-like attitude of the university so wildly inaccurate that in calls into question the basis of any of your claims.  It was simply never an issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.  As I said, Neumont left Virginia because the intended new campus construction went belly up due to zoning, which ended up causing the shopping mall/Panda Express fiasco.</p>

<p>They never opened a campus in Providence.  They were having discussions with local and state government officials, and it never left that phase.  From what I understand they are now pursuing something similar in MA as a result.  I would have to say that the Providence issue is more of a political issue rather than educational.  This sort of thing happens all the time in business.  It seems like every day the folks over at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are posting something about &quot;XYZ Corp. abandons plans to open Somewhereville, Some State, campus after tax break talks fall apart.&quot;  They also never left the Utah campus.  They have changed locations three times--from Cottonwood Heights to South Jordan, and then to downtown Salt Lake City last year.  To my knowledge, no classes were taught at the Cottonwood Heights campus.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t understand all of the Mormon conspiracies.  It simply was not an issue.  Some of the management and faculty are Mormon.  One of my roommates while I was a student was Mormon.  It literally never came up.</p>

<p>None of this was told to me by the school.  I was a student around the same time as Jason Aquino (he started in April 2005, myself in July 2005), and we seem to have had radically different experiences.  I sympathize with him for the way things seem to have worked out, but it is unfair to say that his experience is the norm.  It sounds like Jason had issues with the program, and at the time (and possibly still today) the narrow offering of degrees combined with national accreditation is not a good combination for his situation.</p>

<p>This is the kind of misinformation that leads me to not trust you in your claims. I thought you&#39;d know by now (7 years after the fact) that the school being relocated &quot;next to a Panda Express&quot; in a mall was a <strong>result</strong> of the zoning issues with the actual campus building. I know you have a bone to pick with Neumont but, again, I thought you&#39;d at least be able to spout actual facts to support your case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting, Ryan. You (or Neumont) sure found this post fast.</p>

<p>We figured with your public interaction on Twitter re: Neumont you invited your story to be told, especially after allowing us to retweet your experiences multiple times in the past few years and after following us on Twitter, and after having used your name in multiple articles on our website seemingly with your full support as you were aware of them for many months. You have even commented on our website multiple times, so it seems a bit funny that you are now playing both sides of the story.</p>

<p>It appears that Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Levine has contacted you? Were you paid to stop saying bad things about Neumont? What sort of arrangement do you have with Neumont University in order to hire their new graduates to your company? What a shame IF your moral convictions have taken less precedence over making a profit...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I expect less than half the people that started any particular semester graduated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...wow... that is pretty insane. How could anyone with a conscience shill for a school after witnessing this?</p>

<p>As far as shill posts on our website, are you aware that even Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Levine admitted to posting his own fake positive reviews of Neumont that were against our Terms of Service? Or that he bribed students to leave positive reviews? etc.</p>

<p>There are plenty of highly respected schools that love our website. Only for-profit scam schools hate us.</p>

<p>P.S. We published an interview with Jason Aquino, and would be happy to publish one with you as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, changed to IF</p>

<p>Neumont has multiple &#39;hiring&#39; agreements in Utah, most of which are small Mormon-controlled startups.</p>

<p>This is how they falsely inflate their &#39;employment&#39; rate to an alleged 100% of graduates. Firstly, a large number of students are seemingly pushed to drop out before graduation if they aren&#39;t &#39;smart&#39; enough. Secondly, the ones that do graduate are sent to partner startup companies for at least a few months -- a.k.a. &#39;hired&#39;...</p>

IBM is genuinely interested in the students exiting the program so they can get great employees. You may or may not know this but the world is kind of in a shortage when it comes to software engineers, especially quality ones, so companies will make efforts at grabbing the loyalty of grads as fast as possible so they can have a higher chance of meeting their talent needs. </p>

<p>Why do you think all of Neumont&#39;s employment &#39;partners&#39; are now tiny Mormon startups in Utah, like the one founded by former Neumont student Ryan Elkins (as mentioned above), most of which shut down within a few years?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they were employment partners, you did. They have &quot;Enterprise&quot; partners, which are companies that have &quot;Enterprise&quot; projects for students in their last few quarters. This is more akin to sponsored internships than employment. After you&#39;ve completed your degree there is no guarantee of employment from any of these companies. Those companies aren&#39;t required to employee anyone either. I think if anything this particular program suffers from businesses not wanting to provide projects for students because it requires a lot more management than a normal project as you are attempting to train 4+ students on a team. If done well it could provide a business value of having a affordable jump start on your project, but I think only small companies are interested in making a bet on something like that. The best ones in my opinion were the ones where I went onsite to the company and integrated with full time employees instead of being only on a team with other Neumont grads. </p>

<p>So, I think you are misinterpreting the growing pains and challenges by a more unique way of doing internships. </p>

<p>Now stop bringing Mormons into this, as it really has nothing to do with the school or the businesses. At neumont I had several Moromon and Non-mormon friends and associates. I knew, from others that had met the founder previously, that founder of the school was mormon but that never was a factor. I was a mormon and am an Ex-Mormon and there is no mormonism in that school. I now loath the mormon church and I would never want anybody to suffer from it, but I have no problems recommending Neumont to someone if they are truly interested in software development. </p>

<p>What you are seeing and relating to &quot;brain washing&quot; are those that would be equally attached to their school had they attended any other University. We valued our experience at Neumont and feel it has value and merit. As Alumni&#39;s we do have a vested interest in the reputation of our school and our degrees. We also had a tight-knit community while we were there and when you spread false information and conspiracies we are going to defend it. That isn&#39;t brain washing, that&#39;s community.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found this post quickly because Neumont has a lot of alumni and as you may imagine from a bunch of CompSci majors, we tend to use Reddit a lot. I saw on Facebook and from personal messages that someone was throwing my name around and was directed to this post.</p>

<p>So you figured that because of my Twitter posts you knew the whole story and could freely tell it to anyone to use as vindication for your side of the story? I can&#39;t control who retweets my stuff. I didn&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; you to do so, you just did it. I also can&#39;t control what you put on your website. I didn&#39;t know that that you used my name in &quot;multiple articles&quot; and was not &quot;aware of them for many months&quot; (this is the first time I&#39;ve heard about it) and certainly wasn&#39;t in &quot;full support&quot; of what you&#39;re doing. I haven&#39;t &quot;commented on our website multiple times&quot;. I believe I only left one review (this was 2 years ago). In which I stated much of what I said earlier - that the school is tough, not for everyone, but a good school if you fit the profile.</p>

<p>No one has contacted me. I don&#39;t currently have any relation with anyone involved in running the school. I hire Neumont grads because they are good at their jobs and I know a bunch of them. I&#39;d hire more but they are generally very expensive as well because they make a lot of money. I never had a problem with the students, alumni, or quality of education (while I was there - no idea what it&#39;s like now). I had some drama with a few key people at the school but that doesn&#39;t invalidate the school as a whole. You have to learn to separate individuals from institutions. </p>

<p>Neumont was an intense school. The curriculum moved fast. When it comes to CompSci I&#39;ve found that for some people it clicks and is easy, and for some it just never makes any sense and they really struggle with it. People dropped for all sorts of reasons - they weren&#39;t ready for the intensity (about equivalent to normal job environment - but compare that to a traditional school where you only have class ~3 hours a day), CompSci never &quot;clicked&quot; for them, they&#39;d rather stay home and play World of Warcraft all day, etc. That&#39;s right, a decent amount of people drop out because THEY NEVER SHOWED UP. You&#39;d see them on day 1 or on test days and that was it. Like i said before, I feel bad for the ones that tried hard and just couldn&#39;t get it. There was no recourse for them. I talked to a lot of people contemplating Neumont and I always told them they needed to be sure they wanted to do CompSci BEFORE they got there. Take programming classes online or at a community college or something - make sure it&#39;s something you&#39;re excited about. I&#39;m not shilling for anyone but I&#39;d still make that suggestion to anyone who wants to go there.</p>

<p>As for shill posts on your site, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find out that school execs were posting fake reviews. I never heard of any bribes for reviews. I do know you deleted a bunch of real reviews left by real alumni though. Believe it or not, Neumont is a polarizing school - people mostly either love it or hate it. You seem to be unable to accept that there are people who like the school. </p>

<p>As I said before, you need to learn to separate the school from people who work at the school. I am very glad I went to Neumont. I&#39;m happy with the education I received. I have had issues with people who work at Neumont. They have done things to me in the past that make me believe that there is some truth to your story. However, that&#39;s an issue between you and the current administration, not between you and the school. It has no relevancy to the quality of the school. You&#39;ve gotten to the point where you are lashing out at anyone who supports the school and call them a shill for sharing their opinion. It&#39;s hard to support you when there are obvious falsities in your story. Your credibility is shot by stretching the truth and false accusations.</p>

<p>There are a lot of non-accredited colleges out there. Just because it&#39;s located in SLC does not mean the LDS church supports it. They only support BYU in Provo, BYU-Hawaii, BYU- Idaho, and LDS Business College. That&#39;s it OP.</p>

<p>Fact is after readin the Yahii Answers page comments. One denoted this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would also like to add that if any of the staff are indeed Mormon, i don&#39;t even know it because they don&#39;t share info like that, nor does religion make any difference in how you will be treated. 
this is a mainly mormon community that the school is in. Since ~80% of the students are out of state, we have a great diversity on campus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also the supposed members you list I cannot find in the church directory, and basically even jf they were members. That does not mean that it is sponsored by the church. There are lots of so called crap Saints IMO that are not always honest. Just look at Mitt Romney (yes i&#39;m disappointed in him) and his business dealings. Fact is we have people who join to prey upon those in the church for MLM purposes. That&#39;s my big peeve. </p>

<p>Nope and I have access to the whole church directory world wide on the MLS  as Ward Clerk, and don&#39;t say I don&#39;t have access. I can see the First presidency and all the other leadership to contact.</p>

<p>For months, the LDS listserv email servers were sending traffic to our website from all over Utah... after we finally took screenshots and wrote about it, the LDS Church tried to hide it and stopped linking our pages:</p>

<p>The email server lists.lds.org, which is responsible for distributing private email newsletters to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, appears to be sending visitors to recent CollegeTimes articles highlighting Neumont University, a for-profit Utah institution that has repeatedly denied any affiliation with Mormonism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this server links to all LDS.org Newsroom feeds so members can see anything with association to the church in the news. be it this one, or SLC Tribune, or NY Times, Deseret, or CNN etc...</p>

<p>If members see it and feel like responding that&#39;s their right. just like me and many do on reddit.</p>

<p>Even the blog you posted admitted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neumont’s administrators and student employees have repeatedly denied any official, or unofficial, connection with Mormonism, despite all of Neumont’s founders (Graham Doxey, Scott McKinley, and Marlow Einelund) being Mormon, and despite many of Neumont’s current investors being Mormon, and despite a predominant student club existing on the small campus known as the Latter-Day Saints Student Association. (The LDSSA is a student organization affiliated with the LDS Church, managed by their Church Educational System department.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because they are members and attend church. Regarding business and education. Church funds nor leadership have anything to do with this university. it sits in Mormon central and will naturally have Mormon students.</p>

<p>Which brings me to another reason why they are not afilliated with the Church. All Church sponsored schools have a strict student Honor code of conduct like this:</p>

<p>(<a href="http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2013-2014ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php">http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2013-2014ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php</a>)</p>

<p>This university has no code of conduct, and if you noticed. Even the supposed Mormons modeling on the university website. They are not even wearing the Magical Undergarments you guys like to make fun of.</p>

<p>Sheesh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you say you have access, you have access. Eric Denna was a <em>former</em> Managing Director, not a current one, and his information is below (or search Google). The issue is not so much whether the LDS Church is directly or officially involved with Neumont University. Of course Neumont wants to distance themselves from the LDS, otherwise non-Mormon students would not enroll. Neumont doesn&#39;t care a thing about religion or Mormonism, on the surface. But like other money-driven companies in Utah connected to powerful members of the LDS network, they use the Church community to get what they want.</p>

<p>All Mormons know (or should know) that half of what goes on at the LDS Church is not &#39;official&#39; -- for a reason. Nearly all colleges and universities in Utah, even the (now) public ones, were originally established by the LDS Church, i.e. University of Utah. This is the entire issue with Utah, that government agencies, local courts, IRS offices, public universities, and so forth are all supposed to be public entities without influence from &#39;religious&#39; groups, and yet, because its Utah, the lines are extremely blurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cause the Mormon Church is the dictatorship of Utah and controls everything from Neumont university to BYU and all of us college students are brain washed, anti-social, wackos who spend their entire college life kissing ass to faculty and writing reviews at pizza parties. Oh and we have these religious ceremonies where we pray to the school building in hopes that bs organizations like collegetimes would stop attempting (keep in mind I said attempting and not succeeding) to ruin the image of a great school that try to give their students a great foundation for their business, financial, and social aspects of their lives.</p>

<p>Oh and everything before &quot;bs organization...&quot; is sarcasm just in case you turn this around and use it against me... and I will screen shot this so that you there is proof of the original post in the hands outside of the reddit database.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello Reddit and hello CollegeTimes.</p>

<p>First off, before anyone comments about this, yes I just created an account and yes, this is my first post. I do not follow Reddit often, and often don&#39;t care to post.</p>

<p>Now that that is out of the way, I would like to cover a few things regarding this post and the other comments that I have read. I am a current Neumont Student who has been attending since 2011. I am a well-known member of the Neumont community and many at Neumont will know who I am instantly by my username. I am in the Game and Software Development Degree. I am hired by the school as a Student Associate. I have started and run a number of clubs in the school. I came to Utah from a small farm town and school in Wisconsin. I have no regrets. I found this thread due to another student posting it on Facebook. I am posting this of my own free will and am of no way forced nor bribed to comment on this.</p>

<p>Now that my status has been set, let me start going through your post. </p>

<p>The beginnings of Neumont have no correlation to the current school. There were business plans that failed. End of story. The rhyme and reason don&#39;t matter to the current argument at hand. Yes, the school has had many run-ins with OP. No, I do not know what has been happening fully as that is not the students&#39; concern, just like how low-level employees don&#39;t know what happens behind closed doors in most businesses. And yes, we are often treated as employees by management. As the school is focused on getting us ready for the business world, most students don&#39;t have a problem with that. </p>

<p>Now, on to the brainwashing and cult tactics and the slander of the students. Please tell me where that information comes from, and don&#39;t just post your site. I would like to see actual sources. I have yet to meet someone who has a &quot;personality disorder&quot; that you don&#39;t find everywhere. Self esteem issues is something that often happens when smart kids who breezed through high school (and most of the students that I know did exactly that) find that school isn&#39;t as easy and that they are not the top of the pack. That is exactly what happened to me. I am still envious of how bright some of the people at the school are. However, I feel that that is human nature and is something to work on getting over. </p>

<p>About brainwashing: I don&#39;t know what you are talking about. And, before the argument is brought up, yes I do know that brainwashing happens all the time without the person being brainwashed knowing. However, if there was any attempts to brainwash me, they all happened because I asked about things that were happening. Any other &quot;brainwashing&quot; attempt would be to have pride in the school I am attending, which is the same as every other college out there.</p>

<p>Cult tactics: Again, besides the school pride, I do not know of any cult tactics. Yes, we have a club that is Mormon based. We are located in Utah, after all. I expected things like this to be there. Yes, plenty of my instructors are Mormon. However, I can only name, for a fact, two that are. The only reason I know about that is because we have joked with them and listened to humorous stories about their lives that revealed that they are Mormon. The only way that I have learned anything at all about Mormonism is from what I have asked others about. I am a non-Mormon Christian, but I also like to be informed of how others view the world, which leads to me gaining information about Mormonism. No one has ever attempted to convert me in any way.</p>

<p>As for the Yahoo post (of which I am mentioned by Sweet, a former roommate), I (again) do not know what Neumont is doing with the page. It doesn&#39;t concern me as a student. I feel sorry for the female student. However, I am friends with most of the current female students at the school, and have heard of many more issues with other females than with males. As for the mentioned &quot;pizza parties&quot;: yes, we have pizza for events all the time. No, I have never been forced to write positive reviews for the school. Yes, I am writing a positive review now. Yes, I am doing this out of my own free will to give some light on this thread as a current student. The school did not ask anyone to comment on this. Again, this thread was posted by another student on Facebook.</p>

<p>As for the regional accreditation: yes, we do not currently have it. No, we are not not accredited. We are nationally accredited. Both are valid forms of accreditation. We are working on getting regionally accredited.</p>

<p>As for the connection with the LDS church, I do not know. Again, many of the staff are Mormon, but so what? The school itself is purely business and takes no religious stance. I would not be attending this school otherwise.</p>

<p>I am willing to answer any questions I can, but please have arguments with sources to back them up. Any source that is just Collage Times, as you are the OP, that requires data and not simply word of mouth without anything else, I will discredit. You had to have gotten your data from somewhere, so please give those. Also, just to be clear, I am sourcing over 2 years of experience at this school. Again, many of the management choices I cannot vouch for, however regular everyday student-level things I will gladly discuss.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Current student. Please show facts. I cannot credit nor discredit management things as I am simply a student. Willing to answer questions regarding students.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds like a &quot;bad school&quot; more than a conspiracy. There&#39;s lots of bad schools. The fact people are graduating with a BS in an average of 2.5 years is not a good thing. Looking at their CS program, I can see why:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Only one calculus class</p></li>
<li><p>No differential equations or statistics</p></li>
<li><p>Only one physics class, and it&#39;s &quot;applied&quot; physics</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When you study engineering, you look for ABET accreditation... It&#39;s that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The schools primary interest has been to provide business ready software engineers. To that end they focused on hands on training and were a 9-5 school so they could meet the national accreditation requirements which places a lesser emphasis on lab time and more emphasis on lecture based time. </p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.acics.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=5071">ACICS Criteria PDF</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>3-1-516. Course and Program Measurement. 
...
(a) Credit in traditionally delivered programs measured in credit hours must be calculated based on one of 
the following attribution formulas:

    (i) One quarter credit hour equals, at a minimum, 10 classroom hours of lecture, 20 hours of laboratory, 
and 30 hours of practicum. The formula for calculating the number of quarter credit hours for each 
course is: (hours of lecture/10) + (hours of lab/20) + (hours of practicum/30); or

    (ii) One semester credit hour equals, at a minimum, 15 classroom hours of lecture, 30 hours of laboratory, 
and 45 hours of practicum. The formula for calculating the number of semester credit hours for each 
course is: (hours of lecture/15) + (hours of lab/30) + (hours of practicum/45).
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>So, for them to achieve their goal of a hands on style school they were required to do twice as much time per credit hour for their main disciplines, Java and C#, and that doesn&#39;t even take into account the homework that we also had to do which easily took most of the evenings after classes. </p>

<p>On a practical scale, in the business world I have never had a need for physics, calculus, and very little statistics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If all you plan to do is write code for a living, there is (usually) little need for physics, calculus, or statistics. If you ever plan to attend graduate school, or do any kind of research, you need to understand these subjects, particularly the mathematics.</p>

<p>Frankly, I find labeling a program which does not require these subjects a <em>bachelor&#39;s degree</em> to be disingenuous. They are difficult subjects, and being able to master them is a demonstration of critical thinking skills. They <em>are</em> necessary for performing graduate-level research, which a bachelor&#39;s degree is supposed to qualify you for. If I were hiring, I would prefer the student who completed an authentic four year bachelor&#39;s degree to the one who finished a rushed coding school.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s worked out for you, though, congratulations. This is merely my opinion, and I advise everyone to do their research, and really think about your long-term future. I guess what I&#39;m saying is: be careful before closing doors, permanently, just to save time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The school is focused on a degree that gets people in to the workforce able to get to work very quickly. </p>

<p>Generals and other classes that get in the way of that are definitely de-emphasized although statistics is required (as is a formal logic class). Most students have a job before they graduate (which is kind of a weird culture in itself - I think people rush to get a job because it&#39;s almost looked down on if you don&#39;t have one lined up 6 weeks before graduation). </p>

<p>This is definitely not the kind of degree to go for if you want to do high end graduate CompSci work. It skims some of the lower level computer science stuff in favor of practical skills. The upside is that you can hit the ground running in a business development environment as a junior or mid level dev. The downside is you aren&#39;t really prepared to go on to do graduate level AI research or something like that.</p>

<p>Traditional schools tend to focus more on the esoteric parts of computer science and people graduate unable to actually jump in to development at a company. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that, it&#39;s just different. I&#39;ve worked at a number of places that hired people fresh off their Masters degree in CompSci and both of them had only ever written 1 or 2 programs as part of their last last few classes. They needed a lot of help just to be able to start working on the actual codebase and weren&#39;t really prepared to work in a traditional dev team.</p>

<p>Whether that&#39;s a true bachelor degree is certainly open for debate. It does pass all the requirements, but it&#39;s definitely slanted in a different direction than traditional schooling. It&#39;s kind of more of a mix of traditional school and vocational school. Pretty much everyone I graduated with had jobs making $55-65k/year lined up before they graduated. That was in 2007. Most of them are probably making well over $100k now (in the Salt Lake area - adjust that even more if they are in Silicon Valley). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think his point is that whatever Neumont offers, it is NOT a bachelor&#39;s degree, nor is it CompSci to any extent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more like a computer applications &#39;certificate&#39; at best. And it sure as hell is not from a University.</p>

<p>If Neumont was honest about their programs being elementary, there would be less criticism.</p>

<p>Instead, they brainwash students into believing that ABET or regional accreditation is completely worthless, hire faculty who are completely unqualified, and then convince all of you (in the Mormon way) that all outside criticism is simply from people who are jealous of you, or who don&#39;t understand where you are coming from, or who are the devil, etc.</p>

<p>Then they push under-achieving kids to drop out (after stealing their money) so they can maintain a high employment placement figure (100%!!) by hooking graduates up with jobs at Mormon startups that mostly die off in a few years, but at that point it doesn&#39;t matter to Neumont any more. However, they desperately try to stay on good terms with the handful of &#39;smart kids&#39; that finish the program to create a sense of alumni pride and help grow the Neumont reputation, while suing and harassing dozens of other students who did not perform very well or any outsiders who dare question their scammy, spammy methods.</p>

<p>If all you need is a recruiting agency to help you find an entry-level programming job, $100k is a pretty steep finder&#39;s fee.</p>

I feel bad for kids who go there because they are absolutely being ripped off, but are completely convinced its a quality program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neumont is neither ABET nor regionally accredited.</p>

<p>Their Director of Admissions, Karick Heaton, never went to college. He deleted his Twitter account after we asked him about it: <a href="https://twitter.com/karick21">https://twitter.com/karick21</a></p>

<p>(According to Aquino, he was the main recruiter for years, and told recruits the school WAS regionally accredited.)</p>

<p>None of the faculty have PhDs. Only a few have Master&#39;s degrees. And, some of them only have a Bachelor&#39;s degree from Neumont itself, or from University of Phoenix, etc.  Some of the instructors are in fact students who graduated and went straight into teaching.</p>

<p>For many years, they wouldn&#39;t teach Java because they thought it wasn&#39;t a legitimate language, according to Aquino.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Java tidbit is humorous. Java has regularly topped the TIOBE index for over a decade. I suppose you can detract Java for it&#39;s design, but certainly not its popularity.</p>

<p>Lots of for-profit universities are notoriously sketchy. Any college applicants reading this, save yourself from trouble down the road and research the institutions you&#39;re applying to. If you&#39;re studying engineering, look for ABET accreditation. Check the course requirements for your degree and compare them to well-known schools like Stanford.</p>

<p>An easy course may seem &quot;rigorous&quot; to an unprepared student. Real schools require four years of <em>rigorous</em> courses. A focus on &quot;applied&quot; CS, to the detriment of the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings, is generally a <em>bad thing.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Jason Aquino, Neumont also didn&#39;t teach C++ because they had no qualified instructors.</p>

<p>What kind of computer science bachelor&#39;s degree teaches you basic PHP, but not Java or C++ ??... a fake one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Neumont seem to be very skilled at taking advanced of innocent students like you.</p>

<p>If you knew what ABET or mathematical theory was, you probably wouldn&#39;t have been invited to Neumont.</p>

<p>Scam schools like Neumont rely on you getting defensive and angry and &#39;offended&#39; whenever others criticize your fake degree, saying things like: <em>&#39;They are just jealous because our school is so... so... so..... rigorous!&#39;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I graduated in the summer of 2007 and had already accepted an offer with IBM Global Business Services by March 2007.  Since then, I&#39;ve moved on to a senior developer position, managing the Utah team for a very successful financial trading platform.  I would hardly consider that being taken advantage of.</p>

<p>I pulled up the 2013-14 course catalog (<a href="http://www.neumont.edu/cmsdocuments/2013_Spring_Catalog_-_Web.pdf">http://www.neumont.edu/cmsdocuments/2013_Spring_Catalog_-_Web.pdf</a>) and found that both Java and C++ are offered.  In fact, C++ is a required course for software and game development degrees.  I couldn&#39;t find PHP anywhere in the course catalog.  When I was a student, I had one applied projects class where we worked on an open-source PHP project.  At the time, it was the #1 most active project on Source Forge.  There was no dedicated class for PHP.  We were given a PHP primer and then learned by experience.  I also took three separate Java courses, as well as a C++ enterprise project.</p>

<p>Prospective students need to understand the difference between national and regional accreditation, as well as the degree/course offerings available at Neumont.  You are painting a very one-sided picture that is rife with factual inaccuracies.  When anyone tries to present a perspective that doesn&#39;t align with your own, you dismiss it and resort to ad hominem attacks in an attempt to back up your claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, the cycle continues. Hello all, another current Neumont student posting.</p>

<p>Honestly, reading this entire thread makes my head hurt. Almost none of the &quot;evidence&quot; CollegeTimes is posting is relevant, are Yahoo Answers questions, or are false claims to stir up controversy. In reality, however, things are a little different.</p>

<p>First, on the claims of &quot;brainwashed students&quot;, you already are scraping the bottom of the barrel for points against the school. If any of the faculty are Mormon, almost none of us care. Religion, as a whole, is never a topic of conversation or worry unless someone purposefully brings it up. Hell, some of the teachers I didn&#39;t know were Mormon until someone explicitly told me. Its ridiculous to claim religion has a massive impact when students barely discuss it. So, do yourself a favor and drop that accusation.</p>

<p>Second, on the lawsuits and threats. Threats could be a little sketchy, except for the fact that most of them probably dealt with the slander your site has brought towards the school. When i first wanted to apply to Neumont, naturally, i began looking up reviews for both the school and the apartment complex the school was renting from for housing. Many of the reviews focused on CollegeTimes, or similar sites, and all reviews i read were negative. With that red flag, i looked deeper, and found plenty responses on how the negative was inflated in order to give the school a bad name. When i visited the school on spring break, I asked about the reviews and got the same message, &quot;The reviews are often coming from one site, and are weighted negatively, while any and all positive or neutral responses are deleted.&quot; That response alone cemented that looking up reviews was nearly impossible. Then, to rub salt in the wound, CollegeTimes was sued by Neumont for the all the reasons i stated above, inflammatory comments, and misrepresentation. </p>

<p>Third, what is CollegeTimes&#39; obsession with LDS connections?! Seriously, what the hell? Nearly every post they have complains on how there&#39;s &quot;Mormon influence&quot; in the school, but they never really give a reason to hate Neumont other that, &quot;Ermagerd, Mermens are scheerling peoples&quot;. I mean, come on! Its starting to sound like someone complain about the &quot;Gay Agenda&quot;, rather than throw a valid point out.</p>

<p>Finally, Neumont&#39;s &quot;Army of spammers&quot;, might, god forbid, be people who want the truth to be known. Your website has been fielding claims and reports of deleting positive responses, and we&#39;ve witnessed it. Face it, no one who does real research into the school, and has a fucking brain, will notice the bullshit going on with the influx of shit reviews, especially when half the reviews are, &quot;Sucks. Period&quot;. For the love of God, use your FUCKING BRAINS. Then, when someone wants to use real information, you accuse them of being &quot;Brainwashed&quot; or being controlled by Neumont. Give a better defense than that! Make a valid point, drop real data on the subject, something!</p>

<p>Look, i wont say the school has no problems. It does have issues, but nothing in your claims really align with what I&#39;ve seen or experienced. So, next time you want to cause a ruckus, bring some more reinforcement than your own reviews and a yahoo answer page. So, as well as my friend Bellsworth46, i will gladly answer questions about the school to the best of my ability</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude... fucking quit. You&#39;re in the wrong and you need to move on with your life. Personally, I hated almost every minute of my 3 years I spent there, it was not what I expected and If I got to do it again it is not the school I would choose, but it does work and I stuck it out and eventually got my degree and am better off for it. Sorry you couldn&#39;t handle it, but you&#39;re obviously one of these people with &quot;personality disorders&quot; that you mention; and you you need to take responsibility for yourself instead of blaming the school.</p>

<p>Neumont has not posted this page anywhere on their Facebook page. I only found it because my fellow graduates posted it.</p>

<p>Um... actually it wasn&#39;t. The South Jordan Neumont campus was the first campus that existed, and then they tried expanding into Virginia by opening the East Coast campus <strong>years later</strong>. That failed, but they didn&#39;t abandon the students, they gave them scholarships and transferred the ones that wanted to relocate to the location in South Jordan. </p>

<p>Please get your facts right if you&#39;re going to start a conspiracy witch-hunt. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of Neumont after the change in leadership, and I used to be a contributing writer for neude.net.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man no one was super stoked about it at the time but it was kind of a big deal when it didn&#39;t work out. A very good friend of mine came over from the Virginia campus and he&#39;s one of the smartest dudes I know and is very active in the open source community currently. He actually commented on neude.net initially because he and his mom were freaked out about visiting the Virginia campus and found an empty half-built building. He ended up graduating with honors and I&#39;m pretty sure he makes more than I do currently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Neumont University was originally started at a shopping mall in Virginia. After abandoning their students in Virginia and moving to an office building in South Jordan, Utah...&quot;</p>

<p>This is completely backwards... the Virginia campus was an expansion of their already existing Utah location, which yes did end up closing down, but they didn&#39;t abandon the kids there. They brought them out to Utah.</p>

<p>Source: I was one of them...</p>

<p>Neumont has it&#39;s fair share of quirks, sure, but I wouldn&#39;t say they were brainwashing anyone. This entire writeup is a bit over the top</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I graduated from Neumont 2 years ago. I can tell that during my 2 1/2 years there I never once felt pressured by mormons for any reason whatsoever. Hearing about this years later actually makes me laugh. All I know is that I worked my butt off while there, but it was worth it because I now have a great job that I am incredibly thankful for. </p>

<p>I suggest you start picking your battles, Neumont is an established school and you aren&#39;t going to get anywhere.</p>

<p>Oh, and nope I&#39;m not a mormon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to School with Jason Aquino as well. I was at the school from the time it was in Cottonwood, renamed to Neumont from Northface, to my graduation. I not only went to school with this moron, but also got him to snort crushed up no-dose after I convinced him it was Cocaine. This is just prior to him drinking himself into failing grades and having a mental breakdown. All while I was still succeeding in my education and not getting drunk every night. Watching him vomit in my living room after doing such a stupid thing was fairly entertaining and pleasing in a sadistic way though. It was nice payback for his belligerent ass keeping me up on weeknights with his insane theories, drunken loudness, and stupid ideas. I drink a bit myself, but I keep it within check.</p>

<p>This school has no affiliation with the Illuminati, the Knights Templar, or the Mormons. You sir, are no Dan Brown. Don&#39;t try to act like it. You are more like an editor at the Chicago Sun.</p>

<p>You picked a particularly credible source for your interview. I must give you kudos for picking such a winner.  As this chain smoking drunk, hell bent on getting into the NAVY SEAL program at over 30 and miserably out of shape, is the absolute most credible source of information you could possibly interview. He was drunk at my place, much to my dismay, almost every night while he was in school. Good job, CollegeTimes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to go cry myself to sleep in a huge pile of cash, feel bad about my six figure salary, and mourn my rock-solid career stability. My successful career and broadly desired skill-set, with large demand, make me emotional and distraught about the degree I got from Neumont. Suck a dick CollegeTimes. </p>

<p>FYI, not Mormon. Don&#39;t trust a word that these morons say. Anyone. Ever. Both the infant from CollegeTimes and Jason Aquino are incredibly naive and childish in their approach to &quot;take down the Big-Bad-Neumont&quot;. </p>

<p>I feel bad for Jason Aquino, as the education was extremely expensive. He was constantly drunk, didn&#39;t work to better himself, and now owes massive amounts of student loans he has no capacity to ever pay back. He has to pay the consequences of his own lack of foresight and maturity. Sucks to be him. Maybe I&#39;ll send him some crushed up no-doze as a conciliatory gift. On the other hand, he can suck a dick as well. He is a child. He ruined his own life. He could have easily accomplished that epic amount of failure without Neumont.</p>

<p>Edit: Keep in mind, I am judging Jason Aquino&#39;s alcoholism, drug abuse, laziness, apathy, lack of empathy, selfishness, and overall lack of desire to better himself. He had the intelligence to succeed. He, however, lacked the drive and ambition to apply that intelligence and has created his own nightmare out of self-loathing and failed attempts at self-medication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is 4 months late but I decided I would check out your sources.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ryan Elkins twitter. You gave us the post where he was banned inexplicably but not the one where <a href="https://twitter.com/ryane/status/809345381">HE SAYS HE&#39;S ABOUT TO EXPLAIN TO HIS BOSS WHY THEY SHOULD HIRE A NU GRAD.</a></p></li>
<li><p>Washington City Paper. Not a hint of criticism from the author. </p></li>
<li><p>NY Times. This is an article highlighting how he refused to settle a lawsuit made by the S.E.C. which was later dropped after an <em>EXPERT WITNESS</em> said the accounting appeared legitimate. So what if he invested money into NU. Last time I checked a citizen of the United States can do whatever the hell they want with the money they earned.</p></li>
<li><p>InsideHigherEd. The point the author is trying to make is that maybe Neumont isn&#39;t the &quot;most innovative college in America&quot;. He&#39;s expressing  an opinion, not openly saying the school is a sham. He even goes on to say &quot;I hope Neumont survives and prospers&quot;. Hardly the words of someone trying to discredit an institution.</p></li>
<li><p>WPRI. You call <em>offering to pay taxes</em> a bribe? </p></li>
<li><p>Wikipedianmarlith&#39;s blog. I recieved a similar promotion, there is no promise. Only statistics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>95% of our graduates are employed within six months of graduation. And they accept positions with starting salaries averaging $63000 a year.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>I am a current Neumont student and posting this of my own free will. I have no incentive to make this post other than the outrage I have at someone attempting to discredit a fine school, <em>MY</em> school, a place where I have had one hell of a time so far and where I am incredibly grateful to be a part of it. </p>

<p>Feel free to ask me anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello friends.  </p>

<p>A little back story. I&#39;ve been employed at a dev shop here in Salt Lake City for about five years now.  Prior to that I spent five years in the Marine Corps.  I am not a native of Salt Lake and I moved here when I was around 9.   That all being said I would say that close to 30 to 35 of the 45 developers we currently have here are Neumont grads.  For the most part they are all well rounded individuals and I respect them a great deal. Working in the shop with them over the five years has actually inspired me to use my G.I. Bill (yellow ribbon program) to attend here for my second quarter now.  I am sitting currently in the lobby at the floor of their building (My office relocated to be just across the street actually).  I turn 30 this year and as someone who has lived all over the world (Moscow, Berlin, Karachi, Praha, Dublin, Okinawa, as well as all over the United States) and has first hand seen what real brain washing is like (i.e. Taliban fighters, Marine Corps boot camp) I can safely say that there is no brain washing occurring here.  The students here are some of the most enthusiastic kids I have come across in a while and they have drive and motivation to succeed in their daily work.  What ct is attempting to do here makes me laugh.  It&#39;s so far from the truth that it&#39;s literally hilarious.  Wait for it, lol, a literal laugh out loud.  I just upset my lab partner that I&#39;m currently working with by being so loud. </p>

<p>Before we get into &quot;How much pizza are you being forced to eat&quot;  Let&#39;s just take a step back and realize how silly this all is. </p>

<p>Good luck and have fun friends and try not to let this nutjob get you down.</p>

<p>Edit: OOOOh wait:  Addressing this  &quot;Update: 2!&quot; garbage about this being on the Neumont Facebook.  I just logged in there and checked.  Do you have any idea how long it&#39;s been since I had to log into faceyspacey? Years.  Literally years.  There is no such post nor link on Neumonts facebook page.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a stretch to think that all for-profit colleges are a complete joke.  Hell, for that matter so are all of our once fine learning establishments.  The former, just Bessie they are trying to milk dollars in a degree that will provide you with no leg us.  And the latter, as we&#39;ve seen over the last 50 or so years, most graduates have absolutely no critical thinking skills whatsoever.  Certified, but lacking real knowledge.  Just regurgitation of the bullshit they were fed in.  There see those who seek knowledge out on their own regardless, but for most people they need a large chaing in the methods used.  There are some European methods I&#39;ve seen that appear whore successful.  One includes no grading whatsoever, and is able to build students that test consistently high.  Much higher than the rest of the world.  Crazy stuff.  I&#39;m glad I never god sucked into the bullshit.  Later in my professional career, most was doing work.  Not conceptualizing work.  </p>

<p>After some searching on their reviews, I found this blog post half way down the search page.  You&#39;re right.  An Interesting take. <a href="http://wikipedianmarlith.blogspot.com/2012/01/selling-out-education-and-neumont.html">http://wikipedianmarlith.blogspot.com/2012/01/selling-out-education-and-neumont.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s nice to hear people champion critical thinking skills, however rarely --</p>

<p>Your perspective is pretty much the entire purpose of our website - critical thinking, curiosity, and moral questioning. We host the largest database of colleges and universities on the web, and besides StudentsReview.com, all the other review sites for higher education we&#39;ve seen are backed by corporate investors.... /self-promotion</p>

<p>Generally speaking, we are very, very skeptical of for-profit education and the industry its created. Their main business model is trying to qualify students for federal aid money, and sucking as much as possible up before dumping the students. Whenever things start getting too hot, they change their name and location in order to escape a bad reputation (or, in the case of Neumont University, they sue and threaten as many people and students as possible to escape a bad reputation).</p>

<p>There are some very cool schools out there, usually you won&#39;t hear about them much or see advertising for them. For example, there is a school in California called Deep Springs College that is located on a cattle ranch that offers full scholarships to all of its students each year. Students must learn ranch labor and public speaking, among other skills.</p>

<p>If you have some cool schools to share from Europe, we would love to hear about them! haha</p>

<p>The fact that their credits are NOT transferable practically anywhere is something that I&#39;m sure has screwed a large number of people.  They are very likely a fly by night organization.  Their use of student pizza parties to have all the students go out and wrote positive reviews is concerning to say the least.  Also, their online PR agents, wow.  Within minutes, they are posting counter arguments here on Reddit.  Almost as if they had some notification go out as soon as a link to your site is posted.  I wish you thr best in your fight.  Hopefully preventing the fleecing of hundreds of students with their substandard rushed education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I&#39;m a Neumont graduate and I&#39;ll tell you right now that I&#39;ve worked with developers from all ends of the spectrum - the school may be a glorified technical college but 9 times out of 10, I&#39;d rather hire a Neumont graduate than a state college CS grad. And yeah maybe I am spending too much time on Reddit at work... give me a break, I&#39;m on lunch. But hey just FYI I have friends and associates that graduated from Neumont that currently work at Microsoft, Google, you name it. I&#39;ve also not had a single problem getting a job in SoCal since I graduated 6 years ago. In fact, my skills are in demand. So, take that as you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the suggestion. The truth is that the URL doesn&#39;t really matter, they can always file new lawsuits, or attach new complaints (URLs) to old lawsuits, etc, no matter what the page or website is.</p>

<p>And as long as Google, Yahoo, PRWeb, and all these other internet and media giants are based in the USA, they can be sued (or threatened) directly even if small businesses or independent websites are &#39;protected&#39; (or... hiding).</p>

<p>And as long as they have federal courts in Utah and Nevada that are &#39;friendly&#39; with the massive Mormon empire, along with local newspapers, IRS offices, and etc. to back them up, their mafia-styled approach can survive and thrive.</p>

<p>But more to the point, most of Neumont&#39;s success in bringing down websites and online information has never actually relied on a courtroom decision... it usually is sufficed by bullying, threats, and similar methods.</p>

<p>The only true solution is to constantly publish new articles, new content... keep the truth circulating.</p>

<p>Many of the negative criticisms of Neumont have been deleted (or blocked) from the web.

<p>InsideHigherEd reveals sketchy circumstances behind Neumont University being named &#39;most innovative college in America&#39; by the Spellings Commission, a controversial group commissioned by George W. Bush that fell apart before finishing their final report because it had been hijacked by Charles Miller, a billionaire from Texas who financed Bush&#39;s bid for the presidency and who virtually turned the commission into an advertising platform for for-profit colleges:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is truly astounding how many spammers Neumont has working for them.</p>

<p>Besides their own students (&#39;slaves&#39;), they also seem to retain multiple contracted SEO and marketing agencies that are monitoring their reputation all over the web 24/7, including scanning our website multiple times each day using cloud servers.</p>

<p>Before the lawsuit against us, they also trolled Wikipedia and Yahoo Answers like you wouldn&#39;t believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Jason Aquino, Neumont also didn&#39;t teach C++ because they had no qualified instructors.</p>

<p>What kind of computer science bachelor&#39;s degree teaches you basic PHP, but not Java or C++ ??... a fake one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Neumont seem to be very skilled at taking advanced of innocent students like you.</p>

<p>If you knew what ABET or mathematical theory was, you probably wouldn&#39;t have been invited to Neumont.</p>

<p>Scam schools like Neumont rely on you getting defensive and angry and &#39;offended&#39; whenever others criticize your fake degree, saying things like: <em>&#39;They are just jealous because our school is so... so... so..... rigorous!&#39;</em></p>
