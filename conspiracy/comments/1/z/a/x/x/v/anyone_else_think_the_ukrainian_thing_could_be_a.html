       My guess is the sanctions will cover oil/gas fom Russia which will have the desired effect or restricting pil and gas on the market and raising prices and profits for the oil interests just as sanctio s on Iraq did for 20 yrs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This strategy of restircting alternative suplies of lil and gas to keep prices high for the chosen oil and gas suppliers linked primarily to saudi arabia who pays off officials in military cou mntries with business deals is a constant and classic repeating thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran,iraq, venezuela (multiple overthrow attempts of any leader their suppling oil on the world market including right now).
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is anlternative supplier they feel must be taken out to keep prjces high to increase their exorbitant profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no the leaders  NEVER care about the prices their citizens pay. They care about their personal oil profit deals and payoffs from the choosen suppliers. )in othrr words country leaders routinely commit treason against their own country's and citizens interests for their personal oil profit deals .
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise they would be pimpong oil from iraq,venezuala, iran, russia and oil and gas would fall to $30 a barrel!

       EU can't do sanctions against Russia, as there is nothing that Russia needs from the EU.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, it is Russia that has Western Europe by the balls, because EU NEEDS Russian gas, oil, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if there are any sanctions, it will be Russia shutting down natural gas and oil pipelines into the EU.

       So it may or may not be a total sham to distract people while the price of gas rises. But you think that has something to do with it, because that's a contentious topics the worlds largest economy finds itself concerned with. Too bad they were too self-centered to see past the noses on their faces about this issue; due to the fact they have trouble seeing what may be obvious to others it's inconveinent to see every truth when you're kind of pre-occupied.

       Russia had an objection to OPEC existing as the USSR, but kept it quiet because if they spoke too loudly about it to those
       <em>
        in charge
       </em>
       it might seem too self-centered about it to the Peoples Republic of China, the access of oil to whom might have actually accelerated the decline of American power in a faster manner than the USSR could without that, but also been highly-polluting in a manner that would be a result of their right to the self-determination that all nations should have?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it weird to think that the USA and USSR could even think about China in a manner that made it look like they may in fact agree on more than just that alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you expect them to tell you about every clandestine activity or can you just go back to being spoon-fed answers about how anarchists may be radicals but we're not always right?

       Oh yeah, sorry America not everything is about you, but if you maybe for a moment consider the words I'm saying I could point out that
       <em>
        you knew a few of those nations
       </em>
       and
       <strong>
        felt different things about them
       </strong>
       when told their names in that way. Good for you, you're trying. I'm not really paid very well, niether are a lot of people but hey capitalism sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving on we can say that it's important to try again about something else because they did this all with the influence it has on
       <code>
        global affairs
       </code>
       when you do happen to think twice about it Americans; your foreign policy is pro-active because you're convinced you can be right and this often backfires to you (your leaders then hide it to make themselves look better) and you can't really do much about it without a radical social and cultural revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither can any other nation. Sucks to be them? Maybe, you are the worlds largest economy. Patience is a virtue, hard work is its own reward do you think the Chinese have a right to their own self-determination but asking that question while saying others were talking behind their back may startle you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be startled, that's business as usual in international politics because espionage is a real game-changer. I like to tell people Americans not being so obligated to feel responsible for deciding for other nations what is and isn't correct according to their views on it can't always be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accept it and move forward.
