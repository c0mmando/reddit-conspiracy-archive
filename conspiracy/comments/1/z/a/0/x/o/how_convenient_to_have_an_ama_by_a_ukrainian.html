    <div class="md"><p>DARPA (led by Google&#39;s Boston Dynamics) projects 2040 as the general date when AI will exceed human intelligence. Who knows if any of this is true. There were combat robots already deployed in Iraq (with wierd stories of the robot aiming weapon at our own troops at times -- which smacks of smoke&amp;mirrors propaganda to me). The tech could already be there for all we know... Any military hi-tech you see displayed is usually 30 years old.</p>

Whoever that was is a highly educated person in the field of politics. On top of that, I also suspect more of a American sounding person then a Ukrainian.

<p>A little bit, yes.</p>

<p>Not everyone who disagrees with you is a sockpuppet.  They may be right, they may be wrong for entirely understandable reasons, or they may be as dumb as a box of frogs and entirely deluded.  </p>

<p>If you have a country of 45million people a rather large number of them will be on both sides.  Of the people on whichever side you opt to look at a lot of them will have internet access and be part of the demographic group that uses reddit and thinks it&#39;s worth posting.</p>

<p>At a certain point the probability of someone posting this sort of thing becomes a near certainty.  Add into the mix the fact that they&#39;ll be explicitly attached to one side or the other and what they say will have a propaganda-grade bias.  On top of which when they say, <em>&quot;Everyone agrees with me!&quot;</em> it&#39;s merely a reflection of the fact they&#39;re likely to be around people who agree with them.</p>

<p>Finally, reddit aggregates on upvotes which merely represent a form of popularity.  Since corrupt governments are bad - Uprisings of the people are good - Russia is bad! themes are likely to garner popularity the system will allow the likes of that AMA to the top and bury an opposing opinion.</p>

<p>This reflects fundamental flaws in the way reddit works, but it doesn&#39;t need interference.</p>

<p>Skepticism, even cynicism is good.  Rampant paranoia a bit less so.</p>

<p>I think the latter is probably the most likely. Just people who cannot question or critically think what is being presented to them, either because they&#39;ve never considered it or they think any other forces at work are just a crazy theory or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What will come of it? </p>

<p>Obama&#39;s always preached against the use of Military, so since this &#39;invasion&#39; by Russia isn&#39;t directly related to the US, we shouldn&#39;t be talking about this (in Obama&#39;s own school of thought). However, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time we&#39;d see him go back on his word, disregarding campaign speeches and platform, to simply do whatever he wants as President. So, i think we&#39;ll see the controlling arms of the US gov&#39;t each expressing &#39;diplomatic&#39; and &#39;humanitarian&#39; reasons for countering the invasion. It&#39;s a shame, we really shouldn&#39;t be considering involvement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be a fair speculation to say that there&#39;s a good chance this supposed Ukranian citizen is most likely a phony who represents the agenda of the Five Eyes. Ukraine is a very important chess piece is in the struggle for power between the US+Europe and Russia. It&#39;s likely that the &#39;protests&#39; could be receiving direct support from the Five Eyes. I imagine it&#39;s a spectacle to convince the rest of the world that their existing government is bad or upsetting the populace and they should be replaced - which is where the possibly US backed extremists come in to seize power. Obviously if Western Ukraine joins the EU or whatever.. shit&#39;s probably gunna hit the fan. I mean.. if the Five Eyes intended to invade or cripple Russia&#39;s power.. taking Ukraine is how they would do it - and installing military bases there. From what I&#39;ve heard the Russian speaking Eastern half of Ukraine isn&#39;t on board with the imperial agenda. This should be recognized for what it is - a power play. It&#39;s another example similar to Syria of the US or Five Eyes covertly attempting to expand their influence.</p>

<p>&quot;I am Ukrainian please send US war ships to escalate it, we need the US in the world as a protector, blah, blah, blah.&quot; </p>

<p>This post needs more attention and good work on calling them out! </p>
