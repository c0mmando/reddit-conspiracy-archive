       Max Levchin, a co-founder of Paypal, has openly stated his support for NSA spying on Americans. Alex Karp used the Paypal framework to start Palantir, the most important company providing spying technology to the NSA. Palantir’s advisors include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet. The word Palantir refers to the seeing stones used primarily by the dark lord Sauron in The Lord of the Rings novels. From 2005 to 2008 the CIA was Palantir’s patron and only customer. Peter Thiel has some interesting right-wing connections. Thiel started his career working for the CIA-linked law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and then Credit Suisse Group. In 2009, Thiel said, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,”

        How someone was convinced Snowden/Greenwald is limited hangout
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I call it "the limited hangout theory" for its overarching explanation, but its more like the leading hypothesis because of the minimal information that we have been exposed to.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've been sitting on the fence for a while now, honestly trying to view this situation without any bias and hoping for future "revelations" to convince me that Snowden was a genuine whistle-blower (because the leaks kept showing up periodically). Prominent people that made me curious about the "limited hangout" idea were Webster Tarpley and Naomi wolf:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/06/18/309609/how-to-identify-cia-limited-hangout-op/">
        Tarpley's article
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://naomiwolf.org/2013/06/my-creeping-concern-that-the-nsa-leaker-is-not-who-he-purports-to-be/">
        Wolf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <a href="http://publicconspiracy.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/rconspiracy-links-for-snowden-limited-hangout-op/">
        here's
       </a>
       a collection worth mentioning of other bloggers that someone gathered. (Edit: seems to be
       <a href="/u/ObeyTheCowGod">
        /u/ObeyTheCowGod
       </a>
       . Thanks for the links).
      </p>
      <p>
       Their biggest argument was that we have only seen garbage revelations heretofore, which benefited the NSA and not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't entirely convinced, so I looked into it. The best timeline of the "leaks" I've found is
       <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/multimedia/timeline-edward-snowden-revelations.html">
        Al Jazeera's
       </a>
       . I don't think you need to doubt its validity, since it's a collection of mainstream articles anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can follow the timeline for yourself, and you would find that the most incriminating article is from
       <a href="http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/10/ministerio-das-minas-e-energia-esta-na-mira-de-espioes-americanos-e-canadenses.html">
        Globo
       </a>
       that showed how companies in Brazil were being spied on. The big catch? It's the only leak showing that it was perpetrated by the Canadian intelligence agency, not the NSA (besides monitoring Canadian citizens in airports). There is another one that tells us the NSA
       <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/how-the-nsa-and-gchq-spied-on-opec-a-932777.html">
        spied on OPEC
       </a>
       , a collection of
       <a href="http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/25.htm">
        Arab countries and Venezuela
       </a>
       , most of which have had their sovereignty compromised anyway. A worthless leak. Spying on Iraq is supposed to be big news after the entire country has been leveled to the ground?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who doubt the Snowden charade also say that the NSA's main motive is to make people aware of the fact that they're being monitored. Sort of like sending a clear message of "Big Brother is watching you". The diplomatic leaks fall under this category as well, but they also imply a serious threat to the nations' autonomy, like intercepting the calls of Germany's Merkel. Nothing came of it, but people are now a tiny bit more accustomed to the idea of a one world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides these leaks, it's all garbage. Many were waiting for anything on 9/11, but all they got was that the NSA was pushing its spokespeople to promote the official 9/11 narrative, in order to
       <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/30/revealed-nsa-pushed911askeysoundbitetojustifysurveillance.html">
        to justify the program
       </a>
       . An idea so prevalent in society that it's used as satire in
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOh-rpvjYg&amp;t=0m46s">
        cartoons
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Some articles are even used as a mouthpiece for the NSA, like how
       <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-documents-detail-al-qaedas-efforts-to-fight-back-against-drones/2013/09/03/b83e7654-11c0-11e3-b630-36617ca6640f_story.html">
        "Al Qaeda" are trying to hijack the drones
       </a>
       . You should also know by now that anyone even using the words "Al Qaeda" is full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spark that lit the fuse for me was the leak released today:
       <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/02/18/snowden-docs-reveal-covert-surveillance-and-pressure-tactics-aimed-at-wikileaks-and-its-supporters/">
        Wikileaks and other activist groups being monitored
       </a>
       , which by the way was
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1y86j0/glenn_greenwald_topsecret_documents_from_the/">
        top post
       </a>
       in
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       a while ago. The article clearly shows how the NSA was
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       targeting foreign activists like Anonymous. An organization that doesn't include domestic activists, as we all know. My BS-detector went haywire after that, which made me write this post. (Tarpley mentions Wikileaks as another limited hangout operation, which I'm undecided about).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another argument for it is that Snowden has received a lot of attention from the MSM. This only hints to him being controlled, it's not proof. But it still makes you consider why.

       Does it mean that Greenwald is part of it as well? I have no idea. There is a possibility that he naively releases the leaks without being compromised. That's for you to decide, and I would love to hear your opinion on it.

       Nope. The post was originally made in

       as a direct link and it got so much attention and requests for the mods to make it a sticky that I made a self-post (the only kind that can be stickied) and stickied it. It wasn't really my post.

       That article was the bombshell when it comes to social platforms like reddit and it was heavily censored in every major subreddit that's why it was stickied.

      <p>
       Is that why 99% of the posts on that subreddit are about Snowden claiming he's a limited hangout? Seems to me like you made the subreddit to try and discredit Snowden and for no other reason, that subreddit is not about limited hangouts its about discrediting Snowden.

       I'm intrigued by the Snowden case. In fact, I have been nothing short of impressed/frightened by the whole scenario. I had never considered him to be untrustworthy, but quite frankly, I didn't really know anything about limited hangouts until

       started shouting it from the rooftops. Seriously, it's not just here, I see you doing it on other subs as well. I don't mean to be argumentative, just pointing out that you've been fairly intense of late.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said... I've been digging into the Corbett Report and this round table discussion has made me second guess the entire situation:

       Honestly, I think it's time I took a break from the internets (although I won't). I'm second guessing everything. The disinformation has worked wonders on me. I no longer know up from down.

       Sure, I learnt what limited hangouts were but I would have just days later via the Corbett Report anyways. You're not the first to mention it and I would have researched it eventually. Still, take the credit, it's all yours. I'm not interested in your sub due to your over the top nature. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavours and sub, but I'm quite happy here thanks. :)

       Snowden is a very hard core, very right wing person. His posts prior to becoming famous show that. Landing in Russia was no accident, to me. I think Greenwald saw a cash cow and took advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       His launch with a multi-billionaire isn't an accident. He wasn't interested in finding truth. He wanted to profit off of what he saw. His early reporting was full of obvious errors that nearly derailed the NSA story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust Greenwald at all. I see Snowden as a zealot for his cause that ended up helping bring down a portion of the Military Industrial Complex. Greenwald was just a lucky tag along who is now profiting handsomely.

       I've been very hesitant to say anything because this subreddit doesn't like differing opinions, but Greenwald is financed by a billionaire and waited until he had his new website to release this story. Why is this billionaire different? And it wasn't really anything new. It was a bland slideshow hyped up by Greenwald to get everyone to come to his new site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am more on the fence about Snowden, but it seems pretty clear to me Greenwald is in it for the money, the contacts, and what he can gather from a new audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now downvote me for expressing my opinion. I'm used to that in this subreddit.

       Funny how I said exactly that and you called me a shill. Now you are trying to backtrack. A one week old account (what AMAZING timing), trying to pretend to be on the fringe, but putting down anyone pointing out Greenwald's ties.

       This is the very first time that I've seen where every single comment made in a thread were from accounts under fifteen days old, are all of these sock puppet accounts? do you guys have accounts with post history? if so why not use them instead. I also have not attacked anyone here just pointed out the age of the accounts so i have not broken rule 10.

       I wasn't accusing you of attacking anyone or anything like that, I was actually pointing out the ridiculousness of how some things are dealt with around here. And I'm glad that you have faith in the mods. I supported and took up for the mods here for years, hell I was even glad to see the results when this last round was elected. A couple of them I am even still very proud of. Unfortunately as a whole though I have lost faith in them. I don't believe that they are trying to combat trolls here, and in fact I wonder if they may not be making the matter worse. And I'm sorry, but I can prove that there is censorship here and that you aren't free to speak your mind. See Rule #10. And no, I don't believe people should be allowed to attack here. However, there are times I have seen where straight up self admitted trolls were allowed to take over threads and fuck with the users here.
