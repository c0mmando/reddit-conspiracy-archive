        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all these vindications that yes, we are all being spied on and manipulated, or at least there are attempts to manipulate, don&#39;t forget that Reddit is owned by a corporation. Bipolar whatever may be straight up working for them. When the owner of something, whether it&#39;s a website or a nationstate, wants to do something that goes against their own rules… there&#39;s really nothing to stop them. The company that owns Reddit, I think it&#39;s Conde Nast, may very well be inviting this sort of behavior. You can call for bipolar to be banned but really… what clout do any of us have? If they want him there, we can&#39;t do a damn thing about it. So we get rid of his handle. We all know that the shills and trolls usually have multiple accounts, sock puppets or whatever that&#39;s called. I don&#39;t know if you caught the RT, for what THAT&#39;S worth, but that hottie brunette did mention that a lot of the flaming and racism is part of the infiltration. If that&#39;s true… bipolar&#39;s in line with the agenda.</p>

<p>Basically, bitch all you want but always remember: If a service is free, you are the product. The company is probably paid to let this happen, if they&#39;re not doing it themselves, whether actively or just passively letting it happen do to whomever they have to answer to. The reminder is not necessarily know your place… just remember where you are.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> corrected me about Codne Nasty&#39;s involvement. It&#39;s not outright ownership but they, or &quot;at least&quot; their president, have a hand, if not more, involved.</p>

<p>Double Edit: <a href="/u/glassa24">/u/glassa24</a> expands on <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> explanation of who&#39;s running this show. Advance Publication&#39;s LinkedIn page claims it owns/operates a lot of publishing companies and internet sites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a few things;</p>

<p>Reddit is not owned by codne nasty. Advance publications took on an 18 million dollar stake when reddit inc formed as it&#39;s own company in sept 2011 (I think, bad with dates). Now, as to whether or not this &quot;move towards independence&quot; was a smoke screen or not, well <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ptsny/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/c3sc3dq">here&#39;s a former mod of /r/funny and /r/wtf with his take on things</a>. Mind you, that was in regards to <a href="http://imgur.com/a/S08Jt">this thread exposing Chris Brown&#39;s vicious assault on Rhianna</a> being turned into <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ps8j6/here_is_the_police_report_with_the_details_of/">this</a>, most likely do to a fax/call much similar to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RltB0.png">this</a>. </p>

<p>What&#39;s really fucked up is that Mr. Grimm was in on that censorship too, voluntarily censoring imgur in cooperation with reddit inc staff.</p>

<p>Anyway, as to reddit inc. The company has three board members representing three distinct spheres of influence within the organization. Yishan Lee, the ceo who represents the interests of the San Fransisco reddit inc office. Alexis (one of the site&#39;s co founders along with Aaron and Steve) who represents the interests of a group of admins and mods in NYC who work out of Brooklyn. <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?q=antique+jetpack&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;file=&amp;amp;docid=&amp;amp;relid=0#searchresult">Alexis and reddit GM Erik run a PR firm called Antique Jetpack</a>. </p>

<p>A president of Codne Nasty also has a board spot, as I said, representing Advance Publications 18 million+ stake (probably more as of now.)</p>

<p>So why do I say all this; because I want to point out to you that while you can&#39;t change reddit inc structually, you can certainly keep their malfsence in the public forum and dispel as much evil as you can with the light of pubic knowledge.</p>

<p>That reddit inc has to hide itself behind these mod cartels and very dubious and deceitful engagements with the metasphere is a testament to the level of control going on here.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day this site was founded on the organic curation of content and the free flow of information. That is why it is important to keep those malevolent forces of payola and cognitive manipulation on reddit ever highlighted for all to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite. Both Reddit and Conde Nast are subsidiaries of Advance Publications. It doesn&#39;t really mean anything that Reddit operates independently, Advance is still the shareholder. There is usually a lot of communication and influence not only from the parent company but also amongst subsidiaries.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually mainstream media isn&#39;t as manipulated by state-agents, rather it self-censors, abides to infotainment format to obtain viewership and advertisement. Which basically leads to most MSMs to align under corporate-government ideological paradigms.</p>

<p>The &quot;frontier&quot;, or new MSM mediums, today are blogs and social networks. And at this vehicle the latest leaks are devoted to manipulating and/or compromising. Shills, trolls and outright &quot;agents&quot; (usually contractors) are being used by government (GCHQ, NSA) and corporate (Koch, Monsanto) machines for this end.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Reddit has seen both self-censorship for profits (<a href="/r/AMA">/r/AMA</a> becoming a PR platform and increased ad profiting) and outright manipulation (eg Bipolarbear0).</p>

<p>Transparency is (as always) the only tool to identify and undermine these attempts.  </p>

<p>Reddit does not turn a profit, it does not need to when it has rich parents. It serves as a tool for manipulation and a massive honeypot. Like father, like son</p>

<p>1921:  Under the orders of Jacob Schiff the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is founded by Ashkenazi central banker Jews, Bernard Baruch and Colonel Edward Mandell House.  Schiff gave his orders prior to his death in 1920, as he knew an organisation in America needed to be set up to select politicians to carry on the Rothschild conspiracy,and the formation of the CFR was actually agreed in a meeting on May 30, 1919 at the Hotel Majestic in Paris, France. 
The CFR membership at the start was approximately 1000 people in the United States.  This membership included the heads of virtually every industrial empire in America, all the American based international bankers, and the heads of all their tax free foundations.  In essence all those people who would provide the capital required for anyone who wished to run for Congress, the Senate or the Presidency. </p>

<p>The first job of the CFR was to gain control of the press.  This task was given to John D. Rockefeller who set up a number of national news magazines such as Life, and Time.  He financed Samuel Newhouse to buy up and establish a chain of newspapers all across the country, and Eugene Meyer also who would go on to buy up many publications such as the Washington Post, Newsweek, ant The Weekly Magazine. </p>
