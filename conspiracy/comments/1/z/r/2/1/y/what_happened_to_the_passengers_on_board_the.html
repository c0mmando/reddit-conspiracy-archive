       Were they unfortunate collateral damage? Were they not on the planes at all, just whisked away from public sight? Were "the victims" all part of the conspiracy? If they were, how in God's name could they get the hundreds, if not thousands, of people to go along with this story?

       One theory I found interesting was that the planes landed at military bases en-route, and outfitted remote controlled planes took over the GPS signals and continued on their path.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose the passengers were then forced to recorded make fake phone-calls at the military base which were later given to media and claimed to have been made during the flights, then killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operation Northwoods mentioned that the passengers would be evacuated also, which is something to keep in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of "theories" surrounding the passengers that could be possible, but very little evidence available to make any certain judgement on.

       fair question.  i believe the answer is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       the commercial planes were NOT outfitted with high-accuracy remote control equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       the commercial planes crossed-paths with gray, military planes that WERE outfitted with high-accuracy remote control equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       the commercial and military decoys crossed paths in mid-air...
      </p>
      <p>
       as they crossed paths in mid-air (within 1 mile), the commercial plans had their transponders turned off.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the remote military plane went on to the targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       when the commercial planes landed, the passengers were herded off the planes.  1 or 2 to were forced to make a phone call to say good bye to family.  and then all of the passengers were executed.

       Ahhh, I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually heard a very interesting point on here recently. Someone suggested that maybe there was a remote guidance system in play, but the passengers were still on board. The Shanksville plane (93?) genuinely did have the passengers storm the cockpit. However, once they realised that the plane was not being flown by the men in the cockpit, or that the cockpit was empty, the plane was smashed into a field to silence them all and stop the world from finding out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont believe that myself, but found it interesting.

       From a strictly logistical point of view, it would be simplest to take control of the autopilots remotely and fly the planes into the towers/Pentagon. That would certainly explain the incredibly precise piloting by hijackers who couldn't solo a Cessna, and as a bonus, no pesky witnesses to contend with.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, let's factor replacement planes into the equation, as this is the only logical way to achieve adequate performance characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would require a "switch", which was only possible when the hijacked planes were doing dipsy-doodle flight path crossings, formation flying and transponder shenanigans before returning to their intended targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we have remote-controlled military planes and remote controlled passenger planes.  We know where the military planes ended up.  How do you cover up the switch?
      </p>
      <p>
       You fly those passenger planes out over the Atlantic while everybody is focused on planes going the other way.  Then you crash them into the ocean once you get out far enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       No pesky witnesses to contend with.

       The only problem with this is that standard boeing jets couldn't have done what these planes did. That is, fly as fast as they did without falling apart. The top speed of one is like 400 knots. I think the South tower plane was going over 500 knots or something like that. It's not possible unless the planes were enhanced/military.

       This is false. A Boeing 767 is fully capable of reaching 500 knots (it's cruise speed is between 460-480), and doesn't sustain damage until much higher. In a dive, such as it's proposed trajectory in 9/11, it can exceed those speeds even at low altitudes.

       Some people think that no fatalities happened at Sandy Hook. Some people think that all the passengers were taken off those planes. If that was true than none of them died and would have had to assume new identities and their lives continued elsewhere. Lol.

       He's saying we have 20 kids with pictures and parents and everything and they fooled us into thinking they were killed when they weren't. It's not hard to fathom they did the same thing on 9/11.

       If you start with the belief that SH was false, then yes. But seeing as it's an unrelated issue and is far from being proven a false flag, the logic doesn't really stand.

       It's not very far. There are a lot of inconsistencies in the official story and more that came out with the official report. Including no pictures/video of any bodies or Adam. Not at the school or at Dicks sports where he was said to have gone just before.

       There aren't nearly as many inconsistencies as you seem to think there are. Short of manufacturing an entire town, there is no way SH was a false flag. Just because I don't see it doesn't mean I'm ignorant; it means I've come to a very different conclusion than you.

       I mean, you've never misspoke on the phone? Especially if he was a businessman, or had just had to repeat his name ten different times to 911. Things happen. I think one guy saying his full name to his mother isn't exactly sound evidence to claim the phone calls were sketchy.

       okay sure, but then where did those family members vanish too? ditching a plane at see would leave evidence and finding them would generate a lot of questions (which means their remains probably got cremated immediately)

       Everyone who is thought to be dead IS dead.  If there is anything that history should teach you, it's that TPTB have absolutely NO compunction whatsoever against killing off whoever it is they need to kill off to make their plans move forward.  A few dozens or few hundred passengers?  Seriously?  That shit isn't even child's play to them.  They killed them.  Killed them just as sure as they killed the 3K+ they killed in the towers themselves.

       The pilots were former Saudi military pilots. Newsweek published a story several days after 9/11 that discusses how several of the pilots previously lived at addresses on US Air Force bases in the years before the attacks. The USAF trains the Saudi Air Force. This also explains why they essentially blew off the private pilot lessons. They knew it was just to create a paper trail and really wasn't necessary for 9/11 to succeed.
