    <div class="md"><p>The obvious rebuttle is that you can&#39;t really use parallaxing to do what he&#39;s claiming. The long winded response is something that&#39;s not quite as easy to just say. So get your reading glasses, a nice cup of coffee, and prepare to read a long post (or ignore me and call me an idiot whichever suits your wants/needs.) <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message1907731/pg2">Here&#39;s a couple of really good rebuttles I found on another forum that go into <em>why</em> you can&#39;t use it in the way he&#39;s claiming:</a></p>

<p>POST 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Objects further than two kilometres distant, with a minor camera shift, have zero parallax.</strong>
Quoting: aulis</p>

<p>Wrong. Or, at least, overstated.</p>

<p>Ever hear the term &quot;parsec?&quot; It wasn&#39;t invented for &quot;Star Wars.&quot; It is a well-known astronomical term of distant measurement. The term is a concentation of the phrase &quot;PARallax of one SECond of arc.&quot;</p>

<p>What does this mean? It means that a star that is 3.26 lightyears away will, over the course of six months observation from Earth, show a parallax of one second of arc.</p>

<p>The point being -- there is no magic distance over which objects no longer show any parallax. There is only the distance at which some specific method or imaging system is unable to resolve parallax.</p>

<p>Oh, and this is being used incorrectly by the writer anyhow. Parallax is generally used as the shifting of an object against a static reference (usually infinity.) There ARE no objects at infinity in the Lunar Surface Hassleblad record.</p>

<p>So any failure to line up any specific object in the field of view can ONLY be due to either rotation of a 3d object, or failure to resolve the known aberrations of the lens and film.</p>

<p><strong>Optical transformations are applied: axes x and y scaling, rotation, distortion, perspective and in addition a shift to the requirement specified above</strong>
Quoting: aulis</p>

<p>This, from the list of steps, fails entirely to mention any corrections made in reference to lens model.</p>

<p>How can I put this. You know the movie &quot;Wall-E?&quot; Do some reading up on Pixar&#39;s work on the 3d rendering model. You will find multiple mentions of the way the team recognized the way a real camera lens differs from a mathematical model.</p>

<p>This has been known in the SFX industry since, oh, at least &quot;Terminator 2.&quot; It is a well-known problem; having to apply the correct lens model in order to integrate the 3d renderings into the distorted view captured by the camera.</p>

<p>What the Aulis commentator above is describing is simply applying corrections to ONE PART of an image, by eye, and assuming that this somehow magically transforms the entire image correctly.</p>

<p>It is a long-winded version of the typical conspiracy nut trick; play with the sliders in PhotoShop and claim you are doing &quot;Photo Analysis.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Apennines and the crater St. George are also moving as a whole.</strong>
Quoting: aulis</p>

<p>But he hasn&#39;t shown he is looking at St. George. The Moon has lots of craters, down to much smaller than are indicated on any topo map. Where has the writer shown that he has ruled out other choices? Where has he used photographs taken from other stations to confirm that he is looking at a distant crater and not a smaller foreground crater? Where has he compared verified photographs of the Apennines with the shape he claims is the Alpennines?</p>

<p><strong>I am not saying he is wrong. This may indeed be the objects he claims. But he has shown none of the steps he has taken to verify them. This is clumsy work. It is impossible to achieve a zero stereoscopic parallax using only previously-mentioned image transformations</strong>
Quoting: aulis</p>

<p>Rather telling. Let me emphasize this; the writer is applying random PhotoShop distortions (scaling, skew, and others) without any guide other than his eye and a &quot;feeling&quot; for what is right, AND THEN MEASURING THE RESULTS.</p>

<p>How about if I correct a perspective view of an airplane by eye and then measure my picture to tell you the wingspan? How about if I apply numerous distortions to a picture taken at a party and then tell you the exact height of a guy near the back of the room?</p>

<p>This is not analysis.</p>

<p><strong>if the distortion grid has a curved surface, then it corresponds to projection at the rear onto a circular panorama screen,</strong>
Quoting: aulis</p>

<p>So close and yet so far. Yes, there is a distortion. IN THE LENS. It is DOCUMENTED.</p>

<p>What -- does he think a camera lens records in perfect linear perspective?</p>

<p>Any distant object such as the Apennines and the crater St. George also move as a whole. Shadows on the mountains and on the crater change as well.
Quoting: aulis</p>

<p>So, let me get this straight -- the backgrounds are all a still projected image, but the shadows change? And, for that &gt;matter, in larger base stereo sets it is possible to &quot;see around&quot; the objects.</p>

<p>This is the difference between true 3d and the &quot;posterboard&quot; scheme that has been applied retroactively to certain modern movies. The former can actually see partially around objects. If you are shown a sphere, you see more than 50% of its surface. The latter can not.</p>

<p>Incidentally, he&#39;s wrong. The shadows aren&#39;t changing in the pair he cites. The exposure is changing (either as a processing result or because of his own manipulations).</p>

<p>POST 2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh goodie, Apollo 15, my favorite mission out of the whole bunch!</p>

<p>THIS is not parallax:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TYgAlpI.gif">link <del>to www.aulis.com</del> rehosted on imgur</a></p>

<p>That is optical distortion. That&#39;s why it looks like the entire mountain got pushed in one direction in the animation. Try as you might, you can&#39;t see the mountains in 3 dimensions by constructing a stereoscopic image with those frames. The astronaut turned quite a few degrees between taking those two pictures, and like it or not the image rendered by the camera is not perfectly flat. We have to correct for that properly, which is not what this jackwagon did. I ran the mountains through several iterations in Microsoft ICE to correct for the optical distortion and while I could run it through a few more times to get it perfect, you get the idea, there&#39;s no parallax there, it was just optical distortion:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SkZnTKf.gif">link <del>to i319.photobucket.com</del> rehosted on imgur</a></p>

<p>As you can see, it&#39;s nothing at all like what the jackwagon on AULIS was trying to present.</p>

<p>Now for one more for you, the first image he presents is actually easier to do and see that there&#39;s no parallax; the astronaut didn&#39;t turn as much and the relevant portion isn&#39;t as close to the edge of the field. Once again, throwing those through Microsoft ICE to overlay them and see if there&#39;s parallax...</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/KnFIEas.gif">link <del>to i319.photobucket.com</del> rehosted on imgur</a></p>

<p>Nope, no parallax there either, though the focus was better in one than the other :).</p>

<p>Now you may be wondering, how do I know Microsoft ICE isn&#39;t magically erasing parallax? Because it doesn&#39;t work like that. Let&#39;s take two photos that should show a great deal of parallax between them because the astronauts drove a good distance before pointing back to the same mountain range and taking another photo. Like say, AS15-82-11082 and AS15-82-11057. Well, when you try to do that, this is as good as it gets in terms of making them overlap properly:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/g2mEv6E.gif">link <del>to i319.photobucket.com</del> rehosted on imgur</a></p>

<p>Reason being? There&#39;s real parallax there. Those mountains really are many miles away and you really do have to drive a good distance on the moon to get enough baseline to see parallax. We can use that parallax to construct a 3d stereoscopic image of the mountains. Here&#39;s a cross-eye 3d picture <a href="http://www.starosta.com/3dshowcase/ihelp.html">link to www.starosta.com</a> of that valley I just showed you:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Lr5plz8.jpg">link <del>to i319.photobucket.com</del> rehosted on imgur</a></p>

<p>Microsoft ICE can&#39;t erase real parallax, it can just compensate for lens distortions, and that&#39;s all that guy on AULIS was seeing and measuring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what argument you&#39;re talking about, and the answer to that is this quote;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Detailed comparison of the backgrounds said to be identical in fact show significant changes in the relative positions of the hills that are consistent with the claimed locations that the images were taken from. Parallax effects clearly demonstrate that the images were taken from widely different locations around the landing sites. Claims that the appearance of the background is identical while the foreground changes (for example, from a boulder strewn crater to the Lunar Module) are trivially explained when the images were taken from nearby locations, akin to seeing distant mountains appearing the same on Earth from locations that are hundreds of feet apart showing different foreground items. Furthermore, as there is only an extremely tenuous atmosphere on the Moon, very distant objects will appear clearer and closer to the human eye. What appears as nearby hills in some photographs, are actually mountains several kilometers high and some 10–20 kilometers away. Changes in such very distant backgrounds are quite subtle, and can be mistaken for no change at all. As the Moon is also much smaller than the Earth, the horizon is significantly nearer in photographs than Earthbound observers are used to seeing (an eye 1.7 m above completely flat ground will see the horizon 4.7 km away on Earth, but only 2.4 km away on the Moon). This can lead to confusing interpretations of the images.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here&#39;s a pretty good response to the video from an adobe certified expert;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He said the layers cited by doubters are evidence of the use of common, off-the-shelf scanning software — not evidence of a forgery. &quot;I have seen a lot of illustrator documents that come from photos and contain those kind of clippings — and it looks exactly like this,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Tremblay explained that the scanner optical character recognition (OCR) software attempts to translate characters or words in a photograph into text. He said the layers cited by the doubters shows that software at work — and nothing more. </p>

<p>&quot;When you open it in Illustrator it looks like layers, but it doesn&#39;t look like someone built it from scratch. If someone made a fake it wouldn&#39;t look like this,&quot; he said. &quot;Some scanning software is trying to separate the background and the text and splitting element into layers and parts of layers.&quot; </p>

<p>Tremblay also said that during the scanning process, instances where the software was unable to separate text fully from background led to the creation of a separate layer within the document. This could be places where a signature runs over the line of background, or typed characters touch the internal border of the document. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a kid, but that&#39;s how my grandparents found and dug a well that still gives water decades later. Basically, the entire family, engineers and all, just walked around in circles around this country property with Y-shaped sticks, it made an impression, a memory I&#39;d totally forgotten about until someone posted something about the Coral Castle guy and I found some docs about his Y-shaped whatever-tool-it-was-he-invented. </p>

<p>After that, I looked up a bunch of YouTubes on it, but they all look fake--I remember it being a subtle, almost undetectable tug downwards when you walked over, not pulling severely and suddenly down like in the posted videos (i.e., more like gravitational pull, not a freaking supermagnet). But who knows, I was a kid. We kids tried it over and over again after this in our own yard, but to no success. :)</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting - I&#39;ve found that you can post about politics all day long, but anything that touches genetically modified food or medications (psych meds, vaccines, etc.) gets buried &amp; trolled immediately (they also wait a few days and come back again to ensure they have the last word on it).      </p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that if one so much as mentions the fact that cattle are ruminants (their digestive systems are specialized for grasses), there is sure to be a comment telling you why this fact is basically irrelevant. One of the more usual talking points is that cattle are usually grass-fed while they are calfs. At first, I just thought there were quite a few people who were passionate about their beef being raised on an artificial diet; but in light of recent revelations, I do wonder about it*.      </p>

<p>The thing is, even if I disagreed with a person, I would have great respect for them if they&#39;d just be honest and say, &quot;Yes, cattle are meant, by natural design, to graze upon grasses; however, modern industrialized farming makes feeding them an artificial diet more efficient and profitable.&quot;     </p>

<p>*I don&#39;t mean to suggest that anyone who defends industrialized meat production is a &quot;shill&quot; working at the behest of a large corportation. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the goal of corporate &quot;shilling&quot; is to insert talking points into discussions so that they are spread memetically by others; they have others defend their practices, they merely give them a bit of prompting on what to say. </p>

<p>That&#39;s fine and dandy, if many of those who support her actually understood fundamental theories of physics that have taken centuries to build, but they don&#39;t, which you personally have admitted to.

<p>Again, you&#39;re making vague statements without backing any of it up, regardless of whether or not you&#39;re &quot;tired&quot; of arguing about it.</p>

<p>What about her theory breaks the &quot;fundamental theories of physics&quot;?</p>

<p>You <em>do</em> realize that the &quot;fundamental theories of physics&quot; were <em>turned on their heads</em> just 100 years ago, right? The fact that you maintain that they took &quot;centuries&quot; to build exposes your bias. </p>

<p>We understand woefully little of our world, despite our unreasonable reliance on science to explain <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>Obviously you haven&#39;t read her book, otherwise you would&#39;ve directly responded to me with respect to that.</p>

<p>Honestly, I can&#39;t consider you informed enough to dismiss her case if you&#39;ve merely watched a couple of youtube videos and actually haven&#39;t taken the time to look at <em>all</em> of the evidence she provides.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to point out that although it may <em>seem</em> I&#39;m wholeheartedly supporting this theory, I <em>remain very skeptical</em>.</p>

<p><em>However</em>...I&#39;ve devoted considerable time to this theory, as well as the work of brilliant minds like Paul A. LaViolette and Tom van Flandern, and I have to say that their research seems to possibly confirm Wood&#39;s hypothesis.</p>

<p>I should be able to say that I don&#39;t buy the official Sandy Hook story <em>without</em> being lumped into a broader category that accepts <em>all</em> aspects of the conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying that questioning 9/11 automatically means you believe there were no planes that day, just because that just happens to be <em>one</em> theory of what happened that day.</p>

<p>Do you see what I&#39;m getting at here?</p>

<p>Except it&#39;s not. </p>

<p>What would happen to a valid conspiracy that is trying to be covered up? DOWNVOTE. </p>

<p>What would happen to a completely crazy conspiracy theory that people see as a waste of time or a distraction? DOWNVOTE. </p>

<p>My point is that you should not use the karma of a submission to determine the validity of a theory; you should use evidence. </p>
