    <div class="md"><p>I have wondered this, until the recent Greenwald article &amp; Snowden leak that is, as to why their is a subreddit seemingly dedicated to discrediting &amp; mocking this one, or &#39;satire&#39; as they put it, to focus on selective posts &amp; comments &amp; ignore the majority of the content, &amp; from what I notice, they often make <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasty_generalization">hasty generalizations</a> about conspiracy theorists, not to mention it only makes the us vs. them mentality that much worse of an issue to the point where we can&#39;t even discuss theories with each other without questioning the intentions of the person with whom we are debating, as they quite possibly could be a forum spy, since we now <del>know</del> have justified reason to believe they exist, &amp; this, I think we can all agree is exactly the desired effect, to lose trust in each other, thus killing the conversation.</p>

<p>Now that we have tangible evidence, in reference to the sticky post, of the existence* of forum spies, the psychological warfare they assuredly bring to the table, &amp; their desire to destroy our reputations, the key thing I try to remember is, mindgames can only serve to make you doubt yourself &amp; others if you allow it, if you stop caring what others think of you &amp; have the confidence believe what you want, &amp; discuss what you know, then you can effectively combat the nature of whatever this/these agencies call themselves (JTRIG) that we are up against, &amp; possibly even bring more people to the discussion, let them see that it&#39;s ok to go against the grain &amp; be independent of thought, that calling someone crazy for questioning authoritarianism is less rational than submitting to it.</p>

<p>&amp; often make generalisations about conspiracy theorists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes conspiratards speak from ignorance but they will tend to do that for when they do it with one another they often find themselves in the company of people who are willing to suspend their disbelief for humor and give a human the benefit of the doubt. </p>

<p>When they come here to circlejerk with one another they often get called out for being ignorant about contentious topics, even though those allegations are also made by people who don&#39;t have all the facts.</p>

<p>If ignorance is the root of all evil, then why is it so common to both sides of the issue? Why does one subreddit seem so hostile and the other seem intent on mocking this one?</p>

<p>Hmm?</p>

<p>Yeah I could out myself if I left it there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think we can all agree is exactly the desired effect, to lose trust in each other, thus killing the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t like it, I keep my own mind open enough to find the truth but I&#39;m not really <em>with them</em> I like them because they laugh at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and sometimes get really angry when things don&#39;t go their way. First they laugh at you, then they get angry at you, then <del>they</del> you win. But <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was once laughing at them, because before they banded together to assert their own opinions and present evidence that backed up their ideas as a group they found themselves being persecuted here on this subreddit by the majority who did not enjoy their world view being challenged in that manner.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Your second paragraph is a really really long sentence are you avoiding the word influence? </p>

<p>or Canada/international community and America?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well America is important to Canada in many ways but I don&#39;t think we can trust them with treating prisoners like we want them to and it&#39;s easier to say that if we consider ourselves to be the best at what we do then we should tell them maybe we can do it for them. I mean that whole &#39;Good governance&#39; thing is our motto but the Americans took &#39;Out of many, one&#39; in a way that makes think twice about it when it&#39;s paired with along with Annuit cœptis (Latin for &quot;He approves (has approved) of the undertaking&quot;) and Novus ordo seclorum, (Latin for &quot;New Order of the Ages&quot;). </p>

<p>Which looks kinda spooky but we can&#39;t spend all day discussing our differences; there are too many and we have other things to insinuate and imply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll assume the latter as it is a bit over my head</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hue, good for you, cause I didn&#39;t care either way anyways!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but is the issue that America does not want to hand over it&#39;s prisoners to the international courts, for whatever reason, and this is the problem correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_the_United_Nations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_the_United_Nations</a></p>

<p>Really it&#39;s a contentious topic but America doesn&#39;t want to pay debts as it means less purchasing power for their political prestige. </p>

<p>Or does it? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If yes, is this a cause for concern due to the alleged criminal elements presence in the US military?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you feel an intense flare-up upon the acknowledgement that I didn&#39;t care about the way you should feel cause that&#39;s funny I was only going to insinuate and imply that our shared audience couldn&#39;t change it. To our collective face it is true but only as a short answer because then you don&#39;t have to think about it as I move on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 1985 the U.S. Congress has refused to authorize payment of the U.S. dues, in order to force UN compliance with U.S. wishes, as well as a reduction in the U.S. assessment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hue, and the American public probably thinks something&#39;s amiss when people around the world think less of them because they have no real power over their elected officials. </p>

<p>I wonder who does?</p>

<p>My questions are supposed to make you think deeply on contentious issues in a way I desire; since I&#39;m an anarchist I can have a controversy that I don&#39;t even acknowledge because it&#39;s not in my interest to do so and no one can take my influence away from me. </p>

<p>I can be ignored. </p>

<p>I&#39;d talk about how Canadians suffer from a Garrisson Mentality, it&#39;s a thing that involves us feeling big but we need to protect ourselves and we overcompensate because we have huge amounts of land but few people and a dependance on other nations for a common security. </p>

<p>We are the best and there are few of us; we don&#39;t like to talk about it because then people will want to be like us.</p>

<p>Thankfully we live next door to a country with a pro-active foreign policy and a large list of enemies. This not only makes us look good to the world because we too have a pro-active foreign policy, we may in fact also have more friends than the Americans do. </p>

<p>Sucks to be them, if they were less active and wanted to talk about Canada instead of themselves to other countries will they say we are the best?</p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>I do think most conspiracy theories are wrong (unsupported by any decent evidence).</p>

<p>I talk to people who I think are wrong because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it&#39;s good to talk with people who disagree with you.  Good for me, good for them, good for society.  I learn things, they learn things, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>people with wrong ideas affect me: they vote, they spend or donate money, often they try to spread their wrong ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>I see a common thread among conspiracy theory thinking, religious thinking, pseudoscience, anti-science, and the gridlock in US politics today.  It&#39;s the attitude &quot;I know the one truth, no fact or anything you can say will change my mind, you&#39;re either with us or against us&quot;.  It&#39;s a dangerous way of thinking, and carries over from one area to another.</p></li>

<p>Not everybody believes these things, but as a regular visitor here, I have to point out that there is some serious leaps of faiths and jumping to random conclusions without a shred of evidence from users. And am baffled when people state these things as fact, entirely uncontested. There is a logic solving problem in this sub, as with every other conspiracy forum on earth...</p>

<p>And on the other side, there are juicy stories, and real detective work not found on any other subs, that keeps bringing me back. </p>

<p>There is some seriously messed up logic that goes on in this sub, but I rarely see a certain group of people attack that nonsense, its all about calling everyone anti-semites for some reason..</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll stop lumping all of this sub&#39;s users in with them when I see this sub&#39;s users collectively call them out on their bullshit.  Until then, you&#39;re all a bunch of sociopathic assholes with an irrational hatred of Jews and grieving parents.</p>

<p>Edit: How could I forget, you guys also tend to have an irrational hatred of views that dissent from this sub&#39;s mainstream.  You know, because you&#39;re all about &quot;alternative views&quot;, so long as they fit your own preconceived ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody&#39;s mad at our subreddit. We have nearly a quarter of a million redditors. I believe that BPB obviously has a very specific agenda. Conspiracy theorists are essentially critical thinkers who ask tough questions and enjoy piecing together puzzles. In a corrupt organization, the people who ask tough questions and challenge authority generally pose the greatest threat the status quo. It&#39;s a pretty clear logical jump. BPB&#39;s series of questionable actions have been broadcasted all over reddit and I believe he will be recognized as the dishonest and dishonorable person - or employee, that he is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone. There are always an irrational-thinking percentage of people in any demographic. I do believe it&#39;s safe to say that organizations such as governments are inherently interested in their own self-preservation and expansion of influence - just like any organism. It&#39;s much like wild animals in a battle for control and dominance to become the alpha male. I would agree that it&#39;s important to uphold a sense of objectivity and honesty when speculating and/or devising a theory. After all, for the most part conspiracy theorists do construct theories based on very limited supporting evidence. They may or may not be true. I think we can all agree on the effectiveness of the scientific method. It would be fair to say that the majority of our ideas are based on speculation and conjecture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally agree with you.  But it&#39;s been my experience that conspiracy theory guys are way over at the &quot;speculation and conjecture&quot; end of the spectrum, not near &quot;very limited supporting evidence&quot;, and FAR from &quot;start with evidence and see where it leads you&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if that is the case, it&#39;s important to keep in mind that these theories are merely attempts to explain a set of ideas. They are by no means necessarily true, and a solid theory that&#39;s true to the scientific method will have as much supporting evidence as possible; granted for all these theories there is typically never concrete evidence otherwise they would accepted as common knowledge. e.g. NSA/Art of Deception.</p>

<p>While there may be some truth to many of these claims, it&#39;s not surprising that many people just aren&#39;t very skilled at properly presenting their ideas in an objective manner. Doing so generally requires dedicated research and an affinity for self expression.</p>

<p>Because when you cant destroy a sub by getting on it&#39;s mod list, you go after it&#39;s users and it&#39;s image.</p>

<p>Because this god damn site is filled with more PR firms than k street.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason people are angry is that we sometimes (when the mods allow it) discuss topics forbidden by the cultural Marxists who run our lives and who control the corporate media. These topics are not politically correct. That&#39;s what enrages the sheeple. They&#39;ve been trained to attack anyone who raises a taboo topic, like the flock of seagulls in Hitchcock&#39;s <em>The Birds</em>. If we confined our discussions to UFOs and Bigfoot, they would leave us alone, but when we talk about Israel and race relations and homosexuality and abortion and women&#39;s rights and racial intelligence and the Holocaust and white genocide and the war against Christianity, we are constantly stepping on the toes of the elite, and their army of attack seagulls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps I haven&#39;t clearly understood what you mean by <em>organic curation</em>.</p>

<p>I had the idea it meant the post would succeed or fail based on decisions of those who frequent this sub. Whether OP is a troll or not, redditors can determine if a submission is worthy of thought-provoking discussion &amp; debate, or should be downvoted into oblivion.  To me organic curation connotes a natural progression in either a positive, neutral or negative direction.  </p>

<p>To summarily dismiss the post simply because it offended the sensibilities of the moderator is actually offensive to me. Such paternalism isn&#39;t necessary. Had the moderator not removed the post, it most assuredly would have been voted down by redditors. Plus, some choice ideas supporting either side of the issue(s) presented could have come to the fore.</p>

<p>Let the offensive material remain because it actually strengthens the position it&#39;s attempting to villify. Removing it reflects a glaring lack of self-confidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to me, the juxtaposition of &quot;program&quot; with &quot;organic&quot; is antithetical. Programming suggests pre-ordained, strict adherence to procedural protocols, while organic is adaptive to the flow of the friggin&#39; universe.  (btw, that jtrig program was an oppressive tool of the authoritarian state, why would anyone want to adopt that?)</p>

<p>I disagree with the idea of censorship or suppression of speech/ideas under the guise of protecting the sanctity of .... whatever.  No authority is required to dictate what constitutes good or bad.  If manipulation or subterfuge is attempted, trust those who are reviewing it to deal with it.  To do otherwise would be to weaken the ability in others to discern bullshit when it&#39;s right in front of them.  Teach, don&#39;t protect. Protecting creates dependency rather than independent self-reliance.  </p>

<p>Anyway, enough of my soap-box.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve encountered many shills while traipsing about Reddit, although I&#39;m unaware of any of their affiliations. </p>

<p>They are a fact of life, there will always be those who will attempt to hijack the narrative. But it&#39;s essential that we don&#39;t adopt their reprehensible tactics. Never model the temporary successes of the enemy. Learning basic <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">logical fallacies</a> goes a long way towards thwarting the efforts of shills one confronts on reddit. </p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s been good chatting with you. </p>

<p>Take care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP brought up a good question. Why are the tards so obsessed with discrediting this sub? Why even bother?   </p>

<p>If it was just a source of amusement for you guys it wouldn&#39;t bother me personally (I used to laugh in peoples faces when they brought up 9/11). I think whats bothersome is a lot of us have noticed patterns emerging that go beyond playful trolling. It&#39;s become obvious certain members are in business to discredit this sub.</p>

<p>jtrig program was an oppressive tool of the authoritarian state, why would anyone want to adopt that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s their job? Did you Eglin airforce base is the most active userbase on reddit by leaps and bounds?</p>

<p>Anyway; ideologically I could not agree with you more, but when JTRIG tactics are attempted on this sub every single day there has to be some way to protect the sanctity of the free flow of information.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely a quagmire and I hope you&#39;ll discus this here more over time, as you have your finger on the pulse of some very important threads. </p>

<p>Dude, do you have any idea how many times I&#39;ve been &quot;outed&quot; as a government/Jewish/Illuminati shill, simply for disagreeing with someone&#39;s claims or calling for a source/evidence?</p>

<p>Pot kettle black, my friend. Pot kettle black.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of shit that gets posted here and upvoted like:</p>

<ul>
<li>anti vaccine idiots.</li>
<li>chem trails.</li>
<li>the, it was a missile, there was no plane crowd. </li>
<li>doxxing innocent people because they think they are liars/involed in a conspiracy</li>
<li>&quot;insert american event here&quot; was a red flag attack to &quot;goverment action&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Not everybody believes these things, but as a regular visitor here, I have to point out that there is some serious leaps of faiths and jumping to random conclusions without a shred of evidence from users. And am baffled when people state these things as fact, entirely uncontested. There is a logic solving problem in this sub, as with every other conspiracy forum on earth...</p>

<p>And on the other side, there are juicy stories, and real detective work not found on any other subs, that keeps bringing me back. </p>

<p>There is some seriously messed up logic that goes on in this sub, but I rarely see a certain group of people attack that nonsense, its all about calling everyone anti-semites for some reason..</p>
