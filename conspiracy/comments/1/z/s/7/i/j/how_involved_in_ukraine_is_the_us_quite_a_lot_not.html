        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A little background: In 1997 a public-policy &quot;think-tank&quot; was formed in Washington DC called Project for the New American Century (PNAC). Its views mission was to spread American ideology worldwide, that &quot;American leadership is both good for America and good for the world&quot;, and also to promote the Reagan views on foreign policy and military strength.  </p>

<p>The two founders of the PNAC were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kristol">William Kristol</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kagan">Robert Kagan</a>. Kristol is a well known neo-conservative who, along with Dick Cheney, is eager to mobilize American military forces anywhere at anytime, essentially advancing American exceptionalism.  </p>

<p>Without going in too deep into September 11 issues, the PNAC has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Controversies">strongly accused</a> for their potential role in September 11, and the subsequent Iraq/Afghanistan wars. Kristol himself has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kristol#Political_views">a fervent advocate</a> of entering wars and conflicts. Kagan, the other co-founder of the PNAC, happens to be the husband of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Nuland">Victoria Nuland</a></p>

<p>Victoria Nuland may not be a familiar name right now, but she has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QxZ8t3V_bk">actively present</a> during this entire Ukraine crisis, right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6czKOr0Wxfw">from the beginning</a>. Nuland was also seen <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/12/11/250215712/world-is-watching-u-s-diplomat-tells-ukraine">handing out snacks</a> to protestors over the past few months, making sure the protests and eventual overthrowing of the Yanukovych government, are carried out. As a side note, notice that the open discussion with Nuland about the Ukraine situation is sponsored by Chevron. Could there be a certain something in Ukraine that Chevron might be interested in, such as a natural resource of some type, that Ukraine has an abundance of? </p>

<p>The point of this post is not to show that I am a fan of Putin&#39;s (I am not!) but I want people to take a look at these details and see how the people involved with this conflict are all intertwined and connected, and what they represent. Furthermore, look at the people and names involved, and notice what they all stand for politically, and where they can be traced back to. They all have the common ideology, or label, of neo-conservative.  </p>

<p>For the past ~2-3 weeks, the media (here in North America) has been almost entirely one-sided. The similarities among media information has been eerily similar to the weeks and months leading up to the Iraq war; no one bothered to look into what the Bush Admin. was actually claiming, until it was too late. And the few journalists who did, were silenced and disparaged. I am noticing a lot of similarities in the past 2 weeks, with almost all anti-Russia sentiment, without anyone actually asking <em>&quot;why is Russia doing what they are doing?&quot;</em> </p>

<p>Again, I am not saying what Putin has done is acceptable, or that I approve of it, but when we look at the people involved on Ukraine&#39;s side, it&#39;s hard to blame Putin for his actions. He sees a legitimate threat moving in next-door to him, and he&#39;s not happy about it. I don&#39;t condone it at all, however, rather than criticizing the reaction of Putin, maybe we should start looking at the actions which preceded this reaction, and start criticizing those involved.</p>

<p>It&#39;s something to note that there appears to be a purposeful push in the US right now to make the US itself look ineffectual and Putin super-villain powerful, when the US is actually very powerful plus is backed by the EU and powerful Middle Eastern states...and Putin&#39;s back is actually up against the wall (just like the Syria affair, which he managed to finagle a peaceful way out of at the time).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct me if I&#39;m mistaken, but didn&#39;t the government, with the assurance of Russia&#39;s support, attack it&#39;s own citizens?  Didn&#39;t Putin send in troops prior to the West actually doing anything?  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/ukraine-crisis-protesters-kiev-euromaidan-independence-square">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/04/ukraine-crisis-protesters-kiev-euromaidan-independence-square</a></p>

<p>Ukraine, again with Russia&#39;s support, seized the rights of its own citizens to protest the actions of their government.  This is the behavior of a dictatorial state, not a government representing the voice of its people.  Can we not agree that that, at least, is worthy of condemnation in itself?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25771595">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25771595</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m all for questioning our own actions especially when it appears one-sided, which I believe is summed up nicely in the famous quote by Mark Twain, &quot;whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect&quot;, and maybe you have a good point about examining our role in this situation, but sometimes it&#39;s one-sided because, well, the only other side is promoting authentic institutionalized oppression.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Its hard to know when the West began to do anything, since, of course, they don&#39;t explicitly say they have done anything. My thinking is that the US/EU has been a part of all of this since the Orange Revolution. There is a quote from William Kristol where he even talks of the Americans and Europeans&#39; failure that the Orange Revolution wasn&#39;t successful and that they will have to use that lesson for the future. (foreshadowing) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can we not agree that that, at least, is worthy of condemnation in itself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely! For the past few weeks I have found myself defending myself, because people often mistake my stance on this as being pro-Putin, which couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. I understand the corruption within Yanukovych&#39;s government, and his close ties to Putin. And Putin himself doesn&#39;t have a shining track record with civil liberties. But my argument is simply that, the US has used those negatives about Putin/Yanukovych and demonized him to make them seem like tyrannical madmen who need to be removed for the good of international peace. To me, that is far too eerily similar to the rhetoric we heard in the spring of 2003 before Iraq, when all the media was one-sided, and reported the same stories with the same angle. No one bothered, at the time, to look into the Bush family&#39;s ties with the middle east to see <em>why</em> they might be doing this. Those who did question it, were put down and considered pro-Saddam. </p>

<p>So to sum up my posts in a nutshell, Im not pro-Putin&#39;s side, nor am I anti-USA&#39;s side. Im simply trying to shine a bit of light on the details on why this has occurred, who the players involved are, what their ties to other high ranking government officials are, and just generally trying to get people to ask more questions than what we&#39;re being given in the media. We&#39;re just told it started out as protests because Putin/Yanukovych are terrible, and the people want better. But there&#39;s more to it than that. If that&#39;s all it was, that doesn&#39;t make it legitimate for the US to go in, and that certainly would not provoke Putin to move military forces in. There are things moving below the surface, and that&#39;s what Im trying to show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this a serious question? Just for some background Russia/Soviet Union and the USA have been at odds with each other in ideology, culture, and geopolitical views for hundreds of years. Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US has been in numerous wars, conflicts, uprisings, and coup&#39;s, adding to their geopolitic strength, which, understandably, has not pleased Putin. So now when he sees the US trying to move in next door to him, you can imagine what his reaction might be: actually you don&#39;t have to imagine, you just have to watch the news and read some background!

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, which makes the current government all the more illegitimate. The Yanukovych government was democratically elected, and then overthrown by a protest of people, and now magically the US has decided to recognize <em>that</em> as legitimate (which is no surprise, since they are the ones who funded the protests and placed a leader of their choosing in power). </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s why Putin is none too happy, because his neighbour, who was a close ally of his, has a now been sacked and replaced by someone who is an opponent of Putin&#39;s, and favours US/EU/NATO. </p>
