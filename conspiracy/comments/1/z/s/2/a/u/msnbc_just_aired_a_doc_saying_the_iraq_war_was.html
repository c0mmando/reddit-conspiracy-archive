       Here is their agenda.  Pretend to be anti-war by airing this doc condemning the Bush administration for Iraq, while unironically spreading propaganda and misinformation about the Crimea situation.  MSNBC is a pro war network.  It will always be this way.  If we had gone to war with Syria MSNBC would be cheering and waiving flags.  They are General Electric's 24/7 "news" network, and they aim to maintain GE's perpetual war economy.

       I don't like having to defend MSNBC, but this is not exactly accurate. They were a very different network back then. It wasn't until Keith Olbermann started becoming popular after the Iraq invasion that they became the "liberal" media outlet. And they have never been anti-war, just anti-Republican. Republican typically tends to mean pro-war so that's how people can get confused.

       I have
       <em>

       of problems with them, but this is....disingenuous at best. The more people who will come to accept that the Iraq war was baseless and never about terrorism, the better.

       What is a RINO? Republicans have had a similar ideology since the 1980s when Reagan redefined the party. Pro deregulation, pro family values and yes pro military. Every Republican candidate since has run on a similar platform, and they have been nominated by Republican primary voters. So who are these "true Republicans" who are not getting represented?

       But he happily approved every increase (minus one) that the Dems asked for. He gave them anything they wanted (I'm talking about the Dems in power, not the loons who vote for them because they are dumb enough to believe Dem propaganda about hating war and oil, even though most of them are heavily invested in both, with a very few exceptions).

       That's because they weren't always the liberal party in many ways. Now they are. Still pro war if it helps their guy, but the party as a whole has far more anti war types than Republicans.

       Sports, in general, are almost completely a two party deal. Either it's two teams competing against each other or two people competing against each other. In sports with more than two teams or two individuals competing against each other, it's common to boil the field down to two or three "important" competitors. Sure, there could be hundreds of people running a marathon...but these guys are "the ones to watch."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not so much that sports influence political choices, but they serve to reinforce the "there are only two choices" that people so often fall in to in politics.

       Well it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       about terrorism, but not terrorism on US soil. I firmly believe we needed to free Iraq, but the Iraq war was lead by people who didn't understand the situation in its entirety, and didn't defend it well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was justified to the public in terms of attacking Al Qaeda - something a country-specific war could never achieve - when in fact it was about liberating people from an oppressive, mass murdering dictator who used chemical weapons on "his own people".
      </p>
      <p>
       I put "his own people" in quotes as that's a phrase that was used a lot, when in reality the Shi'ites and Kurds in his country were as culturally different as you could get, and seeking independence.

       A country can lawfully withdraw another states sovereignty if any of the following occur:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Repeated aggression against neighbouring states
       </li>
       <li>
        The country violates a non-proliferation treaty
       </li>
       <li>
        Habouring internationally wanted terrorists
       </li>
       <li>
        Acts of genocide

       Iraq had done all of those, more than once. The UN knew that, the US knew that when it created the Iraq Liberation Act. The UK and US had
       <em>
        every right there is

       to free the Iraqi people.

       Lawfully? Who writes those laws? The same people that want to invade I guess. Your attitude is typical imperialism where you hold yourself above the rest of the world. I could sit here and go on about all other countries that fall under your bullet points that have not been invaded, but that would require more effort than this discussion is worth.

       Well as of now, they're split between international law, the UN, and some parts of the Geneva convention. Largely speaking, though, it follows English Common Law and more recently the changes pushed by Churchill &amp; the likes after WWII.

       Nope, I hold democratic societies above genocidal mass murderers. So I suppose that's a fair chunk of the world.

       And I would agree that those people need liberating, whether by politics (preferable) or military action (if there has been genocides in the order of hundreds of thousands of people, as there were in Iraq)

       I know what Hitchens has to say about it, I've been on this subject more that a few times :P. Chris Hitchens was great, but he can fuck off when it comes to Iraq, God rest his soul (!).

       There are plenty of despots all over the world who were as bad or even worse than Saddam. North Korea is a good example. Everyone in this sub should really watch this documentary, I have it on right now and it's damn good. The best one I've seen by a mainstream media outlet by far. They are talking about the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       reasons for the invasion and providing interviews with people who were there saying basically it's about oil, yet still haven't used the big P word[petrodollar].
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;Dr of it: Iraq wanted to sell it's oil with euros instead of exclusively dollars. The U.S. didn't like that at the time, as there would be less of a need for dollars to be circulating in the world, making the value drop, and with it the economy of the U.S. (gross(est?) simplification of this ever, but it'll do). And if Iraq got away with it who's to say others wouldn't also try to get away with it? (funny story, Iran and Brazil and a few others still got away with it) Add with that the idiots in power who thought it would be a quick war.

       Yes, and we've waited far too long without doing anything for the North Korean people.

       Don't get me wrong, I'm not standing here saying the Iraq war was a total success and nothing went wrong and the UK and US are the best countries on Earth ever, because it wasn't and we're not. It was a poorly led war, sold to our people on false premises. But it
       <em>
        was

       better than standing by any longer and watching a genocidal dictator murder any more people.

       RE the oil point - prior to Iraq, the oil industry was owned and controlled by Saddam and his "administration". Now it's under the control of his people but influenced by other world actors. Both suck, but I know which I prefer.

       For invading Iraq to have been an Imperialist nice, we would have had to consolidate Iraq into the British Empire (which doesn't exist any more) or American Empire (which never existed), by it's very definition. That's what imperial means - of or pertaining to an empire.

       When the British shaped and divided these Middle Eastern countries, they did so with specific design, as to make these countries an nonviable as possible. they did so by mixing and keeping different non compatible ethnicities and cultures together inside specifically "drawn" borders. The idea was to keep the people fighting each other, so they are easier to control. Iraq is still not a viable country. It needs to be split into 3 different countries, so people are at peace. But who would want to do that?

       Sorry to invoke a cliché, but he who pays the piper calls the tune, and the pipers are paid by the owners of the media outlet, and by those that own/control the companies that advertise - funding the "news" networks. Oftentimes these positions overlap, as corporate power and control continuously consolidates into fewer and fewer hands.

       Those info graphics are astounding; it's one thing to read a dryly-written (if informative) article on the subject, but seeing it represented visually really helps in wrapping one's head around the fact that this is a real, substantive issue.

       In my opinion the war is not about oil, that is to simple an explanation; the war was about what I like to call political chess. Look at the last two nations we have taken a foothold in. We already pretty much have our hooks into Saudi Arabia, Israel is our friend/whatever, and now we are creating buffer zones and areas which are in close proximity to our other threats around the globe. At this time the threats to the US are as follows, Iran, Russia, China/ North Korea. So we have land strategically placed south of Russia in Afghanistan, Iraq and Afghanistan on either side of Iran, Japan and South Korea in Asia, etc. We have basically made it impossible for either of these nations to expand their land and influence, and now we have the capability to smother their income and export. It is all a power play disguised as a need for oil.

       We don't have our hooks in Saudi Arabia, they have their hooks in us...more so, we have politicians who get lots of money from them. The 2nd Iraq war was about destroying Iraqs capability to sell oil, which gave the Saudis more business/power over oil prices. Saudi Arabia and Israel see eye to eye a lot more than say Saudi Arabia and Iran, or Syria, or pretty much any other powerful nation in that region.  The largest proven oil reserves are in Venezuela anyway, I'm sure we are doing something down there to fuck up their country behind the scenes in order to benefit our businesses someway now or in the future.

       I always thought they went after Iraq because it was the weakest country in the region, and they desired first person representation in the region, instead of operating through proxies like Israel and SA. They can't control Israel, or the Saudis, or Iran; Iraq was the only piece on the board that could feasibly be taken over with the whole world watching.

       The latest Iraq war was about the petro dollar, not oil per se.  Sadaam dropped the petro dollar in favor of the euro, and was attacked  shortly thereafter.  Notice, there was no coalition of the willing this time around.

       The first war was because of an imminent threat to the nations in the region and to restrain an out-of-control dictator.  Foolishly we didn't go all the way to Baghdad and left Hussein's bunch in power.
      </p>

       The second war was because we were
       <em>
        required

       to intervene under the treaty terms of the first war as Iraq violated agreement after agreement.  This was mostly because we foolishly left Hussein in power after the first war.

       The corporate entities such as MSNBC will talk about being against war in the abstract, but they won't take any strong stand in the concrete, about any current operation. It sounds so great to be against war, in some vague and undefined way, but it doesn't mean anything. Which current wars are you against? Why?

       if there is evidence that the bush administration lied to the american peeps / the world ( and I'm pretty sure that there is) i think that they should be brought up on war crimes. I'm so tired of americans (me included) complacency on holding people accountable. the bankers that caused the '07 economic collapse not only got away with it but they lined the shit out of their pockets while raping every retirement, pensions, 401k's, etc... if there is no accountability then americans will continue to get taken advantage of.

       Comcast owns NBC now but it's a very convoluted mess. GE did own it, but sold it to Vivendi or Microsoft, and somehow now Comcast owns it. I still think GE is connected, but unsure.

       Life gets a lot better when you stop watching TV.  You are no longer bothered by the endless stream of propaganda so it no longer has power over you.  They lose viewership so they can die the death they deserve.  You can spend your time improving your life and thus the world while gathering what news you like from an array of online sources, providing to you a broadened perspective.

       Capitalism. 
This is what happens when people insists that everything must be  private. You get private media that, surprise surprise, push their own private agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       In saner countries there is state media, that don't have these hidden agendas. However, those
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       also be dangerous when they turn into propaganda channels, but usually that's rather easy to spot and therefore disregard. I know what I prefer.

       Are you kidding?  Cheney had already divided up Iraq's oil fields among the big oil companies before there was ever a US soldier over there.

       Most of the oil fields did not go to US companies. Iraq was given freedom to do the oil deals, and they gave most of the deals to European companies.

       I still think it's strange that the US engineered a war for oil and now, dollar wise, 60% of the bounty goes to Iraq, Russian, Chinese and Korean companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the war was more about some ideological bullshit. Trillions of dollars of tax payer money was spent to get few tens of billions of dollars for oil companies? Even the defense industry made
       <em>
        much more
       </em>
       from the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very unlikely that the real reason was oil.

       The Cold War was not a conflict between the US and USSR.  They never fought.  The USSR essentially stuck to the deal it made with the other allies after WWII dividing up conquered countries.  The Cold War was truly a hot conflict between the US and poor third world countries it thought it could colonize.  Meaning US businesses would control the resources and industry of these countries instead of the countries themselves.  The War on Terror is the same deal.  A cover for the US to colonize poor, third world countries it thinks will be easy to beat.

        explain this

       , which is completely consistent with Israel's (and their US
       <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Golem.html">
        Golem's
       </a>
       ) behavior re: Libya, Egypt and Syria. All four "states" were attacked because their "strongmen" kept the lid on internal tribal turmoil; thus each "state" presented a unified "threat" to Israel's
       <em>
        lebensraum

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The most expedient 'solution' was to overthrow the strongmen. The resultant 'democracies' naturally fractured into ethnic squabbling and guaranteed Iraq, Egypt, Libya and (soon) Syria will never mount a serious resistance to Israeli invasion and 'cleansing'.
