Pretend to be anti-war by airing this doc condemning the Bush administration for Iraq, while unironically spreading propaganda and misinformation about the Crimea situation.  MSNBC is a pro war network.  It will always be this way.  If we had gone to war with Syria MSNBC would be cheering and waiving flags.  They are General Electric&#39;s 24/7 &quot;news&quot; network, and they aim to maintain GE&#39;s perpetual war economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like having to defend MSNBC, but this is not exactly accurate. They were a very different network back then. It wasn&#39;t until Keith Olbermann started becoming popular after the Iraq invasion that they became the &quot;liberal&quot; media outlet. And they have never been anti-war, just anti-Republican. Republican typically tends to mean pro-war so that&#39;s how people can get confused.</p>

<p>I have <em>plenty</em> of problems with them, but this is....disingenuous at best. The more people who will come to accept that the Iraq war was baseless and never about terrorism, the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sports, in general, are almost completely a two party deal. Either it&#39;s two teams competing against each other or two people competing against each other. In sports with more than two teams or two individuals competing against each other, it&#39;s common to boil the field down to two or three &quot;important&quot; competitors. Sure, there could be hundreds of people running a marathon...but these guys are &quot;the ones to watch.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much that sports influence political choices, but they serve to reinforce the &quot;there are only two choices&quot; that people so often fall in to in politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it <em>was</em> about terrorism, but not terrorism on US soil. I firmly believe we needed to free Iraq, but the Iraq war was lead by people who didn&#39;t understand the situation in its entirety, and didn&#39;t defend it well.</p>

<p>It was justified to the public in terms of attacking Al Qaeda - something a country-specific war could never achieve - when in fact it was about liberating people from an oppressive, mass murdering dictator who used chemical weapons on &quot;his own people&quot;.</p>

<p>I put &quot;his own people&quot; in quotes as that&#39;s a phrase that was used a lot, when in reality the Shi&#39;ites and Kurds in his country were as culturally different as you could get, and seeking independence.</p>

<p>Well as of now, they&#39;re split between international law, the UN, and some parts of the Geneva convention. Largely speaking, though, it follows English Common Law and more recently the changes pushed by Churchill &amp; the likes after WWII.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope, I hold democratic societies above genocidal mass murderers. So I suppose that&#39;s a fair chunk of the world.</p>

<p>And I would agree that those people need liberating, whether by politics (preferable) or military action (if there has been genocides in the order of hundreds of thousands of people, as there were in Iraq)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what Hitchens has to say about it, I&#39;ve been on this subject more that a few times :P. Chris Hitchens was great, but he can fuck off when it comes to Iraq, God rest his soul (!).</p>

<p>Ok that was too mean.</p>

<p>There are plenty of despots all over the world who were as bad or even worse than Saddam. North Korea is a good example. Everyone in this sub should really watch this documentary, I have it on right now and it&#39;s damn good. The best one I&#39;ve seen by a mainstream media outlet by far. They are talking about the <em>actual</em> reasons for the invasion and providing interviews with people who were there saying basically it&#39;s about oil, yet still haven&#39;t used the big P word[petrodollar].</p>

<p>Tl;Dr of it: Iraq wanted to sell it&#39;s oil with euros instead of exclusively dollars. The U.S. didn&#39;t like that at the time, as there would be less of a need for dollars to be circulating in the world, making the value drop, and with it the economy of the U.S. (gross(est?) simplification of this ever, but it&#39;ll do). And if Iraq got away with it who&#39;s to say others wouldn&#39;t also try to get away with it? (funny story, Iran and Brazil and a few others still got away with it) Add with that the idiots in power who thought it would be a quick war.</p>

<p>Yes, and we&#39;ve waited far too long without doing anything for the North Korean people.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not standing here saying the Iraq war was a total success and nothing went wrong and the UK and US are the best countries on Earth ever, because it wasn&#39;t and we&#39;re not. It was a poorly led war, sold to our people on false premises. But it <em>was</em> better than standing by any longer and watching a genocidal dictator murder any more people.</p>

<p>RE the oil point - prior to Iraq, the oil industry was owned and controlled by Saddam and his &quot;administration&quot;. Now it&#39;s under the control of his people but influenced by other world actors. Both suck, but I know which I prefer.</p>

<p>Which documentary, by the way? You didn&#39;t name or link to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion the war is not about oil, that is to simple an explanation; the war was about what I like to call political chess. Look at the last two nations we have taken a foothold in. We already pretty much have our hooks into Saudi Arabia, Israel is our friend/whatever, and now we are creating buffer zones and areas which are in close proximity to our other threats around the globe. At this time the threats to the US are as follows, Iran, Russia, China/ North Korea. So we have land strategically placed south of Russia in Afghanistan, Iraq and Afghanistan on either side of Iran, Japan and South Korea in Asia, etc. We have basically made it impossible for either of these nations to expand their land and influence, and now we have the capability to smother their income and export. It is all a power play disguised as a need for oil. </p>

The 2nd Iraq war was about destroying Iraqs capability to sell oil, which gave the Saudis more business/power over oil prices. Saudi Arabia and Israel see eye to eye a lot more than say Saudi Arabia and Iran, or Syria, or pretty much any other powerful nation in that region.  The largest proven oil reserves are in Venezuela anyway, I&#39;m sure we are doing something down there to fuck up their country behind the scenes in order to benefit our businesses someway now or in the future.</p>

All four &quot;states&quot; were attacked because their &quot;strongmen&quot; kept the lid on internal tribal turmoil; thus each &quot;state&quot; presented a unified &quot;threat&quot; to Israel&#39;s <em>lebensraum</em>.</p>

<p>The most expedient &#39;solution&#39; was to overthrow the strongmen. The resultant &#39;democracies&#39; naturally fractured into ethnic squabbling and guaranteed Iraq, Egypt, Libya and (soon) Syria will never mount a serious resistance to Israeli invasion and &#39;cleansing&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consistency and truth have never been MSNBC&#39;s strong points.</p>

<p>The first war was because of an imminent threat to the nations in the region and to restrain an out-of-control dictator.  Foolishly we didn&#39;t go all the way to Baghdad and left Hussein&#39;s bunch in power.</p>

<p>The second war was because we were <em>required</em> to intervene under the treaty terms of the first war as Iraq violated agreement after agreement.  This was mostly because we foolishly left Hussein in power after the first war.</p>

<p>I think the war was more about some ideological bullshit. Trillions of dollars of tax payer money was spent to get few tens of billions of dollars for oil companies? Even the defense industry made <em>much more</em> from the war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey downvoters, <a href="http://allfaith.com/graphics2/eretzisraelmaplg.jpg">explain this</a>, which is completely consistent with Israel&#39;s (and their US <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Golem.html">Golem&#39;s</a>) behavior re: Libya, Egypt and Syria. All four &quot;states&quot; were attacked because their &quot;strongmen&quot; kept the lid on internal tribal turmoil; thus each &quot;state&quot; presented a unified &quot;threat&quot; to Israel&#39;s <em>lebensraum</em>.</p>

<p>The most expedient &#39;solution&#39; was to overthrow the strongmen. The resultant &#39;democracies&#39; naturally fractured into ethnic squabbling and guaranteed Iraq, Egypt, Libya and (soon) Syria will never mount a serious resistance to Israeli invasion and &#39;cleansing&#39;.</p>
