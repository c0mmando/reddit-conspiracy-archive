<p>This is a picture from the 1970s of Osama Bin Laden and his family visiting sweeden.</p>

<p>It really made the think that something is wrong with this picture. If you notice no one is wearing the garb that his organization forces on people.  Also there seems to be 2,what appear to be, homosexual males.</p>

<p>Something just doesn&#39;t seem right here. Sure people change, but not drastically enough to oppress their entire families. </p>

<p>I know this is clinching at unsubstantiated evidence, But something really seems off.</p>

<p>Why would he force everyone to start wearing burkas. Why would he condem homosexuality within his group.  I am not saying that people over in Islamic countries ruled by his cult are not oppressed, I am just saying that there has to be some major outside influence. For example we know that he, and several of his family members, were trained by the US military. </p>

<p>I dunno just something I thought you guys would find interesting.</p>

<p>after all you have to be getting tired of listening to that idiot from infowars.com </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why that has to be the case. Home grown terrorist suspects in Britain for example tend to be more radicalized from their environment outside the family. The friends and family of the London tube bombings had no idea what they were up to. Maybe this could be applied more to the Middle East. And I suppose Taliban fighters are a good example of Muslims being raised with radical views, giving the situation Muslims have historically found themselves in in Afghanistan. I.e. constant foreign occupation. </p>

<p>The fact that Bin Laden was cut off from his immediate family suggests that it was more likely external influences which got to him. Particularly when he was at university. </p>

<p>Ayman al-Zawahiri, Bin Ladens right hand man, and perhaps the real mastermind behind Al Queda and 9/11, was a respected doctor who cut himself off from his family to fight jihad in Egypt from the 1970s onwards. </p>

<p>My father, who has always considered himself quite masculine, had a tendency to wear pink or yellow suits. Why? It was considered &quot;hip&quot;. It also wasn&#39;t associated with the stigma OP believes they are seeing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this is entirely relevant, and I can&#39;t say much for Saudi Arabia. But I would like to point out that in the late 1950s, 60s and 70s the Middle East was a much more progressive place than it is now, mainly due to pro Western regimes like the Shah in Iran and the Egyptian Prime Minister Anwar Sadat.</p>

<p>Also, Osama Bin Laden exiled himself from his family I believe. Don&#39;t quote me on that though. But the 20th and 21st century is full of examples of Muslims becoming radicalized and then leaving their families as a result.</p>

<p>This picture wasn&#39;t that unusual for the times. Go and look at some of the pictures of 1960&#39;s Iran and Egypt, some of them are indistinguishable from 1980&#39;s Miami. Women were allowed to walk about in bikinis and they were given the right to vote in Iran etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, That was one of the first things I noticed that made it seem strange to me. Osama is supposed to be this big baddie, yet you can tell he is honestly happy here. In no way do I see any anger or disdain in his eyes.</p>

<p>Take a look at this picture from Iran in the 1970s: <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__e2VLp6gwyk/SeWT-PY8qJI/AAAAAAAADFQ/OE_IOypofH0/s320/BR9.jpg">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__e2VLp6gwyk/SeWT-PY8qJI/AAAAAAAADFQ/OE_IOypofH0/s320/BR9.jpg</a></p>

<p>And this one from an Iranian magazine of the time: <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__e2VLp6gwyk/SeV8xHk3wvI/AAAAAAAADC4/efkD9ajbY6g/s400/Forouzan_on_the_cover_of_magazine_1974.jpg">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/__e2VLp6gwyk/SeV8xHk3wvI/AAAAAAAADC4/efkD9ajbY6g/s400/Forouzan_on_the_cover_of_magazine_1974.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say it refutes anything. Bin Laden, like many Islamic fundamentalists, became radicalized over time. Bin Laden first began researching the Quran and jihad whilst at university in the late 1970s. </p>

<p>His hatred of the West was motivated by a belief that U.S. foreign policy had oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East. (Which, as we know, is true)</p>

<p>Other interests of Bin Laden included writing poetry; reading, with the works of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and Charles de Gaulle said to be among his favorites; black stallions; and association football, in which he enjoyed playing at center forward and followed the English club Arsenal F.C.</p>
