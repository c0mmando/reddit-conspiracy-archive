       First he's accused on worldnews of getting caught
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ywspe/new_snowden_doc_reveals_how_gchqnsa_use_the/cfovykf">
        running a vote brigade

       deliberately trying to discredit
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . He moves quickly to deny it, calling it
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yUbGC8T.png">
        an 'experiment'
       </a>
       , also claiming that it was
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Nr6O4qj.png">
        2AM in the morning and he was drunk.

       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tk4nq/in_which_ubipolarbear0_summons_his_voting_brigade/">
        In this post
       </a>
       it shows he posted a link to one of the 'experiment' threads to an IRC channel, with people who actively want r/conspiracy to disappear, less than a minute after he submitted to reddit.

      <p>
       <a href="/u/bipolarbear0">

       decides to make a
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1z51r2/rconspiracy_is_calling_for_bipolarbear0_to_be/cfqorke">
        'Central Hub Of Facts'
       </a>
       where he lies about
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/k1vUjxj.png">
        'making absolutely sure no outside votes came in'
       </a>
       , despite being caught cross posting to IRC within seconds of submitting to reddit. His lies are lapped up by
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">
        /r/subredditdrama
       </a>
       and elsewhere. Also what he was doing has now become a experiment lasting several months rather than the isolated drunken 2AM mistake he claimed earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       However in the actual thread where he details the 'experiment', which he has subsequently rage-deleted in shame, All the top comments are calling him out being an idiot. Even
       <a href="/r/conspiritard">
        /r/conspiritard

       thought what he did was wrong -

       summarizing nicely:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Conclusion: You went to

          /r/conspiracy

         for the exact purpose to find anti-semitism, didn't find it to any substantial degree outside of the confirmation bias you shown here, posted here anyway and lied to make it sound worse than it was.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         You wasted a massive amount of your time for nothing and are now trying to justify it to an audience of people who seemingly haven't bothered to see if your story is legit.

      <hr/>
      <p>
       User 'redping' who has been
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9GQstb0.png">
        attacking
       </a>
       anyone challenging his 'friend' bipolarbear0, even using the classic tactic of
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JA2l7EF.png">
        branding me an anti-semite
       </a>
       for stating that bipolarbear0 cross posted to IRC.
      </p>
      <p>
       bipolarbear0's main damage limitation strategy seems to be -
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Claim what he did was an experiment
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Falsely claim he did 'everything to make sure no outside votes where coming in'
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Try and hide the fact his 'experiment' was a failure and called out even by the members of
         <a href="/r/conspiratard">
          /r/conspiratard
         </a>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Falsely claim that the links he posted 'all received hundreds of upvotes each', there is no evidence for this.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Use 'redping' et al to aggressively attack people challenging him, and brand them anti-semites.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       By and large it has worked and people are believing him without looking in to whether his claims are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, by sheer coincidence,
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">

       If I had a nickel for every post in which he dismisses all of this as a "witch hunt", I could probably purchase Reddit and remove his mod powers myself, and finally get him to shut the fuck up about "racism" and how he is a "victim of a witch hunt".

       Rather than give this absolute loser a drop more of attention people should just accept that this is what we are up against FULL ON. This is the latest Snowden revelation IN ACTION. Don't waste your attention on this disgusting clown. This is what they do.
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">

       is FULL of these people. IT IS literally born of the intent to discredit the truth. The losers in that group are designed and bred to specifically counteract and discredit the most damning truths that threaten them most. It's what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't a shred of reality or truth coming from that sub. Nothing. There is no purpose or substance. Just a machine of reality hatred. Look and laugh at their impotence and ineffectiveness. The effort is fed on attention to it's vandalism of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand as well that clowns like bipolarbuttblaster are CREATED not hired or paid to do what they do. They are automatons of reality hatred. They are formed and created by the faceless hatred of truth without their conscious awareness. These "shills" are patsies of a mostly artificial intelligent social graph networking system. Groups like
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       are engineered. These people are unknowing patsies who fully subscribe to the hatred of reality they pump and spew. Read the snowden doc and understand that the engineers CREATE groups and movements. They don't RUN the groups. They generally don't have actors in the groups. These people are completely ignorant and unaware of their manipulation. It's extremely sad.

       I get what you are saying.. and it's not an invalid statement. My post is a call for those who understand the larger threat isn't these peon drones but the machine that is producing them. The scope and effectiveness of this kind of attack is decreasing because people are beginning to understand engaging them is the intended purpose.
The drone automatons need your help in turning off their remote control haha.

       Yes i mean it literally. Take the technical concept of the facebook social graph and google adwords; put them together and you get the system that Snowden is alluding to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social engineering online can be done programmatically whereas pre-internet this was not possible. Actual agents were needed to make social connections and propagate and promote ideas and (dis)information until a movement took hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our online identities are under continuous profiling. The REAL social graph the NSA uses connects everything.. it extends into meatspace. And this is really important.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it simply your political, philosophical, moral beliefs are being targeted on an ongoing basis in a similar way that you might understand google and facebook targets you with ads. It keeps tabs on what you like and are interested in and uses probability and literal connections to pump ads at you. The system i am talking about is much more complex but similar. It profiles you and exposes you to content and ideas to shape your beliefs and behavior. There is a feedback loop where all your interaction online is profiling you in near realtime and fed back into the system which controls (to some degree of likelihood) the content (and people who create it) you are exposed to. All of this is done programmatically and should be understood as artificial intelligence. To most people this is science fiction because they believe the concepts of programmatic social engineering are not as developed as they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       promotes ideas that need to be countered with a measured response equal to the threat. There are naturally people who are statist and then there are those who can be easily targeted to act on their hatred of "tinfoilers". Their anger born of their confusion and inability to feel secure in what they believe (which is a collection of made up propaganda) can be directed towards people who are questioning the exact same things. They are influenced to believe the people doing the questioning are responsible for their insecurity in what they know to be real and true. "I feel insecure about authority! It's the tinfoilers making me insecure!".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what the internet is. When you query google you get measured results.. and it's not just about ads, location and other obvious demographic info. Everyone is profiled and their experience online is contrived to various degrees. There are sheep and there are drone patsies. The system is processing and delivering content on a broad based and individual level. Your profiling is everything. Your profile determines your online experience.. who and what you are most likely to be exposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       it sounds like science fiction. To really understand it you have to truly investigate what the likelihood is that a group of people would attempt to create a system like this if they could and then take a look at the complexity of publicly known systems and efforts. What's the probability based on all the evidence that much of our internet experience is contrived, directed and controlled based on the KNOWN tracking and profiling being done?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pointing out shills is fruitless. Understand they have no clue and if they did what they are being told about their direction is completely misleading. That's the snowden dilemma. If he was able to lay out the absolute complete technical details and reality of what is REALLY going on there is near 0% of the population who would understand the concept let alone believe it was being done. I am just spewing out info here.. not a whitepaper :)

       Hmm... very interesting.  The reason I asked for you to elaborate is that I just saw this post yesterday which dealt with something similar and what you said reminded me of it.

       If you have a little time to spare and haven't read it before, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on this:
       <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0801/0801.0337.pdf">

      <p>
       It's a scientific paper which explores the idea that "reality" might be a VR and how this idea is supported by known laws of quantum physics/relativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the detailed response, I love speculating on this stuff.  I've seen more than enough to convince me that something like what you described is definitely in the works if not already being implemented.

       I was just accused last night of "jumping to conclusions" about 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       On 9/11, i actually did jump to the conclusion that I was being told the truth...
      </p>
      <p>
       So 5 years later I start to really investigate 9/11, spending several years studying it on a daily basis... and able to back up anything I say with the source...
      </p>
      <p>
       So several years worth of research is considered "jumping to conclusions" by the guy who made up his mind about 9/11 on 9/11 and never questioned it again...
      </p>
      <p>
       No, thats not jumping to conclusions, if your conclusion happens to coincide perfectly with the official story and/or the first things you heard.

       Thats an astute observation. Whether something is a conspiracy theory or not boils down to whether you accept the evidence or not. Many people accept the official story of the Holocaust, so in their minds its not a conspiracy theory but a conspiracy fact. These same people might choose to deny the fact that FEMA deputy director Richard Serino was at the Boston Marathon Bombing scene 15 minutes before the bombs went off, so in their minds this is not conspiracy fact but conspiracy theory.

       Which is funny cause the majority of the people I talk to do not trust the government.  They may not go as far and say there was theremite or whatever, but everyone I talk to think 9/11 was either used to go to war and all the NSA shit or known of before and hand and let happen.

       Yeah, he seems crazy to people who understand the rhetoric but to the naive he's a voice of authority and they can be swayed by his nonsense.  That's why he does it.  They (him and his co-workers) don't care about changing our opinion, their orders are to sway the masses.  Ridicule is a very effective weapon.

       I've always wondered why someone would go out of their way to deliberately create a sub that is not in harmony like the rest of reddit, as in a sub that just attacks another sub. I also noticed a bug influence of anti zionist propaganda that placed by him in this sub, I took offense to that and actually left at one point.

       I just listened to the new Dan Carlin Common Sense, it really made me rethink my perception of what's going in Ukraine. It also made me very nervous.

       Basically he's not saying he's against a revolution, but USA involvement has been proven and it could be a recipe for disaster to make this "aggression". Russia is blaming us.

       Looks like the storm is already in full force. I suddenly feel guilty about rallying behind this revolution, but Yanukovych is still a complete shit. It'd be hard to do much worse but the new government sure is trying.

       The presidential candidates seem just as terrible, though. Take Yulia Tymoshenko: Billionaire (with a "b", so any ostentatious display of wealth from Yanukovych pales in comparison) who made her money through the gas industry via bribes and kickbacks. You pretty much don't get far in the oil industry there without heavy corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do hope for a democratically elected president that represent the people. From what I understand, protestors want an end to the corruption... and I don't know if the person they'll replace will fit that bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it's the same all over the world--you elect one person thinking they'll bring "hope" and "change," only to find that it's the same shit and different day.

       it is a new kind of war where the soldiers are protesters and america pays them 30 euros per day to prop up the hard core fascists that seek to steal power via coup.  Play some civ 5 if you don't understand.  Kiev is a city state and both Russia and the EU want to exploit their resources.

       There needs to be an easier way to remove people from positions of power if a massive amount of users vote for it.  It needs to be transparent and immediate.  We can downvote trolls into oblivion but can't seem to remove one psycho mod no matter how hard we try?

       It wouldn't do anything. In my opinion it would be the smallest least effective deterrent against these people. You cut off one head another pops up. Continuously getting the message out that these people exist and have the public awareness is much more important than getting rid of BPB.

       How would removing an abusive admin, and creating a culture of zero tolerance for 'shills' (lack of a better word here) 'not do anything'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creating the culture of no bullshit is the most important part, we can't become complacent and just accept this as the future of the internet/world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree as well that keeping the conversation going is highly effective and vital for anything to happen however.  Its the foundation of any change we can expect to make, never stop being offended by this and keep posting.

       Because we don't live in a world of zero tolerance, in white and black terms. Life is grey. I am not proposing people become complacent, but that they actively, through discourse and facts, go over those who are doing abhorrent actions. Yes, we must accept it is going on, again though, do not stay silent. We must understand that spending time trying to get rid of BPB or anyone to the similar affect, in the long run, does nothing but devote time and energy into these scum and giving them incentive to keep producing the shit they make. Keep showing they are scum to the point where it is mundane and their words useless because people became aware of the situation, instead of just outing him now and those in the future had no idea he ever existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Awareness is more powerful than getting rid of them. Getting rid of BPB would be to the same affect of using a band-aid on a stab wound.

       The Admins will do nothing. They hate this subreddit with a passion, and will likely use the first excuse to take it down. In fact, it would be wise for the moderators to patrol the /new queue and delete any and all posts that are racist. But its probably too late, and the sub will get banned for vote brigading. You heard it here first.

       he's a pathetic self-involved faux-intellectual narcissist on the internet, all of the stuff he says is irrelevant and meaningless, he doesn't realize there is a bigger picture than himself and his personal feelings, and you can see that even though he dresses up is (lack of) ideas in phony intellectualism.

       Please provide evidence that BipolarBear0 did anything that resembles a "voter brigade", and isn't telling the truth when he says that he only posted the racists posts to this subreddit and watched them get upvoted.  OP mentions cross posting on IRC. Care to elaborate on that point and/or show some evidence? Thank you.

       I get what you are saying.. and it's not an invalid statement. My post is a call for those who understand the larger threat isn't these peon drones but the machine that is producing them. The scope and effectiveness of this kind of attack is decreasing because people are beginning to understand engaging them is the intended purpose.
The drone automatons need your help in turning off their remote control haha.
