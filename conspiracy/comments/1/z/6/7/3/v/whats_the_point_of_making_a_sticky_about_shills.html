<p>Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism popularized the term &quot;thought-terminating cliché&quot;. This refers to a cliché that is a commonly used phrase, or folk wisdom, sometimes used to quell cognitive dissonance. Though the clichéd phrase in and of itself may be valid in certain contexts, its application as a means of dismissing dissent or justifying fallacious logic is what makes it thought-terminating.</p>

<p>I think the problem is when people start calling others out as shills over a disagreement.</p>

<p>If someone is going to call someone out as a shill, it should be for shady behavior, not because they don&#39;t believe you.</p>

<p>I mean hell, I have been called a shill here before and I can assure you guys that I&#39;m just a random guy who likes to read about conspiracy theories.  </p>

<p>I submit that they are trying to find an equilibrium, but they are up against a subversive agenda from said Government agencies, looking at it from their end, the sticky post and rule 10 combined are their way of saying <strong>be</strong> <strong>aware</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>situation,</strong> <strong>but</strong> <strong>avoid</strong> <strong>getting</strong> <strong>involved</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>flame</strong> <strong>wars</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>witchhunts,</strong> <strong>as</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>distracts</strong> <strong>from</strong> <strong>any</strong> <strong>given</strong> <strong>topic.</strong></p>

<p>You can never be certain if someone is a &quot;paid shill&quot; or &quot;troll&quot; and honestly, lets ask ourselves, say you come to the conclusion, here is what that conversation looks like;</p>

<p>Alleged shill;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe you are mistaken, what the article actually said is; (Facts, n stuff) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accusing user;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah? Well you&#39;re a shill, quit trolling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the conversation is essentially over, what did that accomplish? </p>

<p>I say this again, be aware of the situation, but don&#39;t let it devolve any conversation into a flame war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we report, what do the mods actually do?</p>

<p>I have seen the mods enforcing rule 10, so reporting is a better course of action than personal attacks, says I.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, though I disagree with you&#39;re interpretation of my intention, what examples are you referring to then that violate rule 10?</p>

<p>My interpretation of rule 10 is that it is simply a way to avoid personal attacks from disrupting a conversation.</p>

<p>Perhaps I misinterpreted you&#39;re point, I actually do that a lot, apologies, are you referring to raising awareness of user accounts who you think may be shills amongst* us?</p>

<p>My issue with it is, say that person comes into the thread, and mounts a defense, you are essentially trying to raise awareness that they are a shill and their response would be &quot;I&#39;m not a shill&quot; or they would say yes, either way it is not exactly falsifiable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, my point is we need to have autonomy to raise awareness of suspicious accounts without being equally harassed for &quot;personal attacks&quot; accusations.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the times I&#39;ve seen them enforcing it are just if someone flat out calls someone a shill or troll or whatever, I guess you could work on exposing the accounts you&#39;re suspicious of shillery at you&#39;re leisure and see how they react, but honestly it&#39;s dangerously close to actually calling them a shill.</p>

<p>Perhaps, and I have seen some people doing this not too long ago, (Before rule 10) simply provide examples of their tactics in an argument, (although again this would only result in witchhunting) perhaps message the mods why you think they should be removed, but on that note, I have seen quite a few 1-5 day old accounts commenting here lately, so remove one, and another will appear, there is no easy fix.</p>

<p>Anyway that&#39;s all I can say on it man.</p>

<p>Yeah we seriously should question these rule changes and why it matters if we call people out for being shills and trolls. Some people are obvious trolls, there shouldn&#39;t be rules protecting them. Shill is a bit harder to prove but in the same vein people who purposely talk trash and derail good conversations should not be pandered to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I personally disagree with the rule change, there are ways to highlight a shill post without <em>actually</em> calling it a shill post...it just requires a little bit of imagination.  Example (after a typical shill refuses to give ground or acknowledge any legitimate points multiple times, you could say something like):</p>

<p>&quot;You seem to advocate very strongly for your position...almost like you had a vested interest in it.&quot;  </p>

<p>As far as I know, there is nothing against the rules with a statetment like that, and it basically serves the same purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed there is a lot of disinformation to sift through.....another way to highlight a shill post without actually calling them a shill is to say something like &quot;you remind me of those we don&#39;t speak of.&quot;  This one I like because it serves two purposes:</p>

<p>*highlight the stupidity of the recent rule change</p>

<p>*identify the poster as a possible shill, without actually calling them a shill.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used this one quite liberally and haven&#39;t recieved any negative feedback.  It helps to think of the movie &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbJpJBKUf4k">The Village</a>&quot; when using this line.</p>

<p>This makes me so angry. I thought we all liked the idea of privacy, and due process. Yet we&#39;re allowing the mere accusation of someone being a &quot;shill&quot; to place them under intense scrutiny or ridicule? </p>

<p>I have no doubt there are paid shills on even this sub, but the ends don&#39;t justify the means. Every poster here should be given the (very likely) benefit of the doubt. </p>

<p>If you are seriously concerned about the activity of a user, don&#39;t start a witch-hunt. It would be far better off if you messaged the user yourself, or report/message the mods if you believe they are such a big issue. </p>

<p>The huge overreaction to GG&#39;s revelation bothers me. Yes, it is important. However, by responding by attacking other users is really shortsighted and achieves the stated purpose. </p>

<p>Even once a shill is &quot;outed&quot; they can start a new alias and no one would be the wiser. </p>

<p>I would advocate that this changes nothing, we continue as usual.  Discussing topics that the regular subs and media generally don&#39;t discuss. By giving all users the benefit of the doubt. </p>

<p>I would rather have 10 active shills here than, one regular person wrongly slammed as being one.  </p>

How do we determine the difference between a shill, and someone who just has strong opinions on a certain topic and expresses them when that topic comes up? How does an unpaid shill differ from a person who just wants to make a point about some social issue?</p>

<p>If the shill works for the JIDF, or the NSA, that&#39;s a giveaway. But otherwise, isn&#39;t the behavior of the person who posts more the issue than what he posts? If he posts deliberately misleading information, for example, that favors some corporate or government interest, he is probably a shill.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a dilemma, most users here can easily point out such behavior but as soon as that&#39;s done, Rule 10 is invoked and the debate is silenced.</p>

<p>The accused most likely report the comments when they feel their argument is not convincing and the mods do not investigate the issue, rather punish the ones who were able to see through the tactic by the discussion, something the mods were not following to get the context. This is Zero Tolerance policy and we all know this is a slippery slope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t aware of this actually. If the orders did com from above then that cements the theory that this sub has been subverted by those who wish to silence people based on this all-encompassing, vague and subjective rule. </p>

<p>Rule 5. No stalking or trolling.</p>

<p>Who defines what is trolling? These rules are as vague as possible to allow the loose interpretation to fit the agenda. Most of the rules here benefit rather than stop forum spies.</p>
