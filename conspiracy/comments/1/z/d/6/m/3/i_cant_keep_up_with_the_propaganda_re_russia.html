        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>OK, I&#39;m going to be honest, I can&#39;t keep up with all this propaganda. I was so sure that before sochi, the MSM were propagating anti-Russian propaganda eg. the anti-gay law that wasn&#39;t anti-gay and even the fake reports of dodgy hotels. </p>

<p>Now that this has happened in Ukraine, again I was sure that the Russians were simply protecting the people of Ukraine due to the neo-Nazi uprising. I follow @Danya1980 on Twitter who is tweeting live from Ukraine and others, and the mood seems to be that the Russian troops were welcomed by most of the people there. </p>

<p>However, obviously the MSM are promoting this from a totally different angle. Even Ch4 in the UK who are usually very fair are saying that the Ukrainians are not happy about Russian troops being present, and other articles are claiming that the uprising in the Ukraine is actually a peaceful protest by protestors who have been smeared.</p>

<p>Obviously, propaganda and lies are nothing new but can I just get some confirmation about this. Am I still correct in thinking that Russia is only doing what any responsible country would do in this situation but are being made to look like invaders?</p>

<p>Sorry if this makes me sound dumb. I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve just started to doubt myself here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep it simple, this was a food price riot that got hijacked by western backed neo nazi&#39;s.  As soon as the Ukranian rebels were not satisfied with early elections I knew they were bad people.  They stormed the capital and replace a full fifth of the government with hard core national socialists.  They put in a pro EU IMF banker in as Prime Minister.  All unelected.  </p>

<p>Its not confusing you just have to find the one or two lines of truth the MSM will put it in at the bottom 1/4 of the stories.  </p>

<p>Also try reading some RT Russian propaganda. See who makes a better argument.   Al Jazeera has had some good coverage as well, they have pretty much no stake in this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s very confusing and conflicting. Western media is screaming &quot;occupation&quot;, Ukranian PM says they&#39;re on the brink of disaster, and Russian media tries to make it clear that the people and parliament of Crimea <a href="http://rt.com/news/kiev-crimea-sort-care-449/">turned to Russia for aide</a> themselves. </p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;m personally convinced of is that Russia mobilized to protect its fleet. The war-ships are vulnerable targets when docked. Assuming that Russia sent 6000 troops to fortify, which is nothing. Hardly enough to invade a country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we have to do is look at this conflict from the perspective that has been preached from both sides, that these people are fighting for their freedom from an oppressive regime. That said, this is where the massive amounts of propaganda come into play. Have you noticed how there is quite a bit of pro European Union stuff thrown into the mix? Why would a protester yell &quot;FREEDOM!...and we need to join the EU&quot;? or the pro Russian propaganda as well. These people will not be allowed the freedom to be independent from either Russia or the European union. Both choices will be bad for the people of Ukraine. False choice.</p>
