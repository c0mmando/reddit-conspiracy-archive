<p>This is really strange to me, I check my account activity every few days cause it shows IPs connecting. It&#39;s usually the same one or two depending on if im on wifi or not. </p>

<p>However this sparked my interest, I am from the UK. This IP is from germany. kind of spooky. If you google the IP it gets even stranger, based in germany but a US company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weird, I checked mine out of curiosity and there are a bunch of accesses from 10.x.x.x subnet IPs - which would indicate accesses from a non-public-Internet system (i.e., this would likely only be possible if I accessed my account from Reddit corporate itself or they are just putting fake IPs there - but there are legit accesses by places I&#39;ve been before &amp; after). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean, hard writing? Accessing my Reddit account is easy-peasy. Duct tape on computer cams, but if anyone thinks that&#39;s foolproof, gotta few bridges to sell. Microphones are almost impossible to actually disable and everyone&#39;s mobile device has a camera. We seriously live in an age where even the barbecue joint is doing both video and audio recording. Your best bet is to just talk so much shit you&#39;re part of the Babel.</p>

<p>Anyway, the account access page explains away the 10.0.0.0/8 connects and it&#39;s been there awhile, it&#39;s in their strings file up in github, but I&#39;ve been sniffing around and haven&#39;t found any real explanation as to what the &quot;bug&quot; that causes it is or why/whether Reddit would be snapshotting accounts, if that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t the trust the apps; on Mac, at least, the only way to truly disable the mic is to physically disable it. Been really wanting to kickstarter some cellphone covers that cover all cams, adequately muffle/randomize sound, and go full-metal Faraday to block RF by closing it up. It&#39;s kind of shocking to me that no one has done this yet - huge market of paranoids like us and DoD-types who&#39;d love to not have to leave their phones in a box at the front gate.</p>
