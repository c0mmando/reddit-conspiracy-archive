       Hey
      </p>
      <p>
       This is really strange to me, I check my account activity every few days cause it shows IPs connecting. It's usually the same one or two depending on if im on wifi or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       However this sparked my interest, I am from the UK. This IP is from germany. kind of spooky. If you google the IP it gets even stranger, based in germany but a US company.

       The company is a content delivery network. Interestingly enough, its founder died in one of the planes on 9/11. I'm sure the rabbit hole goes deeper. Let me know if you find out more.

       Come to think of it, last summer I randomly ran a netstat (without opening any webpages and immediately after I connected to my Wi-Fi) and found that the Facebook was an active connection... I discovered it was through Akamai Technologies when I ran a trace route. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but it hasn't happened since then. Then again, I don't run netstat that often.

       Weird, I checked mine out of curiosity and there are a bunch of accesses from 10.x.x.x subnet IPs - which would indicate accesses from a non-public-Internet system (i.e., this would likely only be possible if I accessed my account from Reddit corporate itself or they are just putting fake IPs there - but there are legit accesses by places I've been before &amp; after).

       Does your company NAT to any 10.x.x.x internal IP addresses?  If not, I've yet to see a 192.168.x x IP address logged, so this is potentially an internally designated block that is being used on the public net.  Probably to monitor your ass.  As I asked the OP, terroristing much lately?

       Nope. No terroristaing; at the time of the anomalous accesses, I was posting a lot about prescription medication-induced homicide/suicide cases. But everything I wrote about it was public, there wouldn't be any need to access my account to get to what I was posting.

       Then the question is, did you get hard writing about any of them.  They know.  They definitely know.  I hope you have that MacBook camera covered with something.  There has to be a reason for the "enhanced" monitoring.

       What do you mean, hard writing? Accessing my Reddit account is easy-peasy. Duct tape on computer cams, but if anyone thinks that's foolproof, gotta few bridges to sell. Microphones are almost impossible to actually disable and everyone's mobile device has a camera. We seriously live in an age where even the barbecue joint is doing both video and audio recording. Your best bet is to just talk so much shit you're part of the Babel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the account access page explains away the 10.0.0.0/8 connects and it's been there awhile, it's in their strings file up in github, but I've been sniffing around and haven't found any real explanation as to what the "bug" that causes it is or why/whether Reddit would be snapshotting accounts, if that's what they're doing.

       Ah. XX chromosomes here, so there's no way they'd be able to tell unless they were paying to license someone's patented pupil-to-desire algorithm, heh. But no, that stuff just makes me rage, not lady-bone.

       Don't the trust the apps; on Mac, at least, the only way to truly disable the mic is to physically disable it. Been really wanting to kickstarter some cellphone covers that cover all cams, adequately muffle/randomize sound, and go full-metal Faraday to block RF by closing it up. It's kind of shocking to me that no one has done this yet - huge market of paranoids like us and DoD-types who'd love to not have to leave their phones in a box at the front gate.

       Making a.mini farraday pouch for your cell is apparently pretty big.  There is a group that recommends people hold parties.  They list the proper sandwiched material and  sewing techniques.  They also do a pretty good job muffling the sound.  But since all connections are down, unless the app has an offline record function, you're probably 100% safe.  I'll try to find the flyer/link.

       I've got DoD designated IPs logging into my account.  I refuse to live in fear. While I do not consent or approv their illegal intrusion in any fashion.  Yet the only thing I can do is publicly voice my concern (bitch).  I can promise you, life is much better when you're not looking back over your shoulder constantly.  They know what their doing is not only unconstitutional but horribly wrong.  This will be made right some day.  Humans as a while won't do consistently wrong.  Especially after they realize the wrong they were once feverishly supporting.  People are generally good people.
