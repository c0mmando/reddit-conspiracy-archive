       Final Edit: Just to say, I've come to the conclusion that
       <a href="/u/sheasie">
        /u/sheasie
       </a>
       's idea is better. Thanks to
       <a href="/u/sheasie">
        /u/sheasie
       </a>
       for a better idea and
       <a href="/u/unixdrone4life">
        /u/unixdrone4life
       </a>
       for implementing it. I'm just going to leave this post here to direct people to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy_no_meta/">
        /r/conspiracy_no_meta/
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in light of this I will be hanging on to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy_meta">
        /r/conspiracy_meta
       </a>
       and implementing a rule that posting in it will be a bannable offense, because the concept is amusing to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       ------- original post
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 1) Create a conspiracy_meta subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2) Make it a bannable offense to create a post that complains about this subreddit, or the users, mods, shills or rules thereof in this subreddit instead of conspiracy_meta.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't make this suggestion in the hope of shutting down discussion. If anything, I think that conspiracy_meta should be a place where people are free to insult the mods and other users in various personal and hurtful ways. And also a place where mods are free to insult them right back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I make this suggestion because I think that this subreddit would be a much better and more useful place, if we could actually fucking talk about conspiracies here for a change instead of all of this meta bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: Addendum, also, anything talking about Reddit in general should also be consigned to conspiracy_meta.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit #2: I've just created it in case this idea catches on.

       Well that's the point. It's already there, so if you have a problem with someone and you feel like you can't deal with here, take it there, and you can rip them a new asshole without worrying about getting banned for violating the rules here. I mean, sure, if a mod has gone rogue and wants to ban you here for what you say over there, they could do that. Not that I'm saying that they would. I'm just providing a place with no rules. It's beyond my power to create a place with no consequences.

       So a shill comes in and runs wild or the moderators change the rules to censor anything that's critical of the mods and we have to go to some dis-used sub to voice our complaints?

       No. Not at all. You would have to go there TO CREATE A NEW POST to voice your complaints. I never said there should be a rule to stop people from complaining in the relevant posts.

       The whole effect of doing that would be censoring.  How many posts like that even are there?  Like a few a week maybe?  And now no one will see them.  A lot of those posts are important.  Without the post the other day that was meta, we woulda never gotten the sticky from the mods about rule 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you are trying to derail, but something a lot like this was brought up before and people thought it was a path to being censored.

       Wouldn't conspiracy_meta just become a big dramafest if people were just allowed to insult each other back and forth? Wouldn't that give critics of /r/ conspiracy even more fire if they saw
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       having a place where people are insulted back and forth in hurtful ways?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean seriously is it a good idea to have a forum where most likely people are going to go...
      </p>
      <p>
       OP: Hey Faggot
      </p>
      <p>
       P2: Fuck you, motherfucker
      </p>
      <p>
       P3: Shut up faggots
      </p>
      <p>
       P4: Everyone here is assholes
      </p>
      <p>
       and so on and so forth
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would become a big mess that might overshadow this forum. People who don't understand conspiracies will probably see that board first and make assumptions from the meta board about all conspiracy users.

       The simple fact of the matter is that constantly cluttering up this subreddit with posts that are complaining about shills and users and mods and reddit in general and this subreddit would be a very good tactic to distract, divide and derail the userbase here. Whether it is motivated by a desire to help or hurt this sub, the effect is largely the same, in my opinion.

       interesting idea.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I don't make this suggestion in the hope of shutting down discussion
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       maybe not "shut down", but your suggestion would definitely minimize discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, what percentage of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       would sign-up for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy_meta">
        /r/conspiracy_meta
       </a>
       ?  Maybe 10% ?  Maybe 5% ?
      </p>
      <p>
       but i like the basis of your idea... how about the "reverse":
      </p>
      <p>
       let's make
       <a href="/r/conspiracy_nometa">
        /r/conspiracy_nometa
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       we can copy all of the posts and stuff to conspiracy_nometa.  but no one will be allowed to talk shit about the mods @
       <a href="/r/conspiracy_nometa">
        /r/conspiracy_nometa
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       like you, i am not trying to "shut down discussion".  and to make sure, we simply create a NEW, "clean" place for people who don't want to manually filter the "meta bullshit".
      </p>
      <p>
       in this way, we disrupt nothing that already exists... and simply create a new "clean room" for people like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       pretty good, right?

       Would it be possible to have this bot post the meta posts to conspiracy_meta instead of discarding them?

       edit: Actually, never mind. I've thought about it, and the conspiracy_no_meta is the better idea.

       In the higher scheme of things this sub is just a Honeypot. The lower level's don't know and become admins, mods and develop a community feel but then it always just goes back to Honeypot. The best thing to do is not spend your life here by being distracted by that "other" sub. I mean when I was younger and I was into conspiracies it never involved "Ilumminiti" but somehow on this site we are all to believe every problem in the world goes back to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit has done nothing but channel Group thought into all that we are to believe that all conspiracy theorist "should" believe in like reptilian, racism, illuminiti. I'm sorry sometimes its just the fucking CIA and nothing more. Sometimes its a group of business men trying to pull the wool over our eyes. This site has streamlined the conspiracies they want us to believe and has made it easier for us to be picked on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea for me as to what a conspiracy theorist is not represented here in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       thats just my 2 cents if you don't like it cool, your the new breed and I'm the old breed, the days of black helicopters and solder of fortune magazines and REM end of the world as we know it.

       I would actually agree with most of what you are saying here. To a degree I believe that it is very possible that this sub is only allowed to remain because it serves as control, by containing opinions and users that would otherwise be posted and posting in more mainstream subreddits. Not that I am saying that the mods are "in on it", if you will. That being said, even if this is the case, I believe that the implementation of my suggestion would make this subreddit less efficient as a control mechanism, by making it more efficient as a tool for the dissemination of useful information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your two cents, they were very thought provoking. But as far as being of the new breed, well.. considering that my interest in this subject started with a lot of long distance calls to BBSes, maybe not so much. :)

       It's not about liking them or disliking them. This is about one thing and one thing only. Keeping this subforum on topic. Talking about conspiracies instead of talking about
       <a href="/r/conspiracies">
        /r/conspiracies
       </a>
       . Besides, the longer you are here, the more likely it is that you lurk on /new instead of on /top, so that really doesn't do much as far as people like me are concerned.

       Well my suggestion consists of two parts, without the rule to put a moratorium on meta posts here, a forum for meta posts is pointless. I don't actually care if the one that I made is used as that forum, I only made it myself because I'm not beholden to the mods here and I think that a meta forum that was created by the mods here might be seen as a sort of honey pot by the some of the people that it is intended to be a resource for.

       Possible alternative. Have one weekly (or whatever), perhaps stickied post
       <strong>
        in this subreddit
       </strong>
       where people can post shill allegations, with whatever evidence they can muster. The mods can monitor that, take whatever action is deemed appropriate, and it can remain a breach of the rules to make such allegations
       <em>
        outside the thread
       </em>
       . Seems this could offer the best of both worlds.

       Any reddit user is free to create their own subreddit. You are doing the same thing that you are trying to stop. I do not know your intentions but your aspirations speak volumes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you trying to mock our moderators? No one should be banned for complaining about how their subreddit is being managed. Any member can message the moderators and dish out insults there, but to attack someone publicly is a different story. Complaints about a moderator and subreddit drama are not same as attacking any member of this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the problem that curbs discussion. I see it happen many times in other subs. The loudest voices are those who reply with the accepted dogma of said subreddits. For all the critical thinking that we claim to do, we never aim our abilities at ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       With over 218,000 readers as of right now, we have all sorts of users. People like to read the discussion, others enjoy derailing it. Some come to add their voice to the discussion while others simply come to dictate their words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insults are civil. Attacks are the antithesis of discussion.

       Something being ironic doesn't preclude the possibility that it is also a good idea. I also don't actually think that this idea is necessarily a good idea. I posted it to see if other people think that it's a good idea.

       Do they now? Then it should be no problem at all for you to provide a sampling of these volumes that my aspirations speak. Well, unless that statement is just some sort of vague, unbacked assertion, cleverly phrased, in an attempt to create the appearance of a stain on my character from thin air.

       I never equated the two. I don't see anything wrong with complaints about users, moderators, this subreddit, or it's rules other than the fact that it, in my opinion, distracts from the stated subject of this subreddit, that being the discussion of conspiracies. I also, in addition, don't see anything wrong with vicious personal attacks, and think that the creation of a conspiracy_meta subreddit also, in addition to it's main purpose of providing a separate forum for the discussion of meta subjects, provides a convenient place for that sort of spirited and, in my opinion, highly entertaining discussion.

       You say this as if people that enjoy derailing the discussion are somehow, in any way, people that should be catered to, despite the fact, that by definition their motives are entirely contrary to the very reason that this sub exists.

       By definition, insults are not civil. "Attack" in the context of discussion is too vague as a term for your statement to be considered a fact.

       I agree. People should vote, reply and respond. Nothing I have suggested would stop anyone from doing any of those things, except for the specific case where their reply or response took the form of a new post, thusly preventing the "sliding", if you will, of a post that is actually about conspiracies, the stated topic of this subreddit.

       You aspire to improve this place. Whether your idea is, good or not, is not besides the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your aspiration speaks volumes because you said it. I simply made an observation based on this post and wanted to discuss. It was not an attempt to stain you. I do not know you so have no care or need to stain your image.
      </p>
      <p>
       No. Are you mocking our moderators?
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2. I did not misinterpret deliberately.  I interpreted what you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you never equated the two. I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought the discussion was your post, not how I said things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very reason this sub exists can change over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which definition of insult should I use? Perhaps it is too vague for you to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods will act accordingy when issues arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont care for many posts but I enjoy reading disussion and participating when I can. 
I will do what I can to encourage civil discussion regardless of the post.

       R/conspiracy is not what it used to be. Get used to it or help change its direction in a way that benefits all members.

       It's not about liking them or disliking them. This is about one thing and one thing only. Keeping this subforum on topic. Talking about conspiracies instead of talking about
       <a href="/r/conspiracies">
        /r/conspiracies
       </a>
       . Besides, the longer you are here, the more likely it is that you lurk on /new instead of on /top, so that really doesn't do much as far as people like me are concerned.
