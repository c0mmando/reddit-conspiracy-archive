<p>the lack of diversity in our OPs lately</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you mean a lack of diversity in the sources of submissions, I&#39;d have to say &quot;no&quot; from looking at the /new queue. But, I may not be seeing specifically what you&#39;re seeing.</p>

<p>Seeing attacks on source material is not something that only &quot;debunkers and infiltrators&quot; do. Even loyal, productive, participating regulars will often attack the source of a claim if it&#39;s extremely questionable or otherwise unreliable.</p>

<p>We&#39;re still occasionally getting stuff from washingtonsblog, endthelie, and even Alex Jones, the guy even hardcore conspiracy theorists can hate on from time to time.</p>

<p>If there is a concerted effort to marginalize non-MSM sources in this subreddit, it&#39;ll have to be more obvious (to me) than it currently is.</p>

<p>Then again, I don&#39;t read every comment under every submission, so - as I said - I may not be seeing what you&#39;re seeing.</p>
