       This may sound like a tired, worn-out cliche, but it really does - and pretty much always will - boil down to "don't feed the trolls".
      </p>
      <p>
       If our numbers and unity in the commenting and voting process aren't sufficient to fend off those who are determined to undermine our discussion and inquiry, then we must rely upon our ability to ignore them - to recognize them for what they are and their participation for what it is.

       I agree, but have you noticed the lack of diversity in our OPs lately.  I'm just concerned that the campaign against sources is working.  We used to get sources from all of the fringe websites.  Not so much anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took a lot of them with a grain of salt, but they did provide triggers for alternative ways of looking at things.

       If you mean a lack of diversity in the sources of submissions, I'd have to say "no" from looking at the /new queue. But, I may not be seeing specifically what you're seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing attacks on source material is not something that only "debunkers and infiltrators" do. Even loyal, productive, participating regulars will often attack the source of a claim if it's extremely questionable or otherwise unreliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're still occasionally getting stuff from washingtonsblog, endthelie, and even Alex Jones, the guy even hardcore conspiracy theorists can hate on from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a concerted effort to marginalize non-MSM sources in this subreddit, it'll have to be more obvious (to me) than it currently is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I don't read every comment under every submission, so - as I said - I may not be seeing what you're seeing.

       I think a part of it, too, is that recent news cycles are giving us fewer and fewer "conspiracy theories" and more "conspiracy facts." So, naturally, more posts from mainstream sources as theories become proven and make it to more general public discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as that happens, more mainstream folks afraid of the fringier stuff flock to us to get our take, and they join and start posting, too, but cringe at the inverted pyramid in Crimea-type stuff (but I love those types of articles, please don't stop posting, people who post the fringier topics).

       I gotta be honest, I don't click or upvote links to fringe websites.  Most of them are analysis of news that comes over the wire anyway and a lot of it is too extreme for me.

       In the face of disruptive influences, I would say 'yes', -- much like one would try to ignore the sound of traffic when calling home during rush hour when your car has broken down. Yeah. Maybe like ignoring hecklers. Yep, like that.

       Not sure there is anything that can be done; at least, not while on reddit. We have usually ~500 readers on a website that generates millions of views a day. Our views don't necessarily coincide with that of others'; and even less with the admins. Someone is trying to make an open source alternative right now. Looks like that may be our best shot tbh.

       Pretty clearly the CIA and/or FBI is in control and trying to get the sub under their control. When they do, bet they get a bonus. But they are making progress in destroying

       I think a part of it, too, is that recent news cycles are giving us fewer and fewer "conspiracy theories" and more "conspiracy facts." So, naturally, more posts from mainstream sources as theories become proven and make it to more general public discourse.

       And as that happens, more mainstream folks afraid of the fringier stuff flock to us to get our take, and they join and start posting, too, but cringe at the inverted pyramid in Crimea-type stuff (but I love those types of articles, please don't stop posting, people who post the fringier topics).
