        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just stumbled across an article about this parasitic protozoan (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii">alliteration courtesy of wikipedia</a>) and was wondering if anyone has heard of it before and/or can link me to some more conclusive/concrete studies or information about it.</p>

<p>It says right in the first paragraph of the article that up to 30% of the world&#39;s population has been exposed to (and, thus, may possibly be infected by) it.  You&#39;d think (or at least <em>I&#39;d</em> think) that a parasite with a demonstrable affect on mammalian behavior that almost 1/3 people worldwide have probably come into contact with would be a little bit more well known/studied/talked about.</p>

<p>Has anyone heard about this before and, if so, what do you think about it?  What if this parasite is responsible for some of the negative human behaviors we see all around us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The parasite naturally infects rats, and there have been studies showing that it causes them to engage in riskier behaviour and so increase their chances of being eaten by cats.  This is useful for the parasite, which can only complete it&#39;s life cycle in the gut of the cat.  So this clever parasite influences the rat&#39;s behaviour to its own advantage.  There has been some evidence that the parasite may have a similar effect of the human brain.  Interesting stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen rats with this infection claw through walls to get to a cat box.  It is nirvana to them.  Then they will sit there for a long time and just zone out, even when danger stimulus is present.  It is an evolutionary advantage for the cat who is unaffected by it, but carries it around and disperses it because it helps the cat eat.  The rat was a very large pack rat, normally a very smart creature. Does affect some humans too.  They predicted the world cup one year and were 8/10 on for standings by analyzing rates of of t. Gondhi in the team.  There have been emergency room studies of motorcycle accident victims who ovverrepresent in findings, because it affects risk taking behavior.  I watched several young women go slowly crazy in identical ways who all lived in the same apartment that had a problem with it.  The first tenant may have introduced it, their cat deffacted everywhere that they seemed unconcerned by, the carpet wasn&#39;t changed and then she starting hoarding, lost her job, started buying odd things, etc... Then I saw another girl (normal) with a cat and do an exact repeat.   Then a third girl. Exact repeat.  I have no doubt it was the toxoplasmosis gondhi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Much of science originates in sayings and wives tales, that when investigated are often found to have a scientific reason behind them.  I know several people who are infected by it, one sign is they are suddenly unaware of a catbox that is overfull and stinking up their house.  It just doesn&#39;t bug them.  They will often make decisions more for their cat than their own children.  New cat toys, fancy cat food, tells their own children they are too broke to buy them decent food or toys.  No rational person would put a pet over a child.  Ever find people who only want to talk aboutbtheir cat and nothing else?  Yea, they may be infected...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>T. GondIi.</p>

<p>Cats are a Carrier.</p>

<p>Big concern that it it making its way through several groups of Sea Mammals like Dolphins, Whales, Sea Otters seals, and Sea Lions.
 It is the most prolific Protozoa in the world.</p>

<p>The big concern with the arctic deicing are remote pods of mammals  are coming into contact with it having no Barrier ice to stop it. Its pushing into the arctic.</p>

<p>That should be a good start.</p>

<p>T. Gondii is a Protazoal which infects its host. to complete one part of the life cycle.</p>

<p>T. Gondii has also been shown to cohabitant in a host with S. neurona Protazoal.it is a Polyparasitism in this case. Neurolgic symptoms are more severe. They think that the T.Gaondii/S Neurona cocktail can  also help induce depression.</p>

<p>This pair has shown up in Dolphins and has also shown up in Horses that are Diagnosed with EPM Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. S. Neurona is the primary in this case.</p>

<p>Google: T Gondii S Neurona, depression, lameness, seizures.</p>

<p>I deal with it on fair basis with Horses ,Studied it, diagnosed it, treated it and have delt with it out of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Protazoals are very long treatments and some of the treatments can be Toxic but yes it can be cured. It has different effects on different infected hosts. </p>

<p>For T. Gondii in human it looks like right now it is not an infection that is treated in every case but only in cases where it can be life threatening.</p>

<p>I just want to say that my direct experience has been with the S. Neurona in Horses but in learning about it I picked up on the T. Gondii info. Also treatments are the same. An EPM Shake Pyrimethamine/Trimethoprim/Sulfadiazine Oral Suspensionis used as atreatment in horses and as a preventative in Humans.</p>

<p>levamisole is also another one that is used in both horses and humans</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/HOUOJUg">http://imgur.com/HOUOJUg</a> These are my left and right eyes. Spot the difference. </p>

<p>I thought I had looked at the sun or a lightbulb too long. It looked like a sunspot, or a silver static hole in my vision. Or like a floater that doesn&#39;t move. When I realized I was going blind, and that it was getting worse, I got it checked out at an optometrist, and they referred me to a specialist. </p>

<p>The parasite loves to munch on the incredibly tender flesh in the retina.</p>

<p>Apparently it&#39;s pretty common. And one round of penicillin (and a mild steroid?) knocks it down. I caught it within a couple weeks of it causing permanent damage. If you don&#39;t do anything about it, you will go blind. And then it will get strong enough to eat its way through your retinal cord, and into your brain. </p>

<p>I have worried about how it&#39;s affected my mental state... But I&#39;m not convinced that it&#39;s that much of a factor. On the other hand, I do sleep more than anyone I&#39;ve ever met. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, during my undergrad we actually focused on it in bio lab. It is completely underrepresented in the media compared to its importance to humans. Same goes for HPV (some strains cause cancer and almost everyone has at least one) and factory farm industry&#39;s abuse of antibiotics (&quot;superbugs&quot; gets attention, but they blame hand washing and overprescribing, factory farms use the majority of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance is transferable so don&#39;t tell me cattle bacteria don&#39;t matter).</p>

<p>A side note about T. Gondii, people always focus on the risk from cats, but most people get it from undercooked beef or steak. Europeans prefer rare steak and thus almost 50% have contracted it.</p>
