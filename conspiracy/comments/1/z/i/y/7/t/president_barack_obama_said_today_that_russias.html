        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is the headline I viewed today.  Does this war criminal not see the absolute hypocrisy in his statement?  Thankfully Putin called him on the rug for this.  Mentioning Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria.  The former two, because we were pied to about who was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.  And the latter two because...well, there was no valid reason for Libya.  And Syria was because of terrorist organizations that WE were financially and tactically assisting, and providing arms through illegal means. </p>

<p>The irony is without parallel.  How can someone be so foolish to attempt to justify their illegal wars?  Russia is doing the right thing here.  Something America would hopefully do of they had a large population stuck in a war torn area.  The Crimea is roughly 75% Russian.  And while they are protecting them, I am not seeing this as an invasion, or an attempt to pull this region or people back into the Russian fold.  Do you guys see the absolute hypocrisy here? Can this be justified in any fashion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately they won&#39;t. The media and the US political apparatus are controlled by the same private interest that makes up the deep state. This thing masquerades as big corporations and business, presenting itself as an injured party, but honestly its fingers are in everything. I wanted to laugh at the guy in shill r/news who insisted that Russian news couldn&#39;t be valid because some of it is controlled by the state and suggested that the mainstream media was more valid because it wasn&#39;t controlled by politicians. It&#39;s still controlled...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The fact that anyone can take any &#39;news&#39; as real from a mainstream news source continuously boggles me. We&#39;ve been shown time and time again that the news is not impartial reporting of facts and happenings but that it is very much controlled and agenda-driven. The same 5 concerns own the majority of Western media. The same apparatus that owns those concerns owns the political structures of the West as well. It&#39;s all a big scam. </p>

They are forced to use the riskiest tools in their arsenal, and are fucking up with much regularity.  Aurora, Sandy Hook?  Absolute fiascos.
