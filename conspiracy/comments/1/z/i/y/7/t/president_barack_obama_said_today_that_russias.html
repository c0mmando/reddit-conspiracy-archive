       This is the headline I viewed today.  Does this war criminal not see the absolute hypocrisy in his statement?  Thankfully Putin called him on the rug for this.  Mentioning Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria.  The former two, because we were pied to about who was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.  And the latter two because...well, there was no valid reason for Libya.  And Syria was because of terrorist organizations that WE were financially and tactically assisting, and providing arms through illegal means.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony is without parallel.  How can someone be so foolish to attempt to justify their illegal wars?  Russia is doing the right thing here.  Something America would hopefully do of they had a large population stuck in a war torn area.  The Crimea is roughly 75% Russian.  And while they are protecting them, I am not seeing this as an invasion, or an attempt to pull this region or people back into the Russian fold.  Do you guys see the absolute hypocrisy here? Can this be justified in any fashion?

       Unfortunately they won't. The media and the US political apparatus are controlled by the same private interest that makes up the deep state. This thing masquerades as big corporations and business, presenting itself as an injured party, but honestly its fingers are in everything. I wanted to laugh at the guy in shill r/news who insisted that Russian news couldn't be valid because some of it is controlled by the state and suggested that the mainstream media was more valid because it wasn't controlled by politicians. It's still controlled...

       Yet they fail to see how completely controlled our corporate sponsored news is.  Actually, they probably don't and were just seeing the shillls do the talking.  News viewership has never been lower.  We see how they have habitually lied to us, and won't take it anymore.

       No more lies.  No more propaganda bullshit.  I haven't tuned in for going on a decade now.  After the obviously staged 9/11 event.

       Exactly. The fact that anyone can take any 'news' as real from a mainstream news source continuously boggles me. We've been shown time and time again that the news is not impartial reporting of facts and happenings but that it is very much controlled and agenda-driven. The same 5 concerns own the majority of Western media. The same apparatus that owns those concerns owns the political structures of the West as well. It's all a big scam.

       Thankfully the people are waking up to the truth that has surrounded them for their entire lives. Business is horribly corrupt.  Business runs everything in America.  America is horribly corrupt.

       It costs a ton of money to pay to continue to push these lies against the tide. People are questioning more and more and more.  They are forced to use the riskiest tools in their arsenal, and are fucking up with much regularity.  Aurora, Sandy Hook?  Absolute fiascos. So much so with Aurora, they've stopped the trial, and no longer even mention it on the corporate sponsored news programs.

       If we ever get America back on track before she falls apart completely, all war criminals will be brought to justice.  Any unlawful order retroactively granting immunity will be disregarded entirely.  You can't justify crimes against humanity with a pardon.  The noose will be in order for such crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason why George Bush and Dick Cheney can no longer ttabvel outside of the US.  As soon as they are out of US jurisdiction, people go out of their way to detain these two.  They will be brought to justice.  Mark my words.

       Pakistan has repeatedly protested these attacks as an infringement of its sovereignty and because civilian deaths have also resulted, including women and children, which has further angered the Pakistani government and people
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because a few individuals make secret deals behind closed doors does not mean that it has the consent of the actual Pakistani govt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It definitely does not have the consent of the Pakistani people. Much like Russia does not have the consent of the Ukranian people.

       As I said. Private opinion of politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Pakistani government really thought those were hostile and illegal acts why don't they protest at the UN? Why don't they sever diplomatic relations? Why do they still accept US
       <del>
        bribes

       "military aid"? Why do they allow US supply convoys?

       The Prime Minister makes an official statement, and you label it as private opinion.

      <p>
       As long as you label anything Barack Obama says as private opinion, you can claim consistency.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pakistan has responded by repeating its opposition to drone strikes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pakistan's PM Nawaz Sharif has publicly urged US President Obama to halt such attacks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Whatever understandings there may or may not have been in the past, the present government has been very clear regarding its policy on the issue," the
         <strong>
          Pakistani foreign ministry
         </strong>
         said in a statement.  "We regard such strikes as violation of our sovereignty as well as international law," it said.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the Pakistani military and other arms of the government had "quietly acquiesced"
         <em>
          This seems more like the private dealings of politicians than what you claim.
