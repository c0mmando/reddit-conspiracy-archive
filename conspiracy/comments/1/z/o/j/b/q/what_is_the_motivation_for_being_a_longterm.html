<p>I believe that seeking truth is a noble undertaking, which is why I am drawn to conspiracy theories - I want to know the truth.</p>

<p>When I am seeking truth about something suspicious, and I encounter &quot;nothing to see here, move along citizen&quot; or &quot;it was obviously suicide by multiple nailgun wounds&quot; or &quot;a magic bullet&quot; or &quot;free fall collapses&quot; or any of a myriad of other &quot;official narratives&quot;... I cannot help wondering what motivates people (especially in social media forums) to spend so much time debunking and derailing such inquiries.</p>

<p>It may be &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;for the LULZ&quot; for a little while, but... to take it up as a long-term activity, hours and hours a day, ... in my mind, that carries an implication of &quot;professional&quot;.</p>

<p>I find the best way to approach a conspiracy is to look at the &quot;unknowns&quot;. We know WTC7 fell at near free-fall speed for several seconds. The approach shouldn&#39;t be &quot;Clearly it&#39;s demolition and that&#39;s final!&quot;. The approach should be &quot;Alright, WHY did it fall that way...ok some supports were destroyed...why?

<p>I&#39;m not trying to make an example of you, but this does tend to capture the essence of my experience with activist debunkers (ala the rhetoric &quot;I&#39;ll bet you also believe &lt;insert mockery ad hominem here&gt;&quot;). And, you also reminded me that there do seem to be people who specialize in certain topics. As a card carrying conspiracy theorist (whatever that is), I take an interest in a wide variety of topics: JFK, 9/11, geoengineering (without a lot of emphasis on the chem/contrail debate - more along the lines of Monsanto toxicity), Big Pharma&#39;s tendency to classify every aspect of the human condition as a &quot;treatable disorder&quot;, war profiteering, and of course, the money masters who have their fingerprints on all of that. There seem to be &quot;expert debunkers&quot; on all of those topics. They appear out of nowhere each time one begins to gain momentum.</p>

<p>My post (above) is about all of them. Not just the populist 9/11 debunkers.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#39;t disagree more. From my observation interest in conspiracy theories seems to peak in high school as Teenagers have access to the full spectrum of information available but have very little context. Combine that with the anti-authority mindset, and &quot;know it all&quot; attitude that many people develop in their teens and you have all the ingredients to produce someone who is drawn to alternative, potentially fantastical, narratives for world events.</p>

<p>As people age they become significantly more jaded and less likely to see events as so incredible that they must be the result of some broader overarching conspiracy. Additionally the older people get the more they identify with the existing power structure - because they depend on it for their livelihoods.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because conspiracy theory presents a type of narrative that many people find deeply engrossing. I mean why do teenagers go on forums to debate Star Wars or Game of Thrones or any other fictional universe? Conspiracy Theory provides the same sort of outlet - with the added benefit that all that&#39;s being discussed is purported to be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; continues to be applied to an enormous range of ideas, from the manifestly paranoid and crazy to the probable.   I imagine some are naturally skeptical and merely wish to cleanse the public discourse of the most egregious nonsense.  Others are professional cover-up artists with a specific agenda specific people to protect.   </p>

<p>Then there are those who feel personally threatened by alternative narratives.   Their self-esteem hinges upon them being in the right about everything.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an argument with someone recently over this. They were asking me why &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; continue to harp on stuff like 9/11 when there are so many  proven conspiracies out there like Iraq and LIBOR and all of this stuff.</p>

<p>I explained to him that we do discuss the proven stuff as well, but when you&#39;re lumping everything from the Iraq war to lizard people and satan under the same moniker of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; you&#39;re going to have a huge signal:noise ratio. It makes discussing these things a lot harder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The day I encounter conspiracy theorists discussing real legitimate liberty infringing issues as opposed to blaming space-Jew&#39;s and lizard men or denying the moon landing or claiming I&#39;m a shill because I have video footage of my clearly untampered with plane leaving contrails--and doing so at will by finding the right altitude and jumping through a 50-100 foot range to turn the effect on and off--is the day that I will admit I am a conspiracy theorist. In the interim I am a rationalist, and a debunker of idiocy. </p>

<p>The &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; that interest me are that there are conspiracies that conspiracy theorists make up and spread through subversive propaganda born of apophenia and Dunning-Kruger effect with liberal dashings of paranoid schizophrenia. &#39;Conspiracy theorists&#39; is the greatest conspiracy going. A means by which socially challenged individuals justify their failure to thrive by citing batshit mental random nonsense. The other &#39;proven stuff&#39; isn&#39;t a conspiracy theory, but a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Anarchism is an ideology that is anti-state coercion and extortion, anti-corporate corruption and anti-religious oppression. As an anarchist I think conspiracy theorists tend to be good, looking for the truth and trying to be correct makes you the way you are. However if you spend all your time reading online and telling your friends what you found, then asking &#39;why is no one doing anything&#39; you are missing your chance to do just that. So I&#39;ll come here, and try to engage you (conspriacy theorists of many stripes) and when I do I find inconsistencies here or there; I try to help and by being a dissident to the community they&#39;ll label me a shill.</p>

<p>That&#39;s okay, Anarchists get called &#39;dirty commies&#39; a lot so your insults aren&#39;t really something I care about.</p>

<p>Yes there is evidence of abuse by those with power and privilege. Why do people think that we should wait to take action? <strong>Resist Occupy and Produce</strong>. I like trying to shove that down your throats if only becuase you might actually see it as a way out of your current problem.</p>

<p>If you think <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> does it for the lulz yeah, that&#39;s why they do it together and enjoy one another. Some of them maybe paid posters, that&#39;s evidence of being bad. I can&#39;t tell them apart, paid posters who are funny and people who like mocking what they don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll try to listen, it&#39;s just that I think there is already <em>enough evidence</em> to end the fed, and gain self-determination. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have special privileged information like leaks or evidence to give you, but you often see me around trying to show people what inconsistencies can be seen in a narrative that supports globalization. Cuase fuck that noise. </p>

<p>Conspiracy-Theory debunkers seek the truth, they try to be correct and it&#39;s because they&#39;re trying to do what you do.</p>

<p>I say make mistakes, get messy and stay learning; both sides do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thoroughly enjoy finding effective debunkings of certain conspiracy ideas, and I actively debate with followers of said conspiracies (Under a different log in and on different sites so don&#39;t bother looking)</p>

<p>A couple of reasons. </p>

<p>Proponents of a conspiracy claim to be so &#39;open minded&#39; but in fact are among the most close minded people you will ever run across on the internet. If a piece of evidence comes out which supports the &#39;official&#39; version, just watch the bile spill out. It is rejected out of hand. Yet any suggestion which supports their pet theory is eagerly lapped up without any question or validation whatsoever.</p>

<p>It&#39;s dishonest. If you truly seek the truth, you have to be prepared to sometimes say &quot;Yeah this evidence suggests the dull old &#39;official&#39; story is more or less true&quot;</p>

<p>Another reason is, I believe the numerous shaky conspiracy theories cause derision towards the few which I believe could have some validity. Not all conspiracies are created equal. The weak ones need to be squashed so more attention is paid to the strong ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There could be several reasons behind such behavior. Think about it, if all of us are right abiut everything, that would create such a huge shockwave in the lives of those who soend their lives complacent and who dont question their world. People can be afraid of such abrupt changes to the everyday paradigms they have grown accustomed to. This could initially cause them to try and debunk the alternstive theories, ajd set off a domino reaction to where they feel they must keep debunking for fear there is truth. </p>

<p>Ive found, that often times, it is very hard to bekieve in only one theory. To me, you kind of have to believe in most theories together, almost as a metatheory, in order to believe in one. So, conversely, to disbekieve one, you kind of have to disbelieve all others too, as our theories are delicately intertwined. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, throughout my course of research, ive noticed that in order to allow plausibility to most theories, most other theories must also be allowed plausibility. This unification of the theories (metatheory, or the theory behind all theories) must explain things in a way that would encompass all theories (or most, as some are, well, you know.).</p>

<p>i like to point out big pharma alot. Big pharma and the fda can arguably be seen as working together to get eachothers back. In order for big pharma to make profits on pharmaceuticals that may or may not be beneficial to our society, they need an authotity figure (enter FDA) to offer justification. Also, they need the fda to squash competition in the pharm markets (in my opinion, the real reason marijuana is still illegal), so they dont lose profits. In return, big pharma offers incentives to those who help them, whether that is donations for political movements, job security, whatever. Companies such as monsanto enter the mix and the need for agriculture regulations arises.</p>

<p>all this cannot happen unless the people who write the laws are in on it, enter congress and the house of representatives, even the executive branch. Now, in order to insure cooperation amongst all these folks, incentives must be offered in return for legislation that allows massive profits. The profits get divided amongst the participants. </p>

<p>Now, when this much money is being tossed around, you have to bring in the IRS, the bankers (the Fed), and those who control the power of the purse of our country (the HoR again, i believe.)</p>

<p>None of this can happen without the full cooperation of all involved, and full cooperation cannot exist without each participating entity to accrue profits and incentives. You scratch my back, i scratch your back. </p>

<p>This can only hapoen for so long before people (i.e. voters) begin to notice. Lest participants lose their advantages during elections, something has to be done to counter the peoples voices. Enter voter fraud, propaganda, marketing schemes, heavily worded legislation that very few actually understand (funny how obama was a constitutional lawyer, how convenient).</p>

<p>when things begin to escalate to such a massive scale, you would need international support. Afterall, those who control the Fed are international bankers. Once we start considering foreign affairs, international treaties and policies, things begin to exponentially get more complex. such complexity must be organised in such a fashion as to allow it to continue, lest it collapses upon itself.</p>

<p>But of course, it is much easier to believe that big pharma truely has our best interests in mind. If you doubt that assertion, then consideration of the rabbit hole i just dug must be given.</p>

<p>All that, without even mentioning such things as illuminati, zionism, freemasonry, or reptilians...</p>

<p>Ak. This is really black and white. I&#39;d go for the &quot;light grey of lots of people generally with good motives, with a few black (not actually black-black - that&#39;s racist!) and white (see previous brackets!) people sprinkled in there shoving the masses under their influence back and forth trying to get their own bad-ish or good-ish agendas as the one that succeeds&quot; concept.</p>

<p>Basically most people who go into science aren&#39;t doing it because they think they&#39;re going to get shedloads of cash and &quot;power&quot; from it. And you know what - they won&#39;t! There&#39;s <em>undeniably</em> some dicks in the upper management who manage to ruin some of it for everyone else, but also non-dicks who just want to get the job done (and make some money too, because hey we&#39;re not running a goddam charity here, and have you seen how much stuff costs now?).</p>

<p>Totally agree! Nothing is ever only black and white. Its always some form of a greyscale. This is why i tend to reserve my beliefs from my discussions, as i entertain ideas that i dont subscribe to quite often. </p>

<p>I think where i am struggling is in regards to those at the top. If those who run the show are closer to the black or white types, then their agenda gets trickled down to the greyscale types who are just trying to pay their bills and feed their families. The military is a good example (im trying to avoid a nefarious connotation with this as a neutral example) where the military has their secret projects that must remain secret. So, in order to achieve success they must apply a need-to-know basis upon the minions who do the work. Often times the majority of people who have clearances work on things that they arent allowed to know what they are. They are just allowed to know how to do that particular job, without ever learning how their piece fits into the bigger puzzle.</p>

<p>Its this comparmentalization concept that i struggle with, as you csnt really prove or disprove its extent, though i know it must exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whilst there&#39;s some plausability in this, doesn&#39;t this tend to mean &quot;growing the conspiracy&quot; has to take place, so that nearly everyone ends up being involved?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically. I usually follow the caveat that i dont necessarily have to believe what i speculate about, though. This is what i was trying to point out though. Its hard to completely believe one theory, without also believing other theories. As logic dictates (for me, at least), you have to keep connecting loose ends with something until the entire net is woven.</p>

<p>I aliken this attribute to those who debunk, for the same reason. If you believe that a given theory is utter nonsense, then other theories that would be connected to it must also be proven to be the same. (Again, this is just how i see it.)</p>

<p>You act like both sides are correct.  I will follow the side supported by experts who have studied their whole lives backing it.  Its not really a hard choice.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You really don&#39;t though.  Inquiry implies a search for answers and that doesn&#39;t represent the majority of conspiracy theorists.  If that was true this sub wouldn&#39;t be discussing things like 9/11, GMOs, Sandy Hook and contrails.  All of these things have been debunked and explained numerous times yet they show up everyday.  </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t making an argument, I was answering your question.  I know saying things like &quot;ad hominem&quot; make you feel smart but that all melts away when you can&#39;t even follow a conversation.  Get over yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t keep a blooming list, so I&#39;ll just have to wing it. Let me think...</p>

<p>First, I base my views that wealthy people will generally collude to remain that way, at the expense of others and proceed from there.</p>

<p>This leads me to such popular conspiracy theories that are <em>often</em><sup>1</sup> addressed here, such as - </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Big Coal / Oil funds Climate Change denial to obscure the massive damage they&#39;ve done to the environment. Americans in particular, being tightwads, will gleefuly accept this since they think they&#39;ll actually avoid paying a tax &quot;somehow&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Big Coal / Oil does everything in its power to raise protest at Nuclear power. This is done so that safety is insufficiently funded to make it work as well as it should, leading to inevitable accidents which can then be held up as proof that it&#39;s no good.</p></li>
<li><p>The wealthy elite who work towards mass depopulation have planted the seeds of anti-vaccination beliefs, so that the easily-swayed and suspicious poor of the world will die enmasse by common, avoidable diseases.</p></li>
<li><p>The US opposes the advancement of the EU, as it will inevitably become another superpower, and <em>two</em> superpowers is one too many in its view. This takes place in various ways, such as constantly starting wars and conflict on <em>European</em> borders (Iraq / Ukraine), whilst hiding in safety like a corpulent coward on the other side of the Atlantic. Also exporting their godawful food franchises to displace traditional British teashops! God save the Queen!</p></li>
<li><p>Chemtrail theories were started by two white supremacists who ended up just hating everyone, and wanted to make people believe stupid things for their own gratification.</p></li>
<li><p>Burton&#39;s Wagon Wheels were considerable larger during the 1970s, but Burtons have destroyed all the physical evidence to support it, leaving only people&#39;s memories, to which Burtons usually replies - &quot;Well, your hands were probably <em>smaller</em> during the 1970s&quot;. The smug, chocolatey bastards! Now they pretend not to recieve my daily letters.</p></li>
<li><p>This planet isn&#39;t the real Earth. It&#39;s a gigantic fake. The Moon is real however, so ironically the Moon Landings weren&#39;t faked.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><sup>1</sup> - These are just too edgy for the average mainstream conspiracy theorist to admit they believe, but are secretly afraid to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I often see this &quot;people are scared to accept reality, so they have to debunk&quot; line, but basically that entire argument exists within your head, not the heads of others, in much the same way that people who don&#39;t accept evolution think &quot;So how could life come from dead material&quot;, which basically just means they don&#39;t even know what evolution actually is about.</p>

<p>tldr - No, with respect, you&#39;ve misjudged the motivations of other people. Please just stop using this argument.</p>

<p>Everytime I see something where a CT relates &quot;I told them the truth, and they said they don&#39;t want to know it even if it is true!&quot;, it&#39;s almost always a work colleague or relative who is more likely <em>just sick up to the back teeth of hearing about your theories</em>, rather than actually being afraid of the New World Order, and is trying to just avoid the part where they tell you to shut your trap, and make all future interactions with you even more awkward.</p>

<p>It might be the most interesting thing in your lives, but other people have different obsessions, and I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to hear all about the minute details of their Pokemon / My Little Pony collection or other garbage in their life.</p>

<p>As with all things, this also applies to all sides.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Next point, I <em>do</em> find conspiracy theories interesting, which is why I&#39;m here so often. But I only want the ones backed by evidence to rise to the top, and the silly ones to slink off in embarrassment. I will <em>still</em> read silly conspiracy theory information, because it&#39;s entertaining, but that doesn&#39;t mean I will <em>entertain it</em>.</p>

<p>To head off the inevitable (and tiresome) argument of &quot;Who gets to decide what&#39;s silly or not? You?&quot;</p>

<p>And the answer is &quot;Yes. I <em>do</em> get to decide what&#39;s silly or not.&quot; It&#39;s my perogative.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Final point</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the pigeonholing of the &quot;opposition&quot; takes place on both sides, because it&#39;s a very human trait to try and make people you disagree with to be &quot;lesser&quot;, and so disregard their arguments.</p>

<p>I try my best to not fall into this trap myself, although I probably often do. It&#39;s an imperfect world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, thanks for the nice reply.</p>

<p>The alternative explanation was - people are just being &quot;polite&quot; and not wanting to know from lack of interest in conspiracy theories, so are trying ineffective (but socially acceptable) &quot;shooing&quot; techniques.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not actually filling their pants in fear at the impending (since at least the late 1990s) arrival of martial law / FEMA camps / police state / come and and see the violence inherent in the system, that people here seem to think they are. They&#39;re <em>not</em> afraid.</p>

<p>For your second point- </p>

<p>Some people here have mentioned boredom, which I think is certainly a part.</p>

<p>For myself, who I&#39;m the only person to really speak for, I&#39;d have to say that when I see a conspiracy theory that has a flaw in it, it&#39;s like seeing a spelling mistake in the middle a paragraph of writing.</p>

<p>I just <em>have</em> to say something or I&#39;ll burst. So perhaps it&#39;s just lots of people like me?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any contact with other &quot;debunkers&quot;, so I&#39;d have to admit I honestly don&#39;t know here.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s my motivation at any rate.</p>

<p>Oh, also! What makes you guys tick? It&#39;s <em>fascinating</em> - same facts, radically different conclusions.</p>

<p>This makes a whole lot of sense to me. Often times you can go either way when it comes to these topics. Its just that some fall to one side, while others fall to the opposite. </p>

<p>The underlying similarities amongst those folks (as i think you pointed out in another comment) is the search for the truth. I usually get along with these people regardless of which side they fall to. </p>

<p>I think the intent of the OP was in regards to thise who vehemently debunk, in absence of logical deducement for their own arguments. Now, this happens eith the CT side as well, if you dont believe what they believe, then you must be a shill. You know what im talking about. Similarily, there are people on the debunking side that if you believe the official narrative has any inconsistencies, or if you even question the validity of trivial statements, then you must be a quack or nutjob. </p>

<p>Extremists will be extreme, regardless of who they align themselves with, and i think this is what OP was referring to when he spoke of &quot;debunkers.&quot; Not the logical, civil, openminded debunkers who are actually pleasant to debate with, but those who reject all logical discourse for the sake of their beliefs.</p>

<p>Btw, im curious, do you tend to fall under the debunker side of things? Or the CT? Ive been getting mixed signals from your statements ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be a vehment debunker (to my shame!), but that&#39;s something I realised was unacceptable thanks to the patience of some of the old-hands here.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m still a self-admitted debunker who has a genuine interest in conspiracies, except the conspiracies I tend to believe in are &#39;crooked businessman / politician performs dodgy action&#39; (boring!) type and not &#39;hologram wotsits did 9/11&#39;. To be fair I don&#39;t think there&#39;s very many super-extreme CTs here either, but it&#39;s tough not to engage them when some of them say some <em>really</em> outrageous stuff.</p>

<p>If I&#39;ve been giving mixed signals, it&#39;s possible because I&#39;m quite grey too myself. I&#39;d have to class myself on the debunker side of the fence (no surprises there), although I want to say... &quot;conspiracy <em>refiner</em>&quot;, but since CTs aren&#39;t getting called &#39;critical thinkers&#39; by anyone but themselves, that&#39;s not going to happen to me any time soon either. ;-)</p>

<p>Allow me. ;)</p>

<p>In its original incarnation, it was &quot;reptilians&quot; - a label introduced by the infamous David Icke. However, he was decrying (and listing and naming) very specific people as belonging to this class of &quot;reptilians&quot; at a time (early 1970&#39;s) when speaking against them directly might get him &quot;suicided&quot; (so to speak). Many years later (almost 5 decades), he made this presentation called &quot;They Dare Not Speak Its Name&quot; to &quot;clarify&quot; what he meant by reptilians... who he&#39;d been talking about... and why.</p>

<p>See: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=david+icke+they+darenot+speak+its+name">here</a>.</p>

<p>He was talking about Rothschild Zionists - the most globally influential people in the world and how they manipulate everything you consume - from your food, to your pharmaceuticals, to your media, and they have the governments and politicians on their payroll.</p>

<p>Those who understood this were an &quot;in crowd&quot; with an &quot;inside joke&quot; to hide behind ... a sort of &quot;insanity cover&quot; if you will: Our Reptilian Overlords.</p>

<p>Later, those who didn&#39;t understand the inside joke, bastardized it into &quot;lizard people&quot; in mockery.</p>

<p>EDIT: Apparently, his choice of the term &quot;reptilian&quot; is derived from science, by the way... specifically, the &quot;Triune brain&quot; (a model of the brain which was popular when Icke began his writing career), which references a reptilian cortex, responsible for the behavior of the power-hungry. See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain">Triune Brain</a>.</p>

I see more subversive propaganda, fear mongering, hate mongering, and lie spreading by the 99%. I see far, far more violence and aggregate acts of socio/psychopathic behaviour in conspiracy circles than by the &#39;reptile alien overlords&#39;.</p>

<p>But hey, maybe I&#39;m wearing glasses with chemtrail tinting and all that fluoride in my water/toothpaste/anus is making me imagine things.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to make an example of you, but this does tend to capture the essence of my experience with activist debunkers (ala the rhetoric &quot;I&#39;ll bet you also believe &lt;insert mockery ad hominem here&gt;&quot;). And, you also reminded me that there do seem to be people who specialize in certain topics. As a card carrying conspiracy theorist (whatever that is), I take an interest in a wide variety of topics: JFK, 9/11, geoengineering (without a lot of emphasis on the chem/contrail debate - more along the lines of Monsanto toxicity), Big Pharma&#39;s tendency to classify every aspect of the human condition as a &quot;treatable disorder&quot;, war profiteering, and of course, the money masters who have their fingerprints on all of that. There seem to be &quot;expert debunkers&quot; on all of those topics. They appear out of nowhere each time one begins to gain momentum.</p>

<p>My post (above) is about all of them. Not just the populist 9/11 debunkers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, throughout my course of research, ive noticed that in order to allow plausibility to most theories, most other theories must also be allowed plausibility. This unification of the theories (metatheory, or the theory behind all theories) must explain things in a way that would encompass all theories (or most, as some are, well, you know.).</p>

<p>i like to point out big pharma alot. Big pharma and the fda can arguably be seen as working together to get eachothers back. In order for big pharma to make profits on pharmaceuticals that may or may not be beneficial to our society, they need an authotity figure (enter FDA) to offer justification. Also, they need the fda to squash competition in the pharm markets (in my opinion, the real reason marijuana is still illegal), so they dont lose profits. In return, big pharma offers incentives to those who help them, whether that is donations for political movements, job security, whatever. Companies such as monsanto enter the mix and the need for agriculture regulations arises.</p>

<p>all this cannot happen unless the people who write the laws are in on it, enter congress and the house of representatives, even the executive branch. Now, in order to insure cooperation amongst all these folks, incentives must be offered in return for legislation that allows massive profits. The profits get divided amongst the participants. </p>

<p>Now, when this much money is being tossed around, you have to bring in the IRS, the bankers (the Fed), and those who control the power of the purse of our country (the HoR again, i believe.)</p>

<p>None of this can happen without the full cooperation of all involved, and full cooperation cannot exist without each participating entity to accrue profits and incentives. You scratch my back, i scratch your back. </p>

<p>This can only hapoen for so long before people (i.e. voters) begin to notice. Lest participants lose their advantages during elections, something has to be done to counter the peoples voices. Enter voter fraud, propaganda, marketing schemes, heavily worded legislation that very few actually understand (funny how obama was a constitutional lawyer, how convenient).</p>

<p>when things begin to escalate to such a massive scale, you would need international support. Afterall, those who control the Fed are international bankers. Once we start considering foreign affairs, international treaties and policies, things begin to exponentially get more complex. such complexity must be organised in such a fashion as to allow it to continue, lest it collapses upon itself.</p>

<p>But of course, it is much easier to believe that big pharma truely has our best interests in mind. If you doubt that assertion, then consideration of the rabbit hole i just dug must be given.</p>

<p>All that, without even mentioning such things as illuminati, zionism, freemasonry, or reptilians...</p>
