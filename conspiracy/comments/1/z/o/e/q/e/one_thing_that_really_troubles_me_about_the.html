       The revelation of these facts did not phase them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were doing something unpopular which I believed to be a covert operation (e.g., painting graffiti) and I heard about my own operation through the grapevine, or if it made some kind of local news, ... and there was an implication that someone, somewhere, might actually know my identity... I'd be hesitant to continue that activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It stands to reason that Greenwald not only knows about these infiltration activities from an arm's length reporting stance (what he's been willing to say in the public spectrum), but also that he has access to (or at least Snowden had access at one time to) information pertaining to the specific activities being undertaken (which social media sites - I'm assuming all of the big ones), but... more threatening... the actual participants identities... either in the form of real names or online avatars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I'm having now is...
      </p>
      <p>
       The shilling hasn't stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is afraid.

       Uhm the CIA was caught funding cocaine dealing death squads and selling weapons to Iran to further fund those death squads in the 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one cared. Oliver North, who helped orchestrate the weapons deals and knew all about the drug dealing as head of Reagan's NSC, is a popular talking head on fox news.
      </p>
      <p>
       People forget the NSA was caught spying on everyone back in the 70s. The CIA was caught slipping citizens LSD. FBI was caught blackmailing and assassinating and infiltrating. Who was arrested? Who was held accountable? NO one. There was a congressional report admitting everything, and then nothing substantial happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has always been like this. Just appreciate the fact that more people are waking up due to the internet and people like Snowden/Greenwald.

       Are they really waking up? Or are more people simply accepting and ignoring more oppression while they turn their TV to their latest download of Breaking Bad (or whatever is common in the immediate present)?

       By simple virtue of the fact that the NSA is in the news for spying on everyone, more people are waking up. Most people probably didn't even know what the NSA was in the 90s. At least now most people know the NSA is spying on everyone, even if not all of them care.

       Conspiracies can be best fought once they are given mainstream credibility, frankly. If everyone thinks you're crazy for believing a particular conspiracy, good luck stopping it. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and all that.

       Because no one understands what is being presented here. No one has demonstrated a thorough understanding of what has been created. What is already running and has been for years and years. We are asking "what sites?" and "who's involved?" Instead of what and why. There is no threat. No one has a clue what the problem is because the system itself has everyone completely deluded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is tracking everything. If you are alive you are tracked and profiled. Everything. Everythibg you say, type, do, where, how and with who. It's just metadata right? Haha. Yes it is because that's how the system organizes the info to maintain your profile and manipulate every thought,  belief and insight you have through content exposure and flat out physical manipulation.  Food, pharma, radio/microwaves, light and of course high level programming through media content online, tv etc. PER PERSON.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a frickin computer to put it simply!! It's not who it's what! There is no one looking at the records because it would be impossible. The shills are patsies and there are millions of them. They are just people silently nudged towards their purpose. Engineered responses to your response all orchestrated through the same system.  It's so absolutely science fiction no one gets it. There is no threat. Once people see what's going on they realize that there effort to overcome it was ALL wrong.

       Don't be afraid. I mean that sincerely. Have no attachment to what is being implied through your online experience. Much of it is vapid and meaningless in the grand scheme of things. And by online I mean everything you perceive as being collectively experienced through all media.  It was inevitable that from technology a system like this would evolve. It is a physical manifestation of the disconnect man has suffered since the IAm duality. It's going and the only way it will end is disaster. On a personal and collective level to overcome it we should seek peace in ourselves first and the experience of absolute truth beyond the religion of science and technology.  People have been oppressed by delusion forever. The novelty is in it's present manifestation but the essence is the same. The last weapon in it's arsenal is to be scary. To frighten you with it's power and massiveness. Look right into it and you see a rotting computer with failing hard drives and burnt out memory. And a pile of patsies tending to it's temporality. It's going to implode and people dependent on it are going to suffer.

       Grandma always said this world could become something akin to one of the "god machine" episodes of the original Star Trek series...  I found those ones especially jarring as a youngster.  However, Kirk and Spock would typically destroy or disable the thing.

       No doubt Kirk WILL eventually destroy the evil computer. OR it could be Tom Cruise ala Oblivion. We will just have to wait and see i guess. WantsNeeds is interesting name too! If you find yourself in a place of actually wanting needs it's a good place to be. Peace!

       The spying has not stopped either.

       I think they are still going to try the tactics and censor the info the best they can.

       My coworkers who mainly watch the MSM don't even realize Greenwald is still putting info out. They thought the mass spying was all of it.

       Well I mean if one government stops paying shills do they lead the next generation astray like the Pied-Piper?

      <p>
       Do other nations decide that if one nations give up they sohuld just pack it in because espionage isn't fun without them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be concerned if they stopped, if only because I'd feel like I was wasting my time espousing unpopular opinions online with no one to stop me.

       If the paid posting stopped all of a sudden on them being exposed by someone then the internet wins. Sure, we'd have the right to self-determination in our online communities.

      <p>
       But when has a government mistake exposed on this scale been followed by an apology and an altered policy? Do they think it's a mistake to continue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably not. They continue cause we can't do anything, they see everything and how did you plan to object?

       You're making an assumption Greenwald has actual names, he may not.  The reason, though, that no shill is afraid is because even if you knew their real name, they could just never associate it with work online, shouldn't be that hard if they got the NSA-bypass for Google+ registration, and avatars can change. The scariest shit though is like, what if everyone is in on it?  The Statsi's had about 1 informant for every 3 citizens thereabouts.  I wonder what the internet ratio looks like?  If Greenwald knows he gotta tell or he's in on it

       The point being that information about identities is accessible to potential leakers.

       I did not, as you claim, make an assumption that "Greenwald has actual names".

       What about my retort that even if you knew names there's nothing that can be done?  Impossible to locate somebody just on a name, except if its unusual, but the NSA doesn't hire people with unusual names -- they watch them.

       Unfounded assumption.

       A name is a starting point.

       However, I also referenced the potential of knowing online avatars. Did we recently notice a change in names from any of the regular trolls in this sub? Same MO, different UID?
