       has lost it. I had few friends yesterday and a day before trying to submit the other side of the story, comments deleted within 30 sec of submission, users banned from submitting to subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, do not get fulled by propaganda on reddit. The latest is like Poland is being afraid, who the blip needs Poland??? Seriously? Why would Russia want to invade Poland??? The fear mongering, anti-Russia sentiment does no good and only escalates difficult situation. I am loosing all respect for reddit.

       I noticed the increase in anti-Russian newspieces leading up to Sochi. It's rare to see anything positive about Russia in western media but it just seemed like way too much even for Russia.

       Another thing is that the majority of anti-Russia redditors are accounts between 6 and 3 (or less) months old. I take time to see how old the account is, and it almost always a new account. I do not like it, and it is scary too.

       These two videos explain what I think, and I've been interested in potential WW3 for years now. Still dumbstruck by Ukraine, until I realized it was the same as Syria in terms of Western Interests.

       I'm only stepping in to say that propaganda is a very real thing.  Why would you think it couldn't exist on the internet?

       Propaganda has evolved.  I don't think it took any geniuses to realize that the anonymity of the internet would be great when trying to spread propaganda.

       At the same time..Russia is very anti-gay, is not a free media state, the Arctic 30, Pussy Riot.

      <p>
       ...they're not a good state. They're just as bad, or at least equal, with America.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, they may just be trying to stop an American led coupe and stabilize a state whose destabilisation will hurt them, but don't fool yourself. The Russians don't give a shit about the people. They're just tried of it being a proxy war between the US and Russia. Neither side gives a shit about the people of the Ukraine.

       Most of the people in this sub are just tired with hearing the constant anti-Russia narrative and talking points being pushed, and find looking at the situation from the other perspective refreshing, even if Russia is just as corrupt and run by the same kinds of elitist criminals as everywhere else. Putin is just as bad as Obama but the outrage around Russia is merely for political points, turf and natural resources, not out of any concern for its citizens.
For example many of the US and UK allies have a much more inhumane and disgusting attitude towards LGBT individuals, such as Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, but I barely see the kind of outrage that had the coverage of the Russia thing.

       Very valid points. We are attracted to enemy of today. I mean while we're at it, North Korea is literally a slave state which depends on its slave population to keep the nation running.

       Uh no... Obama isn't a saint, but if you think he is anywhere near as bad as Putin you have a 14 year old's understanding of world politics.  And the reason people give Russia more shit about LGBT rights then Saudi Arabia is because Saudi Arabia is well....Saudi Arabia. No one expects much from a country that doesn't allow men and women to eat in the same restaurants. People have a higher opinion of Russia (or they used do before the current debacle) so when Russia passes stupid reactionary laws a lot more people are outraged.

       Why does everything that happens in the world need a reasoning larger than itself? Can't an uprising just be an uprising? Why must it be an American funded coup? What evidence is there to support this? What does American stand to gain from this? Most importantly, if it is then why has Russia not called out the US on this then? If it really where true Russia would be making that case to the UN but it's not.

       The anti gay law everyone went crazy over doesn't impose jail time, you get a fine if you provide children with pro gay literature or information. It's stupid but Britain had the same law up until the early 2000's and a tons of allies such as Saudi Arabia still execute people for being gay. The anti gay movement was used to turn young people against Russia and it worked big time. If you are really interested in countries where homosexuality is illegal I've posted link to a list.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give you sample, Barbados passed a law in 2002 giving those engaging in anal intercourse up to life in prison. Barbados!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look ar the worldnews timeline of 'who's the enemy' it switched from anti Muslim to anti Russian right after Russia successfully intervened in the Syrian invasion.

         Russia hates gays, imprisons dissenters, has no freedom of speech/ press, and is in general extremely unfree so &amp;quot;They are just as bad or equal with America&amp;quot;

       It's different. You ever play Final Fantasy 7?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "...I'll let you here my new appointment speech. Old man tried to control the world with money. It seems to have been working.The population thought that Shinra would protect them. Work at Shinra, get your pay. If a terrorist attacks, the Shinra will help you. It looks perfect on the outside. But I do things differently. I control the world with fear. It takes too much to do it like my old man. A little fear will control the minds of common people. There's no reason to waste money on them." -Rufus, Final Fantasy 7

       In the United States, we have the imitation of free press. CNN is the 4th branch of the US government: the propaganda branch. And it's so cute you think people in the US don't get locked up for protests. Have you been to an Occupy rally? Have you been to a Democratic or Republican National Convention? They turn into tear-gas zones with thousands of people locked up for two or three days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure all the charges get dismissed, but these protests rarely ever make national news. The people who plan them are constantly raided by police and intimidated. And yet we have some big names that do get locked up, like Bradley/Chesey Manning, for taking a real stand against the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US plays it a little cooler and uses a little more money to keep the people on its side. But don't be fooled. The US bombs kids with predator drones, starts countless military coups, makes up shit to go to war for oil and is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.

       There is so much fucking propaganda!
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the main themes of the day:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Putin is crazy.  Unsourced except that "Merkel said it."    Let alone the fact that the entire nation of Russia (with all its history and context) has been reduced to "Putin," now, he's also crazy.  Great way to lower tensions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russia gives unreasonable ultimatum.  Again unsourced.  Parroted everywhere, in many sources.  Comments explain it is untrue.  Paints a great picture.  It's "true."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Putin wants Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, etc.  Wait, what?  He wanted Crimea because his naval base has been there since America was in it's infancy, and Ukraine, which is basically Russian to begin with, underwent a rather dubious revolution.  Russia is protecting their interests, moreso than the US in Iraq, with more historical legitimacy BY FAR.  This is being furhter hyped by "scared" Lithuanians and Latvians.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reports of Russian censorship including
         <em>
          gasp
         </em>
         the Oscars.  How dare those pinko fucks censor the pinnacle of our civilization?  What's that?  US has a more pervasive and damaging spy grid that would make the Soviet era KGB cum in their pants?  They're keeping Snowden out of jail by granting him asylum?  What?  Can't hear you!  Russia is CENSORSING!?  Oh no evil communist cunts!
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       People are so dumb.  Jesus.

       For weeks I have been saying that comments are being deleted at wholesale rates.

      <p>
       And here is the
       <em>
        really

       sinister thing. Your post (that has been deleted without warning or explanation)
       <strong>
        still appears to you when you are signed in

       .

       what happened to me. I submitted a comment, and the only reason why I've noticed it, was because it remained without any downvotes, completely static. That is how I discovered it. Now I can write and "submit" comment to r/worldnews, but it does not appear in a thread any longer!!

       If it helps, that's the only deletion ability the mods have.  And deleted comments have always still appeared to the commenter when they're still logged in.

       Deleted only shows when you delete your comment.  If a mod deletes your comment it stays on your user page and you continue to see it while you're logged in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first time i stumbled across it was in 2011 when I got into it with Violentacrez over something dumb.  I went back to check out the arguments and everything but my comments were deleted.  So I logged out to check my alt and then my comments were gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's when I created my first subreddit and tested it for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly if you don't believe me make a subreddit and test it for yourself, it's the only option you have in your mod tools for removing a comment.

       The concept for shadowban as a countermeasure for spambots is kind of a great idea, the bot won't know it has been banned. The problem is how most reddit mods are complete retards when it comes to banning people. There was a guy that blogged about him leaving reddit, he was a 5 year user (this was about 2-3 years ago, so he was a user from the start) an he got shadowbanned for having 3 posts in a row with a score below 1. The problem is that
       <a href="/r/reportthespammers">
        /r/reportthespammers
       </a>
       is hardly monitored, if your 8 newest comments were all below, lets say 5 karma, I could link you to that subreddit and you'd probably get shadowbanned. It's absolutely retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: To give another example, here's a guy (
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/fsx3jdi">
        http://www.reddit.com/user/fsx3jdi
       </a>
       ) who is new to reddit and he posted something to

       There's a leaked tape of US officials strategizing about which people to put in power in Ukraine. Listen to that tape. True or not the Russians believe we are behind the revolution to some extent. To them we started it.

       There's evidence that the US was involved with the Ukraine revolution as an attempt to bring them into NATO and destabilize Russia.

       I can't imagine Russia is pleased with Poland's US missile shield, plus there's a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of historical bad blood between Russia and Poland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the deal a few years back where most of the Polish leadership was killed in a plane crash, which many thought was engineered by Russia.

       I was always under the impression World News, and News, didn't encourage RT posts in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen some of my friends quick to run to RT because they don't trust the MSM.  at this point, I personally view RT as MSM Russia-version.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, RT can provide an interesting perspective. It's far from the whole picture, but not the worst place to start if all you can find is anti-Russian editorials.

       It's understandable people aren't siding with Russia in light of what's happening in Ukraine. The situation is hazy at best, and no one's sure what Russia's motives are.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are claims the political parties in charge of rebuilding Ukraine's government are Neo-Nazi puppets, so Putin steps in to ensure Ukraine's independence. Then again, it's also been claimed Putin wants their own puppet, Yulia Timoshenko, in charge of Ukraine, which I believe to be more likely.

       I found this report to be very insightful:

       How about forming a new subreddit --
       <a href="/r/worldnews4real">
        /r/worldnews4real
       </a>
       or something where there's no censorship and the mods are true believers in open sharing of info. Reddit is a democracy. We vote with our subscriptions and participate by creating subs and submitting content. You have the power to do something.

       I find it strange how pro-Russian this subreddit is now, i'm not saying you guys need to be pro-us or pro anything for that matter. I think neutrality to absorb the entire realistic situation is the best way to go, but understand that when there's such a large shift in '' allegiance '' for lack of a better word, you yourself might be influenced by propaganda. If you truly wan't to have clear eyes, i'd think neutrality is the best way to go so you're not bias.  Don't be so gullible to think that only one world superpower employs propaganda, undoubtedly Russia and China have a-lot of propaganda tools themselves.

       I find it hilarious that if a uprising happens in the US or ones of it's allies,the response is 'yeah,viva la revolution! free the people!' if it happens in a country that is hostile to the US, no matter how horrifically despotic the government is, it's always
       <em>
        always

       a CIA backed plot and people here  will cheer on governments that are

       I find it interesting that right after a possible large budget cut is announced for the US military, Ukraine flares up and the cold war is  back in the limelight.

       Terrorists are old news and don't have the impact on the US, (and possibly European?), population the way they once did. The military industrial complex needs a bad guy to justify their enormous and ever increasing budgets, and there is no better bad guy than the nasty, evil and commie Ruskies.

        Russia hates gays, imprisons dissenters, has no freedom of speech/ press, and is in general extremely unfree so "They are just as bad or equal with America"

       Please don't take this as a personal attack, and I do acknowledge that your point is valid, but to a lot of people (myself included) your point automatically seems less valid because you compose and spell like a teenage girl.
