    <div class="md"><p>beating shills has nothing to do with presenting facts. They couldn&#39;t give two shits if you present facts. They will just attack your personality or reputation or verbiage. Its the definition of a shill.</p>

<p>You beat them by not giving a fuck and posting anyway. Then when they attack you, you go harder. </p>

<p>We have tons of &quot;facts&quot; at our disposal all the way from 9/11, uss liberty, mumbai bombings, to the sandy hook shooting, and aurora shooting.</p>

<p>Again, facts have nothing to do with it. It&#39;s a fact that MK ultra was real but if you talk about it you might as well be wearing a tin foil hat. </p>

<p>Satanic cults using children as sacrifice are real but again if you talk about it, you might as well be wearing a tin foil hat. </p>

<p>shills are liars. deal with them by not paying attention to their nonsense. It&#39;s called a down vote. USE IT</p>

<p>The comments section are extremely important. I personally always go through the comments, typically they are more insightful than the actual articles. Usually articles are written with an extreme prejudice or bias towards one side or group. I am however really sick of people trying to demonize anyone with random ideas or thoughts. </p>

<p>This sub-reddit has surely been invaded by a large amount of people with disdain for r/conspiracy. This whole bridge between r/conspiracy and r/conspiritard...sometimes I feel like I should be reading from r/conspiritard but I am actually reading from r/conpiracy. But there is no reason to combat them in the open. They just ridicule and talk shit. Best we can do is just keep doing what we are doing but with a higher decibel level ;)</p>

<p>There is a difference between a theory describing a different viewpoint and a conspiracy theory. Learn, JTRIG:</p>

<p>If that &quot;different viewpoint&quot; is no different from what is shown in the media, then it&#39;s not a &quot;different viewpoint&quot;, it&#39;s propaganda, and it&#39;s not different at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The answer: I can and it does matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you can? Great! Then this should be easy for you: Show me incontrovertible proof that someone you accuse of being a shill is actually working for the government. Show me a pay stub. Show me a memo directed to the individual on what to say. Show me a picture of them in a three legged race with George Soros at Bohemian Grove. </p>

<p>If you say you can tell the difference between a shill and a person who disagrees, then put up or shut up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a difference between a theory describing a different viewpoint and a conspiracy theory. Learn, JTRIG:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently &quot;JTRIG&quot; is the code word you&#39;re using to get around calling someone a shill directly. That&#39;s adorable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If that &quot;different viewpoint&quot; is no different from what is shown in the media, then it&#39;s not a &quot;different viewpoint&quot;, it&#39;s propaganda, and it&#39;s not different at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if a viewpoint is expressed and backed with research in a non-prejudiced manner with journalistic integrity, it must be government controlled propaganda - according to you. </p>

<p>So what would you call a viewpoint that is contrary to that which has been researched with due diligence and supported with evidence? </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to most people here</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to no one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh really? Because I disagreed with what you said and you just accused me of being <del>a shill</del> JTRIG. Please explain. </p>

<p>And the rest *is your opinion and not based on anything I actually said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which has been researched with due diligence and supported with evidence</p>

<p>Like what?</p>

<p>You use JTRIG disinfo tactics as is evident in your comments, such as labeling people &quot;truther&quot;. That makes you JTRIG.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Faceshovel said that, effectively.  If I shot down a couple of conspiracy theories, I must be on the other &quot;side&quot;.</p>

<p>Each theory is separate, each should have facts supporting it, and those that don&#39;t are false.  Odds are zero that every single theory is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, OK, here I go then.</p>

<p>Did you know that most of the leaders of Israel throughout its history have been actual terrorists? As in, &quot;shoot them - blow them up&quot; terrorists? That&#39;s right, Israel is a terrorist state, founded by terrorists, on acts of terrorism, and run by terrorists throughout its history. The Mossad still regularly conducts acts of murder and terrorism around the world. You didn&#39;t know that? Well now you know.</p>

<p>Say, did you know that blacks are significantly less intelligent than whites, Asians, Latinos ... in fact, they are less intelligent than all other races and subraces on the planet, with the sole exception of the Australian aborigines? This has been absolutely proven by multiple IQ studies, which have been verified and replicated. There is no doubt about it at all. None. Yet if you mention this <em>fact</em> people will dispute it, because they simply do not know the truth. The media has never informed them of this truth. Yet, when you think about it, it has profound significance for Western society. Affirmative action is shown to be not only unjust, but impossible. Blacks will never be able to compete fairly with whites, no matter what advantages they receive, because they simply are not bright enough to do so, as a racial group.</p>

<p>Say, did you know there is a sustained campaign to destroy Christianity? You didn&#39;t know that? It&#39;s true. The media has been bashing and maligning Christians and the Christian religion and Jesus himself for decades, trying to turn people away from the Christian churches, and more importantly, to drive people away from a Christian code of behavior. America has always been a Christian nation, but the elite don&#39;t want that -- they want atheists and degenerates that they can more easily manipulate. And they are getting them, in droves. Most young people today have no morals to speak about. They are like feral animals. Thanks to our ruling elite.</p>
