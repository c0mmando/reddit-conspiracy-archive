        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, <a href="/u/Sovereignman">/u/Sovereignman</a> has stepped down from the mod team, likely the result of events that culminated <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zdqqr/today_this_post_was_removed_from_the_front_page/">in this thread</a>.</p>

<p>FTR, I&#39;m really disappointed how all this went down. </p>

<p>I hope SM comes back, because since I&#39;ve been a mod here, he&#39;s dedicated an <em>unreasonable</em> amount of time to moderating this sub...he does most of the grunt work and he deals with both the petty and the serious issues and conflicts.</p>

<p>That being said, I completely understand the frustration with rule 10. It&#39;s glaringly obvious how poor the timing was with the latest revelations (although suggesting that the rule change was <em>related</em> stretches even <em>my</em> normally very elastic levels of credulity).</p>

<p>How would you, the users of this sub, like the rule to read?</p>

<p>There are <em>so</em> many incredibly important things going on in the world, and while I recognize the dire need for a completely transparent sub, sometimes I feel like all this meta drama is distracting from real research and real activism.</p>

<p>And yes, we should <em>absolutely</em> question the mods--I felt that before I became a mod and my feelings haven&#39;t changed--however, I see no justification for driving one to step down over the sheer amount of personal attacks he received.</p>

<p>SWS was not right for the mod team, but SM has been a dedicated <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user for <em>years</em> and I&#39;d like to mention that he was the <em>least</em> enthusiastic about joining the mod team originally. </p>

<p><em>We</em> voted for him, and he begrudgingly accepted, and as a result I truly believe the sub has improved, despite the latest drama.</p>

<p>There is a lot of justified anger and frustration at play here, especially with regards to those who purposely spread disinfo online, and now that our frustration has recently been validated, I understand the need to take action.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time we change rule 10, but we need to have a conversation about it without our emotions getting things out of hand.</p>

<p>While the rest of reddit is slowly falling apart, we can&#39;t let this sub be driven into an &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality, whether that&#39;s mods vs. conspiracy users, or conspiracy vs. the rest of reddit.</p>

<p>This place is <em>great</em>, and has the potential to be even greater, but the most important thing is to remember that we&#39;re all in this together.</p>

<p>Edit: Rule 10 has been changed to the following: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rule 10 - Posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context. Repeat offenders are subject to a ban.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, sadly SM says he wont be coming back as a mod, but I encourage you to PM him with your appreciation and support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aw fuck. Not this shit again. Seriously guys, this shit is getting out of hand and needs to stop. We can&#39;t keep attacking mods. The mods should be able to police themselves and users of this sub without fear of pitchfork brigades.</p>

<p>The rules were tightened in order to protect the user base from constant personal attacks. They also were more commonly enforced due to the LARGE INFLUX of users intentionally breaking the rules.</p>

<p>This situation has blown out of proportion and has resulted in many users having their comments removed. That has resulted in an ideal situation for those we are supposedly opposed to influencing our subreddit. These guys want to turn you against the mods.</p>

<p>If you are involved in this subreddit drama then you should back up and check yourself. You are creating a situation of instability. Go back to standard operating procedures and stop breaking rules just to create drama.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been a fuckton of self posts attacking the sub, users, and the mods. They will be removed. Deal with it.</p>

<p>Just to be clear:</p>

<p>Invading a subreddit, creating chaos and drama, accusing mods of crimes, ousting mods and destabilizing a subreddit are all actions that constitute shill activity.</p>

<p>This is content manipulation, conversation manipulation, and user manipulation. This drama is what the rules were trying to prevent. </p>

<p>Stop following the &quot;Rabble Rousers&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very disappointed in this subreddit as of late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the reasons why this post has been made. We want to discuss and clarify rule 10 with the community. It isn&#39;t a question of attacking mods, its a rule that can affect all users here but at the same time it is there to also protect them</p>

<p>The very fact that this post has been made by active moderators should show that we operate with the community&#39;s concerns in mind. We want rules that work but not censor. </p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m disappointed that <a href="/u/Sovereignman">/u/Sovereignman</a> has left us. He was a popular choice and did good, if unrewarding work whilst he was here. Other members of the mod team and myself have asked him to reconsider but i will respect his decision and completely understand if he is done here (as moderator) It&#39;s a pretty thankless task. </p>

<p>We have asked our readers for their thoughts and opinions on rule 10 with a subject to listen and adjust it accordingly. There is no more, nothing hidden and only a request for user feedback so we can protect  posters and everyone else involved with the continuation and growing of the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My conversation with SM in regards to selective enforcement of rules could have gotten me banned. I mentioned that in my comment. It was a heartfelt question to him. Not being rude or accusational.  Ironically in a thread about allowing people to post numerous usernames as suposed shills that he allowed to remain posted. He seems honest, humble, responsive and able to admit his bad choices. That to me means a lot. I really hope he posts here to tell his side of the story.</p>

<p>Yeah, well some of us don&#39;t want rules which are left widely open to moderator interpretation. In fact, some of us would like to see (and have mentioned) a code of conduct for the mods. You don&#39;t rule over us. You&#39;re supposed to be <em>serving us and our interests</em>. This... this right here is where the communication is breaking down.</p>

<p>You see yourselves as our overseers, much the way the police often see themselves as conduct regulators... rather than as public servants.</p>

<p>When you stop behaving as &quot;rulers&quot;, a trend which was established almost 2 years ago by a mod who was recently banned over a &quot;mistake&quot; involving child pornography and then reinstated after pleading ignorant, perhaps we will stop viewing you as tyrannical monsters trying to control us. </p>

<p>Where some of you are concerned, I agree whole-heartedly with <a href="/u/GoyzIIMensch">/u/GoyzIIMensch</a> who wrote</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe our mods shouldn&#39;t be considered any better than us. I believe they should be considered one of us who happens to be able to issue punishments as the community would want them to be done. I don&#39;t believe they are better judges of character than us, or morally superior. I also believe that our mods feel that way as well. I just think that sometimes in the rat race of doing their job(especially in a place as stressful as this sub) that they can forget that sometimes and overstep their bounds. I do not believe this makes them bad mods, I believe it makes them human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where I don&#39;t agree is with the precedent set by 9000sins that frequent and heavy-handed banning &quot;improves&quot; things. A precedent which, sadly, other mods (most recently, SovereignMan) have followed.</p>

<p>Your rules should not be excuses to ban. They should be reasons to get - and stay - involved in this subreddit. Rerailing derailed discussions (All of you could learn some great lessons from axolotl and Assuredly about being involved but still hands-off. And, yeah... I&#39;m looking in the direction of Flytape as I type this.)</p>

<p>Since I don&#39;t have direct access to the modtools (and I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re quite thankful that donbueno doesn&#39;t either), all I can point to without a lot of sifting through thousands of comments is <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> - where your name appears quite often.</p>

<p>From observation as a moderator, myself, I&#39;ve seen a direct correlation between mods who liberally remove content (and I see your name alongside removals which are/were critical of the sub/mods) and who also aren&#39;t hesitant to ban.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fact that you were so easily called out by my closing remark (in my previous comment) makes you somewhat volatile and unstable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well public Intel analyst, </p>

<p>You&#39;re failing at analysing the Intel.  Firstly donbueno doesn&#39;t have access to the mod tools because he abused his privilege and used his access to trump the mod team and delete everyone like the mini tyrant he was.  If donbueno had taken a different course of action like joining in the mod mail and discussing the issues we were debating like a normal human being instead of acting like a child throwing a tantrum he would probably still be a mod here.</p>

<p>Anyone is free to look at <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> and see that my name doesn&#39;t really appear there that often and when it does if you look in the conspiracy comments you&#39;ll find one from me explaining the removal.</p>

<p>Based upon your own analysis, you feel that there is a correlation between mods who remove content as seen in uncensorship and mods who ban people.  Well everyone have look.  (No offense Mr.Dong) Mr.Dong removes more content than I do because that is what Mr.dong focuses on, where I focus on the comments sections thus I ban more people.  Your analysis is flawed and you aren&#39;t even following it or you would have called out Mr. Dong instead of me.</p>

<p>You think &quot;in closing&quot; that you called me out but you&#39;re wrong again, I don&#39;t feel shamed for you exposing me.  I feel annoyed that you&#39;re so glaringly wrong about everything you have assumed here, yet you keep spitting on the floor at my feet every time we cross paths.  You do this not because of any problems with flytape&#39;s mentality, you do this because YOU are the problem.  You are the incorrect one who is ruining this community with your fantasy of Paradise via anarchy.</p>

<p>Now, you&#39;ve said your piece.  You called me out publicly and spit on the floor.  I&#39;ve proved you wrong and now I predict that you won&#39;t be man enough to admit your defeat.  You&#39;ll keep nagging at me and spitting on my boots.  You&#39;ll accuse me of being a liar, and if Mr.dong comments to verify what I&#39;ve said, (that each mod focuses on different things) then you&#39;ll call him a liar.</p>

<p>But that is how it works, that is how you&#39;re wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. so... one full comment of personal attack on me, followed by use of profanity. I&#39;d rest my case, but I wanted to add this (should have quickly edited my previous comment). I explicitly stated that your removals pertained to criticism of the sub/mods... this was my direct correlation to frequency of banning (nullifying your retort w.r.t. Dong).</p>

<p>Anyway, you&#39;ve revealed enough about yourself in this exchange to make it clear that you&#39;re too emotionally involved in your position. Easily provoked, your skin is too thin for the job. </p>

<p>Prediction: Next time the heat gets hot, it will likely be you at the center of the controversy. (Let&#39;s see how my analysis pans out on this.)</p>

<p>If someone defends them self against your accusations of corruption, you accuse them of attacking you and pretend that this somehow validates your erroneous claims.</p>

<p>You have a problem with me specifically because I ban people, never mind that they refused to follow the rules and were warned before banned.  (Anarchists don&#39;t do rules)</p>

<p>Guess what, I&#39;m going to continue to enforce the rules to their fullest extent.  Not because I&#39;m &quot;emotionally involved&quot; or any of your other exaggerated claims, but because I give a shit about the quality of this sub.</p>

<p>Prediction:  I didn&#39;t accept this position to make friends with trolls so I&#39;ll likely make enemies of a few of them.  Ding ding ding ding ding!</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t my assertion. Your emotional involvement in your mod position may be what makes you think this.</p>

<p>One whole post (4 or 5 paragraphs) of ad hominem invective. That wasn&#39;t an accusation, it was simply pointing out a fact.</p>

<p>You might want to take a look at the title of the post. If you banned me for discussing the mods, any of the mods, including you, you&#39;d be digging your own grave.

<p>Yes I remember very well,  you were once again implying that the mods were using rule 10 to stifle legitimate criticism of the mods.   I asked you for an example of this and you suddenly moved the goal posts and pulled this strange concept out of your hat that I was asking you to call someone a shill...  which I didn&#39;t... and which anyone can click the link above and see for themselves.</p>

<p>Actually, I wasn&#39;t thinking that, ... at least not precisely. However, now that <em>you&#39;ve</em> suggested it, I will give it some thought.</p>

<p>Actually, what I <em>was</em> thinking was the sheer number of early comments which were sucking up to the mods (we love you guys! <em>slobber slobber</em> we don&#39;t want you to change! you&#39;re all so yummy and <em>slobber slobber</em>... I just don&#39;t have words to express how much we love you!). So, I looked at a couple of the accounts. That&#39;s all. Nothing more, nothing less. And I discovered one which (while making a comment in that vein) wasn&#39;t even an active participant in the sub... sitting at the top-voted comment.</p>

<p>So, while you claim you want rule 10 to protect against shills, it appeared (to me - and still does) that you only want that protection if* the activity in question isn&#39;t in your favor. If it&#39;s all praise-shillery, that&#39;s just fine and dandy. Right?</p>

<p>Some of us don&#39;t agree with the mods all the time. When the mods don&#39;t agree with you, they are very comfortable banning you or threatening to do so with no real reason. </p>

<p>Frankly, I have a hard time taking you genuinely because in the several years I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve not found it so easy to stay on the clean side of the mods. But then again I don&#39;t feel uncomfortable voicing my disagreement. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the mods seem to be interested in making this a place that does not tolerate disagreement. It&#39;s incredibly ironic and a bit though provoking as well.</p>

<p>This rule change is just making many of us lean more towards them being involved. If we can&#39;t question each other, then why have a sub that questions everything?</p>

<p>Look dude.  Auto moderator removed your link because you made a brand new account to post it.  It didn&#39;t get unspammed by a mod because we have brand new accounts posting lame meta stuff every day.  </p>

<p>If you have messaged the mods and asked what&#39;s up like 10 months ago they probably would have unspammed it and it would have died in the new queue due to being down voted.</p>

<p>The rules should be in place to protect the users of the community, not to get rid of shills.</p>

<p>Until they stop sending shills, they will always keep coming.  There is nothing that we can do to stop them.  The best thing I think we can do is to ignore them. So we can continue on learning and discussing.  PR 101: If it&#39;s damaging, ignore it and it&#39;s impact will be reduced. </p>

<p>&quot;Rooting out Shills&quot; is a losing battle.  It&#39;s not even something worth putting the time into.  Each time someone get&#39;s exposed, they can simply create a new alias.  We should use the newfound information to understand, rather than as a weapon. </p>

<p>The last thing we need, is for the alternative media to respond with a &quot;war on shills&quot; that places users under strict surveilance and other such nonsense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently, as near as I can gather, the recent drama over SM is due to his banning of someone who was being extremely vocal about the bpb0 drama. </p>

<p>See, bpb0 stirred the pot, at the same time that G. Greenwald was a hot topic (post removals re manipulation of social media), people got outraged... then, SM foolishly (IMO) tried to quash the outrage - sorta like trying to break apart a pit bull fight - and got dragged down by that drama. A wise man would not have rolled up his sleeves for that mess, let alone reach an arm into the pit.</p>

<p>On a very related note, it&#39;s extremely easy for me to be an arm-chair commentator on this stuff, because I am so far removed from it. However, it&#39;s also easy for me to be more objective and, in my not-so-humble opinion, more accurate in my assessment: SM was, quite frequently, drawn into drama-laden discussions, dating back as long as I can remember (long before he became a mod). He&#39;d wait for the drama to unfold (and you know - only one side usually does the initial unfolding; the other side, if it unfolds at all, does so in self defense), then choose sides on the matter. </p>

<p>WRONG. So very, very wrong.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t an asset for a mod. </p>

<p>In the end, he couldn&#39;t stand the heat he generated by getting drawn into the backlash of bpb0&#39;s confessed activities. He chose sides in a personal debate relating thereto and began leveraging &quot;rules&quot; - and it bit him in the backside.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just the direct connection.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also his delusional belief that &quot;a small minority of people&quot; object to rule 10 (which he was using as justification for a lot of removals recently). If you say it often enough in an attempt to downplay dissent (repeat after me: &quot;it&#39;s just a small minority. it&#39;s just a small minority. it&#39;s just a small minority&quot;) you begin to believe it. </p>

<p>Once you believe it, you begin to act accordingly (i.e., &quot;I won&#39;t have very many people hate me for enforcing this rule, because... afterall... they&#39;re just a small minority.&quot; -- a small minority that turned out to be not so small after all, amirite?).</p>

If you follow the links to the post where you commented about &quot;mods should be just like the rest of us&quot; (etc), the third link in the self-post was to the Greenwald article, my augmenting point was that the bpb0 confession (to having manipulated this subreddit) enflamed it. Those were the sources of the tension; you were simply the guy who tripped over the last straw, which created the subsequent total breakdown of sanity.

<p>First of all, it wasn&#39;t shills who were arguing against SovereignMan&#39;s behaviour - this is a ludicrous statement. </p>

<p>Ultimately SovereignMan dragged himself down by being provocative, biased and banning people who disagreed with him. He used Rule 10 to quash dissent.

<p>As I have, so listen. Any rule which impinges on our freedom to write what we think in this subreddit (especially in this subreddit, of all places) has to be very carefully thought out. A kindergarten rule banning name-calling and accusations of &quot;shill&quot; is not justified. We are not children.</p>

<p>Disruptors (be they shills, trolls, &quot;selective-skeptics&quot; or ignorant idiots) are drawn to this subreddit, and they are a massive problem. It is unbelievable that mods should be protecting these people, and that ordinary members should be banned for trying to repel these people. </p>

<p>Rule 10 needs to be redrafted, at the very least. </p>

I support these mods, I always have and that includes SovereignMan. I do not want to see him gone, all I wanted was a discussion about looking into rule 10 more. Now I have that and I am not happy. I have written and asked him to accept an apology, I have not heard back and am assuming that I will not be hearing from him. </p>

<p>I believe our mods shouldn&#39;t be considered any better than us. I believe they should be considered one of us who happens to be able to issue punishments as the community would want them to be done. I don&#39;t believe they are better judges of character than us, or morally superior. I also believe that our mods feel that way as well. I just think that sometimes in the rat race of doing their job(especially in a place as stressful as this sub) that they can forget that sometimes and overstep their bounds. I do not believe this makes them bad mods, I believe it makes them human.</p>

<p>I would like to apologize to the sub for my part in this. This is not what I intended, and I also don&#39;t believe it&#39;s what Sovereign wants. I am still debating whether or not to stick around myself, as this entire ordeal has been rather stressful. No matter what happens, I have faith in everyone here and feel that what we do here is very important. As things intensify in Asia and Europe, and here at home, I think it will be more important than ever that we stick together. Thanks guys, for giving me a great 3 years here. </p>

<p>If we assume that any of these theories are right then it would make sense for the people involved to have an interest in reducing the publicitiy and credibility of these theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but having theories is zero threat to anyone. Why did they go after Snowden? He had facts, documents. He was working with a journalist. There is not an investigative bone in this entire subreddit, there has never been anything that it has provided that has any merit in the real world or politics or whatever. It is a hub of people who agree about things and never do any substantial work to verify them. There is no structural threat coming form unfounded assumptions, which is what makes the supposition that it is a threat worthy of brigading from the government insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it says &#39;misleading or sensationalist headlines will be removed&#39;, and I am pretty sure there are often posts that talk about Sandy Hook being fake, the kids not dying etc. Those aren&#39;t removed, even though they are blatantly misleading manipulations of the truth. The reality is that you use your rules to attack people who disagree with you.</p>

<p>Alsooo. So like, saying, &#39;I am a Shill AMA&#39; is a bannable offense? That&#39;s a good use of moderation.</p>

You guys don&#39;t remove misleading titles when they support your worldview, you clearly stalk bipolar bear, etc. So saying &quot;know the rules and you wont get banned&quot; is pointless, because your rules are a joke used to enforce conformity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate the &quot;troll&quot; and &quot;shill&quot; accusations around here. Rule 10 is badly needed; but I am not sure it can be enforced properly. I guess because of bias or lack of resources. I guess we need to be using the report button and do our own part as users to help the moderation. Please don&#39;t get rid of it, though. Seeing shill/troll in 1 out of every 4 comments is aggravating and serves no place here. Agree to disagree and move on to something else.</p>

<p>Edit: I really believe a code of conduct for moderators would probably help more than anything. Make sure it is highly visible and make sure all mods adhere to the guidelines stated within it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just returning from a 5 month hiatus, read rule 10, sorry if this has been answered repeatedly but does it apply to a post that exposes a consistent history of trolling or a focus on derailing certain topics?</p>

<p>We all know JTRIG is real and them or their counterparts being active on this very sub is a sound logical conclusion. And the perpetrators are getting clever with manipulating account histories and such to appear normal...</p>

<p>I guess after writing this I have no real constructive criticism of rule 10, but I support the idea of altering it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem is that it does create more shit whether someone is a shill or not. Remove it but be aware that it will create more derailed threads and it will be used by people to discredit posts, posters and the sub.</p>

<p>At lease the mods have asked everyone what they want which shows they are willing to have a vote on what we want. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;d like to add that the addition of rule ten did see a change to this sub. It was a shit fest of shill accusations and counter accusation and times when people made sustained accusations against the mods asking them to be removed on other false accusations of people being removed for no apparent reason. </p>

<p>Reasons why people are removed is when there is a clear attempt to undermine discussions, posters and the mods which can be put down to a number of things including the acquisition of a mod position here for nefarious reasons. Since I&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve not seen a single credible reason to remove the rules other than to start off the shit fest again and give ammunition to people who want to create doubt in the sub and the mods. And that&#39;s the reason why i said remove it but be aware of the consequences which will get people then asking for the rules to be reverted to how it is now.</p>

<p>If the mods didn&#39;t have the best intentions, they wouldn&#39;t have asked anyone here what they wanted and opened a line of discussion. That&#39;s been done countless times, mods have been picked by the users and the rules have been changed based on things coming to light and situations that call for the integrity of the sub to be secured.</p>

<p>I realize you&#39;re probably not a new user despite your 1-day-old username. However, if you think that removing this rule (which was originally written by 9000sins to justify banning people who didn&#39;t like him, personally - yes, I was here then, and thoroughly familiar with the circumstances) will lead to &quot;discrediting&quot; this sub (or it&#39;s users/posts) then I think you&#39;ve already missed the boat here. At present, it appears that <a href="http://redd.it/1zfp6n">moderator activity</a> is a bigger problem than anything remotely referenced by this over-reaching rule 10. </p>

<p>(In a nutshell, that removed post said that it appears <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> has become a burial ground for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts. I&#39;d be happy to quote the entire post here if you feel it&#39;s necessary.)</p>

<p>Many people have already taken notice that rule 10 is primarily being used to defend the mods themselves with far more frequency than it is for defending users or the sub in general. Furthermore, as I have stated on several occasions and in various ways - taking on a mod position is volunteering for criticism. Making rules to protect you from that aspect of the job is not only laughable, it&#39;s cowardly. If you don&#39;t have a thick enough skin for the job, you shouldn&#39;t be doing it.</p>

<p>We&#39;re here discussing rule 10, which is being justified to protect against shills, but which is actually being used to protect against criticism (and, from my observation, mostly criticism of mods). Thus, I find defense of the rule and/or it&#39;s use (in context) suspicious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, well... there&#39;s also the fact that this is the internet. The more you try to police internet speech, the less popular you become. I figured this subreddit would know that by now.</p>

<p>So, we start with &quot;troll&quot; and &quot;shill&quot;. What next? If someone&#39;s being a smartass and I call them a smartass, will that become a ban-worthy offense? </p>

<p>The slippery slope began with the contemplation and public discussion of rule 1. After rule 1 was implemented, <strong>eight</strong> more rules were added <strong>and acted upon</strong> <em>without public discussion</em>. Then a ninth was added to defend all of that (rule 10).</p>

<p>I was, an still am, in favor of rule 1. I don&#39;t think anyone should be attacked, directly  or indirectly, based on their skin color, religious beliefs, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also in favor of the ban on facebook links because they inevitably lead to two things: a) revelation of personal information, and b) tracking of user activity by those we (are supposed to) despise.</p>

<p>The rest of the rules are so subject to interpretation and personal bias that they will inevitably lead to misuse (if not abuse). Those activities should be, IMO, regulated by the up/down-voting mechanism in place. And, if the voting mechanism isn&#39;t working, is it really worth the effort to try to save this place? It is, after all, totally dependent upon that process.</p>

<p>The removal of all those &quot;will result in a ban&quot; tag-lines left all of the ban-justifications in place, without improving the public perception aspect -- like lipstick on a pig. It&#39;s still just a list of things the mods will use to justify bans.</p>

<p>Rule 10 has been a point of contention among the users of this subreddit far more frequently than any other, because it leaves so much power-of-interpretation in the hands of the moderators (i.e., This guy is very passionately questioning some of the behavior here, so he must, therefore, be &quot;attacking&quot; us. - LOWER THE BAN HAMMER).</p>

<p>What ever happened to &quot;don&#39;t feed the trolls&quot;? What ever happened to &quot;let the voting do its work&quot;? Oh, right... all the people who held those views <strong>left this subreddit in the dust</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are they 3 day old accounts?  </p>

<p>I had thought that there was some rule that meant an account must be 3 days old to comment here  but then I started noticing <a href="/u/LimitedHangouts">/u/LimitedHangouts</a> who&#39;s been posting and commenting non stop, when his account was but a few hours old.</p>

<p>So, is there really a 3 day old requirement to comment here and, if so, why does this not seem to apply to <em>all</em> accounts here?</p>

<p>I&#39;d prove this to you but he seems to have deleted his extremely suspicious account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rule 10 needs to stay as it is. Accusing people of shills and general disturbance is a very effective tactic to use by shills themselves. </p>

<p>To tell you the truth, SM was my least favorite mod. I had my issues with him, but it wasn&#39;t severe enough to not move past. I could have started the same pitch-fork threads as GoyMeetsWorld made, but I didn&#39;t. Why is it OK to listen to a user with a 25 day old account? He single-handedly created this whole mess over bullshit. People need to do <strong>A LOT</strong> more background checks before taking users at face value. </p>

<p>I think SM should come back as mod. The mod team should invite him back.</p>

<p><a href="/u/go1dfish">/u/go1dfish</a> is the maintainer of several subreddits pertaining to moderator abuse, post removals and the like. He was invited here as a representative on that topic. Check out the list of subs he moderates and you&#39;ll get the picture of what his area of expertise is. He&#39;s not an opinion-poster, rule-interpreter, or any of the otherwise typical images of a mod. He&#39;s an activist technician. I believe he may have even contributed some code-advice to <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> (where he co-mods alongside sunshine-x, the primary creator of that bot).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, I&#39;m one of a few who appreciates all of you, even the #10 rule change. I&#39;m only saying this sub might need at least one more mod (if SM returns) to do what him and Flytape are doing. GoyMeetsWorld should have been banned, and again when creating his new account GoyMeetsWorld_. If not, his thread will be upvoted by trolls and normal users who love the drama. </p>

<p>Also, this might sound off-putting, but I think the mods need to discriminate between users. A fresh account should not have as much leeway as someone who has been a long-time contributor to this sub. It&#39;s bad to treat them with one comb. New users and those with an abusive history need to be banned if they&#39;re destructive, and long-time users need to be pulled aside to discuss their wrongdoing. They&#39;re the cornerstones of this sub, and need to be treated with respect. </p>

<p>What is damaging to this sub isn&#39;t that you can&#39;t accuse shills/trolls of being such, it&#39;s that the mods aren&#39;t recognizing that they even exist. If I was mod, anyone with an account that&#39;s younger than a month would be scared to make the slightest rule-break. The worst thing that happens is that they start over, which isn&#39;t a huge cost anyway. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, I strongly agree with this! And it&#39;s not because a long-time contributor is necessarily wiser or more informed, it&#39;s simply that they have demonstrated they are contributing in good faith. </p>

<p>I am willing to debate anybody if I think they are genuine, and the problem with new accounts (or new contributors) is that so many exhibit disruptive behaviours from the outset. They might be genuine but they are indistinguishable from shills!</p>

<p>I agree with your idea of a probationary period - I think new users should have to &quot;earn their stripes&quot; - to show in the early posts that they are willing to make a genuine contribution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling someone a shill is the same thing. </p>

<p>The simple fact is labels are designed slot someone into a to a widely held but fixed and oversimplified view of a particular type of person that you think he is but have no proof to back it up. It doesnt do any good other than to decrease everyone&#39;s intelligence. </p>

<p>Instead of getting people to look at what the person is saying. Calling someone a name prevents people from thinking clearly about content of the message and instead puts all the focus on the label of the person short circuiting critical analysis and debate.</p>

<p>Nobody has a right to call someone a name, and I support Rule #10 100%</p>

<p>Edit: is it just posts? Or comments too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s both posts and comments. </p>

<p>Originally, the &quot;rules&quot; began with one - racial/ethnic slurs. This was because there were many posts which were blanket canvassing all people of Judaic faith (&quot;the Jews&quot;) as being the great evil-doers of the world. Around this time, David Icke finally &quot;cut through the crap&quot; in one of his presentations and clarified the terminology &quot;Rothschild Zionism&quot;. So, discussion was had, consensus decreed, and the rule was implemented that anti-semitism (&quot;the Jews&quot;) should not be tolerated here. Then, 8 more rules were added within a few short weeks. And, after much drama and many bannings, rule 10 was added to retroactively defend the many bannings. </p>

<p>What is happening now is a post-mess cleanup justification of the slippery slope that happened after rule 1 was implemented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue is  selective enforcement of rules. I was on a thread recently with SM bringing this up. I did not like the fact that certain posts were allowed to remain up when they clearly violated new rules. Then people were being shadowbanned for breaking rules. Selective enforcement was not a good decision. He removed a post of mine for having a few capitalized words in the title, but allowed a post naming suspected users as shills to stay up? He did admit he was wrong. I do not have a solution for these issues. I have no clue what mods deal with here. I will say that I&#39;m less than a year here and I thought everything was working well before the rule change. Even people calling others shill/troll never bothered me. Perhaps because I wasn&#39;t on the recieving end. Now I see this sub is degrading and needs some type of adjustment. I do not think adding more rules and censorship is the right choice. I wish SM would post his story here. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1yjj35/fuck_these_new_rules/">I&#39;ve been posting</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1yk4k1/open_discussion_on_the_rules/">about this</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zeffz/i_questioned_rule_10_6_months_ago_and_my_post_was/">since I first noticed rule 10 last year</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Granted, I was a little heated, because as you can see by my last post, my original post was removed.</p>

<p>So thank you for the sticky.</p>

<p>Anyway, you ask <em>How would you, the users of this sub, like the rule to read?</em></p>

<p>My first instinct is to have the people vote on all the rules, or at least have the moderator discussions on an open forum, so we know what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>It seems we don&#39;t ever know about a change until it slaps us in the face and goes through.</p>

<p>There is rarely open discussion or a chance for the users to give their input. Which is ironic, considering </p>

<blockquote>
<p>our intentions are aimed towards a fairer, more transparent world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for rule 10, get rid of it, thats my vote. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posts that attack this sub, or the users or mods thereof, will be removed. Accusing another user of being a troll or shill is considered an attack. Repeat offenders are subject to a ban.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t even care about the second part there - I&#39;ve never accused anyone of shillery or trollery (sp?). I&#39;m not advocating the removal of rule 10 so I can use racial, religious, ethnic slurs; I don&#39;t do that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m advocating for the removal because &#39;attack&#39; could really mean anything - to me it means dissent. And what happened to free speech? Granted that has nothing to do with this private entity we are using (Reddit), I do find it disturbing that the moderators of a <em>conspiracy</em> subreddit - one that probably is more powerful than we know - would censor in ANY way. It is very very hypocritical - there are no exceptions to free speech.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also advocating the removal because I believe we as a community have the power to remove unwarranted attacks and accusations. And if we don&#39;t we need to realize that there are more of us than there are of them. More level headed theorists than racists, trolls, shills, conspiratards, etc. We need to vote with our mouse. Downvote that which is a slur, an unwarranted accusation, a derailing comment - <em>we have the power</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you think that these merit hired shills to disrupt your subreddit, so many in fact, that you need more mods and rules to combat the influx of people worried about that story coming to light? Do you understand how preposterous that is? I am here to represent people who haven&#39;t drinken the kool-aid and to provide you with some perspective as to why people may enjoy disrupting this place. Because it is so far removed from reality, while having such a pretentious tone, that people cannot help but be annoyed by you. When I was a teenager I believed in this crap, I fell down the rabbit hole. Now that I have an adult, real world education, this place just seems very sad and pathetic. I hate the thought of people coming here and never having their head shaken a little bit. I just wanna remind you guys of the reality of how small an impact or attachment to reality that your posts have in the world of international or domestic politics.

    <div class="md"><p>Total props to the mods for resisting shills and supporting <a href="/u/uncensorship">/u/uncensorship</a>.  Also props for finally putting another Obama-hypocrite sidebar image back up.  (Maybe we will also see another one criticizing the red party soon.)  I feel like these mod wars lead to mushy sidebar images.  Images that call out specific actors are much more effective.  Name names.</p>

<p>To be blunt.  Mods HAVE to be thick-skinned.  All the sane people agree that shills are trying to destabilize any source of serious information, so they can replace it with disinformation.</p>

<p>This sounds like a lunchroom argument to us on the nets, probably mostly westerners and North Americans.  But it&#39;s a matter of life and death to the hundreds of thousands of innocents (many children) that the US military and other goons are killing in the name of &quot;freedom.&quot;</p>

<p>Mods have to be thick-skinned.  There is NO GOOD ALTERNATIVE.  It&#39;s not a preference, it&#39;s just logic.  The shills will find any angle they can to break up a discussion.  If you are not thick-skinned, they will succeed.  Over and over again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as we evolve to better resist the shills, they will devolve to become more violent.  I fear that IRL violence may be coming soon.  Too many pigs have too much money to lose.</p>

<p>For those reasons, I think Rule 10 is a bad idea.  It doesn&#39;t solve the problem, just creates many new ones.  Shills will not go away from any policies or rules, they just devolve and adapt.</p>

More honest users can also fall into the trap of using it to silence unpopular opinions without necessarily consciously understanding that effect. Either way, the accusation plays no productive role, period. </p>

<p>Shills and trolls exist. We know this. But we need better ways of alerting each other to potential subreddit subversion than screaming &#39;shill&#39; at each other indiscriminately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I liken this to texting while driving laws. We already have a law against wreckless operation of a vehicle. Why do we need to get meta.</p>

<p>I made this argument <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1z0zsz/rule_10_this_is_not_an_attack_on_the_sub/">in another thread</a> and my belief is you should delete clearly hateful, or unprovoked personal attacks. My worry is when we start to ban language, we&#39;re on a real slippery slope. If anything, having a no-no list of words seems immature.</p>

<p>&quot;Rule 10 - Posts that attack this sub, or the users or mods thereof, will be removed. Repeat offenders are subject to a ban.&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry to go off topic. But the amount of times they have modified or added to the cell phone laws (In my state at least) they just slightly tweaked them. Now its &quot;phone in one hand,ticket in the other&quot; </p>

<p>Same thing with a new law passed this year in my state. It is now something like a $1,500 to throw your cigarette butts on the ground, so my reps and law makers took the time to write, debate, and pass said law. Why the hell could they not just use the no littering laws already on hand? Why waste more tax money on shit like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And here, the mods don&#39;t seem to understand that banning language sends a message about who we are in this sub. We ban language. I think context makes all the difference in the world, however, it appears the mods don&#39;t understand this. They can police &quot;troll&quot; and &quot;shill&quot; without banning the words outright, and have, as evidenced by this post, hopefully, not being deleted.</p>

<p>Ultimately as long as cool people are here and we can talk about the stuff most dare not mention, I&#39;m fine. But having banned language in the sidebar does bug me a bit. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a great point about the cigarette butts though. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>As I was here before the change and watched everyone who disagreed be called a shill or troll and then bam the whole topic is derailed and a bid drama fight ensues. Making us all look bad here, since everyone lumps us 200k people as one...</p>

<p>But yeah the cigarette thing is ridiculous. The only reason people were not getting in trouble for it before as littering, is cops do not like paperwork and have discretion. Same thing with cell phone use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the number of cases where a poster is accused of being a shill are very few, especially since the mods stepped upto the plate and started banning them faster.</p>

<p>9 times out of ten when i make a shill statement it is as a result of built up frustration after days or weeks of observing the poster spew the .gov line, apologise, distract, derail, diffuse all the usual obvious shit etc etc only to see nothing done by the mods. So i vent, in the, until recently, futile hopes of it being noticed and something finally being done about the account in question.</p>

<p>tldr: remove the troll/shill section of rule 10 and allow us to callout or highlight the offenders as we always have done - and ban them - so we don&#39;t have to keep calling them out week after week day after day</p>

<p>maybe add a definition of shill, such as: paid or unpaid, troll, ignoramus, or sheep, set on distracting and detracting from the exchange of ideas and information</p>

<p>Thats how I read this. Please correct me if I am wrong. How can a community maintain its health while being paranoid? McCarthyism damn it. House Committee on Un-American Activities. This reeks of similar tactics that are used to curb discussion. </p>

<p>Excellent question. Why, are you here? We should be able to accuse a shill of being a shill based on evidence, not the consensus. People are throwing the word around loosely, that when &quot;newbs and people&quot; come this sub, its like someone here talking about &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; to people outside of this type of community. &quot;Shill&quot; has become analogous to what was done to the phrases &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. </p>

<p>What makes you say that? Honest question. I think he has ulterior motives but why do you think that this is traceable to him? Because of the fake anti-semitic posts he made &#39;at 2 am when he was drunk&#39;?</p>

<p>On another note, is <a href="/u/go1dfish">/u/go1dfish</a> even alive? Since he was made a mod, I haven&#39;t seen him do anything. </p>

<p><a href="/u/go1dfish">/u/go1dfish</a> is the maintainer of several subreddits pertaining to moderator abuse, post removals and the like. He was invited here as a representative on that topic. Check out the list of subs he moderates and you&#39;ll get the picture of what his area of expertise is. He&#39;s not an opinion-poster, rule-interpreter, or any of the otherwise typical images of a mod. He&#39;s an activist technician. I believe he may have even contributed some code-advice to <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> (where he co-mods alongside sunshine-x, the primary creator of that bot).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On one hand I do see the mounting problems moderators face, on the other I also understand how moderating standards have fallen due to numerous factors. </p>

<p>Clearly there are problems that need to be addressed. Getting people objective towards the problems rather than pointing fingers to insinuate culprits is a good place to start. </p>

<p>No sub-reddit can afford to lose good people when we know potentially EVIL ones will take his or her place.</p>
