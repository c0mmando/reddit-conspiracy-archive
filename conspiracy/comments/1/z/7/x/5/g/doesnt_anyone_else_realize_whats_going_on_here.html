    <div class="md"><p>Lets think about this topic for one second please.</p>

<p>OP is saying that people with new accounts are <strong>against</strong> rule 10, and the undertone is that these people with new account are shills.</p>

<p><strong>Why would shills be <em>against</em> rule 10?</strong></p>

<p>That makes 0 logical sense whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>Shills would be <em>for</em> rule 10 because rule 10 benefits the shills.</strong></p>

<p>There would be absolutely zero incentive, under any stretch of the imagination for shills to be against a rule that makes it against the rules to call them out on their bullshit.</p>

<p>It seems to me like the OP of this thread is the one that people should start looking sideways at. This is the kind of classic, completely illogical post that conspiratards and &quot;those who shall not be named&quot; upvote in order to bring division to this sub.</p>

<p>Lets use our heads here. Seriously, why does this completely illogical bullshit post even have a score of 40?</p>

<p>Having a new account doesn&#39;t always mean skullduggery.</p>

<p>In this case I believe rule 9 may have been applied to me.</p>

<p>9 Posting links in other subs pointing to specific submissions or comments here is subject to a ban, depending on context.</p>

<p>but I posted no link  and may have been over zealously banned  by an admin with an opposing viewpoint.</p>

<p>re edit, I&#39;m also dumping this account because the handle can be misread as Wizes Ass. rather than Wize Sass  and  it is unduly negative.so I will have an even newer account. Don&#39;t let that bother you too much.</p>

<p>Yes I am. I&#39;m disturbing those few people that don&#39;t want to follow the rules. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve posted and have only been lurking for the past couple months but when I started seeing the crap those few people are trying to pull I had to get a few words in and call attention to it.

Without the rules, things can get real crazy and we&#39;d have everybody calling each other trolls and shills and never actually discussing the topic at hand... just like it was prior to the rule changes. Why do those few people listed insist on being able to go off-topic with name calling etc? Why do they think that&#39;s ok? Because their whole objective is to be able to derail discussions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that. I know they have the shills but it works both ways. Yeah, some(you know who) have more influence than others but you can&#39;t tell me that reddit isn&#39;t full of shit on both sides. </p>

<p>What I said is I would like to see proof. Take you for example. redditor for one day and you have how much karma? Not calling you a shill but those up votes seem a little bit odd... </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, is that it works both ways. If Doxxing was aloud we would know who are getting paid to reddit and those that like to reddit but at the same time everyone&#39;s entitled to some sort anonymity(at least to the general public). </p>

<p>That&#39;s why this place is so flawed. If you took away all the shit here, there might not be enough content left to run this place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sharing truth is a two way street.  I don&#39;t know what point you&#39;re trying to argue here.  Of course anyone of intelligence knows that they must always verify their data.  What they are sold as fact.  This is a given.</p>

<p>However, this DOES NOT negate the large power and censorship abilities that are now wielded by our moderators.  Saying they have no power is 100% incorrect.  You can argue other items, but this is what I&#39;m saying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Futility?  Hardly.  Reddit articles garner more individual views than all news programs combined.  They own the networks entirely, and what we see is exactly what they want us to see.  The last hope is the internet.  And we&#39;ve seen them treat it as such.  They are fighting a losing batttle, yet giving it their all.  This does not indicate that the censorship efforts are, as you say, futile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the sake of this exchange let&#39;s agree that this subreddit is indeed a linchpin of modern discourse for esoteric knowledge.. look around.. It&#39;s still entirely functional. If agents of the state are indeed hunkering down on top of us this very moment with the intention of suppression then theirs is a quite unenviable position to be in. If on the other hand their only purpose is to stoke fear.. Well then you and I are playing right into their hands.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it so hard to believe that so many people don&#39;t like Rule 10 as it is written?? Hell, you&#39;re breaking the damn rule right now so I guess that shows us all how much you think it should be in place as well. It is censorship. There is a difference between asking what someones agenda may be for being here and attacking them. WE KNOW THEY ARE HERE! For Christ&#39;s sake, it&#39;s stickied on the front page!! By banning the users from doing what you yourself have just done we are taking the ability of the 200,000+ to make their own decisions on this matter and placing it into the hands of a few. You called me a shill in this very post and you know what I did?? I said you have the right to do so because I know that my post history is there for anyone to see. I have faith that just because a person calls someone else a shill the majority of the users here will be able to think and investigate for themselves and come to the correct conclusion. Rule 10 is saying that no, in fact, the users here aren&#39;t smart enough to see past a misplaced allegation and think for themselves. It is censorship. The fact of the matter is, every single member that has been around here for a while has probably been called a shill by some ass hat at one point or another. When that happens then you are either a shill and are pissed that you got accused or you&#39;re not and it isn&#39;t going to bother you because you&#39;re history will speak for itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no supportable reason why we should censor anything.  I know most of you can remember back to the time prior to the new rule.  Conversations and debates were handled just fine.</p>

<p>Rule 10, as it stands now, simply protects the shills that we know exist.  We should be enhancing our detection methods to counter their attack.  Shills should not be immune from identification and shaming when they are identified.</p>

<p>Do you recall Reddit before the modified Rule 10?  We are extremely good at self.regulating and self policing.  The greatest comment discussions in the history if the entire sub occurred under the original rules.  Proving the unnecessary nature of the most recent rule implementation.</p>

<p>The &quot;power&quot; they wield is akin to putting a finger in a dike.
There is no power here. Only leaders have power.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s on the first half dozen responses.  If you nerd more, find them yourself.  You clIm the power doesn&#39;t exist, when we both know you&#39;re not correct.  Then you claim that yes, they do have power, but it isn&#39;t that much.  And then try to push that it&#39;s not that bad because &quot;it&#39;s only a little censorship.&quot;  Jesus, what planet to do you come from?  Is English a second language?  Is basic comprehension a second language as well?</p>
