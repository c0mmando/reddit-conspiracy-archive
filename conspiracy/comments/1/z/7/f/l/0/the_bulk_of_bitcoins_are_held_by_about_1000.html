    <div class="md"><p>You just asserted that the US military industrial complex, which I admit has an almost infinite amount of power for all effective purposes. Has the ability to: Break TOR (which they helped invent for their own covert purposes), silence all hackers around the globe including the ones paid by other countries and crime organizations, and hide this purpose in plain sight inside the source code of bitcoin.</p>

<p>That makes them pretty close to omnipotent. Why would they even need a crowdsourced encryption platform at that point? I would rather lean on the idea that an AI has birthed on the web and it is using bitcoin as a way to secure its birth and steal wealth from powerful nations. It seems more plausible.</p>

<p>Also, historically the military is the first to use the advances in microprocessor technology. Why wouldn&#39;t they just pour their funds into making a useable quantum processor? It would totally defeat the purpose of your &#39;crowdsourced encryption cracking&#39; overnight.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Also, if the military wanted to pour money into making better ASICS, if this was their true purpose, they would <strong>DOMINATE</strong> the market. They would smash the current producers into the ground with their multi-billion dollar budgets effectively taking ASIC production from <a href="http://www.butterflylabs.com/monarch/">28-nm processors</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_nanometer">14-nm processors</a> overnight.</p>

<p>The arms race to have quantum processors is already happening and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contingency_plans#SHA-256_is_broken">bitcoin is being hardened against this eventuality by the developers</a>. </p>

<p>Crypto is downright scary precisely because the US Military industrial complex spends so much money on it (I have never seen exact numbers, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_encryption_systems">this gives you a pretty good idea about the effort we put into it</a>). Your theory would be useless in the face of advances in mathematics which would make the cryptography of bitcoin useless. You should update your theory to include the idea that bitcoin mining is used to <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_collision">produce collisions</a> in SHA-2 SHA512</strong>. This would allow you to not only steal bitcoins but crack anything encrypted with SHA-2.</p>

<p>Yet again though, this is effectively useless if someone uses <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/21112/what-is-sha-3-and-why-did-we-change-it">SHA-3</a> SHA512 because it is an entirely different algorithm.</p>

<p>Learn more about crypto before you ask questions which show your lack of knowledge about crypto.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2</strong>: Also a simple google would reveal that <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/17132/is-bitcoin-mining-itself-compromising-the-security-of-sha256">you are not the first person to come up with this idea</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/17132/is-bitcoin-mining-itself-compromising-the-security-of-sha256">second edit actually answered your question</a>. </p>

<p>And it is not my job to go around teaching everyone about crypto. My statement was simply implying that you are spreading disinfo with your lack of research. I don&#39;t fault you for it, quite to the contrary, I am happy to be given the opportunity to let people know how deep this rabbit hole goes. Crypto is huge, scary, and hard to understand. Even reading descriptions of it on wikipedia make seem like you need to pass a Calculus class first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if not for cryptography then possibly something else.  I&#39;d probably be more interested in what you know about it - especially quantum encryption cracking.  factoring is much faster on a quantum computer - and despite your assumptions, I do have more than a cursory knowledge of algorithms and prime factoring.  I&#39;ve also aced differential equations.. second order and all that, so go ahead</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not quite sure what you want me to go ahead about. I already covered quantum encryption cracking above. I asserted that it would render such a crowdsourced application useless as well as SHA256. You would need totally new encryption algorithms to fight it. Quantum computing is a totally separate issue from bitcoin or current encryption schemes.</p>

<p>You can easily account for quantum computing advancements as well by assuming there is a zero-day  vulnerability in SHA256.</p>

<p>My only question to you would be, what purpose would such a conspiracy have? I have already demonstrated it would be more effective to either have a working quantum computer or have better maths to produce collisions in the algorithms. </p>

<p>And why does the military even need such a scheme? The NSA is so effective at using standard security holes to pwn targets that the only possible reason you would need such a program is to do penetration testing on your own encryptions. Sounds like an awful lot of work for such a small return.</p>

<p>Why not just put more funding into maths programs to produce stronger algorithms and layer them? You might be able to break one but you can&#39;t break them all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: If you asked me to make an offshoot theory from yours, I would go down the aforementioned AI route. I would hypothesize that an AI produced bitcoin as a way to secure computing power. Or if you like the US military route, that the military has <em>created</em> an AI and they are using bitcoin as a way to decentralize their creation across the web. I think that the decentralized nature of bitcoin and its value are far more prone to conspiracy theories than a direct use of the hashing power against encryption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would also like to add that I also think it is a tad weird we don&#39;t do anything with the hashing power. I understand that it is to secure our network from attack and all but I still feel like we could be using it to do <em>something</em>. Which is why I go down the AI route, like <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;amp;id=2259">maybe we just don&#39;t really understand what kind of number crunching we are really doing</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do we know it&#39;s not doing something?  I remember the SETI project became very popular at one point.. I was almost certain that what they showed you on the screen had NOTHING to do with what you were using distributed computing to calculate.   </p>

<p>Of course decryption goes on, and that&#39;s why I think it would be natural to question whether distributed computing scams are being used to do this willingly, rather than using zombie machines.   Multiple benefits.  </p>

<p>The other issue with bitcoin, I don&#39;t think AI needs to secure computing power - they really aren&#39;t that anywhere near to sentience except in the most basic definition of the word - self awareness.    It will be very different than our own experience of self-awareness, and we&#39;ll need a new term for AI sentience.   I will be interested in the interactions of AI&#39;s especially as Google/NASA&#39;s D-Wave2 AI project does something like that.  I think we&#39;re a long long way off still.</p>

<p>My statement says there are other better methods of achieving the exact same goal with less cost and effort. The use of the word, &#39;overnight&#39; is hyperbole but I figured that comments like:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m seeing this Bitcoin hoarding argument parroted a lot lately. I see it as mindless negative rhetoric with little merrit. There may be plenty to contemplate about how hoarders effect the market, but let&#39;s remember what hoarders are; merely long term investors.</p>

<p>So, in truth, bitcoin doesn&#39;t really seem to be all that disjointed from &quot;reality&quot; after all.</p>

<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not saying bitcoin isn&#39;t &quot;gamed&quot; (as a system), but gamed (or not), it sure looks la lot like the current global financial system... in terms of value distribution -- which also might be gamed, for all i know ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you have faith in it. I think a lot of people bought at different levels and know when to hold them. They&#39;ve been through storms like this in the past.</p>

<p>There&#39;s many like me who bought in at 100 dollars. We don&#39;t want to see it at 100 again so we&#39;re not going to sell at 100, especially when we&#39;ve seen it go to 1500.</p>

<p>Lots of people bought in at 500. They don&#39;t want to sell at only a 59 dollar profit, they too have seen it go to 1500. So they&#39;re going to ride out the storm.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a long term gamble. You buy in early (and it&#39;s still early, it&#39;s still wild westy as you see with gox) and sit on it. Sit on it for a long time. Every storm goes by the industry gets a little stronger, a little smarter, until finally the shit is so tight it makes Visa look like ginger beer man.</p>
