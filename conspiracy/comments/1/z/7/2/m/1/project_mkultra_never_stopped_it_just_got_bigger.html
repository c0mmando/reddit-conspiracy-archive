       So I am a big acid freak. Love the stuff follow just about every story about it and one day I heard of Project MKultra where there were some test done with LSD to control people or brainwash them. Read more here

       Now fast foreword to when I started using reddit and found the conspiracy section I was reading and I saw a story about the 1960'S SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnkg-yCPryE">

       that got me thinking OMFG the project never stopped it just got bigger. Think about it, there a BILLIONS if not TRILLIONS spend in advertizements which most focus on sound, visual, and stimulus of parts of the brain &amp; body. The old saying sex sells..... well why is that b/c sex feels good and releases endorphins so when you see images of sex you get all warm and fuzzy inside. Well I'm sure getting people on a mass scale with LSD would be a little hard and really uncontrolled but give them that feeling they get with sex on TV, radio, in food and God knows how else its a lot simpler. Lets face it the media even plays with our emotions. You hear a story of a little old lady getting raped and murder or a kid even know you know the outcome is not going to be good you still watch, Or when you hear a story of super cop saving a bus full of handicap children you get all warm and fuzzy. So why does the government want us dumb and spending money? Your a slave to the system, also I believe that they withhold knowledge from us. The war on drugs was a way to kill open mindedness. They give us 30 minutes for lunch so we are forced to eat fast food which makes us fat and depressed which gets us thinking of our bills and the dead end job we all work. Then you have to get a credit card which is like the thought to most people its unlimited money so you swipe away get nailed with late fees and 30% interest on the money you used. This is making you work harder longer wearing you down so you dont have time to look for answers. Keep the People poor dumb and in debt they own you. Sorry if this is everywhere I just came down off a great mushroom trip. So I want to hear what everyone else thinks?

       We are all pawns on a chess board. Everything is meant to make us feel certain ways and want certain things. Until you realize first that you're a slave and second that you aren't in control of your desires you will never be free.

       You're just at the tip of the iceberg, friend. The folks who pull the strings realized very early on that the people who control housing, food, clean water, and energy, control the masses. Unrest comes when people start growing their own food, installing solar panels, digging their own wells.

        Victor Marchetti, author and 14-year CIA veteran, stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducted disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MKUltra was abandoned a "cover story."[90][91]

       If you think posting on a conspiracy sub makes you a "nut case" then you're simply feeding the negative stereotype. If you want to do your psychedelic drugs, fine. Enjoy them, but don't flaunt them and make us look less credible than we already do.

       Congratulations btw; but to the unappreciative type, this destroys credibility.

       So what you're saying is that Monsanto is engineering LSD into crops?

       Thirty minute lunch? Where? Regardless, do you know how long it takes to microwave a cup of stew I made for myself at home? It's a big cup so 4 minutes. No fast food needed (or eaten!).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's some free thinking that didn't get taken over by the system, right? I have the ability to make whatever I want for my lunch rather than eat the proscribed
       <em>
        Big Mac, Filet o' Fish, Quarter Pounder, French Fries, Icy Coke, Thick Shake, Sundae, and Apple Pie!
       </em>

       Woah! What just happened there?
