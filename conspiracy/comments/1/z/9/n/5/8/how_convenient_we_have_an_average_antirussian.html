<p>Baseline budgeting is an accounting method the United States Federal Government uses to develop a budget for future years. Baseline budgeting uses current spending levels as the &quot;baseline&quot; for establishing future funding requirements and assumes future budgets will equal the current budget times the inflation rate times the population growth rate.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know of any subs that consider simply linking to be brigading, especially when they make the link NP. I believe they have to actively call for vote-manipulation (as in, putting a comment inviting people to down vote) for it to be brigading.</p>

<p>Also, I disagree with the idea that they&#39;re &quot;dedicated to making fun of this sub&quot;.  They&#39;re more dedicated to making fun of conspiracy theorists, rather than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> specifically. Most of the time whenever I see their front page, it&#39;s links from all over the web. One in ten or two in ten of the links there are from here.</p>

<p>I doubt it will happen often, but if they start noticing some people are inordinately or unordinarly good at predicting large scale geopolitical events that have clandestine origins then maybe they will suspect that if <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> pays them they&#39;re raking the cash cause that person should be suspected of working for an alphabet soup agency. </p>

<p>Were you using it? On this subreddit? </p>

<p>If they continue to throw it away and you bring it back to them do they get upset and distressed? Let&#39;s stop playing fetch with them, see if they notice. Perhaps they&#39;ll even want to play again when they miss it so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of the opinion that it&#39;s difficult nigh impossible for the US state dept to provoke a mass uprising.  I live in Cairo, saw the revolution(s) here and understand the complexity.  Euromaidan is likely legit, 95-99% legit.</p>

<p>However, it also doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that a well placed intelligence agency, like what the US has, would easily be able to track and somewhat predict the escalation of such events, and even push them along somewhat via public opinion in the West.</p>

<p>The media game that&#39;s being played is pretty obvious to me.  And yes I do think it is timed to get people worked up anti-Russia, knowing that some kind of confrontation will happen over Ukraine.  </p>

<p>And yes the government does influence media, it was even made 100% legal last year for the CIA to use mass media for propaganda purposes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I got a question, and it&#39;s a real, I wanna know, kinda question.</p>

<p>About a year ago or so, I saw info saying russian troops were being stationed here in the usa to do what fema told em, which might not exactly be exceptable by our own brave and free military.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re subverting Russia.</p>

<p>So if the elite trust the Russians enough to use thier army, but not so much as to make a push to take over another province of thier nation?</p>

<p>Idk, seems inconsitant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sHow much is this Snowden related? I think on a certain level the US doesn&#39;t give much of a shit about Ukraine as it does about protecting its NSA crown jewels. Even if we do nothing for Ukraine, Snowden being protected by the &quot;tyrant&quot; Putin, makes him seem more treasonous, and by extension, those associated with him. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s only one dimension. I know we want to sell natural gas to China and Europe as well.</p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s been a while since they left authoritarian collectivism but it&#39;s only been like a few decades, you would throw away progress toward peace because you think that in this precarious situation between two nations worlds apart culturally in the buffer state where Asia meets Europe (the theatre of two world wars in the past) what we need is <em>rising tensions</em> from what seems to be a group-think action designed to incite the population of one country against their leaders?</p>

<p>I like it, but I wasn&#39;t planning on buying anything from Russia today anyways. </p>

<p><code>think about it twice</code> I said <strong>Russia Today</strong>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the truth hurts. The denial is strong out there. I posted a comment in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> basically replying to someone saying that they felt all tinfoily for thinking that some comments were coming from the likes of the NSA. I said, it&#39;s not tinfoil hat paranoia, it&#39;s true. And then I got 3 or 4 comments asking for sources and questioning if I was trying to be sarcastic.</p>

<p>Denial is strong, strong, strong. </p>
