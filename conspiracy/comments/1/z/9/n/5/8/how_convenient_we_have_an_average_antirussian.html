       Usually when they talk about 'cuts' they really mean cuts on increases in spending. So spending is still going up, just not at the same rate.

       None of the 'cuts' talked about by MSM actually decrease defense spending.  Spending is still going up, just not
       <em>
        as fast
       </em>
       as the MIC would like it to.  Only in DC can an increase in spending be considered a cut.

       <p>
        Baseline budgeting is an accounting method the United States Federal Government uses to develop a budget for future years. Baseline budgeting uses current spending levels as the "baseline" for establishing future funding requirements and assumes future budgets will equal the current budget times the inflation rate times the population growth rate.

       I thought it can be considered vote-brigrading in some subreddits? I thought some even ban if users flood votes from direct links?  I'm not for banning personally, but it seems to be a good thing to be aware of the possibility that a group that is dedicated to making fun of this subreddit is trying to influence opinions here by mobilizing voters?

       It makes vote-brigading possible, certainly. But that doesn't mean it's a foregone conclusion. Like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , most people in
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       are probably
       <em>
        too lazy
       </em>
       to follow the links of the stories they upvote, and probably don't even visit their own comments section.

        I thought it can be considered vote-brigrading in some subreddits?

      <p>
       I don't know of any subs that consider simply linking to be brigading, especially when they make the link NP. I believe they have to actively call for vote-manipulation (as in, putting a comment inviting people to down vote) for it to be brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I disagree with the idea that they're "dedicated to making fun of this sub".  They're more dedicated to making fun of conspiracy theorists, rather than
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       specifically. Most of the time whenever I see their front page, it's links from all over the web. One in ten or two in ten of the links there are from here.

       It has been more like that in the immediate short-term, since this subreddit has been particularly hectic and panicked more recently, but generally you'll see Facebook postings, images from the net in general and a mix of sources.

       Is the post I made here showing the NSA blatantly operating on the front page of reddit "vote brigading"? I don't want my account banned, though I bet it will once the agents notice I'm calling them out.

       Because the truth hurts. The denial is strong out there. I posted a comment in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       basically replying to someone saying that they felt all tinfoily for thinking that some comments were coming from the likes of the NSA. I said, it's not tinfoil hat paranoia, it's true. And then I got 3 or 4 comments asking for sources and questioning if I was trying to be sarcastic.

       I'm not really capable of being so terribly ignorant as to not know how the government and corporations are spying on me and limiting my freedoms. But that's just me.

       When another person's view is wrapped up in denial of reality, I don't have to waste my time empathizing. People just don't want to believe that the US government, and the "deep state," is working against their basic human rights. They buy into the propaganda of the American Dream (whatever the fuck that really is).

       But they should just trust what you say without question?  I don't get any of my info from gov sources and know how to use google, yet I come to a completely different conclusion than you do, which is why it's important to cite your sources so we can all see the exact claim you are making, that way we are at least on the same page.

       It's interesting you should say that, because what would happen if conspiracy theorist's dreams came true and they finally got put in charge of the world?

       I doubt it will happen often, but if they start noticing some people are inordinately or unordinarly good at predicting large scale geopolitical events that have clandestine origins then maybe they will suspect that if

       If they continue to throw it away and you bring it back to them do they get upset and distressed? Let's stop playing fetch with them, see if they notice. Perhaps they'll even want to play again when they miss it so much.

       I'm of the opinion that it's difficult nigh impossible for the US state dept to provoke a mass uprising.  I live in Cairo, saw the revolution(s) here and understand the complexity.  Euromaidan is likely legit, 95-99% legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it also doesn't take a genius to figure out that a well placed intelligence agency, like what the US has, would easily be able to track and somewhat predict the escalation of such events, and even push them along somewhat via public opinion in the West.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media game that's being played is pretty obvious to me.  And yes I do think it is timed to get people worked up anti-Russia, knowing that some kind of confrontation will happen over Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes the government does influence media, it was even made 100% legal last year for the CIA to use mass media for propaganda purposes.

       One of those didn't even get an eyelid batted, the other one has everyone flipping their shit. That's how it happens sometimes, there's no reason to invade Ukraine, in the publics mind, therefore it must be done discretely. When you can come up with a boogeyman or some threat, then you can bomb the place and replace the government.

       Okay, I got a question, and it's a real, I wanna know, kinda question.
      </p>
      <p>
       About a year ago or so, I saw info saying russian troops were being stationed here in the usa to do what fema told em, which might not exactly be exceptable by our own brave and free military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we're subverting Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the elite trust the Russians enough to use thier army, but not so much as to make a push to take over another province of thier nation?

       I remember when we were castigating Russia over their stance on gays shortly before and during the Olympics (which for the record, I do find deplorable).
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Uganda murders gays--not any outcry here. Saudi Arabia bans women from driving. Nothing. The human rights violations pile up, but the only difference is politics.

       I love how it's gotten to the point where every significant world event is a conspiracy to this thread. If it makes the news you can bet it'll be called a conspiracy. The level of evidence required has literally degenerated to a guy going "Hey everyone! Isn't this odd!? Must be those evil people too!"

       Any move to devalue the sovereignty of a nation should be decried here! I'm growing more and more disaffected with this place daily. It's as much a circlejerk as news or worldnews just in opposite directions.

       sHow much is this Snowden related? I think on a certain level the US doesn't give much of a shit about Ukraine as it does about protecting its NSA crown jewels. Even if we do nothing for Ukraine, Snowden being protected by the "tyrant" Putin, makes him seem more treasonous, and by extension, those associated with him. I'm sure that's only one dimension. I know we want to sell natural gas to China and Europe as well.

       I say we hurt Russia economically, let's start boycotting anything Russian. Can we boycott Russians from buying anything in EU and USA? Can we also block access of Russians to most shopping sites in EUROPE and USA, can we ask major companies to block russian user access to western websites, let's find a way to fight back!

       I mean it's been a while since they left authoritarian collectivism but it's only been like a few decades, you would throw away progress toward peace because you think that in this precarious situation between two nations worlds apart culturally in the buffer state where Asia meets Europe (the theatre of two world wars in the past) what we need is
       <em>
        rising tensions

       Russians are very cruel in their nature, they are very blatant people, I have known enough Russians in my life from that part of the world to see how they treat people when they don't get their way, besides i am only for a temporary boycott till they learn to respect another's country sovereignty
