The bank apparently was running out of cash...running. out. of. cash. When the teller announced that, people were like wtf? Never seen that amount of people visibly frustrated inside of a bank and never heard that a bank was close to running out of cash. Talking to some people while waiting in line and they told me they tried other bank of Americas and it was the same situation. Crazy. For some reason it reminded me of all those bankers commiting suicide around the world. Just wanted to share!</p>

<p>Bank holidays are just another step. I know several banks have begun limiting cash withdrawals, charging a fee for using a human teller (which would be necessary to withdraw cash &gt;$500 or to close an account), and other practices designed to discourage people from accessing their money.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that banks don&#39;t just print money on site, right? Of course a bank can run out of cash if an unexpectedly large amount of people decide to withdraw money in any given day.

    <div class="md"><p>A more discerning mind would understand the parallels to the Great Depression. Fractional Reserve lending is like Musical Chairs. There aren&#39;t enough dollars in the bank for everybody who is presumably keeping dollars in it. If everybody decides to play Musical Chairs at once, this is what happens. The OP posted this because people are panicked about the setting of the international stage, and are therefore hastily withdrawing more money than banks have available. When this happens, people get angry and there is even more pressure on the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a <em>huge</em> difference between an individual bank branch running out of currency and a bank going insolvent. Among many other things, we have a whole system that was put in place after the Great Depression to deal gracefully with bank insolvency. Banks, typically small local ones, go insolvent every week. Nobody ever notices because the banking system handles it so well.</p>
