       It's so shamefully obvious about why the rule was modified.  It certainly isn't to protect the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I think the rule is good because harassment and accusations of being a shill/troll is a tactic that can be used by shills themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what people think of me personally, and some might suspect me of being a shill, but I've been under heavy attack a while back from one user. It made me run up the walls. I think he was either an overly paranoid person or an actual shill who tried to discredit me. It showed me that it's a very effective tactic to disrupt this subreddit if it was used.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are undoubtedly shills in this sub, but many of them don't break the rules, which makes the moderators powerless to do anything. From my understanding, you can still write a summary of their accounts to imply that they're shills and that IMO is enough to make people not take them seriously. If their account has existed a short while, highlight it. If they are apologetic about one issue in particular, mention it. Simply Calling them "shills" wont help, and I've made that mistake several times in the past to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe you think I'm a shill, so disregard this message in that case.

       I've had the exact same thing happen to me a couple of times, and I eventually came to the point you made: you don't know if they are overly paranoid person acting as an individual or a shill themselves with an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       My gut feeling is that some are shills trying to make sure the comment section of a given article, where people can discuss / share and rally, is full of infighting and tail chasing. Callings names and pointing fingers is an excellent way to do that.

       Maybe, but either way it can be extremely disruptive. Especially when active, non-shill users are being targeted.

       I appreciate what you're saying and I have seen it. Great comment. I get what you're saying entirely. And I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really the idea of banning language; any language. I think context is what's important. I think the moderators have done a really great job lately and for me, it's more about the rules and what's right. We all support free speech. I'd prefer my favorite sub not be in the business of banning language.
      </p>
      <p>
       I propose we have an unspoken rule with careful moderation, which appears to be what's happening. I think escalation is the key. I like being able to suggest that when I suspect it. I think escalation will reveal our enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be the most civil sub without banning language. And I do thank the moderators. If you aren't getting paid, you should be. We all know plenty are.

       When part of the 5 eyes strategy is to call people shills and trolls to draw attention away from the subject at hand and toward their self perpetuating flame war then what exactly is the point of allowing it to stand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you want the comments section of a post about vaccines or GMO crops to turn into hundreds of comments about who is a shill and who is a troll?
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule is solid, calling someone a shill or a troll is a personal attack and personal attacks are not allowed here.   the community improved significantly when we started enforcing the "no personal attacks" rule and the only thing missing was conspiracy theorists and people who claim to be conspiracy theorist calling everyone a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those days are over.  Personal attacks are not allowed here.  Intellectual discussion will live on.

       I think the most important thing you said is things changed "when we started enforcing" the rule. However, my point is that the rule was very clear before. At any point, the rules could have been enforced and that wasn't happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree. It has gotten way better here and I think the new mods all deserve some gratitude for what you're trying to do. But the idea of banning language, to me, seems somewhat dangerous and maybe even a bit childish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being gay, every time I hear someone say, "fag" or "that's gay," I have to determine whether or not it's go time. If I flip out on everyone using those words, either I'd be really angry at everyone around me, or people would be afraid to say anything. Civility can not be enforced by banning a word or two. Context means a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, this post was somewhat of an experiment to see if the words are autobanned, or if you mods get some sort of notification when words come in. I'm not 100% familiar with the reddit engine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sort of don't feel as proud of this being "my" sub knowing we ban words. But I appreciate your comment and the fact that ya'all are really doing a great job.

       Well it wasn't on the sidebar before, but common sense would tell you that calling someone a shill or a troll is no different than calling them an asshole or a fag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its name calling thus its a personal attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't autoban words.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason we added Shill and troll specifically to the rule 10 is because we kept encountering this huge meta debate, "is shill and troll a personal attack?"  yes, yes it is. And calling people such serves the same purpose as calling someone a retard or a fag.  It starts a flame war and diverts attention away from the topic at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we won't be removing it from the sidebar.  Shill and Troll will continue to be considered a personal attack.  Context is very important and sometimes, be it rarely, the mods misunderstand the context.  If you're banned because of such a misunderstanding then we have an appeal process that you can initiate via mod mail.  I understand how it could be frustrating to be banned over a misunderstanding and forced to argue your case, but its more frustrating when someone is in the conspiracy subreddit talking about conspiracies and they get attacked for talking about conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I would love it if humans were not greedy and deceptive and we could just have a global anarchy where everyone just miraculously gets along and nobody steals anyone else's piggy bank.  Where police and military weren't ever invented because society never had a need to imagine them into existence.  Where we weren't burning surplus food in the USA while people in Africa were starving to death and where groups didn't form to take advantage of strength in numbers so they can take from individuals what they didn't earn.
      </p>
      <p>
       unfortunately, people suck.  We need rules to have order, order to have peace, peace to have prosperity and prosperity to have happiness.  Thus is our pursuit.  Good luck everyone.

       Exactly how is one to discern whether it was a joke or an attack? There's no "/s" there. There's no "just kidding' there. There's no smiley face there.

       I know the rule. I was simply giving OP and his supporters an example of what they were really asking for. If they've been reporting my comments then that's a good indication of how hypocritical they are. They want to be able to call others trolls and shills but when the shoe is on the other foot...

       You would start with their post history. I have found quite a few Pro-Israel accounts that only post pro-Israel topics and comments. Anyone who spends a significant amount of time posting misinformation and lies is a shill in my book. I would also automatically ban anyone who posts in Conspiritard, since its a downvote brigade. Lots of places like /worldnews shadowbans anyone who links to a /worldnews story.

       We've had a little army of pro-Israel shills here for as long as I've been using this sub (hint: this isn't my first account here). Every time anyone posts a story critical of Israel, out they come from under their rocks with the same old JIDF talking points. I'm sorry to say, we also have at least one mod who is working for the JIDF.
