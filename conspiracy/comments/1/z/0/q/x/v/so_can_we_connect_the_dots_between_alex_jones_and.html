       First of all, who is "us"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, that episode had 2 million live viewers and afterwards sunk Morgan like a torpedoed ship, as I expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       People might have not appreciated Jones's antics, but I knew exactly what he was doing. He didn't want to get caught in Morgan's web of control. You can see in the entire last third of the interview Morgan using nothing but use of semi-autos in the Newtown and Aurora shootings to justify gun confiscation. Fortunately, Jones wouldn't have any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones is way too much for me, and I have a difficult time watching anything from Infowards, but this interview should be appreciated with pride rather than scorn. And I have no issue with people who support Jones.

       During that interview I was talking about the interview and the subject of gun control with Facebook friends and they pointed out the fact that he was acting like a loony and how he shouldn't own guns and how gun owners, or as they said "gun nuts", were not mentally stable enough to be trusted with fire arms.
       <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-FVQgLkbLjQ">
        I don't think he brought piers down at all, his interview turned into incoherent babbling, this is the interview I think brought piers down.

       honestly, I think that was the worst debate I have ever seen, and in end Alex Jones would go on to challenge piers to.fight in a boxing ring wearing the flag of his country, which we all know is called the jolly Roger.

       I don't know where you've been during the last week, but it's pretty evident that Morgan lost his job because of the

       . You can think whatever you want about it, and weigh in your facebook friends' opinions all you want, but Jones undoubtedly destroyed his ass. And you need to make a distinction between "acting like a loony" by screaming and overtaking the interview, or because he is pro guns.

       <p>
        “Look, I am a British guy debating American cultural issues, including guns, which has been very polarizing, and there is no doubt that there are many in the audience who are tired of me banging on about it,”...

       Morgan rode his anti-gun hobby-horse into the lake. He got what he asked for, and what he deserved. Alex Jones probably helped him along, but there were many other pro-gun advocates who made Morgan look like a fool on his own show.

       None of them received a fraction of the attention Jones created. We can argue about the cause all day, but I'm personally convinced that Jones's antics was the straw.

       You should watch the interview he did with Jessie Ventura in front of a live audience. Big mistake on Morgan's part. Jessie at one point asked how many agreed with Morgan. Not a peep from the audience. Then he asked how many agreed with him. Huge applause. Total Piers Morgan humiliation.

       Do you think Alex Jones was the only pro gun advocate to go on his show? All of them destroyed him because his logic on gun control is completely warped. Out of all the people on his show I think Alex Jones did the worst job of debating facts. Facts destroyed piers, not screaming. Truth does not have to be screamed to be heard and to be powerful.

       If that's the case, we would have justice for 9/11 a long time ago. Most people are more emotionally driven than rationally.

       Alex Jones' only job is to look like a clown so when people think of a conspiracy theorist they think of him, the crazy lunatic world is ending every day conspiracy theorist tin foil hat wearing Alex Jones. you wonder why people look down upon conspiracy theorists? it's because of people like him.

       That's good, because I don't accept that term, and neither should you.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, I can't stand Alex Jones. My biggest issue with him is the phony merchandise he sells. But the Piers Morgan debate was a thing of beauty, which I like to re-watch once in a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe he is controlled. If he has interests in not going after Israel because he has a Jewish wife, then that's that. He is a man, and every man is fallible. Just as trying to take over that gun controlled rally you linked to, which I think was a mistake and unintentional from his part. Too much ego.

       I will admit, I enjoyed that interview, I could not stop laughing. It was hilarious, but it was not a debate at all. A debate doesn't end in a fist fight challenge. Again, making a terrible representation of gun owners. 
His ego is what allows him to be the center of attention, and from their he has the power to ruin what should have been a good protest.

       Exactly and I think we have a strong piece of evidence now of his intents and I feel like we all constantly argue over what to think of the guy here all the while he is giving us a bad reputation and groups like r/conspiratard spread this bad reputation hard. We are constantly discredited because we are browse r/conspiracy and therefore must listen to that asshat Alex Jones
