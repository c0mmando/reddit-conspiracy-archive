<p>Well, the tricks i&#39;ve noticed so far, in the few stories that are coming out: concentrating on the conflict with Anonymous, and the somewhat esoteric concept of manipulating online discussions, while ignoring the character assassination/facebook hacking stuff.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is no way to make this look good, that&#39;s why it&#39;s not being spun in the news. Spin, lie or completely ignore it because bringing it up has all the questions that come with it. To be fair to media, a lot of the Snowden stuff has been covered because they had to but the silence on this one speaks volumes. I&#39;ve been in conflict with myself asking if it&#39;s just my bias making me think that this story in particular deserves more coverage than the others but it&#39;s not that.</p>

<p>The implications from the details of the slides are wide ranging and far more sinister than just being spied on. It&#39;s an escalation from just being observed to covert engagement and it really is far more sinister than just being spied on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. </p>

<p>I said something similar to my coworker. You can defend the mass spying. It&#39;s still bullshit, but you can defend it as being in the interests of the public good. This is indefensible. It shows without a doubt they don&#39;t deserve our trust with this kind of power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make an incredible point and a very valid connection.</p>

<p>People seem to forget that there was absolutely no evidence pointing to the Tsarnaev brothers but, literally one moment to the next, thousands of people somehow became convinced that they did it from a picture of them attending the Boston Marathon.</p>

<p>This was before the backpack shot, where the younger brother was seen running without one. A photo that is validly criticized as being photoshopped, since the bricks behind him (in the exact spot where the backpack would be) look to have been made with the clone stamp tool.</p>

<p>And for some reason, the idea went viral that &quot;reddit detectives&quot; somehow overstepped and botched the case because everyone was trying to figure out who did it. </p>

<p>But when you look at the facts, this idea is bogus. The people on the internet were collectively working together and making much better connections and observations than the media at the time who didn&#39;t seem to know jack-shit and continued to scramble for an explanation.</p>

<p>Cue a sudden war cry of &quot;Stop everybody, you are all wrong, these guys over here did it&quot; and the social media snowball that followed successfully convinced everyone that the Tsarnaev brothers were guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (without any proof backing that claim up) and that everyone on the internet should be ashamed that they were trying to help or figure it out themselves.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe the people who started spreading the idea that it was the guy who died (I forgot his name but he was apparently accused but was already dead), maybe that idea was intentionally spread by government disinformation agents in order to humiliate everyone into thinking they were doing something wrong by trying to figure out the Boston bombing.</p>

<p>Which is crazy because anyone who is paying attention knows that the internet in the last 5 years has grown into a device that is far better than any news source or media outlet. Every natural disaster for the last 3 years has been successfully managed by people on the internet getting together to help others with up-to-the-second updates and numerous others advances, like posting survivor information or tips for people still in harm&#39;s way.</p>

<p>I think you make a great point. Knowing what we now know (for a fact) about agents with an agenda online, the connection between the Boston bombing and the reaction of the internet is undeniable.</p>

<p>I keep telling people now and I was even telling people when it was happening: What proof do we have that these guys did it other then the seemingly random turn of events that suddenly pointed at them, the media immediately jumping onto that theory, and then the brothers being scared shitless and trying to get the fuck out of dodge. </p>

<p>Imagine if you came home from the bombing and saw that the entire internet was accusing you? Most people would have reacted the same way, guilty or not.</p>

<p>And think about it, the media immediately picked up on the picture of the brothers at the race. Immediately. Almost at the exact same time the internet opinions had their sudden shift.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. I think one of the reasons it&#39;s difficult to broadcast this information is because the truth of it sounds so over-the-top that it&#39;s easily dismissed or blocked out. I think a gentle approach combined with solid evidence front and center (like the ppt slides) would be more effective. Sensationalism does enrapture people, but I think people need a tender coaxing in order to be okay with knowing about this shit. Maybe a certain slide of the ppt could be a meme? Something like, &quot;Government instructions to control your thoughts&quot; (it&#39;s hard to not make it sound crazy...) &quot;go to (such and such easily memorable web site) for more info&quot;</p>

<p>I also think this type of advertisement should not be limited to online. What if we put up the same thing, photocopied on 8.5x11 (or A4 for non-Americans), posted in public places? Libraries, street posts, etc.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They want to embarrass or discredit you amongst your peer group, maybe a photo/s that changes your friend&#39;s impression of you and your values.</p></li>

<p>One man is a martyr.  A million is a revolution of consciousness and path.  Tell me, what is everyone waiting for?</p>

So long as it is not us personally.  No one wants to make the sacrifices.  I don&#39;t think it is a hard point to understand.  Again, I INCLUDE myself in that criticism.

    <div class="md"><p>Being scared is not a solution either.  Rocking the boat is never pretty, and yes, some will pay a much heavier price.  Can you not see though, that worrying about what &quot;they&quot; think or do is why we are in this boat?  We are all to scared to really go the distance or what that even means.</p>

<p>It saddens me deeply.  &quot;They&quot; and their system have that much control.  You and I and everyone else on this board know &quot;they&quot; control all, yet we all buy right back into the system because of our fears.  Fear of change.  Fear of the unknown.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what that means.</p>

<p>I used to be very involved in &quot;conspiracy&quot; sites, but as the lack of anything but bitching has broken me, I have just moved to occasionally visiting Reddit.  You happened to catch me on a night (my Friday) after getting off work.  I might check this again, after bed, in a day or two.  </p>

<p>The suspicion is mutual.  Either you are a)  A government tool.  b)  Judging by your terminology, a well meaning, but very misguided new ager/spiritualist.  These types confuse others truths with negativism, as in a disagreement with a personal view = not in line with spiritual energy.  This is a very common, and sad mistake.</p>

<p>I hope I&#39;m wrong and I&#39;ll do what I can to inform others around me and try to be positive and continue to speak what I believe to be truth without fear or judgement.

<p>and snowden? this guy is a GHOST.. his background of who he is, is almost as shady as obama</p>

<p>are you feeling ok?</p>

<p>yup lots of good ol&#39; infighting on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to start an argument with you, can&#39;t we all just get along like the old days? We used to be more of a band of brothers before JTRIG and its ilk got to work.</p>

<p>Mission[edit]</p>

<p>The scope of the <strong>JTRIG&#39;s mission includes using &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to “destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt” enemies by “discrediting” them, planting misinformation and shutting down their communications.[2]</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being scared is not a solution either.  Rocking the boat is never pretty, and yes, some will pay a much heavier price.  Can you not see though, that worrying about what &quot;they&quot; think or do is why we are in this boat?  We are all to scared to really go the distance or what that even means.</p>

<p>It saddens me deeply.  &quot;They&quot; and their system have that much control.  You and I and everyone else on this board know &quot;they&quot; control all, yet we all buy right back into the system because of our fears.  Fear of change.  Fear of the unknown.  </p>

<p>Who&#39;s life are we all leading, who are we all trying to impress with our great knowledge and inaction?</p>
