        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This isn&#39;t your typical UFO conspiracy theory. While I don&#39;t intend to diminish the importance of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, especially with regards to the explanation of the UFO phenomenon, for now we&#39;re going to concern ourselves with another possible explanation for many early UFO sightings, a very <em>human</em> explanation...</p>

<p>That being said, records of UFO sightings <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reported_UFO_sightings">go back thousands of years.</a></p>

<p>When Alexander the Great began to attack the city of Tyre, five “flying shields” were recorded by both the attacking and defending forces. One of the “shields” shot a “lightning bolt” and brought down the walls, and Alexander&#39;s army stormed and captured the city.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vallee">Jacques Vallée</a>, a well-known ufologist, has come across many unusual incidents in the distant past, including a cigar-shaped UFO that was observed to change course in Europe in 1034 and again in Japan in 1235 when General Yoritsume and others observed a dazzling display of objects in the sky, performing incredible maneuvers. </p>

<p>As a result of this sighting in Japan, Yoritsume initiated one of the first recorded scientific investigations of the UFO phenomenon, predating the US Air Force&#39;s own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Bluebook">Project Blue Book</a> by more than 700 years.</p>

<p>The following is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Covert-Wars-Breakaway-Civilizations-Celestial/dp/1935487833/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394146702&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=covert+wars+breakaway+civilizations">Covert Wars and Breakaway Civilizations</a> by <a href="/r/josephpfarrell">Joseph P. Farrell</a>, from which much of this research is derived:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1347-1350, Western Europe experienced the Black Death, the massive epidemic of bubonic plague that was, according to some, brought from the Orient by the trading ships of Venice and Genoa, which has fueled speculations and conspiracy theories by some that this was the deliberate act of a corrupt financial oligarchy already touting the idea that the world was over-populated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, certain accounts suggest an even more sinister scenario, and I quote from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/UFOs-Wartime-What-They-Didnt/dp/0425240118/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394146612&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ufos+in+wartime+what+they+didn%27t+want+you+to+know">UFOs in Wartime</a> by Mack Maloney:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were persistent reports from the time of strange flying objects moving low through the sky, leaving a trail of suspicious waving vapor in their wake. Wherever and whenever these objects were seen, the plague would soon break out in that area. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1561_celestial_phenomenon_over_Nuremberg">1561 phenomenon over Nuremberg</a> which has been suggested by many to have been a well-documented UFO sighting.</p>

<p>By the time of the industrial revolution and the invention of the telegraph and then telephone, not only did it become possible to instantaneously transmit information, but it also created the potential of the technological emulation of these sightings. According to Farrell:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing so signaled this shift as the outbreak in the USA and Europe of the great “airship” mystery of the post-Civil War period of the second half of the 19th century. </p>

<p>Most people tend to dismiss the nineteenth century airship mystery as being related to the question and culture of a “breakaway civilization,” but as will now be seen, it is deeply related to the question of its historical origins and the possible motivations behind it. The sightings that broke out in the USA, especially during the 1890s, raised the public awareness of the UFO for the first time, even though these sightings were not at that time called UFOs. </p>

<p>Much more importantly, the sightings impressed upon the public mind the implications of two things: technology and its secret development. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The 1897 Airship Mystery</h2>

<p>For an indispensable study of the airship mystery, I recommend Michael Busby&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Solving-Airship-Mystery-Michael-Busby/dp/1589801253/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394138664&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=michael+busby">Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery</a>.</p>

<p>Among his various sources, Busby examined over 1200 newspaper reports, and even though there was “ample debate concerning the flying machines&#39; origins in 1897 (the year of the most concentrated and numerous sightings), including the supposition that the machines were of extraterrestrial design, all of the 1896-97 newspaper accounts referred to the flying objects as <em>airships.</em>”</p>

<p>There were other consistencies, as Busby determined that the sightings begin to follow “an easily identifiable path beginning in California, proceeding east to the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan), then changing to a southerly course and traversing Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma before arriving in Texas and Louisiana in April 1897.” Busby continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People saw the airship, or airships, at night, sometimes following a straight line, sometimes stopping then starting again then changing course before disappearing over the horizon. The descriptions of the size, shape, and sounds associate with the airships are similar, regardless of the location and date of the sighting. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These newspaper accounts were remarkably specific, as most referred to the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Swishing sounds, searchlights and flashes of light coming from the airships, and the obvious ability to maneuver independently and under apparent intelligent direction, sudden accelerations and a cigar-shape or Zeppelin-like appearance, descriptions of sparks and electrical motors, descriptions of “sails” and “fans” projecting from cigar shapes, flapping wings, estimations of their dimensions, and speculations upon their mode of propulsions and potentials for military application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leads us to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Texas,_UFO_incident">1897 UFO incident in Aurora, Texas</a>. Busby speculates:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Were the appearances of these strange flying vessels and the purported crash of an airship at Aurora, Texas, a prelude to the alleged events that occurred fifty years later near Roswell? Or did an epidemic of mass hysteria sweep a good proportion of the country? Were the stories the product of newspaper writers&#39; imaginations? Were the flying machines a secret government project (and was there a subsequent government cover-up)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s often claimed that black-ops and fringe research, whether conducted by private corporations, governments or individuals, may be <em>many</em> years ahead of what is released for public consumption. As the Wright brothers would make their historic flight in 1903, it seems not unreasonable that someone, somewhere, might have been just six years ahead of the game, as indicated by the spate of sightings in 1897 which reached a climax in Aurora. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Aurora sighting and crash occurred in the absence of any other airship sighting in the area then it would be much easier to consign the account to the heap of known hoaxes. However, there were numerous airship sightings—more than thirty were reported in the North Texas region—the evening before the crash.</p>

<p>Two airship sightings were made at 3:00 AM on the morning of the crash, one in Dallas and one in Ladonia. Also, another sighting of an airship said to be experiencing mechanical difficulties, occurred in Stephenville at some early, indeterminate hour before the crash. With so many reported sightings nearby, one cannot summarily dismiss the Aurora account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Stephenville sighting is of particular interest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An airship was seen near Stephenville early on the morning, but before 6:00 AM, of the crash. The airship was observed on the ground experiencing mechanical problems by many distinguished citizens shortly prior to the Aurora crash. The airship was previously observed on the ground only when it was experiencing mechanical difficulties or the crew needed to replenish their water supply. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only daytime sightings occurred when an airship was on the ground being repaired. Farrell expands upon this observation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is this aspect of the airship mystery—sightings of grounded ships undergoing repairs, and even actual contact with their crews by witnesses—that begins to put us in touch with what may have been the first phase in the development of a breakaway civilization.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Human Crews</h2>

<p>On April 10th, 1897, a week before the Aurora incident, the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> ran the following story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For several days <em>The News</em> has contained specials from different points stating that parties had an airship in the night. A man named McKnight has been working on an airship at US Marshal Williams&#39; ranch for some time and it is claimed he has been traveling around by night in his ship. While McKnight will not corroborate the statement, many who are in a position to know say his aerial navigation has at last become a success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the possible connection to personnel of the US government. Also, on April 13th in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, two former soldiers heard an explosion of “heavy ordnance”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Later investigation turned up debris which appeared to be “part of some electric appliance” and a “propeller blade of some very light material,” which might have been aluminum.</p>

<p>In another sighting near Dallas, the day <em>after</em> the Aurora crash, witnesses reported an airship at a mere 200 feet altitude. One man saw three men on board, along with “something he took for a large Newfoundland dog,” and heard speech “but could not understand what they said.” From the tone of voice he <em>took them to be Spaniards or Mexicans.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hardly extraterrestrial! The April, 1897 sightings continue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On April 16th, one witness spotted a grounded airship in a remote clearing, and a crewman making repairs with a hammer and chisel. And on the day of the Aurora crash, yet another Texan saw a grounded cigar-shaped airship, and three men of its crew, two of whom went to work on its “rigging,” which the third called to the witness and asked him to mail some letters for him!</p>

<p>When the witness began to take notes of the encounter, he was told not to report about it, and that the crew was doing “experiments” and hoped to “revolutionize travel and transportation.” This is a significant sighting and report, because it tends again to confirm the view that airships represented a secret experimental project of some sort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A story that ran in the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> on April 19th not only named some of the witnesses but also some of the crew/inventors! According to a number of “prominent” citizens:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The airship consists of a cigar shaped body about sixty feet in length, to which is attached two immense aeroplanes, and the motive power is an immense wheel at each end, in appearance much like a metallic windmill. It is driven by an immense electric engine, which derives its power from storage batteries. </p>

<p>The crew consisted, as stated, of two men who gave their names as S.E. Tillman and A.E. Dolbar. They report they have been making an experimental trip to comply with a contract with certain capitalists of New York, who are backing them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The observation about electrical components is an important one, for many of the airships were sighted near railroad tracks, as Farrell expands:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The propulsion appeared to be via <em>electrically</em> powered propellers, which would be one reason so many sightings exist of people having contact with the crew of the airships, who request <em>water,</em> presumably for recharging the ships&#39; batteries. This would be a crucial reason for why so many airships appeared to follow railroad lines, for water towers to replenish their steam engines would be spaced at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Electrically powered airships—and let it be recalled that within this time frame, Tesla was making similar claims—would not require <em>petroleum.</em> Tesla would perform his famous Colorado Springs experiments a year later, and upon his return to New York City, would begin his proposal for the wireless transmission of power, which, as he himself indicated, could power flight.</p>

<p>Finally, it is clearly and explicitly stated in the article itself that the airships were a <em>private and semi-secret development by certain capitalists of New York.</em></p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><h2>Mr. Wilson and possible means of propulsion</h2>

<p>A “Mr. Wilson” also makes frequent appearances in many of these accounts, for example on April 21st, 1897, <em>The Houston Daily Post</em> reported how a father and son encountered a grounded airship:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We went to investigate and discovered four men moving around a large dark object, and when I hailed them they answered and asked if they could get some water. I told them they could. They came to my house, each bringing two baskets, and after filling them, started to return. I accosted one of the men and he told me his name was Wilson and that he and his companions were traveling in a flying machine. They were returning from a trip out of the gulf and were now headed toward Iowa where the airship was built.</p>

<p>[The ship was] 130 feet long and 20 feet wide. It was propelled by four large wings, two on either side, and steered by propellers attached to the bow and stern, electricity being the power used. The hull of the ship is made of steel and contains apartments into which compressed air is pumped when the ship is in action.</p>

<p>The ship carries a water ballast that is pumped to the bow when it is desired to bring the vessel to the earth and to the stern when the course is skyward. The workings of the ship were thus described to him by the man Wilson, who also stated that this ship was only one of five that had been built in a quiet Iowa village.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what was providing this bulky contraption its lift? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question is even more improbable than the descriptions of the craft and the cumbersome, awkward questions they pose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Wilson appears again in a <em>Dallas Morning News</em> article on May 16th where this time he&#39;s accompanied by a “Mr. Warren” and a “Mr. Walters” who were sighted and confronted by a local physician, who gave the following account:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were a number of incandescent lamps about the walls and hanging from the ceiling, and I immediately concluded that the motive power of the ship was electricity and so expressed myself to Mr. Wilson. He said this was not the case, but that it was propelled and sustained by a gas which had the property of great compressibility under a slight pressure and correspondingly great power of expansion.</p>

<p>He had invented a machine or rather engine that once started worked automatically and that one had only to attend to the governance which regulated the speed. I was not prepared wholly to accept this explanation and intimated as much in my expression of astonishment, but I was convinced of it when he showed me the apparatus for generating the gas and the engine for utilizing it.</p>

<p>This much I was able to understand: That there was a receiver made of aluminum (and of this metal the engine and everything connected with the ship so far as I saw was constructed), from which pipes passed to what appeared to me to be a square box, at each end of which was a cylinder with an exhaust chamber, in which worked a piston attached to a very singularly constructed driving wheel like the sprocket of a bicycle, except that there were four wheels, one within the other, and these Mr. Wilson called the accumulators.</p>

<p>There were two sets of such wheels with a combined velocity surpassing anything heretofore constructed. By the peculiar arrangement of the wheel within a wheel [Ezekiel, anyone?] the balance of the centripetal and centrifugal forces was preserved in the presence of 65,000 revolutions a minute; that is, the velocity of revolution in these wheels would equal 65,000 revolutions of an ordinary wheel ten feet in diameter in one minute if such a thing were possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The airships, whether they were made of steel or aluminum, certainly seemed nothing like the conventional zeppelin.</p>

<h2>Secret Societies, Secret Financiers, and Psychological Warfare via Exotic Technology</h2>

<p>In one newspaper report, “Wilson” claimed to be from Goshen, New York.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wilson turned out to be Hiram Wilson, an actual investor in the airship project. He and other investors had worked on their secretive project for several years, and “had parts of the ship constructed to order in different sections of the country, whence they were shipped” to a rendezvous near San Francisco and there assembled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even the name “Hiram” might have some relevance, for in one contact with an airship pilot who was likely Mr. Wilson, the following statement was later reported: “If you will <em>promise on the square</em> not to reveal what I tell you I will give you a little history of our adventures.” </p>

<p>The connection to Freemasonry here should be more than apparent.</p>

<p>Farrell summarizes what we have so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Private investors, representations of the involvement of New York “capitalists”</p></li>
<li><p>Compartmentalization of the project by ordering parts in various places and assembling them at remote locations.</p></li>
<li><p>Some connection to the federal government</p></li>
<li><p>An unusual technology of motive power and lift, in some cases, electrical, and in the Wilson case, compressed gas of some sort.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>All this is occurring, once again, at the same time Nikola Tesla will do extraordinary electrical experimentation, when he will propose a world system of wireless power, which can also power flight, and, within a decade, his ideas will be totally suppressed and forgotten, just like the airships. The concurrence of these events cannot, in my opinion, be coincidental.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over the course of Busby&#39;s research, he determined that “Tillman” was likely Captain Samuel Escue Tillman, a professor of chemistry at West Point Military Academy, and “Dolbar” was likely Professor Amos E. <em>Dolbear</em> of Tufts University. In Busby&#39;s opinion, the major hidden capitalist player was none other than William Randolph Hearst. Busby concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The body of evidence points to a true airship story of terrestrial origin, with test flights beginning in California in the fall of 1896 and proceeding across the country to the Midwest before turning south and arriving in Texas in April 1897. </p>

<p>A group of well-financed, secretive individuals, based in a remote California community, a quiet Iowa village, and a small New York town have left behind a wondrous story of daring accomplishment. It appears they did not just suddenly appear out of the thin mists of time but may have been secretly building and flying machines for over forty-eight years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did such a technology not lead to a revolution in transportation? If the motive power <em>was</em> in some cases electricity, it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> petroleum. For TPTB, it may have posed a threat, or been perceived as not being profitable enough.</p>

<p>Also, it should be noted that <em>two different</em> descriptions of the technology are being offered by the occupants of the airships, and this raises the possibility that each version is only part of the truth, or possibly even completely fabricated. </p>

<p>It seems that whoever was allegedly experimenting with these technologies was <em>also</em> experimenting with the public&#39;s perception on a mass scale. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, people were already connecting the appearance and use of an exotic human technology as represented by the airships with the possibilities presented by the manipulation via technological means of religious, psychological, and social expectation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From an affidavit recorded by <em>The Austin American Statesman</em> on April 17th, 1897:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Difficult as it is to believe that these airships have been invented and are operated by men of the earth, even that is more easily believed than to believe that these ships are manned and sailed by celestial crews <em>and portend the beginning of another dispensation pointed out by the inspired writers.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “dispensation” pointed out by “inspired writers” to sensationalize and obfuscate the truth of these sightings and technologies show all the signs of being deliberately concocted by TPTB with elite financial backing.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it becomes much clearer why <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/early-psychological-warfare-research-and-the-rockefeller-foundation/30594">The Rockefeller Foundation funded Orson Welles&#39; infamous War of the Worlds broadcast</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hourofthetime.com/warofthe.htm">The broadcast was a psychological warfare experiment</a> conducted by The Princeton Radio Project. The Rockefeller Foundation funded the project in the fall of 1937.</p>

<p>With the airship mystery, it seems that someone was a good fifty years ahead of the Nazi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Skorzeny">Otto Skorzeny</a> who suggested that advanced technology could be used to promote psychological operations.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>The Dellschau Dilemma</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dellschau">Charles Dellschau</a> was born in Prussia in 1830 and died on April 20th, 1923. Dellschau&#39;s relation to the airship mystery is perhaps the strangest of them all.</p>

<p>I recommend the following for an in depth description of this enigmatic figure: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/THE-SECRETS-OF-DELLSCHAU-Airships/dp/1933665351/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1394314016&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+secrets+of+dellschau">The Secrets of Dellschau: The Sonora Aero Club and the Airships of the 1800s, A True Story</a>.</p>

<p>Dellschau “filled at least 13 notebooks with drawings, watercolor paintings and collages depicting fantastical airships.” A single page of one of his notebooks sells for thousands of dollars. Continued from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His work was in large part a record of the activities of the Sonora Aero Club, of which he was a purported member. Dellschau&#39;s writings describe the club as a secret group of flight enthusiasts who met at Sonora, California in the mid-19th century. One of the members had discovered the formula for an anti-gravity fuel he called &quot;NB Gas.&quot; Their mission was to design and build the first navigable aircraft using the NB Gas for lift and propulsion. Dellschau called these flying machines Aeros. Dellschau does not claim to be a pilot of any of the airships; he identifies himself only as a draftsman for the Sonora Aero Club.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Wikipedia continues by saying that “it is speculated”  that the Sonora Aero Club is a “fiction by Dellschau,” taken in context with the evidence overviewed so far, it seems premature to dismiss Dellschau outright.</p>

<p>According to UFO researcher Pete Navarro, who owns several Dellschau originals and co-wrote <em>The Secrets of Dellschau</em>: “The story of the Sonora Aero Club and their achievements had been cleverly hidden by Dellschau in his drawings using several codes and unconnected sentences hidden throughout the work. Thus, one would have to see <em>all</em> of the Dellschaus to understand the narrative.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dellschau&#39;s artistic subjects were invariably of airships, zeppelin-like airships that were seen over Germany during the 1850s, and later during the 1880s and 1890s, principally in California, Texas and the Midwest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.surfingtheapocalypse.com/mystery_ships.html">During the 1850&#39;s mysterious &quot;airships&quot; regularly crossed the skies of Germany</a> and just before that, probably in the year 1848, Dellschau immigrated to the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dellschau also made it clear that the Sonora Aero Club was but <em>one</em> such “secret society” attempting to build and fly “aeros” or airships, others being located on the east coast of the US. Furthermore, the activities of these various aerial secret societies were coordinated by a parent body in Germany bearing only the cryptic designation “NYMZA.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wikipedia article also mentions that some of Dellschau&#39;s work ended up in the possession of the “DeMenil Museum.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_de_Menil">John deMenil</a> is remembered as a patron of the arts, but in conspiracy circles DeMenil is known for his possible connection to the JFK assassination, as alleged by the <a href="http://the-torbitt-document.blogspot.com/2010/05/nazi-connection-to-john-f-kennedy.html">Torbitt document</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on this subject I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nasa-Nazis-JFK-Document-Assassination/dp/0932813399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1394315801&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=nasa+nazis+and+jfk">NASA, Nazis &amp; JFK: The Torbitt Document &amp; the Kennedy Assassination</a>.</p>

<p>In the interest of brevity (oops, too late!), I&#39;ll summarize by quoting Farrell:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DeMenil was in the circle of Eastern European exiles in texas that clustered around Dallas and Houston (obvious center of America&#39;s space program), and indeed, according to Torbitt was a leader of that community and close political supporter of Lyndon Johnson.</p>

<p>DeMenil, if the Torbitt document is to be believed, was a leader of the Eastern European exile community in Texas, and thus, this would have placed him in a position to know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_de_Mohrenschildt">George DeMohrenschildt</a> (Oswald&#39;s “handler” in Dallas). </p>

<p>Since this community was a large component of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Gehlen">Nazi General Reinhard Gehlen&#39;s</a> <em>Fremde Heer Ost,</em> this placed DeMenil firmly within the orbit of the postwar Fascist organization, which, as the Torbitt document notes, was intimately connected to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permindex">Permindex</a> (an alleged CIA front organization linked to the JFK assassination).</p>

<p>For more information on these topics, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LBJ-Conspiracy-Kill-Kennedy-Coalescence/dp/1935487183/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1394316381&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=lbj+kennedy">LBJ and the Conspiracy to Kill Kennedy</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another contextual connection to Nazis, NASA and JFK:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons many advance for the murder of president Kennedy was his plan for a joint US-Soviet mission to the Moon, and his willingness to share whatever may have been found there. Kennedy also made direct inquiries to the CIA concerning the subject matter of UFOs, and hence, into the <em>actual state of knowledge of the US concerning advanced science and technology.</em></p>

<p>Many assassination researchers believe that this inquiry, plus his willingness to share information with the Soviets, was sufficient reason to get him killed, simply for the fact that with the heavy Nazi presence and influence within American black projects at that time, they would have balked at sharing their secrets with their hated Communist enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the German Dellschau, Farrell continues by noting the uncanny resemblance between some of Dellschau&#39;s illustrated “technologies” and E.O. Lawrence&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calutron">beta calutrons</a> that wouldn&#39;t be invented for decades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dellschau is depicting machinery, some of which bears too uncanny a resemblance to machines not yet officially invented, machines that, in turn, are dependent upon developments in physics that have not yet occurred. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also referred to technical details that resembled aspects of the technology reported for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Bell">Nazi Bell</a>, which is worth mentioning as Dellschau claimed to represent a secret society based in Germany called NYMZA, which supposedly was coordinating the secret development of airships.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of Dellschau&#39;s paintings-books were purchased by DeMenil, who has connections to Lyndon Johnson, the Texas East European Exile community, and therefore deeply connected to Nazi General Reinhard Gehlen&#39;s postwar military intelligence.</p>

<p>It is when these points are considered together that one must entertain the possibility that Dellschau did indeed represent some unknown group in Europe developing hidden aerial technologies, and that indeed there may be yet another, little-considered, connection to hidden technologies, groups, and the JFK assassination.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>It&#39;s often speculated that some of the more “fanciful” realities depicted by the entertainment industry are often based on some kernel of truth. Keeping that in mind, when I was first exposed to the 19th century airship mystery, I couldn&#39;t help but think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioshock_Infinite">Bioshock Infinite</a>, the entire premise of which is based on exotic technology powering airships in the second half of the 19th century.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll conclude by quoting Farrell&#39;s final thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The propulsion methods and lift generating technologies of the airships do not appear to be conventional by any means, since both electrical systems and compressible gasses are mentioned.</p>

<p>Significantly, within the same time frame, Tesla will conduct his revolutionary Colorado Springs experiments that will lead, within a decade, to his proposal for wireless transmission of electrical power, one purpose of which he envisions to be flight. This technology is suppressed by his financial backers, and similarly, the airship technology, which promised a revolution in transportation, is never publicly revealed. </p>

<p>While the historical impetus for the creation of a vast system of hidden finance and alliances between private, government, Axis, and criminal components began after World War Two, this pattern of secret organizations, private finance, and government interface began on a smaller scale sometime in the 19th century, as did the perception of the possibilities of psychological operations in conjunction with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it was more than just a coincidence that one of the greatest psychological operations of the 20th century occurred almost exactly fifty years after the alleged events in Aurora. For more information on this fascinating subject, I can&#39;t recommend the following enough: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Roswell-Reich-The-Nazi-Connection/dp/1935487051/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1394318170&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=roswell+and+the+reich">Roswell and the Reich: The Nazi Connection</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What began in the 19th century as a secret airship program quickly morphed in the postwar era into a secret space program, one impelled not only by the need to reconnoiter, contain, rollback, and defeat the Soviet Union, but also by the need to discover <em>what strange thing and entities may have been behind clearly hostile actions that were potentially threatening to the vast thermonuclear arsenals of the two superpowers.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that, my friends, is a story for another time.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>An Addendum</h2>

<p>The Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_airships">Mystery Airships</a> does a decent job of summarizing this topic. Here are a few passages that stood out for me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was popularly believed that the mystery airships were the product of some genius inventor not ready to make knowledge of his creation public. For example, Thomas Edison was so widely speculated to be the mind behind the alleged airships that in 1897 he &quot;was forced to issue a strongly worded statement&quot; denying his responsibility.</p>

<p>Author Gregory L. Reece has argued that mystery airships are unlikely to represent test flights of real human-manufactured dirigibles as no record of successful airship flights are known from the period and &quot;it would have been impossible, not to mention irrational, to keep such a thing secret.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reece is wrong on both accounts. The desire to suppress certain technologies that might no be as profitable for TPTB is by no means irrational. And as for there being &quot;no record of successful airship flights&quot; from the period, the Wikipedia article clarifies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the contrary, however, there were in fact several functional airships manufactured before the 1896-97 reports, but their capabilities were far more limited than the mystery airships.</p>

<p>Steerable airships had been publicly flown in the US since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Andrews_(airship">Aereon</a>) in 1863, and numerous inventors were working on airship and aircraft designs (the idea that a secretive inventor might have developed a viable craft with advanced capabilities was the focus of Jules Verne&#39;s 1886 novel Robur the Conqueror).</p>

<p>In fact, two French army officers and engineers, Arthur Krebs and Charles Renard, had successfully flown in an electric-powered airship called the La France as early as 1885, making no fewer than seven successful flights in the craft over an eleven-month period. </p>

<p>Also during the 1896-1897 period, David Schwarz built an aluminum-skinned airship in Germany that successfully flew over Tempelhof Field before being irreparably damaged during a hard landing. </p>

<p>Both events clearly demonstrated that the technology to build a practical airship existed during the period in question, though if reports of the capabilities of the California and Midwest airship sighted in 1896-97 are true, it would have been considerably more advanced than any airship built up to that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it seems to be premature to outright dismiss the 19th century airship mystery as utterly fanciful, hoaxes or the product of yellow journalism.</p>

<p>One of the sources for the Wikipedia article is the following extremely impressive collection: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ma4/oddities/airshiplog3.html">The Mystery Airship Log: 1871 - 1895</a>. They continued through the early 1900&#39;s as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a series of mystery airship sightings in 1909. Some came from various European locations, some from New England and from New Zealand. Later reports came from the UK in 1912 and 1913. </p>

<p>However, by this time airship technology was well advanced (Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin having been flying his massive passenger-carrying airships for nearly a decade by this time), making the prospect that these may have been small, private airships rather than evidence of extraterrestrial visitation or newspaper hoaxes more reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, we are dealing here with a matter of <em>years</em>, not decades. If electric crafts had been successfully flown in the 1880&#39;s and if &quot;private&quot; airships were being constructed by 1910, it seems again to be unreasonable to completely dismiss the possibility that <em>someone</em> was flying around some sort of experimental craft in 1897, or even earlier.</p>

<p>As for legitimate attempts to debunk the entirety of this mystery, I&#39;m grateful to a user over in <a href="/r/ufos">/r/ufos</a> for bringing this article to my attention:</p>

<p><a href="http://skepticversustheflyingsaucers.blogspot.fr/2014/01/cracking-189697-airships-mystery-toward_11.html">Cracking the 1896/97 Airships Mystery? Toward a Psycho-SocioCultural Explanation.</a></p>

<p>The author does an admirable job offering a skeptic&#39;s view, and the sheer amount of images provided makes it worthwhile checking it out.</p>

<p>I was going to make a long-winded attempt at &quot;debunking his debunking,&quot; but fortunately <a href="/u/shangriLOL">/u/shangriLOL</a> stepped up in the <a href="/r/ufos">/r/ufos</a> thread and said it <em>far</em> more eloquently and succinctly than is within my ability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Half of the debunking is just an examination of the plastic and impressionable nature of human perception. We get it, people make serious, game-breaking mistakes all the time when reporting on their experiences. Venus and Chinese lanterns are given as the stimulus which was warped by preconceptions and the building social focus on flight to become airships.</p>

<p>The comparisons of directions of sightings with heavenly bodies puts a nail in the coffin of many of the long distance sightings. So a few cases (all long-distance sightings) are discussed and debunked, but he doesn&#39;t even mention (unless I missed it while reading) cases where people reportedly made contact with the pilots/passengers of the airships. Cases of direct contact with the airship pilots (who are always described as well-dressed, non-anachronistic humans) support this being a real thing and not merely mass improvisational reporting on Venus etc.</p>

<p>The other half of the debunking essay was giving real historical examples of what was seen in the 1890&#39;s in the USA, often at earlier dates, in other places in the world. Maybe I am missing something, but this research/evidence seems to support the theory that these ships existed and were potentially flown over the USA.</p>

<p>He cites a person reviewing the Busby book apparently doing some math to debunk the alleged size of the airships saying they wouldn&#39;t be able to float but 60% of an average human, but the math is crappy. Consider the [Nulli Secundus](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_Dirigible_No_1), a real dirigible which flew in 1907. It was 120 feet in length and supported a small carriage for a few crewmembers. I did a quick search on the generation of hydrogen gas, just to a method for production was in existence at before 1890 (it was indeed, in fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_brothers#First_manned_hydrogen_balloon_flight">in 1783 a flight was made on a hot air balloon</a> which was filled with hydrogen gas released from reacting iron filings with sulfuric acid, a trivial reaction). </p>

<p>Thus, the descriptions of the airships from up-close witnesses are not impossible, but plausible. The physics are valid and a 150 foot airship could definitely support a few people, and the amount of lift provided increases exponentially as the volume of the envelope (the &#39;balloon&#39;) increases, so a 200 foot envelope could lift much more.</p>

<p>If I am now further convinced of anything, it is that &#39;mass delusion&#39;, while real, is rare at the scale of the airship mystery. There don&#39;t appear to be any examples of &#39;mass delusion&#39; on the scale of the airship cases except tautological.</p>

<p>The author has done a great job demonstrating that airships like those described in the 1890s sightings did indeed exist at the time, and that it is no far stretch of imagination to think such ships might have been flown over the USA. Is it physically and historically possible that real airships were the cause of the 1890s wave of sightings? The answer is undoubtedly yes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a practicing occultist. I believe in non-physical beings. Or more literally-- since everyone &quot;believes in&quot; them to a limited extent-- I believe that nonphysical beings have reality and volition independent of the individual human &quot;mind.&quot;</p>

<p>(I put &quot;mind&quot; in scare quotes because I don&#39;t actually think we know where &quot;mind&quot; ends and &quot;world&quot; begins.)</p>

<p>It seems clear, also, that there is a class of beings who exist in between the physical and non-physical. Perhaps their bodies are composed of the stuff that acupuncturists and qigong practitioners call &quot;chi,&quot; or perhaps they&#39;re &quot;spirits&quot; that have an unusually strong ability to affect the physical world. Or maybe both of these explanations are wrong, because human brains can&#39;t fully comprehend the world as it actually is. But I think that they&#39;ve always been with us, that they share this world with us, and that their motivations are impossible for us to fully understand. </p>

<p>This is what I wrote about the <a href="http://www.newsgarden.org/columns/alllieufo.html">UFO Conspiracy</a> UFO&#39;s, since after WWII, have almost entirely been new planes developed by the US. They want them labeled UFOs so people will discount them. They even have pilots afraid to report them because that would reveal new details of these ships to others. And since the evil capitalists see the entire world as their enemy, as we are, they don&#39;t want new ships described to others. </p>

<p>There are new ships that are half blimps and half planes. That is the source of some of the UFO sightings. Though, of course, LOTS of people love to set up hoaxes and fool others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good writeup alllie, but please see my comments elsewhere ITT defending this as a sticky.</p>

<p>Yesterday the same bullshit made it to the top...the same thing we see <em>all</em> the time here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>We <em>need</em> to highlight original research by users in this community. I&#39;ve been inspired by the original research of others, and I sincerely hope to do the same with my work.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><em>Precisely</em>!</p>

<p>You do realize that that&#39;s one of the <em>main</em> points in my post here? The use of exotic technology for psychological operations has its very origins in the 19th century airship mystery! Did you read my whole post?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong...I happen to respect you more than the most on reddit, but I cannot possibly see how stickying this post for a few days is going to have a negative effect on the sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it was really a worthwhile post, surely you could trust people to vote it up. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might have been true a few years back, but sadly that&#39;s now how it really works anymore.</p>

<p>Many people here, mods and regular users alike, have been noticing disturbing patterns of random/new users posting bullshit to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and then proceeding to amass thousands of upvotes.</p>

<p>Some of these bullshit posts, IMO, serve to distract from the real shit that gets posted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and the mere fact that they get so much attention does more to discredit the sub than <em>anything</em> else, <em>especially</em> more than a stickied post like this.</p>

<p>Since I was elected a mod here, I&#39;ve viewed that as a sort of mandate that the users trust my judgment. I will never abuse that trust.</p>

<p>When I saw this post getting overshadowed by the same bullshit fluff yesterday, I discussed it with the mods and we decided to sticky it for just a few days. </p>

<p>Again, alllie, honestly this post shouldn&#39;t make you sad. It encapsulates a lot of the stuff you&#39;ve been talking about yourself!</p>

<p>We need to keep the variety here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. The same old shit again and again becomes outrageously tedious. </p>

<p>This post is meant to expose people to information that they normally would never come across. Except for a few complaints, I would like to think that this post is actually appreciated.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a plethora of reasons for this. Trolls are one part; &quot;shills&quot; are another; and some of the crazy people here(the anti-semites, NWO freaks, Agenda 21 bullshitters, Illuminati fuckers, and Alex Jones cocksuckers) are also to blame. The latter of the three really piss me off because they make all conspiracy theorists look insane when we&#39;re not. The media has done a great job at making people who don&#39;t listen to their bullshit narrative look bad, and the fools are eating this propaganda up like butter.</p>

<p>After all, as improbable as it may seem, the Soviets scooped up a considerable amount of top Nazi scientists...Operation Paperclip in the US by no means got &#39;em all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post! But one question- what do you make of the supposed body recovered from the aurora crash. It was said at the time of recovery that it was &quot;not of this world&quot;. The show UFO Hunters did an episode on this subject, and found the grave in the aurora cemetery where the pilot had been buried, yet were not given the go ahead for exhumation. I don&#39;t see why this would be staged, because they gave the pilot a Christian burial, obviously not intending it to be a tourist attraction of any sort. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question. It does seem possible that <em>someone</em> died at the scene.</p>

<p>In fact, the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> reported the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pilot of the ship is supposed to have been the only one on board, and while his remains are badly disfigured, enough of the original has been picked up to show that he was not an inhabitant of this world.</p>

<p>Mr. T.J. Weems, the US Signal Service officer at this place gave it as his opinion that he was a native of the planet Mars. Papers found on his person, evidently the records of his travels, are written in some unknown hieroglyphics, and cannot be deciphered. </p>

<p>The ship was too badly wrecked to form any conclusion as to its construction or motive power. It was built of an unknown metal, resembling somewhat a mixture of aluminum and silver, and it must have weighed several tons.</p>

<p>The town is full of people today who are viewing the wreck and gathering specimens of the strange metal from the debris. The pilot&#39;s funeral will take place at noon tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is what Busby has to say about the curious statement of the US Signals Service officer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people quickly dismiss this account because of the claim that an alien body was recovered. But, why would a government official, probably with no long-term ties to the community, lie about the recovery of a body? Was this a gaffe by a United States official, similar to another famous incident at Roswell fifty years later?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could this be an attempt by a government official to misdirect the origin of the technology involved?</p>

<p>Also, the discovery of &quot;hieroglyphics&quot; might be correlated to the codes employed by Dellschau in his art, but that of course is just speculation.</p>

<p>One of the most important points mentioned by Farrell is his excellent <em>Roswell and the Reich</em> is that a false dichotomy was established <em>immediately</em> as to the explanation of the incident.</p>

<p>On one hand, the first official release about information of the Roswell crash referred to it as being a UFO and not from this world.</p>

<p>This statement was quickly retracted, but the damage was done.</p>

<p>Following this they introduce the other part of the false dichotomy...namely the weather balloon meme (which has since been updated to a secret spy balloon meme).</p>

<p>So, from the <em>very</em> beginning, the public is confronted with two possibilities: the <em>extra</em>ordinary and the mundane. </p>

<p>As a result, the vast majority of discussion concerning these topics become extremely polarized into the ET crowd and 100% hoax/fake crowd.</p>

<p>In reality, this is a false paradigm that is used in <em>many</em> other instances, especially politics, and its goal is to obfuscate from the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>The crash at Roswell was <em>very</em> likely an experimental Nazi/Soviet craft. Imagine the shit storm that would&#39;ve been created if merely <em>two</em> years after the end of WWII, a craft exhibiting unusual technologies with a possible Nazi/Soviet origin was flying over the US!</p>

<p>As a result, they went into damage control by creating the two polarized false paradigms of the ET meme and weather balloon meme.</p>

<p>I think something similar may have been at play at the Aurora site, though on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, the rehearsal, or at least the inspiration for how Roswell was handled almost exactly 50 years later.</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense.</p>

<p>Also, writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Redfern">Nick Redfern</a> has done great research into how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progeria">Progeria</a> victims may have been used in testing experimental craft. The burned remains of progeria sufferers would certainly look out of this world.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that this is the explanation for the body allegedly recovered at Aurora, however I&#39;m curious under what authority this &quot;US Signals Service officer&quot; had to enable him to make such a statement.</p>

<p>AFAIK, his quote about the pilot likely being from Mars is the origin of the extraterrestrial explanation of the Aurora incident. </p>

<p>To conclude, I&#39;ll quote from Farrell regarding Aurora, though his words apply to Roswell too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I continue to have difficulty believing that ET can travel through the blackness of interplanetary space with his advanced technology, only to crash it into windmills in Texas.</p>

<p>Could we be looking at an attempt by a government official to obfuscate a truth--the recovery of a body--by misdirecting attention as to the origin of the technology recovered?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MUFON then investigated the Aurora Cemetery, and uncovered a grave marker that appeared to show a flying saucer of some sort, as well as readings from its metal detector. MUFON asked for permission to exhume the site, but the cemetery association declined permission. </p>

<p>After the MUFON investigation, the marker mysteriously disappeared from the cemetery and a three-inch pipe was placed into the ground; MUFON&#39;s metal detector no longer picked up metal readings from the grave, thus it was presumed that the metal was removed from the grave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a mystery!</p>

<p><em>The lizard hunt continues for hundreds of years, battles &#39; result in the destruction of the Orion and Sirian crews that have tried to work behind the scenes to break the lizard New Empire.

<p>you ommitted &quot;Despite exhaustive research, including searches of census records, voting rosters, and death records, nothing has been found to substantiate the existence of this group except for a few gravestones in the Columbia Cemetery where several of the surnames are found. It is speculated that, like Henry Darger&#39;s &quot;Realms of the Unreal&quot;, the Sonora Aero Club is a fiction by Dellschau&quot;</p>

<p>Fun story, but it is just that, taking random incidents and drawing an unproved narrative through them. Nothing here is of any interest to people doing legitimate research in the history of flight.</p>

<p>If you have some proof for a theory, it is not hard to take that proof to a school or research group and have your work reviewed and begin a proper academic inquiry. As far as I can tell, Farrell is not interested in having his discoveries be investigated, just trying to sell books to peopl unconcerned with scientific accuracy. </p>

<p>Why is this on the front page? It is lunacy. Cause the mod though all of his work would be ignored if he didn&#39;t sticky it? This is hogwash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Raises hand sheepishly</em>.</p>

<p>Honestly, I am <em>more</em> than sick of the usually fluff that makes it to the top 10 in the sub.</p>

<p>As a veteran here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I&#39;ve noticed a very clear pattern: the same small group of users resubmits the same content on a cycle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their posts are almost always superficial or even erroneous, yet they are consistently upvoted with thousands of votes, despite the fact that they aren&#39;t the <em>least</em> bit informative.</p>

<p><em>This</em> is what makes <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> look bad, not original research and speculation like this post.</p>

<p>Cheers to <a href="/u/godiebiel">/u/godiebiel</a> for defending me on this one. </p>

<p>I can guarantee you that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s reputation is not going to suffer <em>in the slightest</em> as a result of this post. </p>

<p>In a week, the only people that are going to remember this are those who actually took the time to read it, which clearly doesn&#39;t include you.</p>

<p>After all, you didn&#39;t even bother to say <em>what</em> you thought was madness. You dismissed my whole post and claim I&#39;m here to discredit the sub...yet you offer <em>no</em> evidence for this.</p>

<p>Comments like <em>yours</em> and users like <em>you</em> are what&#39;s wrong with this sub. I&#39;ve dedicated more time and passion to this place than you could possibly understand. </p>

<p>If I may quote <a href="/u/godiebiel">/u/godiebiel</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What madness? It is well studied analyses of a fringe conspiratorial subject-matter. And an example of how posts here should be, instead of memes or 4chan screenshots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we had more original research in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, this place would have <em>so</em> much more credibility and be <em>so</em> much more attractive. </p>

<p>For example, I&#39;m sure many people here remember this post:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/">Original Research: The Mountain of Evidence for a Massive International Pedophile Ring Protected by Police and Intelligence Agencies</a>.</p>

<p><em>This</em> is the time of investigative journalism/research that gives <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> its credibility, <em>not</em> bullshit memes and stupid recycled images and information.</p>

<p>I was inspired by that post to ramp up my own research on anything and everything, and as a result I&#39;ve recently been studying the concept of a &quot;Breakaway Civilization.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, far from trying to discredit the sub, I&#39;m trying to <em>give</em> it credibility. For example, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qnth3/financing_a_breakaway_civilization_a_series_of/">I thought this post I made on the Breakaway Civilization</a> was informative and interesting.</p>

<p>This post about the 19th century airship mystery is yet another chapter in this fascinating story. </p>

<p>There <em>is</em> substance there. Sure, this is a <em>fringe</em> conspiratorial topic, and it wont stay stickied for long, but surely it&#39;s a stretch to suggest that the significant amount of work I keep putting into all of this is merely my attempt to work <em>against</em> the sub.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure who you think <em>you</em> are that you aren&#39;t worthy of complaints, or what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is if it is not deserving of complaints. My complaints were clear - if you thought they were invalid you had your chance to respond and let everyone know why. Presenting myself as a complainer should make no difference than you presenting yourself as a moderator. This is a place for discussion and I shared my opinion. Last I checked the mods didn&#39;t share their decision to sticky your random post, so I see no reason why it&#39;d be unreasonable to point this out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As other users are pointing out, you&#39;re attacking the messenger, not the message.</p>

<p>No, those people can&#39;t read. I&#39;m attacking the moderator that stickied the message - not sure how you can think it means anything but.</p>

<p>ok. If you want me to be polite - maybe you shouldn&#39;t offer rebuttals to arguments I never made? That&#39;s just another way of offering a strawman argument. I never said the post shouldn&#39;t be here, I said <em>I don&#39;t think it should be stickied</em>.</p>

<p>Ok. Until you are willing to acknowledge your obvious preferential sticky treatment, I see no reason to act like this post is worth discussing. It&#39;s very easy to make up rules convincing yourself that they apply to everyone else. Of course the difference is you are the moderator so you can ban people.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>An Addendum</h2>

<p>The Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_airships">Mystery Airships</a> does a decent job of summarizing this topic. Here are a few passages that stood out for me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was popularly believed that the mystery airships were the product of some genius inventor not ready to make knowledge of his creation public. For example, Thomas Edison was so widely speculated to be the mind behind the alleged airships that in 1897 he &quot;was forced to issue a strongly worded statement&quot; denying his responsibility.</p>

<p>Author Gregory L. Reece has argued that mystery airships are unlikely to represent test flights of real human-manufactured dirigibles as no record of successful airship flights are known from the period and &quot;it would have been impossible, not to mention irrational, to keep such a thing secret.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reece is wrong on both accounts. The desire to suppress certain technologies that might no be as profitable for TPTB is by no means irrational. And as for there being &quot;no record of successful airship flights&quot; from the period, the Wikipedia article clarifies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the contrary, however, there were in fact several functional airships manufactured before the 1896-97 reports, but their capabilities were far more limited than the mystery airships.</p>

<p>Steerable airships had been publicly flown in the US since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Andrews_(airship">Aereon</a>) in 1863, and numerous inventors were working on airship and aircraft designs (the idea that a secretive inventor might have developed a viable craft with advanced capabilities was the focus of Jules Verne&#39;s 1886 novel Robur the Conqueror).</p>

<p>In fact, two French army officers and engineers, Arthur Krebs and Charles Renard, had successfully flown in an electric-powered airship called the La France as early as 1885, making no fewer than seven successful flights in the craft over an eleven-month period. </p>

<p>Also during the 1896-1897 period, David Schwarz built an aluminum-skinned airship in Germany that successfully flew over Tempelhof Field before being irreparably damaged during a hard landing. </p>

<p>Both events clearly demonstrated that the technology to build a practical airship existed during the period in question, though if reports of the capabilities of the California and Midwest airship sighted in 1896-97 are true, it would have been considerably more advanced than any airship built up to that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it seems to be premature to outright dismiss the 19th century airship mystery as utterly fanciful, hoaxes or the product of yellow journalism.</p>

<p>One of the sources for the Wikipedia article is the following extremely impressive collection: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ma4/oddities/airshiplog3.html">The Mystery Airship Log: 1871 - 1895</a>. They continued through the early 1900&#39;s as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a series of mystery airship sightings in 1909. Some came from various European locations, some from New England and from New Zealand. Later reports came from the UK in 1912 and 1913. </p>

<p>However, by this time airship technology was well advanced (Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin having been flying his massive passenger-carrying airships for nearly a decade by this time), making the prospect that these may have been small, private airships rather than evidence of extraterrestrial visitation or newspaper hoaxes more reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, we are dealing here with a matter of <em>years</em>, not decades. If electric crafts had been successfully flown in the 1880&#39;s and if &quot;private&quot; airships were being constructed by 1910, it seems again to be unreasonable to completely dismiss the possibility that <em>someone</em> was flying around some sort of experimental craft in 1897, or even earlier.</p>

<p>As for legitimate attempts to debunk the entirety of this mystery, I&#39;m grateful to a user over in <a href="/r/ufos">/r/ufos</a> for bringing this article to my attention:</p>

<p><a href="http://skepticversustheflyingsaucers.blogspot.fr/2014/01/cracking-189697-airships-mystery-toward_11.html">Cracking the 1896/97 Airships Mystery? Toward a Psycho-SocioCultural Explanation.</a></p>

<p>The author does an admirable job offering a skeptic&#39;s view, and the sheer amount of images provided makes it worthwhile checking it out.</p>

<p>I was going to make a long-winded attempt at &quot;debunking his debunking,&quot; but fortunately <a href="/u/shangriLOL">/u/shangriLOL</a> stepped up in the <a href="/r/ufos">/r/ufos</a> thread and said it <em>far</em> more eloquently and succinctly than is within my ability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Half of the debunking is just an examination of the plastic and impressionable nature of human perception. We get it, people make serious, game-breaking mistakes all the time when reporting on their experiences. Venus and Chinese lanterns are given as the stimulus which was warped by preconceptions and the building social focus on flight to become airships.</p>

<p>The comparisons of directions of sightings with heavenly bodies puts a nail in the coffin of many of the long distance sightings. So a few cases (all long-distance sightings) are discussed and debunked, but he doesn&#39;t even mention (unless I missed it while reading) cases where people reportedly made contact with the pilots/passengers of the airships. Cases of direct contact with the airship pilots (who are always described as well-dressed, non-anachronistic humans) support this being a real thing and not merely mass improvisational reporting on Venus etc.</p>

<p>The other half of the debunking essay was giving real historical examples of what was seen in the 1890&#39;s in the USA, often at earlier dates, in other places in the world. Maybe I am missing something, but this research/evidence seems to support the theory that these ships existed and were potentially flown over the USA.</p>

<p>He cites a person reviewing the Busby book apparently doing some math to debunk the alleged size of the airships saying they wouldn&#39;t be able to float but 60% of an average human, but the math is crappy. Consider the [Nulli Secundus](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_Dirigible_No_1), a real dirigible which flew in 1907. It was 120 feet in length and supported a small carriage for a few crewmembers. I did a quick search on the generation of hydrogen gas, just to a method for production was in existence at before 1890 (it was indeed, in fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_brothers#First_manned_hydrogen_balloon_flight">in 1783 a flight was made on a hot air balloon</a> which was filled with hydrogen gas released from reacting iron filings with sulfuric acid, a trivial reaction). </p>

<p>Thus, the descriptions of the airships from up-close witnesses are not impossible, but plausible. The physics are valid and a 150 foot airship could definitely support a few people, and the amount of lift provided increases exponentially as the volume of the envelope (the &#39;balloon&#39;) increases, so a 200 foot envelope could lift much more.</p>

<p>If I am now further convinced of anything, it is that &#39;mass delusion&#39;, while real, is rare at the scale of the airship mystery. There don&#39;t appear to be any examples of &#39;mass delusion&#39; on the scale of the airship cases except tautological.</p>

<p>The author has done a great job demonstrating that airships like those described in the 1890s sightings did indeed exist at the time, and that it is no far stretch of imagination to think such ships might have been flown over the USA. Is it physically and historically possible that real airships were the cause of the 1890s wave of sightings? The answer is undoubtedly yes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. </p>

<p>And I have noticed the THOUSANDS of votes for BS submissions. While the serious ones usually stay under 100. </p>

<p>I wish there was a list of people who submitted good material, have been here a while and which obvious included me, which could go to the top and just compete against each other. When new people came online and posted serious stuff with value, after a while they could be added to the list. </p>

<p>This is because of all the shill and sockpuppet accounts these days. </p>
