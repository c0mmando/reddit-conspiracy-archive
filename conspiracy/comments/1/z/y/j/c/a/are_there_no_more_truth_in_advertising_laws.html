      <p>
       I may have posted this in the wrong forum, but I have been noticing a dramatic change in the leeway commercials portray their messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was just a commercial on for a popular energy drink that "claims"  that it causes you to focus. Now I have tried all manner of "uplifting" drinks and powders and therapies...none do as they claim. About the only one that has ever had multiple effects ( over many attempts. Including good or bad days ) has been a old fashioned massage. Relaxed and invigorated at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I see, " Will increase your stamina/ infused with musk to increase your attractiveness/ life changing product", all I can feel is sad that we have let this world get so far gone. We have let a generation of "snake oil" spokesmen distract from what I thought progress was supposed to be....fucking hoverboards and flying cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead we have moved from an, "exploration at a reasonable cost" people to a, "well let's see what we should be pissed off about today" society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes...putting a banner up in protest of SOPA on a website is doing something. But not really. If I am correct ( fuck it you will have an opinion one way or the other ), I believe people are being desensitized to everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many stories are you going to see about 5 year olds suspended for pointing a finger like a "gun" before you get sick of it? Turn your back just like a person crying wolf? A plane dissapears off radar at 35ish thousand feet and no one asks how no debris was seen falling on radar?
      </p>
      <p>
       By breeding soap operas for us to watch, it takes our minds off the things that matter in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though it gives everyone a universal medium of sadness ( for people we don't know), and compassion ( for people we have never met ). I am a compassionate person in my own way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through experience I only share that part with everyone that exists...till it is warped or used to harm. I have been harmed and by extension others have been harmed around me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this I say there is a massive and stupid conspiracy amongst us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those with power don't realise that the backs they stand on are the ones  ( our children) that will be friends with their children in the future ( if they don't destroy everything in the process ).
      </p>
      <p>
       This bullshit grab for power and control can only end this way..." There Can Be Only One".
      </p>
      <p>
       That sounds like a shitty world for any "powerful" person.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone survives their power play, their kids will grow up in the same world as the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want an easy fix for the problems all of us face ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad truth is we just need to work together, and I dont think the rich know how to "WORK" per se.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if I ranted. I really need to vent that tiny bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks otherwise! Please be kind also. I do not intend for this expression of my unease with certain...how shall I put it.?. Fucking stupid decisions by our (world) leaders using our names to justify stupid decisions by them which inflicts harm to any other person of whom we have never met and will hate us for decisions which were removed from our choices in life. And now get blamed for. GODDAMN THAT FELT GOOD!

       Thats my point. There is too much deading of the nerves nowadays. There is such a random pattern, but there is a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I see a pharma ad followed by a lawer ad followed by a g.e. ad saying they are bettering power and showing flowers...I swear only one time did I flip channels and got locked into a 3-5 minute hypnotic state watching telletubbies.
      </p>
      <p>
       After thoes mind breaking minutes, I realized how malleable our minds are. Shit made me feel retarded...literally!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, sometimes there is a pattern in how, and why they bombard us with all this crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry again. Just small examples of years of observations. Not all proveable. Just links in what appears to be a long fucking chain of deceit.

       I had an l5-s1 spinal fusion a year ago and while recovering the doctor tried pushing gabapentin ( as a pain killer it did shit ), chantrix ( im not depressed ), metropolpol ( I probably spelled it wrong, but its for blood pressure, my pressure went up when in the doctors office only), and lyrica along with others. I had pain...morphine for the first week or so then taper to vicodin to the end..nope. 2 months of morphine 1 month percocet then 1 month more of morphine.  Fucking felt like a lab rat. Worst 2 years of my life. Now if I can get a job since everyone is asking what I did for 2 years, and I am naturally truthful ( which can be a burden at times)  I tell them my story.

       I think we're in a golden age of journalism; anyone who wants to can read direct reports from reporters and sources around the world, even Google-translating from foreign languages if you wish. NPR, BBC, Reuters, NYTimes, others do a GREAT job. We have civilians tweeting about things they're seeing in person, real-time. All kinds of analysis and opinion and discussion of current events and issues. Almost all of it free. It's wonderful !
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, if all you do is plop down in front of the TV and watch CBS or something, you're going to get some pretty limited news. Whose fault is that ? Yours.

       Sure, there are biased sources, and sometimes even the good sources get it wrong. But if you use your brain while reading or watching, and read multiple sources, you can get a good picture of what's happening. We are better-informed now than at any time in the past.

       Just because you can get bullshit from a multitude of sources, doesn't make the bullshit any more desirable. Even non-media sites like Reddit are experiencing significant censorship and manipulation.

       Im a senior marketing major and from what I can tell there are just a lot of ways to get around regulations and laws when I comes to this. Especially for bigger companies, generally speaking, I love advertising but this annoys me very much.

       Well my (one of many) theories is this... If you need to label hot coffe hot because of stupid/careless people. Then how easy would it be to just tell them its luke warm just to fuck with them? Ad companies see this weakness and exploit it all the time. Thats why I'm more than tired of the crap fed to us. 4 major cell companies say they are the "best", but read/listen to how they phrase it. Each one has one word differences.

       "We just need to work together" doesn't happen because, at the foundation, we are competitive animals.  We have a bias toward grabbing stuff for ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of what you mention (false advertising) is allowed because there is big money to be made in the diet, vitamin, natural medicine, bodybuilding supplement industries.  The laws have been written to prevent proper regulation of those industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's as simple as "the rich exploiting us", or some conspiracy.  It's a mix of our own desires and weaknesses, ideology, history, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing unique about our situation today.  All through history, people have been saying "jeez, things are worse today than they've EVER been, we're really going down the toilet, this just is hopeless".  And they've generally been wrong, unless locally they were in a concentration camp in the Holocaust or the Mongol hordes were at the gates or something.  We'll muddle through today's situation, as we usually do.  We keep doing a lot of stupid things, but there are a lot of good things, too.

       Not to question your perception of things, but are you sure that they are saying what you are hearing.  They spend a lot of money learning how to infer messages without saying them.  A prime example being the extenz commercial. You walk away thinking "man, Bob took pills and became a love machine".  But they never once say that the pills will actually give you a donkey sized Wang. In fact, they really don't say much at all.

       I live in Hawaii.  The commercials are about as nationalized as localized. I don't look at the ad the way you think ( maybe). I look for the underlying message not what they are trying to sell. " Makes you feel like a million bucks!" To me says "You will never see a million bucks in your life, so go with our blatant slap in the face". I guess it's a hobby reading body language, speech, snyde remarks...it all adds up to what I understand. I kinda sucks to see the world through the bullshit shoved down our throats. Sometimes I wonder if ignorance is bliss.

       Same here. I'm not one. I can't help but observe things. To the point where I'm driving down the road picking out potential "oh shit" spots. ( Places kids could run out, cars pulling out in blind spots, car passing that block the view of pedestrians crossing the street...ect.) My life is more dedicated to risk assesment for people that don't pay attention, just to save their lives more than mine, since I take responsibility for my actions. Stupid happens, I try not to be responsible for it.
