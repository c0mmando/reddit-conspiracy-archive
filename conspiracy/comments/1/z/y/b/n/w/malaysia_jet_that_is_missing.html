       So this jet went missing if you have not been keeping up with the news and no one seems to know where it is or what happened too it. It was 1st late , then missing, then possible terrorism target, now they said it may have turned back....? Well what about the GPS on the thing? Or the GPS of the black box.... Or the many GPS of the cell phones on the plane..... Where was the NSA on this one???? Any ideas on what the fuck happened to this jet?

       No clue what happened. What I have observed in the past is that when a story changes rapidly something is off. This story to me isn't developing. It's chaotic. I read an article yesterday stating that the plain was discovered and it had crashed of the coast of Vietnam. Not just the oil slick story. Anyhow what I'm trying to say is that there is no cohesian.

       If they exploded mid-air yes I would imagine debris somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows they could have had some uncontrollable dive and hit the water and an angle and sunk to the bottom.

       I have no clue as the rest of us, just throwing shit at the wall.

       Got to remember to look at both sides of it. It can take weeks or even years to find wreckage on the oceans.

       Oil slicks in the area where the plane went missing mean it likely crashed.  The plane went missing around 01:30am.  If you've never flown over the ocean at night, it's pitch black.  It's possible the plane could have been losing altitude and the crew not know it.  If the plane hit the water at a relatively flat angle, it wouldn't have done as much damage to tear the plane apart as a inclined hit would have done.

       I wish there was more hard evidence of the oil slicks. Or anything related to this story for that matter. With technology today one would think a missing plane shouldn't be hard to locate.

       It shouldn't be if the tracking beacon was working.  However, they lost all communications with the plan and the tracking beacon signal was down.  There was probably some sort of catastrophic electronic failure.  If there is any "cover up" here I think it will be in how they try to conceal any issues that the Boeing, itself, had.  They don't want to scare travelers and that is a very popular and supposedly safe plane.

       I've heard the oil slicks are ocean pollution that gathers there because of the ocean's movements. (Source: Malaysians on Facebook who I can't link here cuz of sub rules.)

       Very little debris will remain on the surface of a full-speed crash in water. And even if it was one sea cushion, it would take WEEKS to find it since they don't know exactly where the plane went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the plane breaks apart and people are strapped to their seats, the parts usually SINK because it's been ripped apart by the impact. Seat cushions are probably all strapped to their respective PEOPLE who are now all dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flotation seats are all bright yellow? Are you sure about that? Even if they were, what color are they after floating in the ocean for a few days? And how easy are they to see from a search plane?
      </p>
      <p>
       What good is a GPS locator when it's 2 miles below the surface? Guess what? Water flows. That means so does the debris field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please go research sea crashes before making a fool of yourself. There is absolutely nothing conspiratorial about this crash. There are bigger and better conspiracies out there.

       Air france 447. It took two years to find the black box. It's not that easy. Sure, some wreckage can be found, but it often SINKS. Duh. But, exactly as it is happening now, it can take DAYS to find the first pieces.

       And just because CNN didn't report it yet doesn't mean it didn't happen. So what... they just happen to find a debris field near where the plane went down and it's NOT from that airplane? How retarded is that reasoning? Extremely retarded.

      <p>
       What about it? GPS is a one-way downlink system, receivers don't communicate back to the satellites. Your phone doesn't even have the equipment to talk to high orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cell phone location tracking works by having the phone report its position through the cell phone network. Open ocean, no network, no tracking.

       None of that contradicts what I said.

      <p>
       Other entities only know your GPS-determined location if your device is willing and able to tell them. The plane went dark and cell phones had nothing they were able to talk to. And the black box doesn't even have a GPS receiver.
