<p>Even pointing out that the situation in Ukraine is complicated because there are <a href="http://rt.com/news/donetsk-kharkov-ukraine-protest-365/">tens of thousands of Ukrainians who do not support the new Western backed puppet president and welcome Russian intervention results in dozens of down-votes.</a></p>

<p>Many of the most vocal accounts were created recently, and have entire comment histories made up of Ukraine comments, posted non stop for 12+ hours a day, every day, with absolutely no comments on any other topic. I have identified dozens of such accounts. </p>

<p>One example of a <strong>suspicious user</strong> is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Silent-Scope">/user/Silent-Scope</a>*</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*Please note that I am not accusing this user of being a paid shill as doing so is against the rules now. I am posting a link to his comment history to point out an example of the apparent agendas and conflicts of interest these users have, and am doing so respectfully and in a way that fosters discussion, which is allowed, as <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RYFEmYJ.jpg">confirmed by  Mod SovereignMan.</a> Also this specific user isn&#39;t even subbed to r/conspiracy. This post absolutely fits within the new rule 10 framework as far as I can tell, but please let me know if anything should be changed. </p>

<p>I am posting this user only as an example of what I am talking about as it directly relevant to this discussion. Please examine for yourself and keep any discussion respectful and constructive. </p>

<p>What can realistically be done about this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No shit.  Other subreddits are basically frothing at the mouth.</p>

<p>Then there are the usual idiots with insightful posts such as &quot;What is a mobilization?&quot;.</p>

<p>I still remember when Georgia invaded Ossetia under cover of the Olympics and tried to do ethnic cleansing during the previous Olympics, when they calculated that the world attention was away from a small regional invasion/ethnic cleansing.</p>

<p>Russia intervened and prevented a genocide.</p>

<p>The reaction of USA/Israel and its poodles in Europe (looking at you, Poland) was predictable yet horrifying: they have stated in their news programs on TV that it was Russia that started the war... and that they were the invaders!</p>

<p>In fact that whole propaganda campaign got me back into blogging (for my 10 readers :), as I simply could not take the bullshit anymore.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my Ossetia collection - this is a replay of that war:</p>

<p>In fact, the Georgian invasion happened on the day of the opening of the Olympics (obviously the Ukrainian &quot;popular uprising&quot; is running behind schedule - Sochi is now over).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t &quot;encouraged&quot;.  That is too weak a statement.</p>

<p>It was on CNN, FOX, NBC, ABC, CBS, MSNBC that &quot;Russia has invaded Georgia&quot;.  And nothing about Georgian invasion, on the 1st day of Olympics, into Ossetia and the bombing of civilians (watch the vid I posted of Georgian tank crews woohoo-ing as they demolish civilian buildings).</p>

<p>On my blog, I have posted articles from Reuters et al about American advisors (1500) and Israeli advisors (from &quot;private&quot; security companies, like this guy <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zatwz/israeli_special_forces_fight_to_protect_kiev/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zatwz/israeli_special_forces_fight_to_protect_kiev/</a> ) who were working on a timetable (the advisors in Georgia own words) because soon the Georgians will be in some &quot;real military action&quot; (again, their words).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame you for being unaware - it was on every channel, 24/7, that &quot;Russia has invaded Georgia to overthrow Western friendly government!&quot;.  It reminded me of Gleiwitz (&quot;Poland is invading us! Nazi Germany must retaliate!&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This all happened a little before I really started paying attention to geopolitics and whatnot. Also I tend to use weasel words because going all out when talking to people who generally don&#39;t question official narratives/what western MSM pumps out can alienate them and doesn&#39;t help when trying to bring them over to your way of critical thinking. Maybe &#39;propagandised&#39; and &#39;distorted&#39; are more accurate terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s important not to swing to the other extreme either. Ukraine is genuinely split - the turmoil is not purely the result of US provocations. Many Ukrainian protesters died and they didn&#39;t give their lives for their love of the United States. </p>

<p>President Yanukovich was a thoroughly corrupt individual - a Russian puppet who was hated by the majority in Western Ukraine. The fact that he was &quot;deposed&quot; by the elected legislature is not an undemocratic coup.</p>

<p>So I would urge everyone to see that there a many shades of grey in this situation. Spare a thought for the millions of Ukrainians who are terrified at the thought of once again being vassals of the Russian state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The commoners perception of Ukraine compared to Syria is different though, people dont give a shit about Syria because as far as theyre concerned its just another Muslim vs Muslim war that the west shouldnt take sides in, which is true to an extent but they dont know how much the west and its allies already support one side. The narrative for Ukraine is different and more easily sold. ie. Ukrainians are civilized people who deserve freedom from the evil dictator Putin. As if a real revolution would ever be supported by the US admin who would have shot and jailed &quot;protesters&quot; a lot quicker if they started throwing molotov cocktails and wearing military gear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not some guy with a big official list. it&#39;s all automated software. It started out as Echelon in the 70&#39;s, branching into  Omnivore and Carnivore in the 90s, and now pretty much everyone is in the game: Facebook, Google, you name it. I just naturally assume that as the decades passed, the monitoring systems became more sophisticated. I just naturally assume that the government can know our social networks pretty much instantly (most people give that information for free) and can tell when we&#39;re using alt accounts by using algorithms that detect similarities in our text patterns such as word usage/frequency/typos/grammatical errors and idiosyncracies etc. The lists are automatically generated and stored; &quot;the guy&quot; just pulls them up when he needs the information. All of this information is so easily verifiable and factual that to question whether it exists is not to suggest conspiracy: questioning if it exists, is to question simple, verifiable facts.</p>

<p>Being mindful of what you post or discuss in public, out of fear of a police state, is one of the fastest ways to encourage the police state to take hold. If everyone is too afraid to ask questions, we may as well just delete this subreddit; what&#39;s the point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t tell if devilishly clever or if you are honestly positing that. </p>

<p>I can easily consider a situation in which it is possible:
There are Ukranians who do not wish to be invaded by Russia. We know the belief that Russia may or is soon to invade Ukrane is a fear that exists in Ukrane, as their acting president just issued a earring to Russia against this very action. I reason that Ukranians who do not wish to be invaded would use any reasonable tool or resource at their disposal. We can reason that Ukranians would consider the friendship of the west as among these because they signed an agreement with the US, Great Britain, and Russia in 1994 that garenteed the Ukranian borders in exchange for the destruction of their nuclear stockpile. Russian movements that seem to abandon this agreement would not convince a reasonable Ukranian that GB and the US have abandoned it as well, and so they might appeal to us and out citizens to act.</p>

<p>I can conceive that this is possible, so it makes me curious of OP&#39;s thinking, who acts like this is impossible. Can OP and the others on this thread imagine such a possibility? What are their reasons for dismissing it? I can&#39;t imagine that Ukranians are so concerned with US interventionism that they would not ask for out help on principle. In fact, I would think US Interventionism would convince many Ukranians that we are bound to interfere in some way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though slightly tangential, I noticed that there is a anti-Russian bias in stories and even ads lately.</p>

<p>One ad which I caught a few nights ago was some silly M&amp;M (candy) commercial. It begins with a sophisticated, well-dressed Russian surrounded by his entourage, opening the door to the back seat of a limo. The Russian, in a menacing voice says (in Russian with English subtitles) &quot;I will chop you up into many pieces&quot; (pause), &quot;then I will sprinkle you overt ice cream&quot;. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t go further (he is talking to an m&amp;m character), but I was just surprised how blatantly the ad firm painted a Russian leader to look like an evil and depraved figure... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia landed on the wrong side of the argument this time. Now is the only time Ukraine has an opportunity to be free and independent, but they need to do two things: Keep the Russians from splitting their country in two, and stay away from the EU debt slavery. We need to support them in these two things. Yes, there has been manipulation from the West, but also from Russia. We need to be positive about this opportunity though, negativity and skepticism aren&#39;t going to help Ukraine right now. Now they have to fight to keep Ukraine.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re against things like empires and one world government, you need to apply that to Russia as well. Ukraine needs to be Ukraine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What happened in Crimea is that after what happened in Kiev,local government of Crimea decided to take their region under their own control,with fears of western-ukrainian protesters coming to Crimea to take over,the local military forces,mainly consisting of ethnic russians decided to not follow Kiev&#39;s orders and instead those of the Crimean government, as a result they were the ones who took over the airport and the governmental building this week. Now with Crimea wanting to break apart from Ukraine,Russia decided to stop that,as they dont want Ukraine to splinter off (without Crimea, there will be less ethnic russians who will vote for a president who can me more pro-Russia, as a result,there will be less chance of pro-russian parliament appearing in Ukraine). So Russians decided to send their troops to the autonomous region to make sure they don&#39;t break off and western ukrainians wont cause even more ruckus by going there and trying to take over.</p>

<p><strong>Ban self-posts re:Ukraine</strong> no real conspiracy content anyway other than we know USA probably fanned (and is fanning) the flames.</p>

<p>There really isnt much any of us can do but sit back and watch the chess game evolve, will it turn WW3? I doubt it but Russia surely must be getting close to calling enough of the USA&#39;s bullshit, prodding and meddling. There is the opportunity to outplay USA once again though, this time, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t tell if devilishly clever or if you are honestly positing that. </p>

<p>I can easily consider a situation in which it is possible:
There are Ukranians who do not wish to be invaded by Russia. We know the belief that Russia may or is soon to invade Ukrane is a fear that exists in Ukrane, as their acting president just issued a earring to Russia against this very action. I reason that Ukranians who do not wish to be invaded would use any reasonable tool or resource at their disposal. We can reason that Ukranians would consider the friendship of the west as among these because they signed an agreement with the US, Great Britain, and Russia in 1994 that garenteed the Ukranian borders in exchange for the destruction of their nuclear stockpile. Russian movements that seem to abandon this agreement would not convince a reasonable Ukranian that GB and the US have abandoned it as well, and so they might appeal to us and out citizens to act.</p>

<p>I can conceive that this is possible, so it makes me curious of OP&#39;s thinking, who acts like this is impossible. Can OP and the others on this thread imagine such a possibility? What are their reasons for dismissing it? I can&#39;t imagine that Ukranians are so concerned with US interventionism that they would not ask for out help on principle. In fact, I would think US Interventionism would convince many Ukranians that we are bound to interfere in some way. </p>
