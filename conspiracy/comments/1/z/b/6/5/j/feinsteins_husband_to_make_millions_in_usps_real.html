      <p>
       The US has entered into a contract with a real estate firm to sell 56 buildings that currently house U.S. Post Offices. The government has decided it no longer needs these buildings, most of which are located on prime land in towns and cities across the country. The sale of these properties will fetch about $19 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       A regular real estate commission will be paid to the company that was given the exclusive listing for handling the sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       That company is CRI and it belongs to a man named Richard Blum. Richard Blum is the husband of Senator Dianne Feinstein. (Most voters and many of the government people who approved the deal have not made the connection between the two because they have different last names).
      </p>
      <p>
       Senator Feinstein and her husband stand to make a fortune (EST at between $950 million and $1.1 billion) from these transactions. His company is the sole real estate on the sale. CRI will be making a minimum of 3% and as much as 6% commission on each and every sale.  All of the properties that are being sold are all fully paid for. They were purchased with U.S. taxpayers dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S.P.S. is allowed free and clear, tax exempt use. The only cost to keep them open is the cost to actually keep the doors open and the heat and lights on. The United States Postal Service doesn't even have to pay county property taxes on these subject properties.   QUESTION?   Would you put your house in foreclosure just because you couldn't afford to pay the electric bill?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the folks in Washington have given the Post Office the OK to do it. Worse yet, most of the net proceeds of the sales will go back to the U.S.P.S, an organization that is so poorly managed that they have lost $117 billion dollars in the past 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one in the mainstream media is even raising an eyebrow over the conflict of interest and on the possibility of corruption on the sale of billions of dollars worth of public assets. How does a U.S. Senator from San Francisco manage to get away with organizing and lobbying such a sweet deal? Has our government become so elitist that they have no fear of oversight? And it's no mere coincidence that these two public service crooks have different last names; a feeble attempt at avoiding transparency in these type of transactions.

       The USPS isn't being privatized.  They're selling no-bid contracts to process the sale of existing properties to a Senator's husbands' real estate company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post office buildings aren't services, they're pieces of property, plain &amp; simple.  USPS will sell off these properties, downsize it's work force, "misplace" the proceeds from these properties being sold, then cry to congress about how they need more funding.

       A Feinstein/Blum owned construction company also got the $1B contract to build the first leg of the California High Speed Rail Project. Another coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Many liberals support Senator Feinstein because of her left politics and strong stance against guns. No one knows her true agenda, but she is a "statist" in the most criminal definition of the word. She is a Monster.

       Ron Paul seems pretty legit to me. But he got screwed over to during the 2012 elections. Just go watch some of his videos on YouTube - what he says just makes sense.

       I disagree.  Ron Paul says a lot to appease people but his policies amount to nothing but massive deregulation and corporate giveaways.  Of course I could be wrong.

       What do you mean by corporate giveaways? Genuinely asking. From what I understand, he is basically for small government and individual liberty. Stuff like decreased government spending (foreign aid, military) de-crimilization of drugs etc.

       Long winded explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, he hijacked a very popular and sensible libertarian philosophy to advocate for less regulations on big business, which is code for degrading environmental and worker protections, under the propaganda of 'free market' economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no free market, and whenever government has deregulated in the past it has been VERY good for corporate interests (they don't have to spend as much money cleaning up after themselves or paying a living wage to employees) and VERY bad for people like you and me.  Deregulation is a political codeword for giving corporate interests the right to pollute, integrate toxic and untested chemicals into their products, destroy communities, and generally do whatever they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two examples: we 'deregulated' banking by nullifying the Glass-Steagall act and then went on to have the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression.  Normal people lost jobs and homes, banks got a bailout.
      </p>
      <p>
       More recently, we 'deregulated' by exempting oil and gas operators from the clean water and clean air acts.  Now fracking operations have poisoned many people's water supplies, caused life threatening illness, and destroyed vast areas of our environment for generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my humble view, corporations are the problem since they are legally mandated to put profits ahead of people, and giving them free reign to do whatever they want under the guise of libertarianism is an insane solution.

       I definitely agree with him there.  It's a shame our country cuts social programs claiming we don't have any money and then spends 100s of billions on the military.  I read 'war is a racket' a few months ago and strongly believe the military industrial complex is a huge monkey on our back.  But Obama said a lot of nice things too about ending wars, then once he got into office he did exactly the opposite, ratcheting up drone strikes and our military presence around the world.  There's just no accountability for politicians.  They can say whatever they want to get elected, but those platitudes mean little when it comes time to implement policy, unfortunately.

       I must get hold of that book. Ya Obama was saying he'll take the troops out of Iraq straight away. Gets elected - suddenly troops must stay for a while. That's evidence to me that he's not really the one in power.

       Well first of all, what you call "deregulation" doesn't result in fewer regulations, and regulations are primarily beneficial to mega-corps, and harmful to small companies, as regulation increase the overhead cost of compliance, increase barriers to entry, and limit competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporate giveaways, I don't even know where you're getting that, what is Ron Paul trying to give away? The onus is on the person who makes the claim to prove it, and you have claimed that Ron Paul is for corporate giveaways, which means now it's your job to demonstrate
       <em>

       Ron Paul supports corporate giveaways. I'll wait.

       stop being so adversarial, can't we just converse like normal human beings?  check out my response above for two instances where 'deregulation' amounted to massive giveaways to large corporate interests.  my thinking is that you don't get to be a politician without accepting a boatload of money that always comes with strings attached.  most of these guys are very adept at saying all the right things, but their actions speak louder than their words.

       Okay, no.  The USPS is being required to pre-fund all health benefits for anyone who will retire in the next 75 years.  You know, including people who aren't even born yet but will start working there in about 40 years.  No other government agency has this ridiculous requirement.  This is the primary reason they are losing money, not because they are "poorly managed".  The assets are basically only needing to be sold because of this requirement.  People benefiting from this is one of the more blatant conspiracies you'll ever see.

      <p>
       Nope, there's a lot more to their operating costs than just lights, heat and labor.  Each P.O. essentially operates as a mini distribution hub which has to be serviced in multiple ways.  Which tack on to the operating cost.  Mail volume has dropped drastically, there's really no reason for them to maintain the costs and the logistics network to support them with so low numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your 4 hubs are operating at half or less capacity, doesn't it make sense to consolidate them down to 2?
      </p>
      <p>
       And brings me to point #2
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        an organization that is so poorly managed that they have lost $117 billion dollars in the past 10 years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You suggest the P.O. keep their doors open while losing money for said offices and then rag on them for being poorly managed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the 117billion loss over a decade (can we get citations for these massive numbers when we make these claims please? I don't doubt it in this case, but citations are always nice.) isn't because they are poorly managed.  They have issues sure, but they are a public service business.  They are actually required to service all areas even if it's not economically feasible to do so.  They also have/had exemptions on competing with private competitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres also the fact that government entities can make money in ways unique from solely private ones.  Where a loss in the books is actually a gain in the big picture.   So that 117billion is probably a lot smaller if perhaps non-existent when you account for the economic growth attributed from full service low cost shipping available from U.S.P.S.   They do need the downsize though and it should come extremely quick.  Shipping being as low volume as it is now with the growth of the internet.  Their business will shrink further as 3d printing becomes more viable, making shipping even less relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I will bite at the wtf of the 75 year health benefit pre-fund they have to do for their employees.  That just fucking baffles me.

       In conclusion, fuck Feinstein, I really wish my state would get rid of her already.  She's out of touch and heavily corrupt

       Why are you figuring in overhead for keeping the buildings.  Is they're sold they're obviously not going to be used for USPS work, right?  If they sit empty you don't need the overhead you describe.  Yeah, Feinstein is an evil one.

       Nope. Blum will not profit that much from this deal:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is true that in 2011, the Postal Service entered into an exclusive contract with CBRE Group, Inc., to sell off billions of dollars of USPS properties.
       </p>
       <p>
        But CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate firm, is not owned by Blum, nor will he see direct income from the sale commissions. Blum is merely the board chairman of the company, which actually employed over 22,000 people last year. And according to a March 2013 corporate report, Blum made a total of only $157,000 last year for serving in that capacity. The commissions on the post office sales will not directly line Blum’s pockets.

       I must get hold of that book, is it a good read? Ya Obama was saying he'll take the troops out of Iraq straight away. Gets elected - suddenly troops must stay. That's evidence to me that he's not really the one in power, someone else is telling him what to do.
