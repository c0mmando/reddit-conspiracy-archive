       I certainly was naive but there is one idea I can't shake despite the lack of evidence. I don't expect it to be a popular one with this sub but ill throw it out there anyways. Chances are he's just another politician with the same agenda under a different label.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the major things that won my support was his pledge to seriously scale back the extent of the PATRIOT act, or eliminate it entirely. After all he had served as a professor of constitutional law, and must have seen the merit of the constitution. Yet only months into his presidency he started backpedaling on the issues. I remember in some press conference he said something along the lines of "In light of the threats we face, these laws are important to our safety" in a way that suggested what he knows now (as president) changed his stance on the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could there be some HIGHLY classified reason that might have caused him to have a change of heart? That perhaps we face a threat a free society is not adept to overcome. I have thought of a few possible situations, yet none of them seem to fit into this puzzle very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some imperfect possibilities
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Contagious epidemics similar to, or worse than, the 1917 influenza crisis could arise at anytime and martial law would be our only hope for containing it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Climate change research is being manipulated to DOWNPLAY the threats posed to the world. We are already too far gone to stop it and in a matter of decades not centuries it bring the end of the prosperous civilizations we know today. Suppressing knowledge, preventing widespread awareness, arresting activists and disinformation campaigns are the only way to prevent  chaos from breaking out as things start a downward spiral.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some sort of extra terrestrial threat.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         For any combination of reasons things are just so fucked up that all the government can hope to do is prevent total anarchy when things begin to collapse.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Feel free to share your theories on what might be enough of a threat to cause a change of heart by Obama.

       the thing is, every politician promises things exactly the way obama promised them. he just had a better PR team and better organization than most.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you don't believe me, watch some old footage of campaign promises made by other politicians, particularly other past U.S. presidents. running for public office on a national level is all about making up and promising shit that you have absolutely no intention of carrying out, because that's what people want to hear. this is unfortunately the way that the world works.

       perhaps in a different world....where everyone in the general public was informed on all issues....

       i didn't vote for obama, if that's what you're trying to imply? the act of voting helps legitimize the system in the eyes of most people, and should be avoided if one does not support it.

       This is politics 101.  They talk out of both sides of their face.  And if they are talking, you can all but guarantee they are lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is clear proof that our government is not running the show.  That regardless of the chief administrator, the course ALWAYS remains the same.  It's because those who truly run the US are jot voted in every 4 years.  They are permanently installed.  A coup occurred when Kennedy was murdered.  And those intelligence officials responsible still run the show to this very day.

       I wouild welcome a president who openly stated that since he got into office he has been aware of threats or nuclear bomb smuggling or other things that are so possible  and would be so devastating that he has had to accept the survellience he didnt like when he ran.

       Just about how the political system really works...I was a democrat, my parents were democrats, until about a year after Obama took office, I got turned on to the movie Zietgeist. After I saw that I really just started doing research about the political system and how it really works and have changed my political views to more of a Libertarian view now.

       Dont feel bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Young voters always fall for the idea that the guy who happened to come along during their first voting years is different than the old guard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing happened to young people when reagan came along in the 1980's. He sounded like obama sounded to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that when you crjticise those who voted before you..
It takes a few presidents before you relaize the truthful ones are always the ones that the media make seem like the crackpots.

       If they are running the psychological ruinationation destruction pr against them they are real threats. They reserve the psychological distaste pr for the real threats.

       If it is a personal attack that makes it absolutely ridiculous to support them so you are ashamed to tell your neighbor you voted for them then tbat is the person who is being setup for a takedown becuase that person really will challenge the status quo.

       Yeah, I believed it for a while. Then I borrowed his books off someone, read a few chapters and put my hopes to rest. Anyone who thinks they can address race issues without addressing war on drugs is a snake or a moron, and he doesn't sound like a moron. Same with american reputation overseas/American foreign policy, income inequality/economic policy etc. Let's make the poor people rich and the rich people even richer! It's totally possible, shut up reality!

       Seriously, those books were chock full of that sleazy laminated hopey dreamy noncommittal pablum, I'm amazed anyone read them and thought - 'here's the guy!'

       I am not American but I remember watching his campaign speeches and feeling great when he beat Clinton in the primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't take long for though, when he was inaugurated and I read his day one list of appoinents, my heart sank. Tim geithner? Oh f### what have we done. 
 I knew on that day how dishonest he had been and how bad the next 8 years would be. In a very real way, it left me heartbroken.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a lesson that stuck. For better or worse. Though I supported Ron Paul and watched his campaign with the same enthusiasm, I was never fully able trust him. Part of me expected that if he did win, he would betray our faith too in the same way. I was in some sense relieved when the nomination was stolen from him, at least it proved that he was genuine on some level, Unlike the placating drone striking robamabot puppet who runs your country now.
