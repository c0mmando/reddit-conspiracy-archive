Mods took the wind out of the sails in every way they knew: deleting for no reason, removing others on account of it being a &quot;repost,&quot; then allowing some to surface and then tagging it with &quot;opinion/analysis,&quot; and then finally letting one surface during the off hours knowing that it would get buried once people started posting new stuff in the morning. Oh, and I think the article that finally made it didn&#39;t even contain all of the PPT slides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep submitting these stories to r news and others so I can have evidence shall we ever need it. I document when I submit where else on reddit has that link been submitted to and how long it last before its removed. The stories I have done so far have all been consistently removed after and elapsed time after posting. 10 minute for EXAMPLE. Also all the post have had similar amounts of downvotes at time of removal. Unless there are people who sit in new and downvote these one after the other it can&#39;t be a coincidence that these all get a downvote less than a second after each other. I hope to reverse engineer or at least get some hints on what they are doing and specifically how so we can point and pick out marketers in comments and submissions from real accounts. Once I get a lot more data il post</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit can be manipulated easily too. If a suspicious world news story breaks, governments can distract reddit with planned posts to AdviceAnimals, aww, pics, etc. Surely they would have upvote/downvote bots at their disposal. </p>

<p>They could also distract or try to manipulate us with scheduled IAMAs. That dodgy Morgan Freeman one comes to mind. </p>

<p>Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. </p>

<p>Who cares who posted the article first, the important thing is that the information is seen by the people.  If the second one has blown up then let it run and don&#39;t manipulate it.  Seems counter intuitive to delete or mess with the position unless you are trying to hide or bury something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It used to be possible to check if a user was shadowbanned or deleted by checking the json; wherein a shadowban would populate the json and a deleted account would render a 404 error.</p>

<p>However, I think reddit admins silently changed this behind the scenes. As<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/potato_in_my_anus/about.json"> this account of an older poster I know to be shadowbanned</a> renders a 404.</p>

<p>In summation, absent the original poster of those comments coming back under an alt we won&#39;t be able to figure out if he was shadowbanned or deleted himself.</p>

<p>I will say that when you see the username of a comment deleted, but the comment stands, it is often the case that the user deleted his own account. Usually as a result of constant PM abuse which goes ignored by the admins.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There may be a nuance to this arguement:  </p>

<p>Greenwald is not a shill, he is legit, Snowden is not a shill, he is legit, however someone inside wanted this information out, so put Snowden in a position to be able to do exactly what he did.  </p>

<p>You better believe that Snowden was profiled to hell before he was employed by someone like Booz.  So he was essentially allowed to get out, and the information was allowed into the public domain, they are trying to suppress the stuff that&#39;s a little more on the damaging side, but really, they want everyone to know they are watching, because a lot of people already knew anyways, anyone that mattered that is...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, these rules aren&#39;t even the issue.</p>

<p>Rule 10 only changed in the sense that we clarified that calling someone a shill or a troll is also considered a person attack.</p>

<p>It has always prohibited against attacking the users, the community as a whole and the mods.  The only reason that anyone is making a big deal about is because there was a change and the opportunity is ripe to try and stage a rebellion and continue to disrupt the community.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s &quot;face it&quot; every time we adjust to rules, the trolls adjust their tactics to continue to disrupt.  And every time we adjust the rules we get a little bit closer to the best recipe of success.  I can&#39;t help bit notice that this latest adjustment has really panicked the horde of trolls.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1yu84v/greenwalds_latest_the_shills_are_real/cfobgfw">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1yu84v/greenwalds_latest_the_shills_are_real/cfobgfw</a></p>

<p>Here is the actual link to the warning you got, where you implied twice that I am a cunt.  Your whole objective here is to disrupt this greenwald conversation.  These rule changes were discussed to death in a sticky post a few days ago and now something as huge as this greenwald post is here and suddenly its a good time for you to start kicking a dead horse.</p>

<p>Its painfully obvious that you want to be able to scream SHILL!  TROLL! RETARD! From your various accounts because it is a low effort way to disrupt.</p>

<p>Those days are over.  Adjust your tactics or give up.  Personal attacks will not be tolerated here.</p>

<p>Harvard Law Professor Cass Sunstein, a <strong>close Obama adviser</strong> <strong>and the White House’s former head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs</strong>, wrote a controversial paper in 2008 <strong>proposing that the US government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo-”independent” advocates to “cognitively infiltrate” online groups and websites</strong>, as well as other activist groups.</p>

<p>Sunstein also <strong>proposed sending covert agents into “chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups” which spread what he views as false and damaging “conspiracy theories” about the government</strong>.

    <div class="md"><p>You think that&#39;s bad? Another of Obamas White House advisors (the Science advisor), John P Holdren made recommendations in his book called Ecoscience that make this look like child&#39;s play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>• Women could be forced to abort their pregnancies, whether they wanted to or not;
• The population at large could be sterilized by infertility drugs intentionally put into the nation&#39;s drinking water or in food;</p>

<p>• Single mothers and teen mothers should have their babies seized from them against their will and given away to other couples to raise;</p>

<p>• People who &quot;contribute to social deterioration&quot; (i.e. undesirables) &quot;can be required by law to exercise reproductive responsibility&quot; -- in other words, be compelled to have abortions or be sterilized.</p>

<p>• A transnational &quot;Planetary Regime&quot; should assume control of the global economy and also dictate the most intimate details of Americans&#39; lives -- using an armed international police force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is completely real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Subscribed to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> after seeing the shitstorm on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> earlier last night. I&#39;ve always thought there was a lot of truth in conspiracy theories, and that the &#39;crackpot&#39; theorists that came along with the rest were a worthwhile price to pay for the intelligent, if slightly paranoid scrutiny of the majority of conspiracy theorists. Like, keeping a check on things.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve never really committed to believing in theories myself - I&#39;ve seen lots of very <em>convenient</em> concurrences but I would never say I had anything more than a vague hypothesis, and not much solid evidence...</p>

<p>But now in the wake of all this, I&#39;m starting to realize that a lot of conspiracy theories are not only more <em>real</em> than I&#39;d ever imagined, but could personally affect me instead of being some distant thing that might have slight consequences on my life through the economy, etc. but never really interact with anything I experience in a big way.</p>

<p>So yeah, new subscriber checking in. I&#39;d really like it now if someone could tell me how I can best help protest these outrages. I feel like most of the time I see some big issue that <em>should</em> make me ultra-paranoid but instead I just grumble and feel passionate about it for the few minutes I&#39;m reading the thread, but then promptly distract myself with everything else on Reddit and go back to being oblivious. (And that in itself seems like an unhealthy habit because I&#39;m effectively training my own mind to be begrudgingly accepting of unacceptable news. Sort of like how every time YouTube updates, everyone says they&#39;ll take action, but no one ever does, so now YouTube basically knows that they can do whatever the fuck they like, and as long as they change things slowly enough, people will stick around because they&#39;re too lazy to feel strongly about changing anything...)</p>

<p>Anyway sorry, I get longwinded sometimes. I dunno if anyone will read this. Hope someone does I guess, but if not <strong>TLDR</strong> Hi! I&#39;m new and subscribed!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term conspiracy &#39;theory&#39; is designed to make people think nutters are just pulling stuff out of the air as some kind of weird hobby whereas the vast majority are regular people, some even academics doing real research and uncovering evidence (not theorising!) but don&#39;t expect anything to see the light in mainstream media no matter how clear cut, it&#39;s controlled and has been for decades if not longer.. see operation mockingbird on that.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know, that Wolfgang Halbig guy talking about Sandy Hook makes me think those in the right line of work may be able to get stuff done through legal means (if a judge can be found who is not corrupt).  I&#39;ve also heard talk of a possible coup in the US relating to the 260+ military commanders that were fired.</p>

<p>The rest of us, well I guess we have to be creative if we want to make a difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Im working on presentations that I hand out in my area in populated areas. I was also thinking about hosting some events as well. I think the best way to handle this is to think about your area of expertise and work from that angle in small ways little by little to bring about change. Trying to do big projects outright that have a huge time investment have a way of discouraging.
I have a hunch that sometime soon a lot of us are going to have plenty of time on our hands to do real activist work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me but you have it all wrong.</p>

<p>Joe six pack doesn&#39;t care <em>because he doesn&#39;t know</em>. See, our neighbor Joe here goes to work everyday, and when he comes back home he is exhausted. Joe though wants to know whats going on with the world while he was at work. He sinks into his couch and flicks on CNN. Joe has been watching televised news for a while, <em>he trusts this source</em>. Or for his news, Joe opens up Internet Explorer 9 to his yahoo homepage and checks out the front page. &quot;Oh Kate Middleton dressed her son up as a punk kid! How cute.&quot; Then Joe jerks off and goes to bed, only to start the cycle again in the morning. </p>

<p>Sadly, this is most of America. They receive their news from the propaganda machine we call corporate media. Think about this for a second, our government fucking pressured tech companies to install backdoors into their products... our government must also have the power to pressure news outlets into reporting what they want. </p>

<p>The Hegalian Dialect is more like if I post an opinion that is polar opposite to yours in order to undermine your viewpoint. We had a guy here called &quot;myconspiracyname&quot; who did that very often. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s still around somewhere. </p>

<p>Hegel has some notion of this society wide discursive process in the form of his history, but it&#39;s really not until Adorno and Horkheimer(and their descendants) that a fully fleshed out criticism of Bernaysian manipulation was really flushed out in proper historical context. </p>

<p>The idea is that by positioning yourself in such a way wherein you entrench the thesis (as it emerge in history), you can subvert/obfuscate/weaken the emergence of the antithesis. Therein rendering an artificial synthesis which is nothing more than a control structure casting itself with a new face. In this way the form of the dialectic has been subverted and rendered useless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I see that and believe it..</p>

<p>..my perspective on this is that the NSA is working (and paying in at least one case) these agencies to perform operations on American citizens so the NSA can claim plausible deniability, while NSA infiltrates the other FIVE EYE citizens, and thus GCHQ et al can claim plausible deniability there. Similar to this <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents">cooperation</a> - this one really scared me.</p>

<p><em>NSA Worked Out Deal With GCHQ To Spy On UK Citizens, Secretly Expanded It
from the funny-how-that-works dept</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early on in the Snowden leaks, it became clear that the NSA and its UK equivalent, GCHQ, had a very close relationship, sharing lots of data with each other. We noted a convenient potential byproduct of this collaboration: while, technically speaking, NSA isn&#39;t supposed to spy on Americans and GCHQ isn&#39;t supposed to spy in UK citizens, if they spy on the others&#39; citizens and then share the results, they can get around that loophole. </p>

<p>But we didn&#39;t know about this without proof until it was released. We&#39;ve had stuff in the past after COINTELPRO but just thinking we know isn&#39;t enough to really know is it now? We need evidence so we adjust our position from &#39;knowing&#39; as you put it to really knowing.</p>

<p>What people need is evidence. We don&#39;t need to be spoon fed information, we need evidence from the source that it&#39;s happening so it puts an end to speculation. It&#39;s no good saying &quot;shills exist guys&quot; without offering evidence. People have seen stuff from the past and even recently and it&#39;s a long (and strongly) help position in the conspiracy community that it existed and that conspiracy theories were and are a target. I fully agreed with that and this new information does no harm at all by it being revealed. We need this information which fills in this gaps between past operations and now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this on another thread in response to a post addressing Zionism but it is related to anything.</p>

<p>Zionism is just an ideological poster to assist the destructive assertions of wealthy corporate entities ultimately serving the economic (power) interests of the Rothschilds and their associates. Christian Evangelicalism and Radical Islam are used in the same fashion, especially in resource rich regions such as africa, middle east etc. &#39;Zionists&#39;, are really just another branch in the Rchild&#39;s money hoarding network, they are discreet and downgrade there existence as a driving political force, unlike the Vatican, one of their compliant rivals (money hoarding network). Most of the world&#39;s economies are dominated by the Rchilds and countries that aren&#39;t, tend to have violent replacement of government until they do; Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Ukraine, incoming Venezuela.
North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Russia are independent, China, India, Brazil and their allies have significant independence but are still influenced. A global economic unification is imminent, though no king rules forever and the Rchilds will lose power as new industries (New forms of energy, advanced internet and space technology) and a new corporate elite will emerge to overthrow them.
It will gradually occur but it will happen, the institute that is the Vatican has been operating since Augustus, though they may have changed their face and creed, thrived for thousands of years due to the delay of civil progression, but because our society has rapidly accelerating civil progression, they won&#39;t be able to last too long. This is why conservatives and fascists exist to purposely degenerate the progress of civilisation so the feudalistic oligarchies and monarchies can maximise the time of rule.
Essentially, the group of Money hoarding networks such as the Rchilds (and banker/corporate associates, Rockerfellers, Morgans etc.), Vatican, House of Saxe-Coburg/European Monarchies, Saudi/Islamic Monarchies etc. are currently in a loose alliance (not exactly loyal to each other) to dominate the world and snuff out other Money hoarding networks such as the Russian Oligarchy, Iranian Shia Islam, Chinese Oligarchy etc.
Money hoarding networks = Nobility, Nobility = Top of the Food chain
Part of the basic principles of Feudalism. We are not a democracy, we just democratically elect representatives who all serve the same feudal nobility, which barely changes.
Edit: We cannot break this system, we have been living in it since the dawn of civilization, it is how society functions and will remain like this until trans-humanism, we need a dominant minority to command the masses.
If you&#39;ve ever played WoW, this is the basic concept of the Lich King, and when Arthas died this is why Bolvar Fordragon had to replace him, because the mindless scourge (zombie army) will be too destructive and rampant without a selfish ruler to manipulate and direct them in order to achieve a purpose. The only thing we can do is try to maintain a Lich King that is less evil malevolent and psychopathic, replacing Lich Kings that refuse to accept their time is over and retain power for an extended period.</p>

<p>This is why we are experiencing censorship and such, it is the circle of life, kings don&#39;t want to allow their children to replace them, thus seeking the fountain of youth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to point out something that may not be obvious.  This sub is highly managed using sophisticated software which notifies agents when certain topics arise.  If you wish to get your topic past the &#39;new&#39; queue, avoid using keywords and instead find creative ways to spell out the word/topic.</p>

<p>A simple example of this is here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zoge0/everything_you_need_to_know_about_chemtrails/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zoge0/everything_you_need_to_know_about_chemtrails/</a></p>

<p>This post has highly valuable information but it is easily targeted and supressed since it includes &#39;chemtrails&#39; in the topic.  We may nee to start getting creative with titles.  Just a suggestion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, we know it is happening. Let&#39;s talk about how we can fight back.  There is no possible way systematically defaming political dissidents threw libel, fraud, and &quot;false flag&quot; attacks can be legally justified.  Somehow this should end up in the Supreme Court.  Of course we shouldn&#39;t rely on that corrupt bunch to stop this, but a legal fight would certainly bring it to the public&#39;s attention.  Right now they are just doing this in the shadows.  We need to force them to defend what they are doing so it can be met with the scrutiny it deserves.</p>

<p>This is just one idea. Let&#39;s hear some strategies for subverting the subversion of free discourse on the internet!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is only one solution and it would send most of this sub into a paranoia fuelled uproar. Some would claim it as boat and switch but there&#39;s only one way that it would work:
1) issue every ISP with the credentials to create &#39;internet passports&#39; for every user. This would be the end of anonymity on the internet but it would mean no more sock puppets. It would also be the end of trolls, criminals, shills and sock puppets.
2) all content submitted by an individual would be traced to their internet passport. If someone is spreading disinfo, misinfo, criminal activity etc then they could effectively be traced and blocked from internet communication. </p>

<p>Can you all see why that would never happen? </p>
