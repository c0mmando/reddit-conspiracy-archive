    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Freemason and everything is about doing good. In fact, those who wish to join are investigated (mostly involves an in-home interview). Anyone convicted of a felony can be booted out or prevented from joining via voting.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ll find within the lodge are a small sub-set of guys who join to advance their careers; these are the guys who don&#39;t take it seriously and shortcut the work. The majority are in it for the good of the fraternity. The membership is made up of people within the lodge&#39;s area, meaning if you&#39;re in a blue collar neighborhood you&#39;ll have more blue collar members. At my lodge, one of the highest populated in the state, we have people from a wide-variety of backgrounds.</p>

<p>The secrets, once you learn them, don&#39;t involve anything negative. The secrets are there to prevent non-members from simply saying they are a member. Put it this way, you can&#39;t just pass the Tiler on your way into lodge with a handshake. Actually, someone claiming to be a Freemason can quite easily be ousted by a true Freemason.</p>

<p>Lastly, although the elements of Freemasonry seem odd at the present-day, that wasn&#39;t the case hundreds of years ago. A big part of Freemasonry is focused on history, storytelling and knowledge and it&#39;s the oldest fraternity in the world.</p>

<p>Why I joined: Son of a Past Master and I love its challenges/rewards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freemasonry today at its lower levels is more of a &quot;good ol’ boys&quot; network geared toward advancing the careers of fellow Freemasons through business contacts with other Freemasons.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with blue collar stoneworkers and everything to do with white collar businessmen looking to join the Brotherhood to gain insider contacts to further their careers. </p>

<p>The  proponents of the Great Plan  use the  upper levels  of  Freemasonry to  pull the strings  from behind the scenes of our national governments, international banks, and multi-national corporations. This is because Freemasonry, at its upper, upper  echelon of  degrees, is the  primary modern day housing of the ancient Babylonian Mystery Religion, secondarily resting with the upper echelon of the Unholy Roman Empire.   It is only the upper 1% or less of all Freemasons that know what the 
true intent of their organization historically was and is. The multitudes of lower rank-and-file Masons, mostly &quot;Blue Lodge&quot; Masons, have no idea they are being used as pawns  to help set up a one world government. </p>

<p>The proponents of the Great Plan rarely, if ever, recruit from the lower levels of Freemasonry. All of their upper echelon minions consist of the various bloodline families who have always been involved with the Luciferian secret societies  and  those  rogue independent personalities  who  have proven themselves highly valuable to their agenda.  Point of fact, nearly all Freemasons are in fact honorable men who believe their organization is  for good and wholesome causes, at least this is what they are coerced to think. This harkens back to both the Knights Templar and the Rosicrucians putting up a diabolical  façade to fool people into believing they are only dedicated to  good deeds and to question them is nonsensical when in fact a great deception has taken place yet again.  </p>

<p>There is also a direct connection between Freemasonry and the ancient Babylonian Mystery Religion, and that is the fact  that Freemasonry regards King Nimrod as the  first Freemason for his &quot;masonry prowess&quot; he employed in undertaking  the construction of the Tower of Babel.  This  is  a carefully planted deception, trying to  hide  the true nature of Nimrod’s significance within Freemasonry. This is also an implication of King Nimrod as the head architect of the Great Plan, for if you tie all of the symbolism involved in Freemasonry such as the hexagram, the all-seeing eye, the obelisk, and on and on it all goes back to Nimrod and  the occult Babylonian Mystery Religion. I would say that the varying quotes of the Freemasonic &quot;prophets&quot; fully admitting Lucifer is the god of the Freemasons should convince you of the true evil intent of the people running the  Freemasonic Great Plan  and their goal of a Luciferian one world government, exactly as stated in the Bible.</p>

<p>As recently as the spring 2006 issue of Freemasonry Today (a sanctioned Masonic publication) we are publicly told that King Nimrod, not King Solomon, was the first head of Freemasonry:   </p>

<p><em>&quot;The universal sentiment of the Freemasons of the present day is to confer upon Solomon, the King of Israel, the honor of being their first Grand Master. But the legend of the Craft had long before, though there was a tradition of the Temple in existence, given, at least by suggestion, that title to Nimrod, the King of Babylonia and Assyria. It had credited the first organization of the fraternity of craftsmen to him, in saying that he gave a charge to the workmen whom he sent to assist the King of Nineveh in building his cities.&quot;</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Freemasonry today at its lower levels...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, so Freemason, here... Let me inject some reality.</p>

<p>This is how most anti-Masonic fantasies start, and to someone not familiar with Freemasonry it seems to make sense, but it&#39;s based on the assumption that Freemasonry has an &quot;upper level&quot;. It does. Many of them. In fact, every nation and some sub-national regions (such as each US state, The District of Columbia, Scotland, England, etc.) have their own Grand Lodge which operates autonomously, relying on the mutual recognition that they share as a way to maintain the guiding principles (&quot;Landmarks&quot;) of the Fraternity.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is more of a &quot;good ol’ boys&quot; network geared toward advancing the careers of fellow Freemasons through business contacts with other Freemasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such motivations are, if revealed, grounds for rejection of an application. There are plenty of business networking clubs out there that we&#39;ll point you toward if you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The proponents of the Great Plan use the upper levels of Freemasonry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upper levels of what parts of Freemasonry? A state&#39;s Grand Lodge? Which one? They have a hard time deciding to all issue a press release, much less coordinate an international agenda!</p>

<p>In order to accomplish what you suggest, an organization would need to span many Grand Lodges and have sufficient power external to Freemasonry to exert their control within it. Essentially, such an organization would need to <em>already possess the kind of coordinated power that you suggest</em> and therefore would not need Freemasonry in order to accomplish its goals. Instead, it would make far more sense to ignore the Fraternity and focus on direct control of real power structures such as seats of government and media. Why focus on the guys who wear funny outfits and talk about morality when you can buy yourself a political campaign or exert media pressure by buying up newspapers and television networks (not that anyone has done that...)</p>

<p>And, of course, if you look, you will see evidence of that taking place quite in the open with no need for the help, and little concern about the hindrance, of Freemasonry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is because Freemasonry, at its upper, upper echelon of degrees</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This trips on a few problems. First, the degree system stops at the third degree. From there, there are three primary bodies to which a Freemason may apply to continue learning, but to which of those do you refer?</p>

<p>The other problem, and this is a doozy, is that you&#39;re implying a system of &quot;rank&quot; to the degrees. While this is true when it comes to the first three degrees, it is not true with regard to those of the additional bodies of Freemasonry (Scottish Rite, York Rite and Shriners International). A Master Mason is a Master Mason, and regardless of what additional degrees they may have attained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nearly all Freemasons are in fact honorable men</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks... I guess...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freemasonry regards King Nimrod as the first Freemason for his &quot;masonry prowess&quot; he employed in undertaking the construction of the Tower of Babel ...

<p>You&#39;re quoting a research article that was discussing myths and legends. I was, in fact, titled, &quot;The Early legends of the Craft: Legends and Myths.&quot; There&#39;s quite a lot of legends and myths associated with Freemasonry. That&#39;s because we use stories based on historical sources and religious scripture to compose allegories by which we discuss more complex truths such as the duty of a man to his family, nation, faith and all mankind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would say that the varying quotes of the Freemasonic &quot;prophets&quot;</p>

<p>No such thing. We aren&#39;t a religion.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish what you suggest, an organization would need to span many Grand Lodges and have sufficient power external to Freemasonry to exert their control within it. Essentially, such an organization would need to already possess the kind of coordinated power that you suggest and therefore would not need Freemasonry in order to accomplish its goals. Instead, it would make far more sense to ignore the Fraternity and focus on direct control of real power structures such as seats of government and media. Why focus on the guys who wear funny outfits and talk about morality when you can buy yourself a political campaign or exert media pressure by buying up newspapers and television networks (not that anyone has done that...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your entire rebuttal is a strawman as it consists entirely of arguments <em>you</em> made up that were not expressed by &quot;PopeEstSatan&quot;. He never said that whatever other organization that exists out there is bigger or larger than freemasonry, nor did he say that freemasonry was an integral cog in their plan.</p>

<p>Can you see why it&#39;s so disappointing to note your incredibly pointed (but entirely irrelevant) rebuttals?</p>

<p>Do you understand why someone might call it disingenuous?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only is Nimrod considered to be the first Freemason and Masonic leader, some initiates of Freemasonry are required to take the &quot;Oath of Nimrod&quot;. Are you beginning to connect the dots on this? The Oath of Nimrod is part of the initiation process for the &quot;Indentured Apprentice&quot;, which is the first degree of Freemasonry. The oath reads as follows:  </p>

<p>Apprentice Degree (1st). </p>

<p>I, _______, do in the presence of El Shaddai and of this Worshipful Assembly of Free Masons, Rough Masons, Wallers, Slaters, Paviors, Plaisterers and Bricklayers, promise and declare 
that I will not at any time hereafter, by any act or circumstance whatsoever, directly or indirectly, write, print, cut, mark, publish, discover, reveal, or make known, any part or parts of 
the Trade secrets, privileges, or counsells of the Worshipful Fraternity or Fellowship of Free Masonry, which I may have known at any time, or at any time hereafter shall be made known 
unto me. </p>

<p>The penalty for breaking this great oath shall be the loss of my life. </p>

<p>That I shall be branded with the mark of the Traitor and slain according to ancient custom by being throtalled, that my body shall be buried in the rough sands of the sea a cable’s length 
from the shore where the tide regularly ebbs and flows twice in the twenty-four hours, so that my soul shall have no rest by night or by day– </p>

<p>When someone says, &quot;the ... of Freemasonry,&quot; it is generally assumed that they are speaking of mainstream Freemasonry as embodied in. In some cases, it&#39;s reasonable to also include the groups chartered by recognized authorities, but no longer recognized for historical purposes. But it&#39;s really not reasonable to treat any organization that has ever used the term, Freemasonry, as equivalent. To what were you referring?</p>

<p>The organization you refer to is not &quot;Freemasonry&quot; as you referred to them. The Blue Lodge degrees begin with Entered Apprentice, and the Blue Lodge <em>is</em> mainstream Freemasonry.</p>

<p>Now that group you linked to is one that I hadn&#39;t heard about, and for the most part that&#39;s because they haven&#39;t been active in the US until recently, but based on the use of the word, &quot;operative,&quot; I&#39;m guessing that they have a connection to the guild houses in The City of London, but that&#39;s a guess. If you don&#39;t know what those are, I highly recommend CGP Grey&#39;s YouTube video about The City of London as opposed to the surrounding city, London.</p>

<p>How can I put something in context for you when you disregard what I say out of hand? I <em>did</em> put a great many things in context. You took a couple of words and dismissed the rest as disinformation without any evidence. You find a name in an allegorical tale from a fringe group and declare the entire organization to be disciples of a long-dead religion. That&#39;s your idea of context?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;Profane&quot; simply means outsider. We welcome the profane to come inside. We hold open meetings, open houses, tours and public events. Stop by!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so anything you say is a lie to confuse and deceive.</p>

<p>Remember when I mentioned confirmation bias and fear?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never lied about Freemasonry and I answer honestly any question put to me. I will admit that I don&#39;t know things when that&#39;s true (and have, here) and I will admit that I cannot answer when there&#39;s a confidence involved. I think that&#39;s all one can ask for in public discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s true of every organization from McDonalds to the Catholic Church. The question is: does the organization work to contain or embrace &quot;the nasties&quot; as you put it, and how successful is it? I find that Freemasonry, so far as I&#39;ve seen, has some brilliant mechanisms for containing any damage done, and a core set of values that make it difficult in the first place.</p>

<p>Top on that list really has to be the autonomous aspect of the Grand Lodges. If a Grand Lodge goes &quot;rogue&quot; (it has happened) then the damage stops at its borders. In the US, that&#39;s a state. For much of the rest of the world, that&#39;s a nation. Once the problem is addressed, the Grand Lodge is once again recognized by its peers.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve pointed out in other threads, a hypothetical conspiracy that was capable of subverting lots of Grand Lodges at once would have to start out with enough power and influence that going after Freemasonry would be pointless. You&#39;d already be in a position that the Fraternity would have nothing to offer, and you&#39;d have to deal with a bunch of do-gooders who don&#39;t want any part of your nefarious plans in order to accomplish your goals.</p>

<p>It would be much easier to simply go effect whatever ends you had in mind using the same resources that you would have used against the Fraternity.</p>

<p>what do-gooders were ever plagued with conspiracies?</p>

<p>All of them? The thing that people tend to forget is that Freemasonry has been around for 300+ years in its current form and has counted millions of men as members in nearly every nation on Earth. There are no organizations that have existed that long and not suffered all sorts of rumors and even the occasional bad actor.</p>

<p>The real question is: is there anything fundamental about Freemasonry that&#39;s problematic, and from my exposure to the Fraternity from the inside, I&#39;d have to say, &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p>You can&#39;t come up with a better anecdote than that? </p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t think all do-gooders ever are plagued with conspiracies. This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, do you see anyone talking about charities?</p>

<p>I see people talking about the Catholic Church all the time. They are a supposed do-gooder, if you ignore the systemic child abuse. So I&#39;m hoping you have some better anecdotes than what you&#39;ve offered so far.</p>

<p>The worst part is, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d think anyone would respond to you in a proper fashion when you make such an outrageously disingenuous point. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ok - this doesn&#39;t serve as evidence of the fact that do-gooders are always plagued with conspiracies. Freemasonry is in question already so there isn&#39;t a point in looking to it for evidence in this context. What you are looking for is an example of a charity that was unfairly plagued by such rumors. </p>

<p>Ok. That&#39;s nice for you. Does nothing to dissuade anyone of the intents of an organization of whose members are sworn to life against revealing inner secrets. </p>

<p>Charities are a huge deal around here! Basically, if it&#39;s ever had any problems, it&#39;s branded a source of malevolent corruption. Try googling with &quot;site: reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot; for the name of any given charity that&#39;s been around a while.</p>

<p>I&#39;m here all the time - if it&#39;s so obvious why don&#39;t you bother with the links yourself? Charities are rarely discussed here and if <strong>all</strong> charities were plagued with conspiracies (like Freemasonry is) then you would see <strong>every</strong> charity discussed here. From a glance at the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, that&#39;s obviously not the case!</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t give a shit what you think. But if you are going to say things here, you can at least make sense. All I&#39;ve done is point out the logical shortcomings in your rhetoric. If you want to pretend that means there is something dark and secretive about Freemasonry, then fine. But that was <em>your</em> suggestion. <em>Not mine!</em></p>

<p>Why are you so upset? I&#39;ve been nothing but cordial with you and I try to answer as many questions as I can. You seem to be fixated on either coming to the conclusion that Freemasonry is &quot;plagued by conspiracies&quot; or that I&#39;m too stupid to engage in any kind of meaningful debate.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you illiterate? I mentioned how your post was insultingly disingenuous and you take that to mean you are cordial??</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t. You don&#39;t respond on topic and only seem to care about minor details that aren&#39;t related to any main point. </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to illustrate how you are too stupid to engage in meaningful debate because you haven&#39;t and appear to be either incapable of doing so or outright unwilling. </p>

<p>I never came to the conclusion that freemasonry is plagued with conspiracies. That&#39;s the hypothesis of the OP and you as well. You&#39;ve said that like every other charity they are. I contested that and pointed out that your reasoning didn&#39;t even make sense. You are now concerned about the fact that I think your inability to offer a cogent argument reflects a lack of... something in you. </p>

<p>You seem to be unwilling to admit that there are very few charities that are as plagued by conspiracies as Freemasonry is. Why is that? Of course the charities that ARE plagued by conspiracies (Red Cross) are well known TERRIBLE charities that do nothing good with the money given to them. </p>

<p>So which camp is freemasonry in? The one that you posit exists but actually doesn&#39;t? Or the group that they obviously do exist in. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like no matter what I wrote, you&#39;d respond with something that A) has nothing to do with my point and B) doesn&#39;t actually make sense. Did you even read the sentence after the one you quoted? How am I to take you as a genuine or literate when I point out how insulting your post is to <em>anyone&#39;s</em> intelligence and you take that as evidence of your conversational kindness. </p>

<p>Rants or not, you are delusional if you think you were actually engaging in conversation. Don&#39;t mistake my impatience for conversation on <em>your</em> part. This is evidenced by your very post here. Your disingenuous invitation to have further conversation is only as good as your willingness to respond to any of the dozens of other things I asked you about <em>besides</em> your ability to read (which is obviously questionable considering what you&#39;d decided to bring up in &#39;conversation&#39;).</p>

<p>That depends on who you talk to. I know some Masons who are very much about the deeper meaning of our Craft. I know others who are there for the social aspects and the buffet dinner. It takes all kinds.</p>
