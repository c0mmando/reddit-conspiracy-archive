        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: I do not understand why a genuine, honest question about the nature of conspiratorial activities would get downvoted in a sub devoted to conspiracies.   I am getting disheartened; I just want answer like (most of) you. </p>

<p>I mentioned in a thread the other day that perhaps it was- and I did not call it a coincidence- but maybe some kind of subconscious connection to the fabric of humanity.</p>

<p>I said this- in sincerity- because <em>that</em> feels/seems/sounds <em>just</em> if not sadly <em>more</em> likely than a group of people HIDING &quot;clues&quot;? Warnings? </p>

<p>If you look at my post history, or know my prior user name around here, you know that I support this sub, I support open rational thought, fact seeking, and KNOW that conspiracies abound. </p>

<p>I am simply asking for each of your views, ideas, thoughts on things like &quot;Sandy Hook town on Map in Batman&quot;--- is the most plausible answer that.....a designer was told to put the name there? He thought it would be amusing and knew a tragic conspiracy was planned? He was brainwashed? </p>

<p>I just would like to understand why- when my suggestion that these dates were being subliminally chosen by writers due to some inexplicable mental thread of humanity that none of us can claim to grasp was stomped on and mocked- it is <em>more</em> acceptable to believe that....what? A few people said &quot;Let&#39;s use the date of the next false flag event in our movie?&quot;  </p>

<p>Were they paid to do it?</p>

<p>If so, why?</p>

<p>Again, all I am saying is...I dont know, and I&#39;d like to hear people&#39;s arguments for what THEY believe is the reason. </p>

<p>Oddly, I can only come up with 2 possible causes for the dates/names and other &quot;forewarning anomalies&quot; --- and each seems just as odd, bizarre, amazing and scary as the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. There would need to be a &#39;study&#39; done, showing dates on birth certs, IDS, checks etc. in all movies and then cross referenced with major events.</p>

<p>If there is repetition, it is worth noticing. If it is spread relatively evenly among random dates, then we are only finding things because we are looking for them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know where/how to START, but it would be a very very interesting study!</p>

<p>And what I&#39;m asking some of my fellow subscribers, is why, you know?</p>

<p>Or is it a part of a &#39;plot&#39;? If this is the case, then why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on what hypothesis you entertain. I think with all of this we know that there is a a spectrum of dominance and control, and that a certain corrupt movement/type of corruption most definitely sits somewhere on this spectrum, as it necessarily has to. This question as to the intensity and scope of the corrupt elite and who/what they are is the basis of all of my investigation. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know for sure where I sit, but I do know that the majority of the public is completely oblivious to the potential for nefarious corruption on a global scale. So on the one hand we can observe that seemingly everybody can be manipulated into predictable habits and reactions (false flag operations, media scandal, demonizing of countries, demonizing of religious groups, mass marketing, school) whilst on the other hand it&#39;s quite obvious that power seeking sociopath&#39;s have existed for some time now. Then consider the seemingly exponential increase in technology and world connectivity that IS the  most important thing for any control seeker to control, as well as the observation that corporate power is likely over time to fall into fewer and fewer larger hands...CONTRASTED against a gullible and habitual group mind consumption society...I think the potential for influence is the highest it&#39;s ever been.</p>

<p>As to whether this kind of thing could exist, it seems to me that average person is uninterested and unaware of: The inherent absurdity of human existence / the history of human evolution and our place in it / the crazy trajectory we are on as a planet / the dichotomy of evil and goodness and where they originate from etc. My point being that the universe is fucking crazy but the banality and repetitiveness of working for a living and being stuck to clock time has severed people&#39;s awareness of the infinite potential of the universe to spit out the unexpected. </p>

<p>With this in mind I don&#39;t think it is insane at all to expect domination over other humans (control/evil) to reach some kind of  natural peak, especially when the world seems so unaware. </p>

<p>If &#39;they&#39; control the banks, the media, the movies, the law etc, and are also in the habit of using dark magic and the power of numerology as some people argue, then perhaps these are not coincidences at all. </p>

<p>As for why, maybe cumulative bombardments of subliminal suggestions regarding significant occult numbers are felt to be a necessary addition to events with &#39;their&#39; name on it. Maybe they feel they NEED to suggest somehow what they&#39;re up to, like the bad guys always do in the films they make about them. Maybe it&#39;s just too tempting not to slip a little something in considering a) the scope of control b) the immediate lack of credibility anyone is awarded when trying to claim things like this exist. </p>

<p>I agree with you though, it&#39;s fascinating!</p>

<p>You repeat a lot of my ideology. I don&#39;t think we can look at facts on this topic of nefarious powers of sociopathic evil groups atop a military industrial complex WITHOUT taking into consideration things that are difficult to discuss, explain, understand, or even get people talking about intellectually (the more psychological end...to the occult....to the mystical... To the transdimensional...) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha YES! glad we found some common ground. And yeah I completely agree, the conversation needs to be approached from so many different levels and entertained without getting derailed for being too abstract or far out.</p>

<p>On the planetary level, I wonder if all of this is just a natural symptom of sentient beings in our stage of development. Maybe this is some planetary karma that we must purge to reach higher levels of consciousness, and in that way it&#39;s not so bad in the long run. </p>

<p>On the mystical side of  things, I think it&#39;s interesting that a dark magician would use symbols and conscious intent to create &#39;dark energy&#39;. Bearing that in mind, it would seem quite natural for a practitioner of the dark arts to see mass media and the music industry as THE platform for utilizing the potential power of occult symbolism!</p>

<p>Like you said, the psychological, the occult, the mystical, transdimensional...this thing seems to incorporate everything that it is to be human, including the chance for redemption. </p>

<p>Probably because Lebowski is a <em>hippy</em>. He&#39;s anti-Establishment, and the TV broadcast serves as a counterpoint to that. This is still in the first few minutes of the film, after all. The hippy movement was all about peace and the end of war.</p>

<p>&quot;Now this here story I&#39;m about to unfold took place back in the early &#39;90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad&#39;m and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there&#39;s a man... I won&#39;t say a hero, &#39;cause, what&#39;s a hero? But sometimes, there&#39;s a man.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishing_shot">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishing_shot</a></p>

<p>This is echoed later when the &quot;Big&quot; Lebowski tells him that he failed and that the &quot;hippies lost&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Big Lebowski: &quot;Your revolution is over, Mr. Lebowski. Condolences. The bums lost. My advice is to do what your parents did; get a job, sir. The bums will always lose. Do you hear me, Lebowski?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The movie is definitely deeper than I would have realized when I was a teenager. There are messages, threads, trends and concepts that juxtapose its ridiculous nature very nicely, in an existential sort of banality-of-everything way that I liked, even before I took a closer look at certain parts of it.   </p>

<p>My question was--- why that date? Why in a movie that was written and released before 9/11/01 was that the date on the check? Sheer coincidence? Maybe. And if so, <em>that</em> is interesting.  And if not coincidence, <em>that</em> is interesting.</p>

<p>I looked up the part about The Shining where people say the little boy&#39;s &quot;Apollo 11&quot; sweater has hidden meaning. </p>

<p>Turns out, the costume designer&#39;s friend knit the sweater and gave it to her. </p>

<p>Wrong. </p>

<p>Cue people saying, Who was her friend? Of <em>course</em> they&#39;d sayyyyy that. etc. </p>

Regardless of where she got it from, it was used.  And highly likely that Kubrick demanded the outfit, and she obliged.

    <div class="md"><p>Upon considering this scene today, it occurs to me that later in the movie Lebowski&#39;s landlord mentions that he&#39;s overdue on rent.  That might be a bad cheque he was passing at the store.  Maybe the parallel is that GBsr was writing a cheque that he couldn&#39;t cash too.</p>

<p>The narration speaks of men for their time, not heroes exactly...  maybe just like how Jeffrey needed some items from the store no matter the cost, maybe GBsr&#39;s actions are viewed as necessary by some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was to show his IDGAF, broke, &#39;whatever&#39; mentality and write a check for a ridiculously small amount of money which is a social faux pas but really, why not? </p>

<p>It is more the question that people kept asking of &quot;why <em>that</em> date?&quot;  </p>

<p>Why not have him write that check, during that scene, during that speech, and have it say 5/29 or 3/14 or something. Just curious what the opinion was of people who HAD an opinion on it.  But, good introspection on your part there. A lot that writers put into movies is unintentional as it is subconscious, a reflection of their thoughts and opinions that even after they look and notice, &quot;Wow, I did that? Yeah that makes sense for me, for who I am.&quot; </p>

<p>Let&#39;s play hypothetical then.

Is it a group who knows? Do they know each other knows? Do you think they talk about it?</p>

<p>Then, getting down to the logistics of getting something like, the date on Lebowski&#39;s check paired with the background of Bush speaking. Let&#39;s say. Does the owner of the production house make sure to tell his minions to get that in there? I&#39;m just trying to see how this would play out logistically if it were true, that&#39;s all. </p>

<p>As far as reason, it&#39;s either totally random, and are two dates selected out of 500+ instances of dates that have been displayed in movies, or otherwise it may be deliberate.  If it is deliberate, the date may have been chosen to &quot;telegraph&quot; an emergency situation in the movie (as in calling 911 for an emergency) or it may have been selected for other reasons.  There is no way to know.  We don&#39;t even know how often other dates are displayed in movies or what their distributions are, but you would need at least that before you try to build any sort of case.  All in all, even if you researched it to the max, it would still be a weak case.  At best you would have data that show that 9/11 occurs in culture more than other dates.  But even that would be circumstantial, thus near-worthless.</p>

<p>It happens to literally every single thread in this sub. There is another sub dedicated to burying this sub. That&#39;s why, it&#39;s nothing personal.</p>

<p>As for the symbology...Personally I tend to chalk these up to coincidence or people playing games more than anything, but I&#39;m open to the idea. I just don&#39;t get why someone would want to leave clues about what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the idea of the serial killer. In almost eveyr movie they have some sort of signature that they leave on the body to create a chase...this almost never happens in real life. The signature is usually a result of how they kill or deal with the victim, people committing heinous crimes generally don&#39;t leave clues leading towards their detection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, right and right.</p>

<p>As for killers&#39; signature- that is a very good analogy/comparison that I hadn&#39;t looked at (and I am from the criminal justice world so I like it).</p>

<p>A signature is something the killer HAS to do to achieve their emotional / sexual/ sadistic/ thrill impact from the kill. Their MO (their modus operandi, the way they commit the murder) can change, adapt, to avoid detection.</p>

<p>Signature is what the killer does that he or she gets off on, taking a token, leaving a mark on the body. Sometimes this signature makes it appear as if the killer is taunting the authorities &quot;Catch me if you can!&quot; when really his reasoning is personal, it is part of his essence, it is written in who he is as a killer.</p>

<p>MO is necessary to achieve his end-- signature is what he does for the thrill. The unnecessary little acts that give it a personal flavor.  </p>

<p>So, in that concept, maybe it is a societal signature... We use 911 to signify emergency. So movies are more likely to use 911 as a date. And so criminals, war/political/terrorists are also more likely to personally sign off using a 911 symbol bc it holds cultural meaning.</p>

<p>So, like a killer&#39;s signature &quot;drawing the letter C on the victim&#39;s forehead&quot; or something, this can look like - to the police-  &quot;damnit he is just taunting us with clues!&quot;  when in FACT...... it is what he is doing for his PERSONAL gratification. Something totally within him, an inner drive. </p>

<p>Hmm.... a lot to explore on this topic. A lot of sociological and psychological studies can be done on why and how writers/filmmakers/screenplay writers choose dates and times, numbers of things etc. </p>

<p>For ex.  in The Shining, the little boy is wearing a sweater in the bathroom &quot;red rum&quot; scene I think that has APOLLO 11 sewn on it.</p>

<p>Prompting cries of &quot;fake moon landing!&quot; or &quot;NASA message!&quot;</p>

<p>When, really, a friend of the costume designer for the movie, allegedly sewed the sweater and thought it was a boy of that age at that time would like, and they used it.   Thus, a societal event, that was embedded in the knitter&#39;s subconscious to use for a typical child, but then the viewer puts his own skew on it. </p>

<p>Who knows. This could go in circles for days!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;ll admit that the video is pretty mind-blowing at first glance, but some quick searching turns up the truth.</p>

<p>This is a quote from Zoologist Desmond Morris:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So are these endearing mammals truly artistic? The answer, as politicians are fond of saying, is yes and no. </p>

<p>Let me describe exactly what happens. A painting session begins with three heavy easels being wheeled into position. On each easel a large piece of white card (30in x 20in) has been fixed underneath a strong wooden frame. </p>

<p>Each elephant is positioned in front of her easel and is given a brush loaded with paint by her mahout. He pushes the brush gently into the end of her trunk. </p>

<p>The man then stands to one side of his animal&#39;s neck and watches intently as the brush starts to make lines on the card. Then the empty brush is replaced by another loaded one, and the painting continues until the picture is complete. </p>

<p>The elephant then turns towards its audience, bows deeply and is rewarded with bananas. </p>

<p>The paintings are then removed from their frames and offered for sale. They are quickly snapped up by people who have been astonished by what they have just witnessed. </p>

<p>To most of the members of the audience, what they have seen appears to be almost miraculous. Elephants must surely be almost human in intelligence if they can paint pictures of flowers and trees in this way. What the audience overlooks are the actions of the mahouts as their animals are at work. </p>

<p>This oversight is understandable because it is difficult to drag your eyes away from the brushes that are making the lines and spots. However, if you do so, you will notice that, with each mark, the mahout tugs at his elephant&#39;s ear. </p>

<p>He nudges it up and down to get the animal to make a vertical line, or pulls it sideways to get a horizontal one. To encourage spots and blobs he tugs the ear forward, towards the canvas. So, very sadly, the design the elephant is making is not hers but his. There is no elephantine invention, no creativity, just slavish copying. </p>

<p>Investigating further, after the show is over, it emerges that each of the so-called artistic animals always produces exactly the same image, time after time, day after day, and week after week. Mook always paints a bunch of flowers, Christmas always does a tree, and Pimtong a climbing plant. Each elephant works to a set routine, guided by her master.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here&#39;s a better video showing how the &quot;trainer&quot; is helping to guide the elephant as it paints</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is a number of things But I don&#39;t believe these things are intentionally inserted due to foreknowledge.</p>

<p>I believe in a universal knowledge that every man, woman and child has access to. I think our concept of time is irrelevant so we conceivably have access to information from the past, present and future. Thinking about someone and they call you. Dejavu. Gut feelings, etc. </p>

<p>Regarding 9/11, the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. I think that attack was such a huge blow to the psyche, that it reverberates through time and subconsciously affects people yet they don&#39;t know why. The Lone Gunmen episode where a high jacked airliner is flown into the Twin Towers. I don&#39;t believe that someone knew that was going to happen so they wrote a script as a warning or just wanted to put it out there to let us know that there is a higher power here on Earth that has diabolical plans and they are so powerful that they can tell you their plans and there isn&#39;t a damn thing you can do about it.</p>

<p>And a lot of this stuff is just being more aware of certain events, like Sandy Hook and then you notice references to it because you are looking for them. Like when you get a new car and suddenly notice how many of them there are.</p>

<p>Finally, this sub (r/conspiracy) Is full of shills and debunkers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole dates in movies thing is stupid. There&#39;s a lot about this sub I don&#39;t get. Everyone is so smart and into looking for real answers to things that are sketchy until &quot;HUR DUR SANDY HOOk IN BATMAN&quot; happens and then I can&#39;t take anyone seriously. ):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, I know. It is ridiculous and silly and foolish, but that is kind of why I asked it.</p>

<p>If very intelligent, intellectual, thought provoking and articulate adults are entertaining these ideas..... no matter their truth, or validity- there is merit in asking why? Where does their truth stem from?</p>

<p>Why do they believe what they believe?</p>

<p>When I see people ask about dates in movies or little nuances of &quot;hidden clues to a tragedy&quot; in a music video....  I wonder ... Do these same people with very sound, logical political views also believe that a group of people sit around a table and plot &quot;Let&#39;s have Beyonce hold her hand like <em>this</em>. Yeah! Good clue! That&#39;ll be hilarious/evil/cool!&quot;  </p>

<p>I was really wondering why people who thought that way think that way.</p>

<p>And I guess, I don&#39;t really have an answer, and I don&#39;t know WHAT I think.</p>

<p>But, I do know that like I commented earlier:</p>

<p>It is interesting if so many movies used the date of 9/11 prior to the events of 9/11 occurring COINCIDENTALLY in a higher statistical rate than using any other random date. </p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>It is ALSO interesting if it occurred NOT by coincidence.</p>

<p>So, either way, I&#39;m intrigued.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of like how Aleister Crowley&#39;s movie rendition of his book Moonchild was found on top of Adam Lanza&#39;s things in his room? Signature things &#39;they&#39; can&#39;t help but do? Maybe.... I&#39;ve seen too many strange things in real life to rule anything out. Truth is stranger than fiction.</p>

Since it is on zoom it is &#39;foggy&#39; but you can see that it is Moonchild. (which I had to Google the title of, and can you imagine my face when Google returns:  MOONCHILD ALEISTER CROWLEY&quot;. <em>jaw dropped</em>)</p>

<p>Ok-- Here you go: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is actually a DVD of the movie Moonchild. </p>

<p>There are a lot of very randomly placed items in the basement photos of the house, where it appears Adam is purported to have been sleeping. There is a bed, with 1 sheet, 1 pillow, an old tv and the windows covered with black trash bags taped up. </p>

<p>Quite a sad scene down there. It looks like photos of where a kidnapping victim is held. Not a home at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t look like he lived there. I am not speculating (yet) as to his whereabouts or his status (dead/alive), or where he was/is living etc etc.</p>

<p>What I will say is that from these pictures, and the state of the house, I do not believe Adam Lanza was residing there at the time the pictures were taken. </p>

<p>It also does not appear that the shower which Nancy Lanza would have allegedly been using was used as there is a dried peeled up corner of the shower floor. I have to look closer, but there are parts of the house that look very out of use. </p>

<p>In many ways it is beginning to remind me of the school, and vice versa. </p>

<p>As if someone took a home, and a school, that were used in the 90s, based upon contemporary decor, clothing, purchases, etc.  and then went vacant, and suddenly reoccupied them for a few months to a year. (Lanza had receipts and bills from 2011-2012) and then....  Gone.  </p>

<p>That is how each appears based on the totality of what I have seen so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was this experiment, I think it is still ongoing and forgive me but I forget the name. It involved random number generators all over the world. If I recall it was run out of Princeton, or maybe another Ivy League school. They started seeing a trend on the morning of 9/11 where they had a surge of non-random numbers being generated that spiked at about the time the planes hit the towers. The theory is that there is a collective unconsciousness and it somehow had an effect on the number generators. Oh, wait, that&#39;s it: Global Consciousness Project. Search 9/11 and you can see the spike for yourself. Check out other disasters and major events like tsunami. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like Star Wars, when Obi Wan says &quot;I felt a great disturbance in the force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.&quot; That&#39;s exactly what happened on 9/11.</p>

<p>Anyway, my personal belief, not supported by anything, but perhaps the GCP data, is that some things are so psychically powerful that the ripple backwards in time in whatever global consciousness there is and they show up in what we see as coincidences in movies and folded dollar bills.</p>

<p>We live in relatively apathetic times, so when something gets attention- positive or negative- just any type of credence, it is worth looking at. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>sigh</em> I know. And I don&#39;t disagree with you. Coincidences/statistical anomalies have always fascinated me, and so yes apophenia is the cause but it is also sometimes that part of the brain which causes apophenia that allows us to make <em>meaningful</em> connections.  The problem becomes sifting through the crap to find the few things that are meaningful, and why/how that is so. </p>
