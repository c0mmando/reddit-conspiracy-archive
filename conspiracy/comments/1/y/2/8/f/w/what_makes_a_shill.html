<p>It seems like it&#39;s quite easy to ignore contrary evidence and opinions if they are constantly labeled as being from shills.</p>

But don&#39;t call them a shill unless you have good evidence they are being paid.  Other people reading your post will assume you are accusing them of being paid, and think you are making claims you can&#39;t back up.  You only make yourself look silly.</p>

<p>Because I feel that looking at the other perspective gives me a better perspective as a whole as it lets me take it all into consideration, if i just flat out refused to look at other view points then I would be small minded and my opinion could never be changed which would mean that I could be wrong about something but never realise because I would be so smallminded. It is the same as looking at another political parties manifesto to see if their policies apply to you and help you decide who to vote for.</p>

<p>To which I answered yes, also earlier I established that by follow I meant believe not understand and so implied that I do in fact understand the theories posted here.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not rocket science, at most I need a GCSE level understanding of science, cursory knowledge of structural engineering however most theories and their counterpoints often explain them in laymens terms so probably aren&#39;t needed.</p>

<p>I am very interested in why you&#39;ve decided to attempt to de-rail this post when my original question was about the usage of the word shill but you&#39;ve instead decided to turn it into a questioning of my reasoning for being here which is irrelevant as I haven&#39;t tried to argue theories or break any rules.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned I&#39;ve explained myself more than enough and if you want to question me more then you&#39;re out of luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you call some one else a shill, you are claiming that you know the person must be getting payed to be on reddit.  Even if you don&#39;t mean to make that claim, you are making the claim when you call someone a shill.</p>

<p>However, many people fling this insult without thinking, and it makes them look like paranoid fools.  I have pointed out to people that they are calling people &quot;shills&quot; without any good proof they are being paid, and they make up silly excuses.  They say thing like &quot;If they&#39;re not a paid shill, then they&#39;re an unpaid shill.&quot;  the problem is that &quot;shill&quot; specifically means a paid confederate.  If you are going to use the word &quot;shill&quot; to refer to unpaid people, few people are going to understand what you are talking about.</p>

<p>The truth of the the matter it is next to impossible to tell a paid Jewish shill from a unpaid Jew who just likes to defend Jews.  It is next to impossible to tell a paid Monsanto employee from a college biology major who just likes genetically modified crops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bottom line is that calling someone a shill is ad hominem. The end result will always be that the conversation turns away from the topic at hand. The original argument is never resolved. Neither party will be able to convince the other of their position or stance. And the accuser opens themselves up to being ridiculed for using name calling.</p>

<p>Whenever I&#39;m tempted to &quot;call out a shill&quot; I remind myself to stay on topic. If they REALLY are a shill they want you to resort to name calling and/or emotionally fueled rants. Both of which are easier to &quot;debunk&quot; or &quot;de-legitimize&quot; your stance.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve ran into a post where someone uses the old &quot;conspiracy nut&quot; or &quot;lunatic&quot; line to dissuade the audience from paying attention to an individual&#39;s opinion or analysis of a topic. People wouldn&#39;t use this tactic unless they knew it was effective.</p>

<p>My point is that you can easily counter &quot;shill&quot; behavior by not falling into the traps that are laid for you. As long as you remove emotion from the equation while dealing with facts others will listen.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it&#39;s also sometimes invaluable to ignore replies from individuals who only intend to &quot;draw out a conversation&quot; in order to pick apart your character. If you don&#39;t talk with them they cannot use your words against you or drown out your message through &quot;reply spam&quot;. </p>

<p>Does any of this make sense? I&#39;m just saying that there&#39;s no real &quot;battles&quot; to chose. Avoid battles all together. Shouting matches never result in positive change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly what I&#39;m talking about, it hurts the chances of people taking you seriously if you aren&#39;t open to debate and act like you wont even consider other peoples opinions or stances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, when I see someone use the word &quot;shill,&quot; I frequently find they are argumentative people who are unable to conceptualize that people can honestly have a different opinion than them.  If you disagree with them, they assume you must be deliberately twisting the truth and you deserve nothing but insults.</p>

<p>It is often best to avoid talking with people that uses the word &quot;shill.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worth noting that you get a very similar effect in the other direction; go into a &#39;conventional&#39; science or history sub and start talking about relatively uncontroversial issues like Tesla or the USS Liberty and there will always be someone ready to frame you up with the tinfoil hat and alien brain implants. I think it&#39;s just tribal wiring overcoming imagination. (nb the distinction between &#39;there will always be someone&#39;, and &#39;they will always&#39;).</p>

<p>Other times I think people here use the word &#39;shill&#39; when they should be using the word &#39;troll&#39;. A shill is cynically promoting an agenda; a troll just wants to fuck with people. The conspiratard crowd falls squarely into the latter category.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it wouldn&#39;t surprise me greatly to find out that there were real live paid shills posting here, but I&#39;ve yet to see anything approaching solid evidence. Of course there are the crusaders, the &#39;liars for jesus&#39; type; I guess you could try and categorize them as a sort of &#39;volunteer shill&#39;, but I&#39;m not sure it helps much to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like I said, if you don&#39;t view other opinions you close yourself off to changing your views and stay close minded when you could be missing an argument or piece of evidence that could make you completely re-evaluate your view point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like always voting for a political party with complete disregard to polices and voting for them purely because you&#39;ve done it before and don&#39;t want to admit you voted for the wrong party.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why viewing other opinions doesn&#39;t make sense to you.</p>
