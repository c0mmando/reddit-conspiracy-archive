       So, just coincidentally this morning, I happened to notice an account history page on Reddit that shows an ip address log of where your account is being logged in from. I opened it up and to my surprise, my Reddit account is apparently being actively used or monitored by the NSA and DoD. I then proceeded to Google the ip addresses and locations and compare them against all of my social media accounts and lo and behold the Government has decided I am a very interesting person and is actively monitoring all of them. Not only that, but my new Android phone, which I very much hate, is also being routed through the DoD. What bothers me is that this is obviously only the stuff they purposely intended to let me know they are monitoring - so who really knows what is being recorded in secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts on the situtation:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        My plan is to cease and close all social media activity at this point. Any post you see beyond this is not me. In fact, if it didn't come from in person - it wasn't me.
       </li>
       <li>
        I am now ashamed to ever have held a position at NSA or worked for the government in that capacity.
       </li>
       <li>
        I feel responsible for ever contributing to this big brother nanny state that feels the need to capture the data of private citizens like myself.
       </li>
       <li>
        I will be destroying all of my data stored in the cloud and replacing my personal hard drives to destroy "potential evidence" they are trying to gather.
       </li>
       <li>
        I will be strongly considering telling my story in other more secretive forums - I think the intelligence industry has vastly overstepped their bounds and will take necessary steps to advocate for limited scope in spying.
       </li>
       <li>
        If I am arrested/detained/dead in the next year, you will know why.
       </li>
       <li>
        NSA/DoD/All you dirty nosy government fuckfaces reading this: COME AT ME BRO!
       </li>

       Yeah.  Perhaps.  My wife and I discussed the potential implication of the whole NSA scandals from time to time - and I've had concerns for a while - but I really thought it was blown out of proportion until the Snowden stuff came to light.  I'm still debating with myself how much I can really get away with exposing.  I was involved with one of the very first missions to use GPS and drones.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bit nerve wracking because I do have a family to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time this has larger implications for privacy and humanity as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if there is cowardice, it's only because I'm scared what would become of my family.

       It's a valid criticism. I just assumed that I am a small fish in a large ocean and now I feel I should be speaking up more and sooner. It's just scary how they can break in your house, destroy all of your stuff, plant any evidence they want, and you have no legal recourse. I have a family that depends on me for income.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tools are very compartmentalized though. However there is still a human element to everything that can be exploited. At the end of the day average people are still running these systems.

       Probably nothing then.  I'm on my phone, will have to check it out from my computer later.  Keep track of actual times that you log in and log out when you're finished.  I'm sure tards will have a field day with this one.

       Basically the internet isn't a tangible thing.  Its just a bunch of computers linked together in a massive, nebulous cloud.  No one really even knows how big it is.  So your phone links to the closest tower, which transmits via copper or fiber to various trunks and switches from the telco company.  From there it is directed to the server that you called up with the URL.  The URL is just a name assigned to an ip address and an ip address is actually a lot like a mailing address.  Basically it directs you down to the continent, country, region, City, etc... To get to the server that you want, you have to travel via a zillion other servers.  How your request travels has a lot to do with how heavy the internet traffic is.  It's possible that you can get bumped all over the country before you end up at one of the many servers that give you access to reddit.  That is my best understanding of it.  Keep in mind that even as a telecomm guy for 20 years, I am a hardware guy.  My expertise ends at the "cell phone to telco company" end of things.  So if I have missed or screwed up something past that, hopefully someone will correct me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  thinking about it more.  Its most likely that your phone is assigned to a larger switch in Tennessee which can handle the load better than the switch in Kentucky when phone traffic gets heavy.

       After further research most of day, there seems to be convenient explanations for each of these scenarios, but I'm still uncomfortable with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, frequently mobile lines borrow non-used IP from DoD, however, I'm still confused as to why both my regular mobile IP (from t-mobile) and supposed "borrowed" ip show as logged in - sometimes when I am not even on reddit and my phone is not even turned on.

       didn't know this tool existed! thanks for sharing the link; checked my IP's within the last 4 weeks and all looks normal, though i will continue to check up on this everyone once in a while. my only question on this is, if the government wanted to spy on a reddit account, do they need to sign in as that user? or, could they not 'clean up' after themselves and remove any digital footprints of surveillance?

       They don't want to silence ppl, they want to figure out what you're willing to watch, listen to, and buy, so you'll be a happy lil slave while 1% of the population hold half the wealth.

       If they took a cut of 1/15, and gave to the world, every person on the planet would be twice as wealthy.

       For those detract that this would cause deflation, as long as the value of money only supports the highest percentage of ppl while others struggle to simple make ends (a concept i know alot of internet weilding americans have trouble comprehending), then you can start to see how, while ofcourse the brain surgeon makes more than the ditch digger, the ceo shouldn't be making more than both do in a year in a fucking hour.

       I'm not sure I know the answer.  There's a couple things to keep in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  Most of the people who do the dirty work are dumb as shit - seriously - most of them are 18 year old kids straight out of high school.  The government has the idea they promote of the NSA being seasoned professionals, while most of them are military kids straight out of high school, not even old enough to drink.  I couldn't begin to list the number of analysts I knew who served some of the highest priority missions with TS/SCI clearances for six months, before getting kicked out for doing dumb fuck things (like holding underage women hostage in their barracks room).
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There might some intimidation factor or at play, or they simply don't care since NSA monitoring everyone's shit is now pretty common knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I could be mistaken.  The ip address I'm getting are from a DoD base in Ohio, and there seems to be a lot of conspiracy theories related to that particular range of IP's.

       Anybody can access your comments by clicking on your username. Even if they know your password, what would they gain by logging in as you?

       And frankly, if they did log in as you, they would always use a proxy IP address to cover their tracks, no?

       Interesting about Ohio.  Years ago there was a prolific poster in this sub who I conversed with quite a bit about the occult.  Someone got suspicious of him and ran a whois and his IP was at an Ohio DoD facility (listed on Google maps as a supply routing depot).  After this came out, he disappeared for a long time, resurfaced briefly and most recently (not that recently) was posting in /conspiratard.

       This makes sense. My history shows IPs out of Florida, which I'm nowhere near. However, they belong to Akamai, and I know the company's services: it's likely my mobile provider uses them as an intermediary to speed up serving of web content. But since it's
       <em>

       server which is contacting Reddit's, it's their server IP which is logged.

       At first I was hoping to go off the grid, but having come to the realization that I am fairly prolific on social media, and my identity is readily available, I have submitted to the mods at iama to see what kind of proof they would be looking for to have a more formal discussion about this.  There's no real way to hide at this juncture.

       And BTW - the "screening process" is (or was) a lot more lax for military - we weren't even required to take a poly until well after I was already in for two years - and never required to take a lifestyle poly.

       Well, as I said, I've never taken the lifestyle poly, but some of the contractors I worked with mentioned how they like to throw you off with the "bestiality" question right out of the gate.  If you do some creative googling there are some books on the subject that are highly informative.  Every NSA poly basically followed the same script.

       The only problem I ever had with my regular poly was getting tired and almost falling asleep.

       Tell you the truth I probably wouldn't remember if I did. I worked in a few different places. L33 doesn't sound like anything familiar to me but I couldn't say 100% certainty I didn't work there.

       im going to lol so hard when you realize you forgot to log out of your accounts at the nsa and people have just been surfing reddit unaware they were logged in as you. additionally, what about cell phone service, do you have 4g. the ip address assigned to your phone may be from a data center nearby that appers to be suspicious but is really just at&amp;t or something.

       How do you know for certain the IP using your accounts originated from the NSA?  Did you at least do a WHOIS search on the IP?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, you may have inadvertently obtained a keylogger or virus. But go ahead and destroy all your data for no apparent reason, if that's what you consider a reasonable course of action.

       Yes I did all of the above, including the whois.

      <p>
       Yes I did type that.  Yes, I feel a bit silly for doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for a long time I just lurked quietly and didn't care about the whole monitoring situation - but now I am feeling frustrated and antagonistic.

      <p>
       Even if it were a keylogger or a virus, that would be just as bad since NSA designs/uses them to their advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I will be destroying my data is because NSA has a reputation/policy for making a spectacle out of people that disagree with them, much like they attempted to do with Snowden at first, and the Disney movie about Wikileaks.  I really don't have anything to hide - I'm a pretty mundane person - but I also know how they are capable of making a case against anyone.

       Lord knows - anyone lurking Reddit long enough probably has enough in their hard drive to be put away for as long as the government wants to.

       It just seems like innuendo and cherry picking facts. This website isn't providing any actual information, it seems just as like if there was an NWO they'd be trying to discredit the people providing these leaks, using sites like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if Alex Jones, Edward Snowden, Assange, etc. are all untrustworthy double agents, and the main stream media is untrustworthy, and internet forums are filled with shills and disinformation agents, then you'd be silly to ever believe anything with any confidence that you haven't seen with your own eyes, and even that would be questionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking with such authority just doesn't jive with the message that you can't trust anything for sure.

       fuck. what am I supposed to do?  I get involved in real shit online and they 'find' cp on my computer.  I protest in public and get arrested for not having a permit.  I protest police and they call me a terrorist.  I vote for a third party and they ignore me.  I spend my dollar responsibly and a million other people don't give a shit.  I am vocal in local elections and people ostracize me.  What do I do?

       I don't understand the relation.  I am not desperate enough to be a suicide bomber.  I am not desperate enough to kill innocent people.  Are you saying that I should quit bitching?  Then what do I do about this feeling I have when I hear that my government kills innocent people with drones?

       I meant that it's desperation that leads people to terrorism. I wasn't talking about you, instead I was taking your situation as an example of what's being done to us on a global scale. Poor, raped countries produce "terrorists" but our rich countries are on the verge of producing their own as well. When you lost everything, what else is there to do than fighting or dying ?

       Interesting about Ohio.  Years ago there was a prolific poster in this sub who I conversed with quite a bit about the occult.  Someone got suspicious of him and ran a whois and his IP was at an Ohio DoD facility (listed on Google maps as a supply routing depot).  After this came out, he disappeared for a long time, resurfaced briefly and most recently (not that recently) was posting in /conspiratard.
