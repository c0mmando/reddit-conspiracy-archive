      <p>
       In short, NIST didn't have any evidence at all to support that explosives caused the collapse of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of now we have NIST's written proof that they didn't have evidence proving either of the theories. As of now, either of both theories is as probable as the other, so why did they choose one over the other? Was there anything that suggested one scenario being more probable than the other? Let's analyze it:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Q: Was there ever any other high rise steel building fire that caused collapse?

A: No.

Q: When compared to past high rise steel building fires, was this one
    more intense and did it last longer?

A: No.

Q: When compared to past normal building fires that resulted in collapse,
    was there any other that collapsed globally from localized fires?

A: No.

Q: Is there anything at all that suggests that fires caused the collapse
    of the building apart from the presence of fire?

A: No.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       So far there is nothing at all that explains why NIST chose one possibility over the other. Let's continue now with the other possibility:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Q: Can high rise steel buildings be demolished?

A: Yes

Q: When compared to previous building demolitions, is there any similar?

A: Yes

Q: Can a demolition cause global destruction of the building?

A: Yes

Q: Is there anything at all that suggests that explosives caused the
    destruction of the building?

A: Yes
</code></pre>
      <p>
       It makes no sense why NIST decided the way they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the extent of considering the explosive possibility, NIST didn't even bother with conducting a valid audio test that would be reasonable with the real case scenario, rendering said test absolutely invalid for rejecting the explosives possibility.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to calculations by the investigation team, the smallest blast capable of failing the building's critical column would have resulted in a sound level of 130 decibels (dB) to 140 dB at a distance of at least half a mile,
        <strong>
         if unobstructed by surrounding buildings
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_qa_082108.cfm">

      </p>
      <p>
       NIST not only ignored the city noise of that day that greatly muffles distant sounds as they also ignored the possibility of other explosives used in demolitions and they also ignored the obstructive buildings that block any distant sound even more. In fact, NIST only simulated RDX explosive when there are other types of explosives that can be used for demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of this moment NIST deliberately setup a misdirection from the main argument in order to conclude it as "answered" without having to answer anything else. We ask if explosives could be used, they say that rdx was not used and even fail to conduct a correct test to prove this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The veil of biased investigation starts dropping the further we check their report and the scientific method is completely lost.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The case of the free-fall speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a long time the conspiracy theorists were insisting that wtc7 collapsed at free-fall speeds, something that anyone can verify for themselves. NIST eventually changed their report in order to admit that indeed it did collapse at free-fall speeds, because they knew they couldn't avoid this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is that they added something else to their report so that they would remain with the fire collapse theory and avoid the demolition theory. According to them, the free-fall speeds is perfectly compatible with their findings except that this is purely a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their findings state no free-fall possibility (other than admitting it) and neither does their simulation. Anyone can verify the simulation model that they released and see that the free-fall period is not there, in fact it stops before it reaches that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, they state that the collapse was 40% longer than pure free-fall, and thus the total time of the visible collapse was 5.4s. However,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXTlaqXsm4k">
        they included an extra 1.5s to their "stages" that does not exist.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       More here:
       <a href="http://911blogger.com/node/17794">
        Chapter 12: WTC Global Collapse Analysis
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is direct evidence that NIST dry labbed their report and by doing so they confirm that they are dedicated on maintaining the fire collapse version by any means necessary while ignoring the other possibility.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       At this point we already have clear evidence of fabrication from a government entity that is invested on deceiving the public by any means necessary and, since they were paid, this also falls under fraud charges.

       This is a great thread. Hatchet, I like how you pointed out the omitted stiffeners. I have a video where a member of AE911Truth points out that he is surprised to find that NIST says there are no shear studs on the steel girders in the composite floor deck slabs. I worked with this guy. Edit: well  here I am going to post here what I had posted in a similar thread: (don't miss this or Part 2; Ron is very meticulous in his descriptions of his requests of NIST and the responses he got back, and also why he feels the way he does about NIST's findings)
      </p>
      <p>
       For an in-depth look at what one of the members of AE911Truth feels about World Trade Center 7, digest this interview with him:
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5-teRFFybY">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5-teRFFybY
       </a>
       That is Part 1 of 2 parts. I worked with Ron at a structural engineering firm in Santa Rosa, California for four years. He is a veteran structural engineer, extremely smart and measured in everything he does in his profession. There are many others like him, who have joined AE911Truth. Check out what he says; he approaches the 3 towers with the perspective of a professional structural engineer. He is very compelling with the approach he has brought to the question of WTC 7.
He feels NIST didn't properly evaluate many things that happened that day. Also, NIST admits free fall of WTC 7 for 8 seconds, but never properly explains it, according to his professional opinion as a structural engineer.

       This is going to sound really weird, but you have no idea how much your comment means to me. I've been debating Judy Wood supporters today

       who drove me mad. I've also debated a guy in this thread (which you can see towards the bottom of the page) about the thermite findings which doesn't lead anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shills and nihilists are getting to me and I'm losing motivation to keep it up online.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the point, I've seen mr. Brookman's segment on AE911Truth before. Everyone who is involved with that organization has my unconditional love and support, so there's not enough praise I can give the gentleman for simply participating.
      </p>
      <p>
       So anyway, sorry for this weirdness, but thanks for your comment, a lot. It definitely helped to keep my sanity in check.

       Not weird! I totally appreciate how you feel, I've been there before :) My motivation wavers, only because I am buried at my engineering firm and I have a 4 1/2 year old daughter. Well actually, it waivers also from the people who are so combative against 9/11 truthers. It's frustrating, isn't it??

       AE911Truth is truly amazing. I am so happy knowing Ron and feeling that I can vouch for him. I remember the two of us being really alarmed, and talking about his findings during the day. It wore on him and me, but he stayed up nights for a long time, looking and searching. I am very proud of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am really happy that I gave you some pep to keep your sanity in check. You know, besides the physical/elemental properties of the collapse being very suspicious, the other aspect of WTC 7 has been really haunting me: The tenants in the building. The fact that case files for the Savings &amp; Loan scandal from the 80's, ENRON, and other Securities &amp; Exchange Committee case files/documents are now gone. It is stuff like that I am really bothered with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the physical stuff...I mean c'mon, the building was not engulfed in flame, but it fell directly in to its own basement in 8 seconds. That was controlled demolition. And the thermite found on the dust: the lady artist who made a sculpture of the dust when people were allowed back to their apartments, and she gives the dust to a scientist and he finds thermitic material. C'mon. Anyway..:sigh: pouring a glass of wine now.

       Yeah, the physics behind it has always been my main motivator. Wars come and go, money ebbs and flows, power rises and falls, but you cannot fuck with physics, the scientific method, and truth-seeking. That's eternal and universally applicable, from the falling apple to the demolished high-rise. I will not only shun the official story, but fight actively against it, because it's a lesion in our most sacred endeavor.

       The world record for tallest building ever demolished by explosives is 26 stories. That building required 12 people working full time for 24 days to wire. It needed 4118 charges placed in 1100 locations, 2800 pounds of explosive and 36000 feet of detonating wire. The men that wired it had unfettered access to a completely empty building and had to take out walls to gain access to support columns.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC7 was 21 stories taller than this world record demolition.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         How was the building wired up without anyone knowing? Support columns were buried behind drywall, desks, cubicles and office equipment.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How did the most involved and elaborate demolition wiring job in history survive fires burning on 12 floors? Wire tends to stop working when it's burnt to a crisp. This doesn't even take into account the damage done by falling debris.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In order for your theory to have any legs at all, you need to explain how a building that would have shattered the world record for demolition by 21 stories was wired up surreptitiously without disturbing any of the employees or alerting security, then set on fire for 7 hours, then still went off without a hitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you do that, you can take on the FDNY calling the collapse 2 hours ahead of time...

       You are asking what you assume to be "logical questions" by avoiding the fact that NIST fabricated false data in order to sustain the collapse theory while still supporting their theory at the same time. I don't understand how someone can say this and still demand others to be serious.

       They used photos, videos, blueprints and the scientific properties of the structural components of wtc7 to come up with a valid theory endorsed by hundreds of scientists that helped put it together. They investigated the possibility of CD and found no evidence at all to support it.

       The type of demolition you are suggesting would have been completely unprecedented in the history of demolition. That type of insinuation requires evidence, something sorely lacking. I'm just pointing out that your pet theory has holes large enough to drive a 767 through.

      <p>
       I've seen multiple views of wtc7 collapsing, and not a single one has the concussive explosions common in all other controlled demolitions. These videos all have line of sight with the building, which means sound could travel unobstructed to the cameraman, yet we hear nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So not only is your world record sized demolition done completely clandestinely in a fully occupied building, not only does it work flawlessly after being burnt to a crisp by fire, but it goes off without sounding like any other CD in recorded history.

        The case of the free-fall speeds.

       <p>
        For a long time the conspiracy theorists were insisting that wtc7 collapsed at free-fall speeds, something that anyone can verify for themselves.
        <strong>
         NIST eventually changed their report in order to admit that indeed it did collapse at free-fall speeds
        </strong>
        , because they knew they couldn't avoid this fact.
       </p>
       <p>
        Problem is that they added something else to their report so that they would remain with the fire collapse theory and avoid the demolition theory. According to them, the free-fall speeds is perfectly compatible with their findings except that this is purely a lie

       Wtc7 took 13 seconds from the time the east penthouse collapsed. The facade, which was nothing more than a shell when it came down, took 5.4 second to fall 18 stories. That's 40 percent slower than free fall, and completely ignores the fact that the interior of the building came down 7 seconds earlier.

      <p>
       The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity
</code></pre>
      <p>
       ........
      </p>
      <p>
       Stage 2 is free fall. And of course the entire thing won't be free fall because it is not a brick falling through the air. It is an entire building collapsing in on itself.

       Actually, there is a theory about how the buildings were wired. Basically, the youngest Bush brother, Marvin Bush, was close with the CEO of a company called Securacom. In the summer of 2001, Securacom won a contract to upgrade the communications systems in WTC. They spent considerable time inside the different buildings of the WTC. I remember finding eyewitness reports from people who worked in the WTC during this time and they would write (paraphrasing): "Yeah, floors 30 thru 34 were locked down no access for a couple weeks" or something like that. If I remember correctly, I found this information in the video 9/11 Mysteries. I do not know if it is confirmed. I have found trails on the internet about Securacom's involvement in the comms upgrade, but at this point I don't have this information at hand.

       Please source it.  I asked because I want to know how this would have been possible.  What you guys are suggesting has never been attempted before, not even in empty buildings by world leaders in CD.  It would have been no less unprecedented than a collapse due to fire.

       This discussion wont lead anywhere, because you're more inclined to bicker rather than keep an open mind. You claim that all the core-columns could be severed without the building falling if the outer columns stood intact, whereas NIST claims a single core-column could be dislodged and collapse would be inevitable. And you want to brush that under the rug? Please crawl back under your moss.

       What's there to verify? NIST has access to the red-gray chips to verify it themselves, but they didn't test it sufficiently. You can verify the engineers' results by reading their report. Do they have access to all the equipment? Yes, so that's verified. Did NIST use all the methods that were required to verify the red-gray chips? No, fraud. Kevin Ryan explains it best here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As he worked to debunk the WTC thermite research, Millette was still unable to find any iron microspheres. But he did claim to have finally found the red-gray chips. Curiously,
        <strong>
         he did not attempt to replicate the testing that would determine if those chips were thermitic.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        ... Millette perfomed an XEDS analysis for elemental composition but failed to do any of the other tests including BSE, DSC, the flame test, the MEK test, or measurement of the chip resistivity. Having inexplicably “ashed” the chips at 400 °C in a muffle furnace, thereby proving that they were not the materials of interest (which ignite at 430 °C), Millette ignored the remainder of the study he had set out to replicate.  Because he did not do the DSC test, he could not do XEDS of the spheres formed from the chips. Since he had still not found spheres in the dust, he could not test those and this allowed him to ignore the testing of spheres from the thermite reaction.

       Even if that was true, it's [12/47 ≈ 0.26 =&gt;] 26% of the entire building. The whole building wasn't really on fire, as you claim. In the worst case scenario, 74% of the charges would remain intact according to you.

        That's correct. We did cook the chips to release the particles from epoxy bindings for further study, but not to measure ignition temperature of energy release.  It was
        <strong>
         not necessary
        </strong>
        to take this step, because
        <strong>
         my chemical tests proved that the chips could not be thermitic in any way
        </strong>
        . I would have just been testing the ignition point and energy release of a paint chip and that would not have been necessary.

       In order to see if the chips are explosive or incendiary, you have to know the energy input and output of the system. Instead, he made an "oopsy" while trying to release the epoxy bindings at

       Nope, the chemical content proved that the sample Millette was testing was not thermetic. Thermite has a very definite chemical composition. Millette tested his sample and found that it's chemical composition was nowhere near thermite. At that point, once you've ruled out thermite as the source for the chip, why would more testing be needed?

        In summary, red/gray chips with the same morphological characteristics, elemental spectra and magnetic attraction as those shown in Harrit et al.1 were found in WTC dust samples from four different locations than those examined by Harrit, et al.1 The gray side is consistent with carbon steel. The red side contains the elements: C, O, Al, Si, and Fe with small amounts of other elements such as Ti and Ca. Based on the infrared absorption (FTIR) data, the C/O matrix material is an epoxy resin. Based on the optical and electron microscopy data, the Fe/O particles are an iron oxide pigment consisting of crystalline grains in the 100-200 nm range and the Al/Si particles are kaolin clay plates that are less than a micrometer thick.

         There is no evidence of individual elemental aluminum particles detected by PLM, SEM-EDS, or TEM-SAED-EDS, during the analyses of the red layers in their original form or after sample preparation by ashing, thin sectioning or following MEK treatment.

       You're right, it was disingenuous... It's been 5 years, not 3. How do you clowns ever expect to get another investigation if you sit on evidence for 5 fucking years without ever having it verified???

       Trillions of dollars does not change the burning properties of demolition charges or detonating wire.  Trillions of dollars does not suddenly give thousands of employees of WTC7 amnesia when it comes to drywall being torn out to wire columns for detonation.

       I've worked in nothing but busy office buildings for 20 years.  Ripping out drywall, ceiling, carpet, electrical and data cabling to get to the support structure of a building is a massive undertaking that would displace office workers for months.  It's not something you could accomplish clandestinely, and then set on fucking fire for 7 hours before detonation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're suggesting would be just as

       You're missing the point yet again. The building was fully occupied. Tearing it down to the support structure would involve displacing a massive number of employees. There is no evidence at all that it happened, and yes, the occupants of the building would certainly have noticed being uprooted while floors were torn apart.

       You don't even answer the most fundamental concerns, you just skip topics and claim to be a wiring expert when you probably just did a couple jobs as a standard contractor. You claim to have an expert understanding of everything conceivable regarding what it would take for a government (with an unlimited budget) to bring down a building.

       I asked very valid questions about the CD hypothesis. A CD of that size, wired up in a completely occupied building and set off flawlessly after 12 floors had burned out of control for 7 hours, and without any of the telltale sounds present in every other CD video would be just as unprecedented as a building coming down from fires alone. The CD explanation requires a LOT more moving parts and a vivid imagination however.

       They used photos, videos, blueprints and the scientific properties of the structural components of wtc7 to come up with a valid theory endorsed by hundreds of scientists that helped put it together. They investigated the possibility of CD and found no evidence at all to support it.

        You are asking what you assume to be "logical questions" by avoiding the fact that NIST fabricated false data in order to sustain the collapse theory while still supporting their theory at the same time. I don't understand how someone can say this and still demand others to be serious.

       NIST didn't fabricate anything.

       The type of demolition you are suggesting would have been completely unprecedented in the history of demolition. That type of insinuation requires evidence, something sorely lacking. I'm just pointing out that your pet theory has holes large enough to drive a 767 through.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also the same photos, videos, blueprints and scientific data that the demolition theory uses, except that in that theory you don't have the fabricated 1.5s, biased invalid audio tests and incomplete unproved model simulations.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've seen multiple views of wtc7 collapsing, and not a single one has the concussive explosions common in all other controlled demolitions. These videos all have line of sight with the building, which means sound could travel unobstructed to the cameraman, yet we hear nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So not only is your world record sized demolition done completely clandestinely in a fully occupied building, not only does it work flawlessly after being burnt to a crisp by fire, but it goes off without sounding like any other CD in recorded history.
