        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now, I know this might seem like a really petty post, but its not about &#39;what&#39;, its about &#39;why&#39; so please read it all.</p>

<p>Every so often, I make a ranty post on Facebook about some current controversial world affair. This one was about the NSA scandal. Providing full facts and details.</p>

<p>I have about 300 friends on Facebook, 90% of which I probably know personally to an extent.</p>

<p>Not one comment or &#39;like&#39;. None whatsoever. I have a few friends into this stuff but I speak to them on chat about it.</p>

<p>How are we meant to spread awareness when no one cares? The only people who happily listen are those who already know about it. No one else gives a shit, they&#39;re too busy and happy boozing and clubbing their lives away.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand it, I imagine they&#39;re the ones who think &#39;who cares if you have nothing to hide&#39; or &#39;it doesn&#39;t affect me so I don&#39;t care&#39;. How can&#39;t they? Why don&#39;t they? I just don&#39;t understand the reasoning.</p>

<p>They all jumped along on the Kony 2012 bullshit. Perhaps we need a similar campaign?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get how we have a chance against these things when almost everyone who doesn&#39;t care by now never will. Its probably why I have such a cynical view of the human race and believe these things will never stop as long as we exist. Or at least without some sort of system change.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I look forward to your responses</p>

<p>Drop subtle facts,  get healthy, be a role model.  Voice concerns over crimes against humanity, social injustices.   Drop conspiracy theories subtlety and in special moments.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a result of the society we live in. People aren&#39;t encouraged to address issues that don&#39;t directly affect them. They don&#39;t see the NSA snooping as an issue because it doesn&#39;t impact their lives. They don&#39;t care that all their contact/personal info is being stolen and tracked because... where&#39;s the harm?</p>

<p>It&#39;s even worse than that - issues that do affect them don&#39;t get addressed either. Their consent has been manufactured... who cares that your govt isn&#39;t doing enough to prepare for climate change, they still get to go about their daily lives without having to sacrifice anything. So why bother kicking up a fuss? They&#39;ve got their TV, their smartphone, their car, their love life. Why bother getting angry? What&#39;s this, we can no longer effectively protest at sea? (New Zealand) &#39;Well, who cares. It has absolutely zero effect on my life so why should I care.&#39; The government is leaking private details to slander people who revealed cronyism? &#39;Bad luck to them, got nothing to do with me.&#39;</p>

<p>The last point I&#39;ll make with the NSA scandal specifically is the impression I get is because it is centered around electronics/technology people are automatically disinterested. It&#39;s all spy-like and covert... borderline conspiracy theory. And we all know how conspiracy theories are received in the public eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I run into this quite often. On the Internet and in face to face interactions. The majority doesn&#39;t care and deeply saddens me and scares me on many levels. My goal is to educate myself (like most everyone here said) and to speak out any chance I get. I don&#39;t go out for a night on the town and bring it up when everyone is discussing good memories or whatever. I do this because I can and I also do this in the hopes that what I say could get at least one mind thinking. If nothing comes of it, oh well, I tried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may not be that ppl don&#39;t care; more than likely it&#39;s something they don&#39;t know about (i.e., they&#39;re not aware of how it can effect them personally), they may have heard/seen it on the news. </p>

<p>Then again, if these are your FB friends, the NSA scandal is something they choose to ignore-- b/c it requires: reading/understanding, </p>

<p>no seriously, it&#39;s not something light &amp; entertaining, there&#39;s so much (what i call) &quot;fluff&quot; (or bs) info being thrown at us every single day, it&#39;s easy for someone to filter out what&#39;s really important, and u realize that a lot of things just scare the poop out of ppl, it&#39;s easier to ignore.</p>

<p>do u know that a report Andrea Mitchell was giving on MSNBC was interrupted b/c of something stupid about Bieber? !</p>

<p>we can&#39;t make ppl see what we see, some might get it, eventually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s true, but what&#39;s the solution? As I said in another comment, I feel like its a stalemate between the ignorant and informed. What can we do about it? The powers the be obviously realise this and do everything as subtle as possible to avoid stirring said group up, its just infuriating by the time they do realise the mess everything is, it&#39;ll be too late</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s massively frustrating but I like to think that we are slowly tipping the balance. There is a constant trickle from the ignorant to the informed. And short of somebody suffering serious head trauma, it&#39;s one way traffic, so we have to keep urging people to come over!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me the solution is changing myself. How can I be self sufficient?  What changes can I make to break away from the system? How can I become what I believe society should be? How am I helping others become self sufficient? Eventually living this lifestyle at the very least shows people it&#39;s possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to &#39;find their island&#39; by front-loading your comments with a mainstream issue that appeals to their conservative tastes.  Try to be balanced to hook them in. So, example:</p>

<p>Wrong: Big brother NSA is spying on us all!
Right:  NSA- must we choose between privacy or protection?</p>
