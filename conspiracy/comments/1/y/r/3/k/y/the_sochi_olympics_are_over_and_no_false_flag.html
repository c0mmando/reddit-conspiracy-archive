    <div class="md"><p>Yes but that&#39;s not always the case.</p>

<p>There are a ton of predictions where absolutely nothing happens and it&#39;s not because &quot;people knew too much for them to pull it off&quot;, it&#39;s because people are just straight up making false claims and predictions.</p>

<p>The Sochi Olympics had a credible possibility of being attacked, many pieces of evidence establish this.</p>

<p>Primarily, the two actual terrorist bombings that happened in Russia mere days prior to the Olympic events.</p>

<p>That and the &quot;Illuminati&quot; card game, which was published in 82 which shows images of the twin towers being attacked, the pentagon being attacked, a marathon being attacked, and a clock tower being attacked.</p>

<p>The clock tower image matches the actual Sochi Clock tower.</p>

<p>All of these things made the possibility of a terrorist attack on the games credible.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t happen, I am glad, and I hope everybody else is too.</p>

<p>We should always keep our ears open and our eyes peeled, so that they are not able to enact events like this, which people may have prevented by discussing en mass before hand.</p>

I constantly hear you people talk about how the illuminati like to leave little clues and messages for the masses to &#39;boast&#39; or because satan requires it or something, and then all of a sudden they have to change their plans because some neckbeards on the internet revealed their terrible secret. Why would they &#39;leave clues&#39; in the first place if people becoming &#39;aware&#39; stops their evil plans? Zero logic.</p>

Nothing happened..... (just as pointed out at the super bowl by the guy who hijacked the microphone)....... so the Orwellian state wins and stupid conspiritards lose?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily.</p>

<p>When a lot of people come out and raise awareness of a possible false flag somewhere it MAY very well be enough to get the perpetrators to back down seeing that since so many people we&#39;re pre-warned that it would be foolish to do an attack as predicted.</p>

<p>Maybe they slink off and plan an attack somewhere else and hopefully get in under the radar.
 Just because something never happened doesn&#39;t mean something was not planned.
It is simply impossible to say.
  So for anybody to use the lack of an event as &quot;evidence&quot; that those warning about such events are &quot;deluded alarmists&quot; is little more than troll talk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just an FYI, most false alarms come from direct propaganda purposely designed to discredit people and the notion that events are planned.</p>

<p>This is how propaganda works, every now and again you have somebody release &quot;insider&quot; information about a possible &quot;doomsday scenario&quot; and the people guillable enough to believe it get online and start spreading it like its&#39; the Gospel.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s highly likely that Alex Jones is a COINTEL agent meant  to discredit the truth seeking free thinkers movement, or conspiracy theorists as some would say.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Just because some people make false predictions doesn&#39;t mean that every forwarning is a false prediction. Go read the nuclear bible, because that even only didn&#39;t happen because of that book and peoples awareness that the event would happen.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t make an event happen when it&#39;s already been exposed to too many members of the public.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think the Nuclear Bible falls entirely into that category. What reliable evidence i.e. NOT from David Chase Taylor, can you provide that there was ever a nuclear terror attack planned for Super Bowl XLV?</p>

<p>This is exactly what Alex Jones does. Publishing the NB didn&#39;t get David Chase Taylor more money or more importance, it forced him into asylum and he could possibly be imprisoned for life.</p>

<p>All of his evidence is reliable and it&#39;s not &quot;from&quot; him, it&#39;s independent sources and mainstream sources all gathered into one location.</p>

<p>That is all of the evidence, him having gathered it all into one place doesn&#39;t make it any less of credible.</p>

<p>He included pretty much everything, I don&#39;t need to add anything else to everything he already provided.</p>

<p>There were pieces to a puzzle, he gathered them a put a ton of them together.</p>

<p>Others are dead from being murdered and tortured, they are not so lucky, but they are just as big a hero, whether their name gets touted around the news or not.</p>

<p>A vehicle travelling north at 70 miles per hour does not eject its&#39; engine 30 yards behind it upon impact.</p>

<p>Indeed, a cursory glance at Chase&#39;s supposed &quot;evidence&quot; shows basic factual errors.

<blockquote>
<p>Tuesday brought official word that Major League Baseball&#39;s players and owners had reached a new five-year labor agreement, <strong>just as the old CBA was set to expire</strong> [That&#39;s a full baseball season AFTER the supposed &quot;lockout&quot;]. <strong>At no point were fears entertained that the sides might reach an impasse - an agreement was always going to happen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good enough for you? His claim of an MLB lockout is flat-out <strong>MADE UP</strong>. Now, I focused on that because it happened to fall in my wheelhouse of expertise. But tell me: since he has been caught in a pure and simple lie there, why should I give the slightest credence to any of his other claims?</p>

<p>I could just as easily say there&#39;ll be a nuclear attack on the Oscars on Sunday - and if it doesn&#39;t happen, woo-hoo, it&#39;s all thanks to me for &quot;exposing the plot&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deluded Alarmist:</p>

<p>A person who scares others about the possibilities of events taking place whilst having no solid evidence with which to support his suppositions.</p>

<p>There was a lot of solid evidence to support the supposition that there may be a terrorist attack at the Sochi Olympics, allow me to list the reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Illuminati Card Game - Has card which show terrorist attacks which have happened since the games publication including 9/11 ( twin towers and pentagon ), Boston Marathon Bombing, and a clock tower being destroyed, the picture of which matches with the Sochi Clock Tower. That makes it seem like much more than coincidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Volvograd and other bombings that happened prior to the Sochi Olympics.</p></li>
<li><p>Media Fear Mongering reports of the potential that you may have all of your data stolen because Russia is heading security. A lot of fear mongering media which sets up precident for there to be an attack which could then be easily blamed on opposition forces for political gains, such as the United States using a terrorist bombing at the Olympics to justify their NSA program ( &quot;SEE! Russia doesn&#39;t have an NSA an look what happened, you Americans should be THANKFUL for the NSA!&quot; )</p></li>
</ol>

<p>TL;DR - Deluded Alarmists are people who get whipped into a frenzy over planned propaganda such as Y2K.</p>

<p>Sharing with people the possibility of how an attack could happen so as to advance a political agenda is not deluded alarmism, it is critical thinking and speculation.</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely zero of which point to an alien invasion. Most of them point directly to secretive government projects, or even more likely, visual/natural anomalies. I have yet to see anything pointing towards something not from this earth. That is what I&#39;m asking for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By &quot;the system themselves put these warnings out&quot; I think he means that they selectively report on stories which through fear mongering and targetted talking points they further exacerbate peoples fears of the possibilities of events taking place.</p>

<p>This is what all those &quot;insider sources&quot; talking about DHS purchases and shit are all about.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys, better freak out about martial law happening on X date that anonymouse government man says because this document shows that DHS just obtained 1,000 military vehicles from the Army.&quot;</p>

<p>People can either be rational and think &quot;Well we certainly don&#39;t need MRAPS on our suburban streets, though I do see the financial justification in giving no longer needed military surplus vehicles to local law enforcement agencies. As much as I distrust them for their potential to be abused, I can see where this program makes sense.&quot;</p>

<p>Or you can be an insane person and think &quot;Oh SHIT I&#39;d better prep up so the gubment don&#39;t kill me in my house, even though they have fucking space lasers if they really wanted to kill my paranoid ass that bad.&quot;</p>

<p>One legitimate example of &quot;the system&quot; trying to make the conspiracy movement look bad is when they purposely had people witch hunting wrong people in looking for the Boston Bombing Marathon suspects.</p>

<p>It was the perfect play for TPTB to say &quot;You guys can&#39;t trust anything anybody says on the internet, look what happened to this poor guy that got singled out wrongly! Only trust official sources from the police who you can completely trust and have never been caught lying, stealing, dealing drugs, destroying evidence, murdering, or lying, did we say they&#39;ll never lie to you? Because they totally won&#39;t.........&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry I may have messed up what they said but I think you get the point I am trying to make here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tuesday brought official word that Major League Baseball&#39;s players and owners had reached a new five-year labor agreement, <strong>just as the old CBA was set to expire</strong> [That&#39;s a full baseball season AFTER the supposed &quot;lockout&quot;]. <strong>At no point were fears entertained that the sides might reach an impasse - an agreement was always going to happen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good enough for you? His claim of an MLB lockout is flat-out <strong>MADE UP</strong>. Now, I focused on that because it happened to fall in my wheelhouse of expertise. But tell me: since he has been caught in a pure and simple lie there, why should I give the slightest credence to any of his other claims?</p>

<p>I could just as easily say there&#39;ll be a nuclear attack on the Oscars on Sunday - and if it doesn&#39;t happen, woo-hoo, it&#39;s all thanks to me for &quot;exposing the plot&quot;. </p>
