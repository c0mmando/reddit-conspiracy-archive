        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I write this because i see people posting comments in this subreddit who are clearly not awake. I also write this because i would love to see how close to the mark this is as the general consensus of what is happening globally. Also any additional links to cited material supporting these statements would be lovely as i have read materials for years but rarely saved the sources.</p>

<p>What my investigations have lead me to believe is that Democracy is no longer practised on the planet. It was practised previously but was quickly subverted and corrupted. It is a ruse. A clever system of control that give the people the illusion of freedom. “None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free”. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p>

<p>Who destroyed democracy. The most powerful people on the planet. Who are the most powerful people on the planet? Well Money is power so - The most absurdly rich people on the planet. The elites. It has been proven that over 99% of the worlds wealth is literally in the hands of 0.01% of the population on the planet. 
<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/02/money-hasnt-gone-1-gone-01.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/02/money-hasnt-gone-1-gone-01.html</a>
<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0025995#s3">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0025995#s3</a></p>

<p>We have been born into an age where an economic model is in place that is inherently designed to do one thing. To forever preserve and enlarge the power of the ruling class of the planet. This is done through the monetary system and achieved through using a debt based system of control known as central banking. Central banking is the concept of allowing a privately owned corporation to control a countries money supply under the justification that it will control inflation. </p>

<p>The last 7 countries without a central bank in 1999 were – Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Iran, North Korea, Cuba &amp; Sudan. Notice a pattern with those countries and the last few countries who have been invaded recently. Every country that has been invaded has had a central bank installed. Now there are only 3 countries left in the world without a central bank.</p>

<p>The premise of a central bank is that it LOANS a country money, with interest. It calls in this loan regularly. The problem is, a country was only given X amount. If it needs to pay X amount back plus the interest of Y, how on earth can it pay Y? By taking out another loan. This time the sum of X + Y. The process repeats and locks the country into a debt cycle. One which can never be escaped. The world is 40 trillion dollars in debt. In debt to who I ask you?</p>

<p>What happens when this process begins on a country. Privatisation. The countries resources that where once owned by the people progressively get sold off to attempt to pay this debt owed by using this privately controlled monetary system. </p>

<p>The consequences of privatisation become more and more severe over time. Privatisation means it is a privately owned enterprise providing a service under the reasoning it will be a more efficient model. Only a select few profit from providing this service though. The number one rule for a corporation is increased revenue. Continually increased profit. If a company does not continue to generate more profit than the last year it is considered stagnating and will be replaced and bought out by a company that does.</p>

<p>You can see the stages of privatising over a country in debt as it progressively loses its public assets. Telecommunications is one of the 1st to go. Then transportation. The process continues over every public property until it reaches the loss of the water supply. It is at this stage a country is in serious financial hardship and begins to sell its RESOURCES at undervalued rates to corporations. But we don’t notice the same people whom we must sell these assets and resources to are the same people who have indebted us in the first place by imposing the economic model we use.</p>

<p>We look around seeing its getting harder and harder to survive, our wages barely go up if ever and yet its getting more and more expensive to live. As seem in the graphs above, the wealth gap is becoming larger and larger and the richest people in the world are the only people experiencing a progressive gain in quality of life all whilst everybody else’s quality of life is diminishing.</p>

<p>We are strung along with this notion that if we work hard enough we can become just like them. Rich, Successful… Powerful. This is an illusion. A concept to justify the system and to encourage people to participate in it. The only people who come close are those that are pioneers of world changing technology’s (such as bill gates). Even bill gates, is nothing compared to the power of the elites. Bill gates is a billionaire. The elites are worth TRILLIONS.</p>

<p>Propaganda is a relatively new and incredibly powerful tool. It is subversive and ever present in our society. As shown in the study above all corporations are owned through share divisions by the same core group of wealthy elites. This includes the corporations that own the media.</p>

<p>“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.” Joseph Goebbels (Nazi Propaganda specialist)</p>

<p>Short clip demonstrating the concept of repetition and programming to the masses.</p>

<p>“Democracy is a con game. It’s a word invented to placate people to make them accept a given institution. All institutions sing, ‘We are free.’ The minute you hear ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy’, watch out… because in a truly free nation, no one has to tell you you’re free.” - Jacque Fresco</p>

<p>False flag attacks. Historical events in which a governing institution attacks itself in order to force its peoples to turn to the state to ask for assistance from an enemy, in the process giving up civil liberties and making the state more powerful. Also used as a pretext to sway public opinion into accepting their nation using imperialism to further its strength globally.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#World_War_II">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#World_War_II</a></p>

<p>So, corporations are all owned by the wealthy elite. They have manipulated and subverted free societies into accepting economic models which are DESIGNED to enslave that nation into debt so that all resources and systems are under their control, even the system of how the nation is governed. 
Lobbyists spend billions  “persuading” our representatives to legislate the corporations ever increasing freedoms. All whilst our own personal liberties are being eroded.</p>

<p>These institutions were here before you were born. That’s why we think this is normal. “Its just business”, “Its just the way the world works”. This is not normal. This is not freedom. This is modern free range slavery delivered in such a subversive way that we cannot see our own prison. Yet we all know something is wrong. You just look around and you see it everywhere. Poverty. Starvation (All whilst current agricultural means are producing over 100% of the world’s food supply needs). War. ENDLESS war. In the entire time I have been alive I cannot remember a time where war was not being waged.</p>

<p>War is a commodity. War is profit. War is a mechanism used to destroy a host nations leader when they are not willing to bend to the will on the wealthy elites in their desire for resources or accepting the current economic model of control using a central bank. Every player in a war is funded by these wealthy elites. As waging war is expensive and creates more debt to that country. Destroying property means it requires to be rebuilt, which further funnels money into the corporations. It is pure profit in the hands of the people that own all the companies. The loss of millions of lives is irrelevant to the military industrial complex.</p>

<p>Money is power. Money is control. Without money you starve and are homeless. So you are free to enrol in the labour force or die. Money doesn’t mean anything to the people who own it all. They know it means nothing. They trick us into believing it means something but to them it is just POWER. The amount of money they have allows them to influence and control every nation on every level of the nation’s faculties and operations.
The last American president who attempted to expose this was JFK. He was assassinated. He intended to stop using a central bank and allow the country to print its own money once more, debt free. He also intended to stop the war machine.</p>

<p>&quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.
Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumour is printed, no secret is revealed.&quot; – JFK.</p>

<p>We are watching our civil liberties evaporate under the guise of protecting us from a foreign enemy. This is a control mechanism used by the state, the concept of perpetual enemies. A justification for a need of the state to exist and to allow it to continually exercise and expand its powers. . Read  or watch 1984 by George Orwell. This book is an allegory attempting to warn the public of the future if we do not become aware of what is happening NOW.</p>

<p>“Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p>I highly recommend watching some documentaries about these phenomena and to begin your own research into global, social and economic affairs. There are endless articles, films and blogs talking about these issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thankyou for your feedback and i completely agree with you. </p>

<p>I will work on expanding my statement to add extra emphasis to the concept of usury as the principle of how the debt cycle works in the first place as i feel you are correct in pointing out that, that mechanism of economics is the problem not the concept of a central banking itself.</p>

<p>Although i have been tempted to argue for a complete abolishment of the monetary system as i feel it is inherently flawed to allow psychopaths to manipulate it till we are left with what we are facing today. I chose not to go into too much detail into usury and fractional reserve banking as i didnt want it to be too much of an essay and just a light read.</p>

<p>Thankyou for your feedback :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Where are you from?&quot; and I said &quot;New York&quot; he said &quot;ah, New York, that&#39;s a very interesting place. Do you know a lot of New Yorkers who keep talking about the fact that they want to leave but never do?&quot;.. and I said &quot;oh yes&quot; and he said &quot;why do you think they don&#39;t leave?&quot;.</p>

<p>I gave him different banal theories, he said &quot;oh I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that way at all.&quot;.</p>

<p>He said &quot;I think that New York is the new model for the new concetration camp, where the camp has been built by the inmates themselves. And the inmates are the guards and they have this pride and this thing they built, they built their own prison. And so they exist in a state of Schizophrenia where they are both guards and prisoners and as a result they no longer have, having been lobotomized, the capacity to leave the prison they&#39;ve made, or to even see it as a prison.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me attempt to add a bit to the history aspect of it
So, Straight after the first world war the global economic system was in shatters. Most of Europe was in ruins. England, France and Germany were at the end of their time as a &quot;global super power&quot; much like America is today.( Sorry if this isnt perfect, I studied most of it through Irish. I could also be wrong on some parts and I welcome correction.)</p>

<p>France and England had imposed restrictions on Germany to the extent that it was almost crippled under the treaty of Versailles. France feared of another attack from Germany and England was too weak to deal with another war. German inflation went through the roof. The &quot;hyper inflation&quot; rendered almost any money they had as worthless. It was better used to light fires...</p>

<p>Now to Italy before I go any further ahead. Italy was disappointed with the allied forces. The English government had broken the London contract/treaty that promised Italy more land. (Pretty much the only reason why they entered the &quot;great war&quot; )Following this Italy had a bunch of coalition governments who failed to make any progress as they couldn&#39;t agree with each other. The democracy was weak in Italy since the end of the &quot;Great War&quot;. When Mussolini showed the citizens of Italy he was able to organize the country (often times through fear and terror) in &#39;22 the people of Italy started to believe that this(fascim) was the best option as Communisim was far too radical. Even today there is no proper democracy in Italy, the last 2 P.M&#39;s weren&#39;t elected into office. (IIRC)</p>

<p>It was in &#39;33 that Hitler took to power as the chancellor in Germany. From here he used many of Mussolini&#39; tactics. Hitler had three main objetives; To break Versailles, Liebenraum (To expand germany. It is a similar policy to William II who had Weltpolitik), and anshluss (To bring together all German speakers). Hitler managed to captivate the citizens of germany in the same way that Mussolini did. Propaganda. Hitler created youth movements and changed the curriculum (History [The arian race], Biology and P.E [So boys would be ready to enlist in the army]). Now Europe had two major un-democratic leader (There was Franco also who was in charge of Spain). The UK and France were fearful.</p>

<p>In the words of Hitler &quot;The battle for the mind starts in the cradle&quot;. Pretty much Democracy never truly worked for most of Europe. It is far too idealistic to work properly. The rich will always take charge.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Democracy never truly existed in Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s mostly correct.</p>

<p>Although, it is a common tropism that democracy has been somehow &quot;subverted,&quot; when, in reality, democracy subverts itself.  We go around the world bringing &quot;democracy&quot; to countries because democracies are more likely to vote to redistribute wealth into the market, where it can be exported to us.  Democracies are not sustainable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re technically a Constitutional Replublic. </p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t always a party system. The first part system came into being in 1792, well after the revolution and founding. Alexander Hamilton lead the Federalist Party, and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison formed the Democratic-Republican party system, known as the Republican party system. The second party system started in 1828, where the Democrats and Whigs were the denominate parties. In 1854 the third party system started, denominated primarily by the Rebulicans, but the Democrat party was a strong contender. </p>

<p>My point though is that there doesn&#39;t have to be a party system. We&#39;ve let ourselves be lulled into it, and it hasn&#39;t served us well. </p>
