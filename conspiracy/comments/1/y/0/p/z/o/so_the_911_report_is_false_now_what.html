        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DegLpgJmFL8#t=5011">&quot;Any explanation for 9/11 must start and end with the facts. The evidence must be gathered and analyzed. Then - only then - can conclusions be drawn.&quot; - John McCain (Foreword - Debunking 9/11 Myths - An In-Depth Investigation by Popular Mechanics)</a></strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m making this post due to the number of people PM&#39;ing me this question so here&#39;s my take on it.</p>

<p>If it can be proven that 9/11 was a staged attack or that the official report is bogus, the consequences would be monumental. Let me break it down.</p>

<ol>
<li>The post-9/11 world we live in today was shaped only by the events of that day</li>
<li>If the events are not according to what we are led to believe, how else will government justify the new security-obsessed initiatives and global wars?</li>
<li>Foreign governments and allies would also begin to demand answers because the events of 9/11 have had a huge influence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror">globally</a>.</li>
<li>The US would lose credibility worldwide and skepticism and criticism of their &quot;benign&quot; actions would send the country into chaos, a chaos not planned or orchestrated to bring about a certain end, as TPTB&#39;s favorite slogan clearly states: Ordo Ad Chao.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the report is false, now what?</p>

<ol>
<li>Begin an independent investigation into the events of 9/11. No more YouTube videos, just accredited people certified by government (just to satisfy debunkers) to lead the investigations. Just certified, not led by a government body so they could investigate properly without interference.</li>
<li>Once the final conclusions are made and the discrepancies acknowledged by government, begin a full criminal investigation identifying things such as motive or who most likely could be involved and why.</li>
<li>Prosecute the perpetrators.</li>
<li>Dismantle the unneeded and no longer justified security theater apparatus.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know this list can be far more extensive, these would be the basic steps. You want stop-and-frisk to end? Investigate 9/11. You want the TSA to end? Investigate 9/11. You want mass surveillance to end? Investigate 9/11. You want your civil liberties back? Investigate 9/11. You want your children to grow up in a truly free country? Investigate 9/11.</p>

<p>Considering all of this, we can know why after 10 years there is still propaganda leading people to believe the reports are factual. The people rightfully accused do not want to be identified much less prosecuted and the US cannot under any circumstance lose credibility on the global stage. Morale within the civilian population as well as all levels of law enforcement and the military would plummet. Those who believe the government is correct in doing invasive searches, checkpoints, wars on foreign soil and the like could turn on government itself for allowing them to be manipulated into infringing people&#39;s civil liberties and killing innocent people abroad under the justifications of a lie. These are the repercussions of debunking the official report and the lies being recognized by the government.</p>

<p>This is why I personally think this proper investigation has to happen. The benefits for people all over the world are immeasurable. Those who still remember the pre-9/11 and war-obsessed world may know what I&#39;m talking about. This is what we have to fight for.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Since I ran out of space on my <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xslls/911_the_new_pearl_harbor_irrefutable_proof_the/">other post</a>, I will post the last and most fundamental questions here as well as part of the speech made by a now deceased first responder who made me ask who was cutting onions, but don&#39;t tell anyone!</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: If you were aware of solid evidence disproving the official version and suggesting the involvement of some rogue elements of the government in the terrorists attack, would it be more unpatriotic and anti-American to ask for a new investigation, or turn a blind eye to it and pretend such evidence doesn&#39;t exist? (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DegLpgJmFL8#t=5040">1:24:00</a>)</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that the people&#39;s trust in institutions is of paramount importance for a nation&#39;s well-being, would that trust be better served by denying the evidence of a conspiracy, or by bringing those suspected to accountability in a court of law? (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DegLpgJmFL8#t=5059">1:24:18</a>)</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DegLpgJmFL8#t=5082">The Last Word</a></strong></p>

<p>&quot;I want to tell you tonight about the people we call heroes, and are still in growing numbers living in terrible physical and economic circumstances as they struggle with the carcinogenic effects of the toxic chemical soup ground-zero became.</p>

<p>&lt;asks people in the audience to stand up&gt;</p>

<p>Everybody at this side, you are all rescue workers, will be dead in 4 years. That&#39;s our statistics. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening. In 7 years it doubles. And everytime Popular Mechanics calls the people of this movement &quot;nuts&quot;, these propagandists, professional liars and tools who cannot be by any stretch of the imagination be considered journalists, strike another nail into the coffin of another rescue worker. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re crazy. Conspiracies are only evidence the courts won&#39;t hear. </p>

<p>We who are still dying from 9/11 who went to the towers and into that pile, now live with those buildings in our lungs, digestive systems and our blood. For myself and far too many of us, we searched any effective treatments to arrive far too late. I have double metastization in both lungs. That&#39;s just a reality. We were also killed on 9/11. Avenge us.&quot; - First Responder David Miller - New York, 2006</p>

<p>David Miller passed away on december 2010, 4 years after this speech. At least 400 first responders and people who lived near the site have died from cancer since 9/11/01. Another 15,000 have been confirmed ill with toxic inhalation-related diseases. Thousands will die in the next 10 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s clear what they&#39;re trying to do. Licenses for journalists is &quot;You&#39;re free to say what we want you to say&quot; license and those who don&#39;t have it (speak inconvenient truths) could face penalties, jail or ridicule. It&#39;s silencing dissent through legislation.</p>

<p>Facebook is also very much pro-government since Zuckerberg is a guest in Bilderberg meetings and pretty much any sizeable social media obeys the strong arm of government to hide information. Since they know the power of the internet I can only assume this will get more noticeable as more people stop watching TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, I remember my polish grandma telling me a story about her adulthood in Poland right before the Germans invaded. She came from a well-to-do family, and would often speak of her peers&#39; inability to believe that the Reich could possibly do such a thing as to invade Poland, and even if they did, that they would be safe since they weren&#39;t Jewish. Those that believed otherwise and said so publicly were derided as &#39;crazy&#39; and &#39;deluded&#39;.</p>

<p>Grandma, being the smart woman she was, kept her mouth shut, formulated a plan, and left her husband and her country with my mom, aunt, and uncle in tow. Weeks later, the nazis invaded and promptly killed every single person she knew (she found years later).</p>

<p>I am grateful to grandma beyond belief. Not only would I not be here if not for her actions, but she also taught me the fallacy of the normalcy bias and the intelligence-neutering ability of cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>My guess is that you and many others feel a sense of satisfaction at laughing here, and then broadcasting about it publicly to others. </p>

<p>I think you do this in great part to reinforce your own belief systems in order to protect your normalcy biases; it helps to make you feel safe in your belief that the world is a safe place, that bad things happen somewhere else, and that groups of humans do not come together to conspire to amass wealth and power even at the expense of their fellow man.</p>

<p>You continue to believe this and laugh at those who claim otherwise even though science has shown that a good 1% of the human population is clinically sociopathic, megalomaniacal, and sadistic.</p>

<p>This is to me the very definition of willful ignorance, and clear evidence of the mind-numbing effects of the normalcy bias and its ability to short-circuit rational thought. Sad, really.</p>

<p>But keep laughing if it&#39;ll make you feel better I guess. It&#39;s your mind.</p>

<ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Morale within the civilian population as well as all levels of law enforcement and the military would plummet. Those who believe the government is correct in doing invasive searches, checkpoints, wars on foreign soil and the like could turn on government itself for allowing them to be manipulated into infringing people&#39;s civil liberties and killing innocent people abroad under the justifications of a lie. </p>

<p>For martial law to work, they need people to run it and if there is no one willing to do that, the USG has no way of protecting itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sure it is,according to a rough estimate published on Cryptome.org in November of this year, “Out of [a] reported 50,000 pages (or files, not clear which), about 514 pages (1%) have been released over 5 months beginning June 5, 2013. At this rate, 100 pages per month, it will take 42 years for full release. Snowden will be 72 years old, his reporters hoarding secrets all dead.” why is there redaction&#39;s, when snowden wanted the full documents published. Not to mention the involvement of   Pierre Omidyar the billionaire with connections to booz hamilton and the NSA. Its plan and simple that the Snowden files are in the hands of greenwald and his cohorts and have used the files to make themselves wealthy and who know what files they will not release. Snowden I believe was a real whistleblower but got conned out his documents and now lives in exhile. The US government wouldnt dare touch him because it would just bring him more attention so this whole doomsday vault story is red herring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish that was possible but all the chances for a <em>real</em> investigation ended as soon as building 7 went down. Then when the evidence was shipped off-site and destroyed. </p>

<p>Some of my friends make fun of me for obsessing over 9/11 so much. It&#39;s not that this disagree with my position (which is much like yours). They don&#39;t. It&#39;s that I find it relates to everything (much like you do). It&#39;s like when you are playing civ and adopt a new social policy. It&#39;s kinda more like the capstone filling out the tree, really. All those value-added bonuses.</p>

<p>The reality is that the investigation will never happen. And I think we need to find a way to move past that and onto what occurs today. Some of the arguments that are used refer to 9/11, but in reality many of the programs started way before. If anything, 9/11 was quite a long plan. Ever see the video of the report commissioner referring to it as a 20 year plan? Our obsession over 9/11 isn&#39;t helping us stop Obama similar policies.</p>

<p>Look at the JFK assassination. There was even a much later congressional investigation into it that said the warren commission sucked and that it was most likely a conspiracy. Yet you still see people arguing over it 50 years later.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the reality of the media programming we often point to. It works on most people. It worked on 9/11, and does today. As much as I love seeing wtc7 ads in times square, it serves little to tackle the <em>today</em>. The gov&#39;t security apparatus is revealing itself, daring the public to resist. That&#39;s when they can take it to the next level and actually take on domestic &#39;terrorists&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we should stop stuff like the wtc7 ads. But I don&#39;t think obsession is going to get us any closer to whatever <em>justice</em> or <em>vengeance</em> would be. We gotta fuckin&#39; kill the bastards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don&#39;t think the rest of the world uses 9/11 as justification for anything. </p>

<p>&#39;The coalition of the willing&#39; is long dead. And as I mentioned with the unveiling of the surveillance state, many nations appear to be mostly unpleased with the US anyway. I don&#39;t think proving 9/11 was a fraud is going to change anything when <strong>everyone</strong> saw those buildings get demolished. When you have people steeped in cognitive dissonance <em>so deep</em> that they witness controlled demolition and think it&#39;s terrorism there is a <em>deeper</em> issue. That&#39;s what I think we should strive for. </p>

<p>As for the media, they have long ago stopped any hard-nosed investigative journalism. For the last year I have been referring to the press as the &quot;Corporate Main Stream Media.&quot; The other day I listened to Peter Dale Scott in an interview--he refers to the press as the &quot;Governing Media&quot; which I feel defines the press quite well. </p>

<p>The Governing Media not only shape the stories--the publishers/editors KILL articles or may act in more subtle ways by omitting important facts. In fact, the act of Omission is one of their biggest sins--the Governing Media has purposely eliminated any story which questions the Lee Harvey Oswald (lone nut) official version. Likewise, the Governing Media has omitted any investigation which seriously questions the 9/11 official story. </p>

<p>&quot;Omission is the most powerful form of lie.&quot;  --George Orwell</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of your premises actually make sense</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The post-9/11 world we live in today was shaped only by the events of that day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rubbish - it was a convenient trigger to execute US government policy at the time. It is not the ONLY thing that shaped the world. But lets pretend you are correct for a second.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the events are not according to what we are led to believe, how else will government justify the new security-obsessed initiatives and global wars?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t need to justify it and never have. The US have been invading sovereign nations since shortly after WW2 and continued to do so without much justification needed. Likewise, national security has always been a free-for-all ... you only need to look back at FBI and CIA history to see that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Foreign governments and allies will would also begin to demand answers because the events of 9/11 have had a huge influence globally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doubtful at best. Who demanded answers when WMD turned out to be a fairytale? No-one!</p>

<p>The War on Terror is a US-lead conflict that impacts a handful of 3rd world countries who have no influence anyway - they are been demanding answers all along so nothing changes. </p>

<p>The rest of the &#39;coalition&#39; was a token effort to maintain friendly ties/alliances with USA ... no-one has has much skin in the game and again no-one is going to make a huge deal of it, so as to not impact alliances/international relations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US would lose credibility worldwide and skepticism and criticism of their &quot;benign&quot; actions would send the country into chaos, a chaos not planned or orchestrated to bring about a certain end, as TPTB&#39;s favorite slogan clearly states: Ordo Ad Chao.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah - my favourite ... the US has no credibility worldwide anyway as everyone can already see the &quot;War on Terror&quot; for exactly what it is - a continuation of american imperialism via &quot;protection of american interests in international regions&quot;</p>

<p>tl;dr - 9/11 facts have no further relevance to the current world ... its old news and you can&#39;t re-write history ... </p>

<p>Or mostly true. I will disagree a little on the &#39;no further relevance&#39; part - I think the event is still fresh enough in our history that if some indisputable revelation were to emerge tomorrow it could have an impact - perhaps even &#39;re-write history&#39;, as you put it.

<ul>
<li>A man who knows nothing of controlling people&#39;s minds, Adolph Hitler</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;There is a principle which is bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance-that principle is contempt prior to investigation&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Herbert Spencer</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people just won&#39;t even look at the evidence.  They are filled with contempt and refuse to believe the leadership is capable of such a crime.  Usually they are the people that lived through the traumatization of the event.  The same phenomena happened after the JFK assassination.  These people need the television to tell them the truth to force them to face it.  It will be emotionally jarring too.  People that were too young to effectively be traumatized or weren&#39;t born yet are more able to dispassionately examine the many discrepancies with the official government narrative.  By the time we have enough people willing to examine the evidence, it will be too late.  We need to make a solid credible well funded and staffed investigation that integrates all of the available evidence into a solid piece of work with recommendations for prosecution.  Then we should ignore the traumatized as we push forward using all of the legal means possible to get those involved to reveal even more information that could illuminate the key players.  We should not try to convince those with contempt prior to investigation.  Let the television do that if we are successful.</p>

<p>The burden of proof is lower in a civil court.</p>

<p>If members of the Bush regime chose not to appear and defend themselves the jury is entitled to draw their own conclusions from that in a civil court (in most countries).</p>

<p>There are plenty of countries to choose from to launch an initial case on behalf of the family of at least one of the foreign nationals killed on 9/11.</p>

<p>More countries could then follow suit.</p>

<p>There are plenty of countries to choose from to launch this initial case.</p>

<p>Brazil might be a good one to go for as it has recently fallen out with the US government, plans to build it&#39;s own government internet away from US servers and cancelled the order for US warplanes and went elsewhere instead. </p>

<p>Germany is possible - there are already anti NSA activists in Germany. </p>

<p>Upon the successful completion of 1 or more civil suits, more serious criminal charges could then be brought.</p>

<p>These criminal charges might be for war crimes, treason, conspiracy to murder, or simply murder. </p>

<p>Also when trying to persuade new people of the facts of 9/11, I find it better to stick to the more uncontroversial facts and effects, rather than say going into the details of how the buildings collapsed. </p>

<p>Something like this :- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much like the screwing about with the moon missions we will NEVER be told the truth about 9/11. There is too much money wrapped up into it (think insurance payouts, rebuilding, war profiteering...not to mention the embarrassment of our &quot;closest ally&quot; who played a HUGE part in the events of that day). America would cut them off immediately which would basically mean and end to their nuclear apartheid state.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more...we&#39;re talking about some of the most powerful people in the WORLD being involved here. You really think that, if, say, Cheney or Dov Zakeim&#39;s involvement were brought to light that there would be &quot;real&quot; justice? Justice is only as good as money can buy...and they have mostly unlimited sums.</p>

<p>WTC was probably planned by the US/Mossad YEARS before it happened. It depended on the apparatus of a fixed state&#39;s intelligence (Mossad, CIA, and who knows else) who&#39;s planning and knowledge spanned YEARS. Remember the Jewish man who heard several very high-level Jews talking about 9/11 happening (in plain Hebrew) a LONG time before it did...only to be dismissed MANY times by the FBI as a crackpot?</p>

<p>There were a LOT of high-level people in on 9/11...and if you think that &quot;all those people&quot; could never keep that secret...well, you&#39;re dead wrong.</p>

<p>Read Christopher Bollyn&#39;s excellent and free ebook &quot;9/11--The Deception that Changed the World&quot; (at Bollyn.com) for a far more in-depth and footnoted look at how the events of that day REALLY went down...and <em>exactly</em> who was responsible.</p>

<p>i agree.</p>

<p>at the same time, 9/11&#39;s <em>symbolic</em> power is huge.</p>

<p>when the spell of 9/11 is broken, we of course would have to face still the same system of control, but it would be harder to maintain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The author addresses that.  When he was asked, &quot;I have read what you said on the internet about the collapse of the towers. First I find it unprofessional the constant use of pejorative to make your case....&quot;</p>

<p>He responds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really? 9-11 conspiracy buffs can slander government officials, accuse them of mass murder and conspiracy, and ridicule their critics, and I&#39;m being pejorative? If people are going to talk like that they should at least have the guts to take criticism. The conspiracy buffs supposedly have the courage to expose a massive high level conspiracy, but they whine like pre-schoolers when anyone attacks their ideas. Some courage. They can play these games because they know perfectly well that nobody is really going to do anything to them no matter how much they blather about conspiracies. It&#39;s all play acting. How else can you call bull$*** what it is without being pejorative?</p>

<p>The amazing thing is this guy can slander people he&#39;s never met and who have done him no harm, and somehow he thinks that is acceptable professional behavior. You can&#39;t have a meaningful conversation about professionalism with this guy any more than you can play chess with a duck.</p>

<p>Being constitutionally protected doesn&#39;t mean deliberate slander has merit. People call other people all sorts of shit, and it&#39;s because <em>they have no real argument</em>. If these people had a point, they&#39;d likely make it instead of making up cute names for things.</p>

<p>I have a more productive suggestion. Reflect on why you are so confident that your (probably layperson) opinion is stubbornly intransigent despite the scientific consensus? Confirmation bias might be a part of it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a sure fire way to prevent a meaningful debate. Have you ever seem a debate where the opponents trade 6-hour monologues?   Imagine how cumbersome it would be to have a comprehensible back-and-forth debate about 50 assertions all at once. It would be more reasonable for you to pick your favorite piece of evidence and start the debate there. </p>

<p>But if your challenge is for me to start debunking that at will... How about squibs? I will link to two GIFs that demonstrate how the random puffs of dust that you misinterpret as demo charges are actually inconsistent with explosives, and perfectly consistent with overpressure debris jets from a collapsing building. </p>

<p>You present him with a mountain of claims, and act like unless he tirelessly addresses all of them, he must be wrong.</p>

<p>So many of the points you linked to have been addressed already (though you probably either ignore, or dismiss those explanations based on their source rather than their validity), some of them are just nonsense, some are questions based on a completely unestablished premise: &quot;...what caused the squibs...?&quot; How do you know they were squibs? </p>

<p>or &quot;Can you explain how more than 100 witnesses, most of them firefighters and policemen, could have all &quot;been mistaken&quot; in reporting explosions at the WTC?&quot;</p>

<p>Because they saw what looked like explosions, or possibly were explosions of a sort? It&#39;s a giant burning, heavily damaged building, how is this only plausible with planted explosives?</p>

<p>...and many of them are just unanswered questions, using the same nonsense premise that creationists use: &quot;If you don&#39;t know the answer, then our theory is correct.&quot;</p>

<p>When you study <em>any</em> event in detail, there will be all kinds of unanswered questions. Sometimes I feel like the reason &quot;truthers&quot; get so excited about all these &quot;coincidences&quot; and &quot;inconsistencies&quot; is because they&#39;ve never really looked into anything before in their lives, and this is the first time they&#39;ve actually seen how complicated real events are, and feel like all of these complications must actually have one incredibly simple explanation: &quot;The government did it&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Truther&quot; <em>does</em> mean something specific. Sure there are variations within the movement, but I&quot;ve never encountered a single person willing to call themselves a &quot;truther&quot; that was willing to seriously consider that 9/11 was carried out by Islamic extremists, and that the government wasn&#39;t completely aware of their targets.</p>

<p>You seem to be under the impression I just outright dismissed all of this without consideration. I&#39;ve been following this shit for a long, long time. I was already deeply into these things when Loose Change was released, and a quick check tells me that was 2005. I don&#39;t remember how long after 9/11 occurred before these theories started to become popular, but it can&#39;t have been too long.</p>

<p>There were times when I took them more seriously than others, for the first few years I was on the fence, but I have also been very interested in other conspiracy theories, as well as wilder claims about things like the paranormal, and I began to recognize the traits and tactics that crackpots of all 
stripes have and use, and that the &quot;truthers&quot; were as guilty as any of them in their use of logical fallacies and dishonest rhetorical tactics.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly the kind of silly, oversimplified thinking I&#39;m talking about. The government isn&#39;t just one giant hivemind that is either totally honest, or totally dishonest. The fact that you see it as what is clearly a false dichotomy just reinforces the image of the &quot;truthers&quot; as people who see the government as the villainous organization from a Bond film, and not a real group of humans.</p>

<p>Not only that, the idea that the &quot;official story&quot; of the events of 9/11 were completely dictated by the government is ridiculous in itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go ahead, explain your position that&#39;s obviously going to be completely different from &quot;believing everything you&#39;re told&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty silly request. There&#39;s a great deal of the &quot;official story&quot; (which is a pretty stupid term) that is absolutely consistent with the available evidence. Blind distrust of <em>everything</em> you hear just seems like you&#39;re trying to make yourself seem smarter through disbelief, rather than through any actual demonstration of intellectual capability.</p>

<p>My opinion is consistent with what historians, academics, political scientists, and other researchers believe happened. If you did much reading, you&#39;d find that many of these people are enormously critical of much of ways that the US has handled its foreign policies, corporate connections with the government, among other things. </p>

<p>Are you familiar with Noam Chomsky? Gore Vidal? Even Chris Hedges? These are not people who anyone would consider to be blind believers in the US government... and they certainly don&#39;t believe in the stupid 9/11 conspiracy theories. Chomsky is probably one of the harshest and most brilliant critics of the US government and financial culture you can find, Vidal is enormously respected as a historian and author, who is critical of the way that the US government is changing, and warns of impending dictatorship (though personally I think that&#39;s a tad hyperbolic), and Hedges was famously fired from his job at the New York Times for his outspoken views about the war in Iraq. These are the kinds of people who oppose the &quot;truther&quot; movement. Personally, I feel that it is harmful to real, important activism that needs to be done. There are genuine issues out there, and you guys are making the critics of the government seem like clowns.</p>

<p>Many academics are actually far more critical of politics in the US than the &quot;truthers&quot; are. So many &quot;truthers&quot; are libertarians, or even Tea Partiers with a hard on for capitalism and a mindless distrust of the very concept of government.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to look at the actual events of 9/11, it seems pretty clear that the accusations of termite, squibs, and controlled demolitions are just bullshit. They&#39;re not based on earnest scientific analysis, but on people saying things like: &quot;hey, doesn&#39;t that look like a demolition?&quot; or &quot;I know absolutely nothing about what would happen when a jetliner hits a building, but I would assume it would look different&quot;.</p>

<p>Many of the claims that the government or various insiders must have known something are complete fabrications. Jews were never warned not to go into work that day, and the fact that you can find a handful of people out of thousands of workers who had some sort of coincidence make them late and probably save their lives doesn&#39;t mean anything.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> somewhat plausible that the Bush administration ignored warnings to some extent, possibly even in the belief that an attack could be politically useful. What&#39;s not so plausible is that they would think the attack would be anything like what happened on 9/11. Al Qaeda has recently bombed the USS Cole, killing 17, and their 1993 bombing of the WTC killed 6. I doubt they imagined they were dealing with anything that had the likelihood of being as successful as the 9/11 attacks were.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not getting your conspiracy theory correct. The claim is that he ate at the restaurant every morning, but not that day because he had a dermotologist&#39;s appointment. Now, there&#39;s not exactly solid documentation that he &quot;never missed a day&quot; or anything like that, and the idea that an elderly man occasionally had to go to the doctor in the morning is hardly surprising.

<p>Yes, it was, because buildings don&#39;t fucking collapse like that. Americans were too busy blubbering and feeling sorry for themselves to look at it objectively for the most part.

<p>I did, actually, explain my viewpoint to some extent, and you ignored it.

<p>It takes a high school knowledge of physics to know that the pancake effect is impossible, that the trusses couldn&#39;t have pulled and destroyed metal walls multiple times their strength, and that a plane hitting the top can&#39;t cause a building to crumble from the bottom, especially not a building so much stronger than ones that <em>have been hit by planes and burnt out with fires and never collapsed</em>.

<p>You don&#39;t even understand the theories that you&#39;re defending, what a surprise! </p>

<p>NIST came to the conclusion in the official report that the top part of the building crushed the rest of the building as the floors &quot;pancaked&quot;. This is impossible because of Newton&#39;s third law of motion.</p>

<p><em>I</em> don&#39;t, huh? Well, let&#39;s just look up &quot;pancake&quot; in relation to the WTC collapse... hrmm, a lot of conspiracy sites talking about how wrong it is, fair enough, oh look, a page from <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm">NIST themselves</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NIST’s findings do not support the “pancake theory” of collapse, which is premised on a progressive failure of the floor systems in the WTC towers (the composite floor system—that connected the core columns and the perimeter columns—consisted of a grid of steel “trusses” integrated with a concrete slab; see diagram). Instead, the NIST investigation showed conclusively that the failure of the inwardly bowed perimeter columns initiated collapse and that the occurrence of this inward bowing required the sagging floors to remain connected to the columns and pull the columns inwards. Thus, the floors did not fail progressively to cause a pancaking phenomenon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hrmm, that&#39;s a bit odd, isn&#39;t it? All those &quot;truthers&quot; clinging to an outdated theory? Turns out that the &quot;pancake theory&quot; was one that had been proposed <em>before</em> the NIST investigation. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how science works. Investigation and research leads to improved understanding. even though that theory was wrong, it in no way demonstrated anything about a conspiracy.</p>

<p>You see, we don&#39;t have a magical and total understanding of every minute aspect of the physical world. We have to figure things out as we go. </p>

<p>Also, I seriously doubt that whoever wrote that Newton&#39;s third law disproved the &quot;pancake theory&quot; had the slightest clue what he was talking about (because, admit it, you didn&#39;t come up with that on your own, we both know you read it somewhere or saw it in a youtube video). Newton&#39;s third law doesn&#39;t disprove that theory any more than the second law of thermodynamics disproves evolution. It&#39;s just another example of idiots with a very basic understanding of physics thinking that they&#39;ve outsmarted the experts. You can find plenty of these people online claiming they&#39;ve figured out perpetual motion, or disproved the theory of relativity with some silly <a href="https://xkcd.com/675/">thought experiment</a>.</p>

<p>Acting like the circumstances of 9/11 were identical to other plane crashes or fires is totally and utterly dishonest. The size of the plane, the amount of fuel, the fact that the circumstances made it difficult to try and deal with the fires all made for a very unique situation. </p>

<p>I get that people without much education see that and say &quot;those magical scientists and engineers know exactly what they&#39;re doing, there&#39;s no way a couple planes hijacked using low tech methods could do so much damage... unless those magical and all powerful people in the <strong>government</strong> were involved!&quot;. You can&#39;t wrap your head around how things actually work, so you just ascribe impossible powers to those entities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Have to split this in half.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s almost as if I&#39;ve been saying this repeatedly!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You <em>have</em> been saying it repeatedly. Unfortunately, repeating some ridiculous statement doesn&#39;t make it true, no matter how many times you repeat it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Haha, you seriously don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, do you? Why would you try to argue about it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...argue about the process of scientific research? I work in science. I have an education in science. I&#39;m not a scientist, but I work in a lab with internationally respected medical researchers. My parents were both respected scientists. I have a pretty good understanding of the research process.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m pointing out is that you&#39;re making an <em>argument from ignorance</em>. This is the logical fallacy where you claim that your belief is validated because your opponent doesn&#39;t have all the answers. </p>

<p>Do we have a full understanding of every minute detail of the physics involved in the collapse of the WTC towers? No? Well then clearly that means that the planes weren&#39;t responsible at all, and the government was lying about absolutely everything!</p>

<p>You should check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60uJ7sOx_1A%E2%80%8E">this video</a>. It&#39;s not about 9/11 or terrorism. It&#39;s about the concept of &quot;common sense&quot; and its relation to science. The basic point is that the idea of &quot;common sense&quot; has no place in science, and, if anything, prevents people from thinking critically. There are lots of things that seem to have obvious answers, and yet the obvious answer turns out to be <em>completely</em> wrong. I get that the notion that the government is lying about 9/11 seems obvious to you, but that is not evidence. That&#39;s an irrelevant statement about your perspective.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not even trying to make arguments or present evidence. You&#39;re just repeatedly accusing me of &quot;not knowing what I&#39;m talking about&quot;. You&#39;re arguing much like people argue for their religious beliefs, and it does seem an awful lot like your belief in a 9/11 conspiracy is based on a similar kind of faith based thinking. </p>

<p>To you, it seems like, it&#39;s &quot;just obvious&quot; that it was a conspiracy, just like some people believe that it&#39;s &quot;just obvious&quot; that there is a god. Why should</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, because you obviously weren&#39;t reading, they aren&#39;t fucking involved. Were they interested in the topic and read information about it they&#39;d most likely change their position, but sadly it&#39;s irrelevant. Stop pretending your feelings are shared by smart people because they most definitely aren&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. All three of those people have directly discussed the conspiracy theories, and made it clear that they&#39;re fairly familiar with the common claims.</p>

<p>There are plenty of highly intelligent people who have both studied the conspiracy claims in detail, and do not accept them. I&#39;ve even linked directly to a paper that goes over the controlled demolition claims, and finds them deeply flawed, and that has no connection to NIST, but you pretty much ignored it: <a href="http://heiwaco.tripod.com/blgb.pdf">http://heiwaco.tripod.com/blgb.pdf</a></p>

<p>...are you under the impression that the people behind that paper are just a bunch of idiots?</p>

<p>Not understanding your opponents is probably the weakest position you can be in during a debate... and the best way to demonstrate that you have that weakness is to accuse anyone who disagrees with you of either ignorance or dishonesty. It really just shows that you have an overly emotional attachment to your beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science is peer reviewed by nature, genius. That&#39;s the point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Peer reviewed by nature&quot;? What the fuck does that mean? Do you know what &quot;peer review&quot; is?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or, alternatively, it&#39;s fucking obvious and any dumbass that watched it could plainly see that&#39;s not how it works. I&#39;m sorry you never passed any science classes in high school but your ignorance is not anyone elses problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, you just looked at it while it was happening and said &quot;Clearly the planes didn&#39;t cause this, because of Newton&#39;s third law!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s almost as if NIST got it wrong and recanted their stupid shit because it was physically impossible! Sorry, but the pancake theory is what NIST wrote in the initial report and what they were on record as saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You <em>clearly</em> don&#39;t understand how science works. First off, if that were true, that would not be a damning accusation. That&#39;s how science works. A hypothesis is proposed and worked into a more formal theory. More extensive testing is done, and if one theory is proven wrong, new ones are formed. Science is <em>constantly</em> proving itself wrong about various things. That&#39;s what makes it science, the fact that it is dedicated to refining the facts and weeding out falsehoods.</p>

<p>Now, I can&#39;t find anything detailing where exactly the &quot;pancake theory&quot; originated, but the only connection I can find between NIST and the theory is them pointing out that their models disproved it. I see some reference to FEMA bringing it up earlier, so it seems quite likely that this is something other agencies proposed, but NIST actually investigated.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that NIST had anything about the &quot;pancake theory&quot; in any &quot;initial report&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, maybe they got it wrong about other things too, but it&#39;s impossible to check because their physics models are private.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be an interesting point if it weren&#39;t a huge exaggeration. They are keeping back some information, mostly that which pertains to certain simulation software that is confidential.</p>

<p>They did, however, release an <em>enormous</em> amount of simulation data to the public.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a PDF of the letters regarding the FOIA request and release of data: <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf</a></p>

<p>Someone started putting the collection of released files online, but I&#39;m not sure if they finished.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an enormous amount of data here, but it requires ANSYS software to be of any use: <a href="http://wtcdata.nist.gov/index2.htm">http://wtcdata.nist.gov/index2.htm</a></p>

<p>For computer simulations more specifically here: <a href="http://wtcdata.nist.gov/gallery2/v/NIST%20Materials%20and%20Data/Computer+Simulations/">http://wtcdata.nist.gov/gallery2/v/NIST%20Materials%20and%20Data/Computer+Simulations/</a></p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://razor.occams.info/nist-wtc/">this guy</a> sent an FOIA request and got further simulation data. You can get details in the XPD file located there, but some browsers won&#39;t open it, so you might have to save it as an html file to take a look. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Planes have hit skyscrapers before, and the burning point of fuel is known. What&#39;s clear and definite is that jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel. Just because you&#39;re a layman doesn&#39;t mean everyone else is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Planes have hit skyscrapers before, but airliners with that much fuel certainly have not crashed into skyscrapers anywhere near that height. A 747 hit an 11 story apartment building in 1992, but that&#39;s hardly comparable.</p>

<p>It really seems like the only place you&#39;ve been getting your information is from conspiracy theory sites, as it doesn&#39;t really match up with what&#39;s in the actual reports.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll just claim it&#39;s all lies, since anyone who disagrees with you is clearly shilling, but here&#39;s a bit of an explanation addressing why the burning temperature is not as relevant as you think it is:</p>

<p>From: <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/impact.htm">http://www.debunking911.com/impact.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was never the NIST&#39;s contention that the jet fuel brought down the buildings as conspiracy theorists suggest. Conspiracy theorists use this as a straw man. They say the jet fuel couldn&#39;t have bowed the columns and sagged trusses. Just as lighter fluid doesn&#39;t cook your meat in a barbeque, the jet fuel didn&#39;t sag the trusses or bow the columns. You also can&#39;t leave this important factor out either. Conspiracy theorists say the columns couldn&#39;t have bowed and the trusses couldn&#39;t have sagged because the jet fuel wasn&#39;t hot enough and was used up within about 15 minutes of impact. That&#39;s like saying your meat didn&#39;t cook in your barbeque because the lighter fluid burns too quickly. All the jet fuel did was act as lighter fluid and intensify the fire for about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Just because you&#39;re a layman doesn&#39;t mean everyone else is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Layman&quot; isn&#39;t an insult, it just means the average person, not involved professionally in the topic at hand. I think you&#39;ve made it pretty clear that you don&#39;t possess any kind of expertise in any of the subjects being discussed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BECAUSE THATS IN EFFECT WHAT YOU SAID. Oh how could anyone possibly know, there&#39;s just so much information! Better trust the guys with all the vested interests in the world to tell the truth, because they&#39;ve certainly done that before!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s not what I said. I&#39;m saying that no one person can claim to reliably do all of the investigation themselves. They need to rely on some information from others. Not all of the sources backing up what you call the &quot;official story&quot; come from NIST, FEMA, or the government. There are plenty of independent scientists who have studied aspects of 9/11. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or just you know, realise no building has ever collapsed like that before and demolition contractors would be out of a job if it was that easy and neat to bring a skyscraper down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The WTC collapse was &quot;neat&quot;? You realize that the difficult part of a demolition isn&#39;t simply making the building collapse, it&#39;s in preventing it from collapsing onto other buildings, spreading dust and debris all over the place, etc... WTC 1 &amp; 2 did not collapse in a manner any reasonable person would describe as &quot;neat&quot;. Neither did WTC 7, for that matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, still avoiding the question? You&#39;re so dishonest it&#39;s unbelievable. Just admit you don&#39;t know what the fuck you&#39;re on about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I answered your question to the best of my ability. I&#39;m not going to say &quot;I believe everything the government says about 9/11&quot; because I don&#39;t. I&#39;m also not going to say &quot;I think the government is completely lying about 9/11&quot; because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case either, and I think anyone who takes such a simplistic view of these things is a fool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf">http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf</a>
What&#39;s that then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the 9/11 Commission Report. What I&#39;m saying is that what you call the &quot;official story&quot; is actually just a collection of the facts that the vast majority of journalists, academics, historians, political scientists agree to be correct. The vast majority of this information does not come from the government, and much of it can be found in pre-9/11 non governmental sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, that&#39;s nationalism. I love how you tried to turn it around back on me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ehhh... not exactly. There differences between the two terms aren&#39;t all that well agreed upon. Some dictionary sources just see the terms as synonyms. Some people define nationalism as irrational or extreme patriotism, but I certainly don&#39;t see anything respectable in calling oneself a &quot;patriot&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s plenty of timestamps to the various different explanations, you&#39;re just being deliberately awkward because you know in your head that if you watch it you won&#39;t have anything left to argue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude, I <em>guarantee</em> I&#39;ve heard all of these claims before. I&#39;m asking for one little aspect. There&#39;s a reason that extremely long movies are good propaganda tools but terrible ways of conveying scientific information. It&#39;s a nonstop flow of claims and ominous music that is all presented to promote one particular idea. This is why when asked what they good pieces of evidence are, &quot;truthers&quot; so often fail to come up with anything solid, and just say &quot;watch the whole video!&quot;. They&#39;re saying that it&#39;s not about facts or evidence, it&#39;s about getting drawn into a compelling piece of propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the fuck? Who said anything about the government or a conspiracy? Don&#39;t insert a narrative you can argue against because it&#39;s not relevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, so you aren&#39;t under the impression that the government was deliberately lying? Because that would be a conspiracy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re talking about the official report and the fact that it&#39;s wrong. Anything else is speculation and isn&#39;t part of the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, and I&#39;m saying that a good deal of the reason you believe it&#39;s wrong, even though you&#39;ve convinced yourself otherwise, is that you have a kneejerk, irrational reaction to major world events, and tend to assume that the government is responsible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take your own advice dude, you&#39;re arguing for an ideology instead of a reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? I&#39;d love to hear what kind of wacky ideology you&#39;ve imagined I have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hahaha, and on the other hand I know exactly where you got that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh? You know exactly where I got what? The nonsense about the second law of thermodynamics disproving evolution has been around for decades, and repeated by all sorts of creationists... I have no idea where I heard it first, and I&#39;m pretty sure you have no idea either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drop a raw egg onto another raw egg. What happens? Does the falling egg smash through the stationary egg, and remain whole? Or do both eggs smash against each other because that&#39;s how reality works you dumbass?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. That one is going in the book. The fact that you think your egg analogy is remotely relevant is nuts. First off, you certainly could achieve different results in your egg drop experiment by changing various factors. A perfectly vertical egg, for example, could potentially crack a suspended horizontal egg due to the natural strength of the egg&#39;s shape. I could go on, but this is so far from making any sense that it&#39;s pointless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why don&#39;t you shift the goalposts a little more? You literally told me that the &quot;dermatologists appointment&quot; was a conspiracy theory. I&#39;ll quote you again to make it clear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re not getting your conspiracy theory correct. The claim is that he ate at the restaurant every morning, but not that day because he had a dermotologist&#39;s appointment.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Shift the goalposts&quot;? It&#39;s like you&#39;ve learned all of these terms about rhetoric and logic, but are just firing them into your writing like a blunderbuss. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say the &quot;dermatologist&#39;s appointment&quot; was a conspiracy theory. I said that the idea that he was <em>always</em> there, every morning, and only missed it <em>once</em> was. The idea that the dermatologist&#39;s appointment was a fabrication is a conspiracy theory. The idea that he had one was not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s funny is that you apparently don&#39;t realise that the fact that NIST recanted on their bullshit theories but still refuse to let anyone else see how they came to their conclusions throws their entire credibility into question for anyone even remotely interested in the scientific method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, they&#39;re pretty far from &quot;refusing&quot; access to information. Until you&#39;ve actually reviewed the mountains of information that have been released, it&#39;s pretty dishonest to say that it&#39;s lacking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you seen their laughable models for the WTC7 collapse? It doesn&#39;t even look similar to what happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty odd claim to make. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s well shot, high quality video from multiple angles. I don&#39;t see how anyone being honest would claim that they have enough information to declare the simulation videos flawed. Not to mention the fact that if NIST&#39;s goal was to make it look exactly like what people expect based on some misleading online videos, rather than what the entire set of data shows, it would be easy as pie.</p>

<p>By the way, a lot of the &quot;truther&quot; videos are pretty dishonest in the way they present the WTC 7 collapse. This segment does a decent job of explaining that: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PpsCCTMP8w#t=335">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PpsCCTMP8w#t=335</a></p>

<p>Or you can watch that whole video here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PpsCCTMP8w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PpsCCTMP8w</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Message me again when you&#39;ve watched at least some of the documentary in question. Otherwise you&#39;re just repeating shit that&#39;s already been explained over and over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, nothing has been explained in a rational manner, but how about this, you watch a few episodes of the Myles Power videos, like the one I just linked to (which is #4), and I&#39;ll start watching your documentary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been watching the start of the &quot;New Pearl Harbor&quot; documentary... slicker with higher production values, but I&#39;m really not seeing much in the way of new arguments or information. The focus on the very dubious claim that the US was totally aware Pearl Harbor was going to happen is a slightly new angle though. There&#39;s plenty of great information refuting this conspiracy theory, but the Straight Dope does a pretty good job of putting it together in an easily digestible package: <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1889/did-roosevelt-know-in-advance-about-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor-yet-say-nothing">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1889/did-roosevelt-know-in-advance-about-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor-yet-say-nothing</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ll continue skimming though it, but I&#39;ve got to say, it&#39;s pretty difficult to take anyone seriously who actually thinks the &quot;Pentagon might have been hit by a missile&quot; theory is plausible.</p>

<p>I wanted to point something out to you. I&#39;ve linked numerous times to <a href="http://heiwaco.tripod.com/blgb.pdf">this paper</a>, but you continue to ignore it. There&#39;s an important point here though, which directly addresses your insistence that the temperature of the burning fuel was inadequate to cause any significant structural weakening:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But are high steel temperatures really necessary to explain collapse?</p>

<p>Not really. The initial speculation that very high temperatures were necessary to explain collapse must be now revised since tests revealed a strong temperature eﬀect on the yield strength of the steel used. The tests by NIST (2005, part NCSTAR 1-3D, p. 135, Fig. 6-6) showed that, at temperatures 150◦C, 250◦C and 350◦C, the yield strength of the steel used in the ﬁre stories decreased by 12%, 19% and 25%, respectively. These reductions apply to normal durations of laboratory strength tests (up to several minutes). Since the thermally activated decrease of yield stress is a time-dependent process, the yield strength decrease must have been even greater for the heating durations in the towers, which were of the order of one hour. These eﬀects of heating are further documented by the recent ﬁre tests of Zeng et al. (2003), which showed that structural steel columns under a sustained load of 50% to 70% of their cold strength collapse when heated to 250◦C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty solid argument for the idea that the steel doesn&#39;t need to be heated to it&#39;s melting point to cause collapse, isn&#39;t it? They even reference actual experiments demonstrating this effect.</p>

<p>To address your belief that any intelligent person who looks at the evidence will come to the same conclusions you do, you should also check out this other video by Myles Power, not part of his main series: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_UYZITc_90">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_UYZITc_90</a></p>

<p>This is an extensive interview with someone who was once a prominent &quot;truther&quot;, who changed his mind after having the opportunity to actually talk to numerous real experts. It should, at the very least, help you understand that it&#39;s actually possible for intelligent, informed people to disagree with you.</p>

<p>That paper uses mathematical equations to figure out something that didn&#39;t happen, their entire shit is flawed. The assumptions they made at the start disqualify the entire thesis. It&#39;s clear that the people who wrote it did so with a goal in mind, to defend the official story. </p>

<p>It&#39;s dishonest to act as if even a 25% reduction in strength would make a building built <em>with massive redundancy in mind</em> to collapse. The WTC was designed so you could remove nearly half the supports and it would survive a gale force wind. Buildings are made especially strong and the WTC even more so. Planes have hit weaker building and fires have burnt out weaker buildings and none of them ever collapsed, let alone collapsed on into themselves and into a cloud of dust that got blown outwards as if it were an explosion.</p>

<p>Nearly <em>every</em> event NIST describes is physically impossible, that&#39;s why they don&#39;t allow peer review like every other piece of science ever.</p>

Putting so much weight on the comparison to the Pearl Harbor conspiracy theories is a bit of a new angle (not a particularly credible one, mind you... good old <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1889/did-roosevelt-know-in-advance-about-the-attack-on-pearl-harbor-yet-say-nothing">Cecil Adams</a> does reasonable job of concisely demonstrating the flaws in that theory).</p>

(2003), which showed that structural steel columns under a sustained load of 50% to 70% of their cold strength collapse when heated to 250◦C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only do they do a good job of explaining why the steel does not need to be fully melting to cause collapse, they even have experimental data to back it up!</p>

<p>You seem pretty intent on the belief that nobody could possibly disagree with you if they were informed and intelligent, but I&#39;d recommend checking this out. It&#39;s also by Myles Power, but not part of his main series, an extensive interview with a former &quot;truther&quot; who, after having the opportunity to tour the US and interview all kinds of experts and scientists, and changed his mind. At the start of the second video, you can see how the &quot;truther&quot; movement reacts to having &quot;one of their own&quot; change their mind. Death threats, accusations of pedophilia, harassing his family (including sending pornographic material to his underage sisters)... certainly not the behavior of rational, decent people who want to have an honest conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this isn&#39;t English 101...</p>

<p>Aside from the will/would error, the assertion that allies will begin to demand answers <em>because</em> 9/11 had a huge global influence does not, in and of itself, make much sense.  Just because 9/11 had a global influence does not necessarily mean allies will demand answers.  9/11 may have had a positive influence for many administrations/regimes.  Perhaps the British Parliament already knows 9/11 was a fake operation, but if it has permitted them to increase their self-surveillance operations, they probably won&#39;t &quot;demand answers.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, not that this is English 101.  Moving on.</p>
