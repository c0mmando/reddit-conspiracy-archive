       Exactly.

       But they lie about their juice. 100% juice, yeah. From GMO concentrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it says freshly squeezed. If it doesn't say, Not from concentrate, then it's from concentrate..

       Not only that, but OJ has less vitamin C than a handful of strawberries or some pineapple juice.

       Right, but then you add an extra liter of water and now what do you have?  An unoriginal watered down fruit.  That's the point.  Meanwhile, you'll still be paying the same amount.

       Juice is already more than 58% water when you squeeze it yourself.
      </p>

       If you're looking for a real juice conspiracy, here's one:

      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1w76dv/til_tropicana_oj_is_owned_by_pepsico_and_simply/">
        TIL Tropicana OJ is owned by Pepsico and Simply Orange by Coca Cola. They strip the juice of oxygen for better storage, which strips the flavor. They then hire flavor and fragrance companies, who also formulate perfumes for Dior, to engineer flavor packs to add to the juice to make it "fresh."

       The content which isn't water is sugar in any case, and citric acid etc. and a bit of 'concentrated extract'

       Better off taking made-in-China Vit C tabs and skipping the sugar and additives of worthless 'orange' juice

      <p>
       In Australia, fifth generation farmers are having to plough fruit bearing orange and other fruit trees into the ground thanks to 'trade agreements' which favour 'orange' and other 'fruit' extracts imported from south America

       Sooner people quit buying fake 'fruit' drinks the better

      <p>
       It will take a while, but it will result eventually in companies getting the message, which in turn might result in the future in a return to genuine fruit drinks made from fruit grown in the land of the consumer

       That company is ran by either coke or pepsi and there was a lawsuit where if you claimed you drank one between a certain date you were eligible for 25 dollars and if you had a receipt proving you bought some between a certain date you could get 50 dollars. Either way I stopped drinking it after that.

       No the lawsuit was because they we stuffing their "juice" with GMO soy filler and not even listing soy as an ingredient. Even the small "healthy" companies pack their products with the estrogen mimic soy which completely disrupts endocrine function and in so doing causes a plethora of diseases. Look at the labels on your salad dressing, cheese, frozen french fries, frozen meat balls, ketchup, bread, cereal, etc. They're all stuffed with soy.

       I think it is generally accepted that low calorie juice will be augmented in some way. Some people would rather drink diluted juice if it tasted good enough and was low calorie. I think those are the people buying Tropicana 50.

       Maybe the consumers don't realize they are stupid enough to pay same price for it, rather than just buying the real juice and diluting it themselves by pouring water in their glass first at home.

       It's unfortunate business preys on the lazy, and uses marketing to obscure and deceive. However I would prefer this to legislation that controls business to cater for the lowest common denominator. I don't want to live in a world built for idiots even if that means I get caught out every now and then.

       I think the same way, I buy a 59oz 'half gallon' of 100% oj and mix with water.  THE SAVINGS WILL MAKE YOU SHIT YOURSELF!
