      <p>
       Thanks so much for being with us! Here are a few (very detailed!) questions I have for you:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your father founded the
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Investigations_Committee_on_Aerial_Phenomena">
          National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena
         </a>
         , so not only is he alleged to have worked with technology related to UFOs, but he clearly had an active interest in researching the UFO phenomenon. At one point (how old were you?) he asked you to sift through files of UFO sightings and told you to separate out the ones that "wobble" because those were "ours." Obviously there are many ways this provocative statement can be interpreted, but what do you think he meant? Who is "us"? Who are "they"? Do you think your father contributed to the technology behind the UFOs that wobble?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         One of the preoccupations of your father's life was "sidereal radiation." He became convinced that the variations in his gravity experiments were connected to the position of the planets and the Sun and Moon...experiments which he conducted over many decades. He also was involved with "gravity" expeditions for the US Navy during the 1930's. Can you expand more on this "sidereal radiation"? What did he discover on his various expeditions for the Navy? Why do you think, even after there being irrefutable proof that your father served in the Navy, that FOIA requests initially elicited a complete denial that a "Thomas Townsend Brown" was even enlisted in the Navy during that time? Do you think this confirms that he was involved with classified research? Does the fact that records of his service are still classified today indicate that perhaps whatever technology he was researching for the Navy continues to be classified as well, 80 years later?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Writer Nick Cook has this to say about your father: "Two portraits of Brown had been painted and are now in circulation: one portraying him as a mildly eccentric inventor with some hare-brained ideas about negating the forces of gravity; the other showing him to be a man responsible for some of the most highly classified research of the war." What was it like growing up with a father like that? Is that one of the reasons why you attended nearly 50 different schools growing up? I remember you said something about your house being bugged...when did you become aware that much of your life was being monitored, and how did that compute in an age when that sort of thing was generally viewed as being in the realm of science fiction?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Writer Paul Schatzkin, who worked for years on his biography of your father,
         <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Defying-Gravity-Parallel-Universe-Townsend-ebook/dp/B00266OWY6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1392430167&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=schatzkin+defying+gravity">
          Defying Gravity: The Parallel Universe of T. Townsend Brown
         </a>
         , quite literally gave up and released a completely unedited manuscript. Even though he had previously worked for 25 years on a biography of
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_Farnsworth">
          Philo Farnsworth
         </a>
         , he called it quits after just 6 years of researching your father. I know this is a loaded question because you spent much of that time helping him with his research, but I can't help but wonder what happened. Will a definitive biography of your father ever be written? Do you think there are documents out there that are yet to be declassified that will fill in the gaps, or is it up to independent researchers like us to figure it all out?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Thank you for your time, and I truly appreciate all the work you've done to share your extremely fascinating and unique life experience!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: For those who are new to Brown,
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xqkpq/in_anticipation_of_linda_browns_upcoming_ama_this/">
        here's a fairly detailed overview of his life and work
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Schatzkin's "Defying Gravity" is definitely worth the read, despite it being an unedited and unfinished work.

       This is the best that I can do on your first question....
      </p>
      <p>
       Dads interest in " Flying Saucers" was first publically demonstrated in the early fifties when he was featured with his associates in front of his " flying disc" demonstration, in an LA paper
      </p>
      <p>
       ...Dad founded NICAP in 1956 in Washington DC. but it was the summer of 1957 when he handed me that big stack of reports from that Washington Office. We were living in Florida at the time`and I was just 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had already learned to type pretty well and I spent alot of my time helping Mother type up patent applications which Dad was drafting that summer.( Once he started dictating the text of the patent applications he never stopped talking and barely slowed up. He never made changes or corrections ( except for our typing) so I was very involved in everything then and was proud to consider myself part of his " office staff!"  a staff of two! Mother and me!)
      </p>
      <p>
       material was being sent to him from by Rose Hacket, his former secretary at  NICAP. She had stayed on with NICAP after Dad left for Florida  but it was obvious that she was still working for him and I always looked forward to these stacks of reports that she sent us. Always interesting reading the reports of saucer sightings around the world . And it was then that he handed me those reports and told me to concentrate on the " saucers that wobbled." "Those are ours" he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that moment I didn't question what he meant by that. I know that must seem strange. But I had accompanied Dad to his lab in Washington many times during 1955 and I had learned already that  if he hadn't already volunteered information that he wouldn't tell me more, it was a waste of time to ask...he never got angry if I pressed a question but he never answered either... so I had learned not to ask. . What I was to know, he would tell me... Sort of the family code &lt;g&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked me what I thought at the time?....It was obvious to me that there was a team at work..I had met several men in Washington and in his lab and hey all talked about " Flying Saucers" I had even gone to a meeting at Clara Johns and listened as her " Flying Saucer Discussion Group" talked about the things. It was after that meeting that Dad decided to form NICAP and the name was created at our kitchen table.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to get into terrible fights with my classmates at school because they all though Flying Saucers(this is the fifties remember) were either ridiculous fantasies or were dangerous and needed to be shot full of holes ".....I just thought they were being silly to not see something that I recognized as obviously real..
      </p>
      <p>
       . and the shape of the "saucers" which were " wobbling" were generally reported in those years as (what Dad referred to as " The Adamski Scout Ship" style)
      </p>
      <p>
       . I had handled a lovely little prototype model in 1952 that I happened to find on Dads desk at his office in Los Angeles.I had walked into the office just ahead of my parents and I was actually  playing with this beautiful shiny silver disc that was on his desk. It had portholes around the center of it and a little knob on top..I had been " flying it" ...( making it bank through the air) when Dad came quietly behind me. He took it from my hand and gently said... " Don't play with that Sweetie. Its not a toy." and then he added " Its probably the most expensive Paperweight in the world".
      </p>
      <p>
       But as he took it from me he said..." It wouldn't go like that... it would fly more like this."... and he kept it stable and moved it in quick jerks without any banking as it was making turns..... I remember saying.... "OH". and thinking that was really different and that he had told me something that perhaps not too many others knew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the reports around the world talked about those " Adamski Style saucers" and I recognized them as being exactly the same as the little ship that I had played with years earlier"... When Dad said... "Those are ours" I just took it for granted that they were somehow connected with what he was doing... because I had already handled a small version of the same thing...The EXACT same style " ship", even down to the three balls underneath. I figured that for some reason some of them were not operating properly and by " ours" he meant that those were the ones he was focusing on at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had already figured out that there were other.... Entities... as Dad called them.
I had talked to him  about "them" during my childhood...... (especially after having a very strange dream in 1955....where three Adamski style ships landed nearby)
      </p>
      <p>
       The dream made quite an impression on me. I asked him later if they would hurt us and his response was that we were probably more dangerous them than they were to us. I asked why they didn't land on the White House Lawn ( in my dream they had landed on our back field!) and his response was that they didn't need to ... that they already knew everything about us that they needed to know  from a great distance.  So yes... I figured that there was a " THEM" but I was not worried about them. If Dad wasn't, why should I?
      </p>
      <p>
       turning my attention to the sidereal radiation question now

       Wonderful response. Can you elaborate on the motion that flying disc toy, or the "most expensive paperweight in the world" as your father cleverly put it, moved? Was it a jerky up and down motion while it moved in a lateral direction?

       He moved it right and left.... up and down... quickly.... so it did look jerky to me... which was entirely different than the way I was " swooping and soaring it....like any kid would playing with a toy airplane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I distinctly remember saying "OH" in response to that little lesson and I remember the strong feeling then that I had just been shown something that not many people in the world knew. Heady stuff for a seven year old!

       The only ufo I ever saw I saw over whiteman airforce base in approx 2003, it moved exactly as you described.  A bright light just jumping, then holding, then jumping, all jerky motion.

       This is the first online place I have mentioned it, but also the first place I have heard what I saw described, of course, by your father.  That is not what I was looking for here, it is very unexpected.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only posted because of that congruence, which for me makes my jaw kind of drop and gives me chills.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know two other living people who were there with me, I had time to go get my glasses and look at it from several angles in a large field, we saw it for 20 minutes or so.  I was at a small hippie music festival along a small river that I at the time did not realize was anywhere near a military base, and it wasn't except that the airspace where the thing turned out to be flying was whiteman airforce base, which also gave me chills and made a knower(not a believer) out of me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I have wondered if I could have been watching the afterburners of some jet, but that thing was motionless, then superfast, then motionless, then superfast, jerky is the only way to describe it.

        to find on Dads desk at his office in Los Angeles.I had walked into the office just ahead of my parents and I was actually playing with this beautiful shiny silver disc that was on his desk. It had portholes around the center of it and a little knob on top..I had been " flying it" ...( making it bank through the air) when Dad came quietly behind me. He took it from my hand and gently said... " Don't play with that Sweetie. Its not a toy." and then he added " Its probably the most expensive Paperweight in the world".

      <p>
       Odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a small thing must have been a working model to be expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont know what would have made it so expensive though if metal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe some exotic dielectric inside.

       You can see pictures of that exact model if you simply type Townsend Brown images on Google. You will recognize it immediately. There are even some pictures of it on its back. Those pictures came from my family archives. If I can I will try to find the images for you and post the link but I am kinda stuck doing a few other theings right now. I believe that the " expense" part of it was the money spent to develop it...not the little unit itself. I know that Dad personally spent a quarter of a million dollar of his own family money on his research and I expect that the group he represented spent millions more.

       We had just come back from Hawaii at the time. He never mentioned that particular experience but he was demonstrating those "saucers going around a sort of maypole" at the time and he was very strongly allowing the connection of his work and Flying Saucers to be linked. I have discovered in my research that he did this intentionally... sort of wrapping himself in the lunatic fringe so that others ( maybe Russian spies) would not take his work seriously. Even Nick Cook who wrote the Hunt for Zero point remarked in his book that Townsend Brown he thought could be discounted because of his association with early nut case flying saucer reports and then the disapearing ship myth generated by William Moore. It was all too fantastic Cook remarked. He wouldn't touch Townsend Brown with a " barge pole"...

       So the one in the tall tube? Thsts the little model you held in yuor hand? Cool!

       Actually i would be curious to know of the giant "frisbee disc" was solid metal or hollow or two disc shapes with another material inside as a dieletric.

      <p>
       Looks light the way he handled it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if he ever got a power supply small enough to fit insode a model or if you ever saw him experimenting with battery power.
      </p>
      <p>
       (i want to make a little battery powered one in the back yard) with modern lipo batteries and tiny high voltage electronics we have now from laptops it should be possible!)

       Oh and also the disc with the leading edge wire... Did the wire always just appear on one side of the disc or did it go all around?
In the picture it is just on one side but i wondered if it was just a partially completed model.

       Being on his ship in a hurricane when the ship would seem like it would never rise out of the huge wave troughs and landing on okinawa and seeing all the ships and a kamikaze.

       He never talked about his lab... out of it.... and if I hadn't been with him I would never have known that he even worked in a lab!!!! He just didn't mention what was happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       He mentioned coming back from England on a Ship that was laden with fifty million dollars worth of gold bullion and running into a storm that he thought was capable of sinking them. He wrote later about wondering if they were going to be the mysterious lost galleon in the future. The year was 1938 and he was on the maiden voyage of the " Nashville". I believe that she was a destroyer.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as far as the war years.... he never said a word.....and certainly didn't mention jumping out of a plane in the dark... at 600 feet... into enemy territory... or about getting shot and nearly dying from his wounds. Not a word.

       Your second question helped me find things that I didn't know about before!
Oddly I happened to have pulled Dads Navy file out last night and just read part of the contents. In them he describes why he called it " sidereal radiation". Strangely information just seems to find me when I need it! There is information in the rest of the sheets which might explain why these records were so difficult to locate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was sent by Dad to the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation... via the commanding officer USS Nashville... via Commandant, Navy Yard, Washington. The date was the 16th of July, 1938.
This is the section three of his report:
"Since leaving he Naval Research Laboratory I have continued independently a pure research problem relating to the isolation and measurement of an apparently new-found radiation from space. Because of a pronounced maximum in intensity at 16h sidereal Time it has been named " sidereal radiation". Attested by Dr. Abbot ( Smithsonian Institution), Drs Fleming and Gish ( Carnegie Institute), Dr. Miller ( Case) and Dr. Maris ( Navy) the investigation appears to be of considerable value to science. Nothing however has been released for publication."
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't have the names of those men before now.... so ... thank you!
Please note where that information was sent and through whose hands it passed... via Commanding Officer USS Nashville and then via the Commandant... Navy Yard... Washington DC. A strange combination indeed!

       Getting back to some of your questions above
      </p>
      <p>
       My parents and I were very close and the constant moving started when we came back from Hawaii.in 1952. I started first grade there and then  attended 48 schools before I graduated from High School in the spring of 1964. I never missed a grade even though generally I was passing through more than four schools a year..
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother and Dad said that they " owed me" those two years last years in one place but. I don't think that it was easy for Dad to remain in one spot that long.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had a man living with us full time who was not the most pleasant fellow in the world. He came to stay with us when we moved to the Bahamas for a period of time in 1962 and he stayed with us until I graduated from High School and left for college in 1964.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can remember being very upset with Charles Miller because he never smiled.  I felt that he was an outsider to our close knit family. I didn't like him.   Mother listened to my gripes but told me to "get over it"... That Charles Miller was a "necessity".. I think that Dad must have spoken to him later about his glowering attitude around me because after that particular snit fit on my part Charles did try to soften up a little in my direction, but he was still a very serious man...
      </p>
      <p>
       I was told too that he " scared the crap" out of most of the boys that wanted to date me at the time!  I have learned since that time that he was indeed an armed " security escort" for the " Brown Family" and that he  had been assigned to us by a group out of Nassau. And I think underneath all of gloomy expressions...that he eventually loved all of us very much.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was Charles who told me very seriously that I should EXPECT that there would be people "listening in" on what was being said in regard to my Dads work ( probably for the rest of my life) and that I always needed to remember that if I didn't want something to be known.... I should simply not say anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as what it was like growing up with Dad? It was an adventure!..Mother loved our nomadic life ( and Dad) as much as I did.... we sailed and swam in some wildly different rivers, lakes, oceans....wondrous places... Paddled a canoe down the rapids of the upper Potomac....hiked in the woods together, walking, laughing and  talking about amazing things... I learned to handle a 48 foot cruiser well enough to back her into the slip all by myself.and learned how to navigate through the Everglades in a canoe without leaving a trace. Dad made sure that the one passion in my life.... horses ... was indulged... even though neither he nor my Mom rode..My mother was the cosmic glue that held us all together and even in the most trying times and the toughest situations... we kept to the oath that we would never all  get " down" at the same time.... that one of us always had to stay optimistic. That worked well for us.....

       Oh Absolutely. I spent my first five years there but we left in 1951 then later he went back many times during the seventies.... First with the Navys Dumand Project ( remember the neutrino capturing device? Its not really funny... but they spent millions of dollars and the fish ate the sensors! Dad carried his " sensor" ( which could do the same thing as this amazing underwater arrary...) in his pocke! Subs would stop by to take it for rides.... I still have that little rock as a matter of fact... its " retired" now &lt;g&gt;. A simple beach rock. Too much to talk about right now but please stay in touch. Aloha

      <p>
       And perhaps with that simple Aloha I should draw a close to the convesations. I don't want to be the guest that didn't know when to go home! and I really do appreciate what a wonderful experience this has been. I have no idea if I have answered all of you properly. I hope that I have given you a glimpse into this topic and into my Dads life.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my other forum members once said that groups like this were like special windchimes set up.... and when that wondrous breeze of conciousness blows gently through us we all respond with a  tone... different for each of us... this is the song of the cosmos... Our conciousness reaching out and recognizing what is reaching for us. It really is an enthralling experience.  Thank you fro giving that to me here today....Linda Brown    Aloha

       Beautiful edit to the original answer. It was a pleasure meeting you here and reading all of your answers. I cannot imagine what an exciting life you live. Digging through the mental and paper archives to answer questions I'm sure is exhaustive. I will research more on your fathers work, your books etc. I do hope to keep in touch. Aloha.

       A'ole pilikia! No problem! It is a fantastic word predating written language. The resonance is deep and profound. The true deffinition even more so. I'm sure you are tired now but I would enjoy emailing or private messaging more here on reddit. I was just looking at your family website. Universal synchronicity is a humerous cosmic joke! I'd like to communicate more with you.

       If I can butt in here, this is what I found out from my research:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After WWII, Brown moved his family to Hawaii and established a lab at Pearl Harbor, relatively isolated and behind the security of a military base. He had his equipment moved from the University of Pennsylvania and soon gave a demonstration of his devices to high Navy brass, including Admiral Arthur Radford, commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet. Brown demonstrated his emerging ideas about using his conceptions for communications, which would later be incorporated into his Project Winterhaven proposals, and another for propulsion. He also showed his “magneto-hydrodynamic drive” which he had been working with since 1929.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be noted that during this stint in Hawaii, Brown still was investigating “sidereal radiation” as well as how it might affect the stock market!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So yes, it does seem like he was
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       actively engaged in working in Hawaii for several years. His proximity to the military base and his ability to move his massive equipment around the world implies a "hidden hand" in his financial support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm sure the islands of Hawaii were an ideal environment for his personal interests, namely his measuring of "sidereal radiation".

       There is one thing that has not been brought up here and it concerns the B-2. Everything about the B-2 including the four engines which are not jet but actually flame jet generators. All of this was invented by Thomas Townsend Brown. Much of what the government has told you about the B-2 is not completely correct.

       We spoke alot about this all through my childhood and into my adult years. Maybe it made it difficult for me because I just already BELIEVED that such a thing as  OTHERS were possible because they flew the craft people called " Flying Saucers" at the time and I had already seen those in my Dads lab.... so it was no stretch for me to take his word that there were other Entities. He was always careful about calling them that and I don't think that we ever got into a discussion about what they looked like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say though that I had one " experience" in 1955. For years I called it a dream but during the last couple of years I have come to understand that it was no dream at all. It was an experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wrote about it in my memoir and before that Paul included my experience in his book....
      </p>
      <p>
       going quickly through it. I was just nine, playing outside... three ships land in a field next to me... I run screaming for Dad who walks out to meet three individuals ( one from each ship) I wouldn't let go of my Dads hand so I was right there with him. He stopped to calm me down saying " Sweetie... everything will be alright. I was a frightened little girl but the "entity " that Dad spoke to looked entirely human. He was a man about my Dads height.... with red hair and a beard... I thought that he looked like Jesus. They were looking at something on the ground... a box... I overhead the Captain ( thats what I chose to call him later) tell dad... and it can send messages a million miles, instantly..... then all of the sudden we were in the house and I disctinctly remember watching his two companions walk into the kitchen and just stand as the Captain went into the living room. I looked at his companions and was puzzled because I couldn't see their faces and other than the fact that they were very pale they looked entirely human. I was upset because none of them were wearing helmets... I thought all space men should have helmets....( it was the fifties remember!) I finally worked up enough courage  to ask the captain about the two just standing there... why they were so pale....He explained that they had a sort of artificial blood in their system but when they got "home" that blood would be taken out and their own blood returned. I can remember distinctly just saying  ..... Oh"!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we happened to have guests visiting when I had this dream and I told my childhood friend Chip about the dream... we laughed about it until Dad at the dinner table mentioned the dream that he had had night... and it was identical to mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my associates, a Dr. at Los Alamos even called Chip to verify that story and though I havent seen him for forty some years he remembered that vividly. Dr. K has helped me work through the idea that this indeed was an Experience and not a simple dream... its just easier to call it that. Thats about all I know about " the others!" &lt;g&gt;

       Hi Linda,
      </p>
      <p>
       First, thank you for doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a whole bunch of questions, so please feel free to answer what you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am interested in recreating some of TT Brown's work.  I am looking for some advice.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is barium-titanate still the best dielectric to use?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What is the minimum voltage/current rating needed for successful electrogravitic effects?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is there a simpler way of producing the effect that has been discovered in recent years?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are there any other tips or effects I should be looking into in order to recreate these effects?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you have any general advice or information for someone attempting to recreate this work?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are there any specific geometries or designs that work better than others?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did TT Brown ever mention aliens or exotic tech he saw?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Again, thanks for your time and contribution.

       Please forgive me for giving you a very short answer because the questions are piling up around here... barium titanate was what Dad used... I think much work needs to be done but I wouldn't doubt that there could be a better one out there... He was most successful over 50,000.....general advice? Be VERY careful. These are not toys! Please stick with us for more information OK....... He did mention forces he called The Other Entities.

       I probably know less about other " Entities" than many other people. I have read what other writers have had to say about Greys, Reptillian and all other types but I have had no personal experience in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dad had an unshakable belief that some type of " Entity" had interacted with him but he never tried to describe it to me. I think that he felt any kind of " description" for something that there were still no " words for" was sort of a lost cause... so he didn't bother. So I never learned anything from him that could help you out here. Sorry!

       The lifter which has been seen a lot and used a lot is a very simple way to re-create the electrogravitics fact. His simple device made from also lead aluminum foil and copper wire. You can achieve lift with it but only about 17,000 V. I suggest to you if you are interested you can see the full Bahnson's Lab Video on my YouTube channel:

       Just an added note. When you are working with these lifters and that means any kind of lifter even the ones that Brown used in his experiments. The ones that look like on umbrellas on the video. Retain the voltage for some time afterwards. This is what Linda is telling you about when she said these are not toys. Another suggestion is you can look for other materials that can be used for dielectric material that are lightweight. One of these materials is Styrofoam. I personally have been shocked when I tried to touch one of the small lifters made of balsa wood and tin foil so be careful.

       In his labs Dad would have painted yellow lines on the floor. You were warned not to go past those lines. I saw one technition get bitten just once and that was enough of a lesson for me. As I said before... these are NOT toys.

       Hey thanks for your reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was under the impression that the 'lifters' made of aluminum foil  were not exhibiting the biefield-brown effect and instead were relying on ion wind effects.  I always understood lifters to being a diversion away from true electrogravitic effects.

       They are. It should be simple to show that if you place them in a vacuum they no longer work.

       Meister_Vargr I think that you did not read the posts I made above which states that this is been proven in high vacuum. Many people misinterpret what the small lifters are really doing. Again you should look at this YouTube video.

       At this time I really do not know of any that I existing. There are those who are still building and flying different size flyers. For myself I am working more on how to actually control the movement and to stabilize the field around it. I am also working on an area that Townsend Brown started in the 70s that deals with free energy.

       And realgravitywave here might be able to tell you a little bit more about what happens when  the " control" factor is not right on the dime. The unit " wobbles". Where did we hear that word before? In 1957 when Dad handed me all of those saucer reports from NICAP. "Look for the ones that wobble" he said. "Those are ours."

       To further explain the wobble effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who are just learning, the electrogravitic propulsion is created by applying very high voltage pulse DC electricity across a capacitor. The positive charge creates what's known as a gravity well and the negative charge creates what is called a gravity Hill. The two combined creates a gravity wave. The best design of a craft to use this technology is a flying saucer or disk shaped craft. With the top surface of the craft charged positive and and a small circular area on the bottom of the craft charged negative. This creates a gravity wave that encompasses the 360° around the craft. The pulsating of the DC creates a wave like a fact much like the waves of the ocean or of a lake. This causes the craft when it is stationary to create the wobbling effect. There is no need to spin the craft itself. Townson Brown and others later used three metal balls located at 120° around the lower half of the craft to stabilize the field. This actually can be seen on the Bahnson Lab Video.

       An associate of Townsend Brown's, Dr. Mason Rose called it a gravity kick. An experiment that was done by Brown in the early 50's had to two one and a half foot diameter disk hanging on a T-square. They were charged at 50,000 V, just 50 W of power, they moved around the circle at 12 mi./h. When they pulsed the DC voltage, they got acceleration that was so great that it nearly ripped the rig apart.

       If you have watched any of eric dollard's early videos you will notice that short sharp pulses of dc allowed fhe electrons to drain the area of space near the discharge of excess energy beyond what was deleivered through the circuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also eliminated electrical resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla had a switch desinged to deliver just such a pjlse to acheive those effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect this may be one reason why ttbrowns saucers got such a boost from jjst  a pulse.

       Tesla had nothing to do with Brown discovered. And this is not what is going on. You need to first really study what the effect is. The electrons are not draining away from the area this is creating an actual field around the craft and it is just boarding the localized space around it and creating a gravity wave. I realize everyone wants to point Tesla but he really did not discover this. There are links to areas on this discussion where you can find documents and the patents of Townsend Brown that you can read and and study.

       The tesla pulse effect for electronics is different alltogether. I was just pointing out thst for any cricuit it can give a large boost to available power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of the circuit itself that ttbrown used is independent of tesla completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remark i made about a pulse draining an area around a circuit ... Actually the ether in tesla's description isnt related to the area around a ttbrown foil and happens in any circuit the pulse effect is used in.

       This is actually a more difficult question to answer than some might think. Dad told me the difference as he was explaining it to the nine year old horse crazy kid that I was...... electohydrodynamics is like a pony.  ElectroGravitics is like an enormous and does the really heavy work. They are both equines. They both have the same natures and sometimes appearance but the mass of the heavy horse makes all the difference. Someone someday can explain it with numbers and formulas but thats probably the only explanation that you will get from me!

       No that is a fallacy started by a few people. It is a very easy and inexpensive way to demonstrate the effect. If you build one and fly it, make sure you have it tethered for it will fly all over the place. I use simple sewing thread together it. When you get tethered and it is staying very stable in one place you can use your hand up near it a few inches away from it to actually feel the wave like affect. But again be careful that you do not touch it with your hand.

       I visited Dad during the weekends sometimes in 1955. and sometimes I slept on his leather couch while he worked through the night. He had given me a white lab coat, told me not to interact with strangers. He didn't have to tell me to act " grown up" I was nine but I was tall and I had figured how to act grown up all by myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had visitors the next morning and told me to sit by the window away from everything and to simply look busy and practice my typing. A group of military men came in... some of them highly decorated. One of them obviously the leader acting like his time was being wasted. Dad had a little foil thingy sitting flat on a table. They apparently were there for a demonstration. " If I apply power to this.... will it move?" The men all inspected it carefully... the big brass ( Dad called him later!&lt;g&gt;) said in a huff" ABsolutely NOT. Dad started turning the rheostat. the little thing hissed a bit and they all stepped back.... it wiggled a little and then he turned the knob again and the silver thing that looked like an oversized foil envelope jumped off the surface of the table and hovered there... straining at the threads that held it down. The Big Brasss face when ashen. Dad had said... before he turned it on.... Are you willing to bet your career on that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       They all left much more silently. Dads two friends Bill Lear and Dr. Sarbacher hovered at the door and smiled back as they followed the military entourage out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it was the best thing that I had ever seen. I asked Dad what it all meant and his simple answer was " Oh a whole lot Sweetie, a whole lot."

       I have NO DOUBT that the men he worked with ( like Sir William Stephenson, Dr. Sarbacher, William Lear. Floyd Odlum and Bradford Shank (and of course his best friend A. L. Kitselman) left the world FAR better than would have been without their efforts. The fact that this work was so deeply shadowed I believe was because of intentional acts... to spare us from getting into a very bad situation and way over our heads with this technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its my hope that the new age is dawning, starting today.... and some of Dads work will be able to be inspected and appreciated. But I think we are much better off because it was hidden so well for so long and will be even better when it is allowed finally to " bubble to the surface"..

       Oh my goodness... it takes that long to read? We must have been really moving along then because I know that I didn't leave this seat for over four hours ... thats wonderful that we covered so much ground but I have to admit... tension was running so high for me that I barely remember some of my answers. Sorry about my typos and mis spellings. Characteristically I type very quickly and what you get is straight off the top of my head. I have to reread to see what I said sometimes because I am so much " in the moment" when I get like that I don't really have a hook on what I am typing. Sometimes its scarey.... but its at least undiluted Linda Brown. ( as some of my associates roll their eyes!!!)

       Do like I do.... Google, Google and Google again. Latest word I think is that they have delayed certain announcements until the middle of March. So you have time to learn more about these developments. This is the start of an entire new age. Understand that this means that we as a species can put away our use of Fisson.  Google that too... learn how dangerous it has been to us... and how a change from that path will change our lives.... learn, learn and learn again... but please... do this for yourself.....you will learn more if you do the research on your own.

       I'm afraid because I'm from the other part of the globe, I'm completely clueless about most of your replies I've read till now.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it isn't too much of a bother, can I ask you how would you summarize this thread, it's premise, your relationship with your father, your father's relationship with UFO's and the American Government, your personal opinion on "The Entities", the application in Fusion, your opinion on future of this world and much more... to a complete layman like me?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand these are completely noob questions but please also try to understand this thread from my point of view. This is an entirely new perspective for me and it's 4 AM in the morning here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will have to sleep now because I have college in 5 hours but needless to say, I'm very interested in this thread and would like to continue once I get back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could really use a helpful Road Map for this entire thread from you. At 4 in the morning, this information in it's current form is too much for me to process.

       Floyd Odlum ran what was called the Atlas corporation. If he hadn't stepped in and paid for the initial space program ( when Congress objected to the bill) we would have been delayed for years in the space program. Thats why they called the missiles ATLAS. Not many know that but record of his contribution is out there. He told me once that you can get a whole lot done ... if you don't get hung up on expecting to get credit for what you do.

       Sir William was knighted eventually for his service to the crown and the world in general for his running of an intelligence service that supplied information that helped the Allies win the war. The modern CIA was patterned after what he helped the English develop.

       Beau Kitselman was a math wizard and my Dads best friend. Some material is coming out on him now but he was almost as invisible as Dad was during their time together. But they were FUNNY and sort of reminded me of Abbot and Costellos routine. Oh another fine mess youve got us in Beau would bellow and Dad would get that silly grin on his face. They were amazing.

       I think the "modern cia" is its own animal and is far beyond the capacities of us to understand, and is now likely the most powerful organization on earth if they are able to keep balance with the mossad.

       These are not positive developments, everything we consider to be our 'government' is a farce.  I don't even claim to know the form of government I live under anymore besides that I don't like it and it is without my consent.

       I hadn't realized how many intelligence agencies there were in the United States, besides the CIA....( something close to 17 or 18, right?) I believe that the NSA is pretty important but what I would like to know is more about the NRO. ( National Reconnaisance Office.... which is responsible for monitoring the intelligence satellites looking out as well as back at us. Surely these guys could know much more about UFOs than we ever would? Their motto is " We Own the Night".

       I am not sure that I agree that everything about our government is a farce, but it sure can be disappointing.

       I appreciate your concern but I can verify to anyone who needs further verification that I am who I am. Read my answers, if you are not convinced that I am Townsend Browns daughter by the end of this session then perhaps we could meet somewhere and I will bring family photos and other proof that can not be questioned.

       Its good to worry about the possibility of " agents" trying to discredit a forum. All of us who are involved in the subjects we have been talking about are going to be subjected to that. So I understand. But I assure you that I am not some computer savy pimple faced kid getting a kick out of pulling the wool over your eyes. I think that its obvious from my struggle with the technology here that I am well into my sixties and totally invested in making sure that my Dads story and lifes work get the recognition that it deserves!

       If your dad was invited to such a group, was he doublecrossed and left out after they had gained privilege of his knowledge?

       Flytape, I am just now learning about the expression called " breakaway civilizations" and I don't think I am really qualified to answer your question right now. I do know that starting in the 30s that Dads life was greatly influenced by very powerful men. It was his choice to stay in the shadows but I think that he has accomplished alot that is still to be revealed , especially with the Navy developments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have met such a group. I didn't notice any invitations however! &lt;g&gt;.(Maybe I was "grandfathered in! &lt;g&gt;) No... Dad was not " doublecrossed by this group" They remained loyal to him and still are I believe.

       Linda i could be wrong but from what i understand about your Father he had a profoundly deep thought process. This is why i asked you earlier about his thoughts on the 'Visitors'. He clearly had a keen mind on a practical level and looking at the hear and now but did he ever share his innermost thoughts about the nature of genuine UFO occupants or life beyond Earth?

       I chose that phrase very carefully. I am so encouraged that you caught that!
      </p>
      <p>
       My Dad was an extremely humble man. I think that helps sometimes when you are dealing with issues that are as important as these.
He explained to me once that we were all like a school of fish who happen to look up and see something strange in our sky.... some of the fish of course scatter and never look back but some study what they see.... but fish he explained are NEVER going to be able to explain a black and white cow munching hay in a field. And even if they could SEE that sight... how in the world could they come back to the other fish and explain it? And he thing that they see? How do they know that its a hull of a ship.... and beyond that there are other things like TVs and rockets to the moon...( thats what he said to me in the fifties when he told me this story) but he fact is... on some levels there are only certain things that a fish can know.....trying to tell a fish what you have seen.... if you were somehow a flying fish and could glimpse all of this.... well... its difficult. And thats what is happening ( he said) when we look up and see a strange thing in the sky. We really can't even conceive of what it means.

       Like the idea that the Aztec's couldn't  recognize conquistadors that were approaching them. They had no past experience with such people and were therefore impeded because they had nothing to go on, that they simply couldn't recognize what they were seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything we understand is based on past experiences with things that we have understood. Many UFO accounts and events contain a level of absurdity that is confusing to those who experience them  - and researchers who investigate, the incidents often don't make sense. This point has been argued well by Jacques Vallee.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an element to genuine sightings that seems to be beyond our understanding or comprehension. It's a key point as to why so many reports contain an element of what we see as absurd or ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever they are, they seem to operate within an entirely different understanding of reality.

       No difference at all. And I think thats part of how the Home Team here operates. They have the ability to be something that we can't recognize. Though I think occasionally a few people somehow " break on over to the other side." I believe that Dad was one of those people. He explained how he got information. He said that it would " come to him" all at once.... with nothing left behind. After experiencing this sort of thing he could write an entire patent application because he saw all of the words in order. All he did he said ... was speak them.... He would do that so quickly that it would take two of us to get it typed....
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can see when you have someone like that how very difficult it is for that person to translate what he knows ( or how he has learned it) to someone who simply wants the MATH and for which nothing less than that will do. Dad would just throw up his hands and walk away.... but he could give other engineers instructions on how to build what he needed and the danged thing would work. No real explaining some of the gifts that all of us are given and only some of us recognize,

       There is a world that is beyond maths and physical material i believe. I have often thought that conciousness, or collective consciousness can offer an energy or creational force equivalent to anything we can produce from equations and materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are co-creators is my best understanding and the power of thought is often an unrecognised aspect of a power we don't truly understand.

       This is way out there but did your Father ever say anything that could correlate to this idea?

       Yes, absolutely.... He was always very cautious about warning me ( and everyone) that we had the ability to manifest our own futures... but its more than just that. Understanding the workings of human conciousness is going to be very important in the future. Dads best friend and closest associate was also very interested in conciousness. You will see this subject more and more in the future.

       One of he men who worked with him told me recently that Dad was capable of " automatic writing". I never saw him do that. Maybe he was just doing a form of that because he knew that he could just dictate his words and we would catch everything ( That was NOT easy... especially when he started one of these sessions in a canoe or...somewhere else that wasn't the standard setting. My mom kept a yellow steno pad with her all the time. Just in case.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is off the subject but the steno pad made me think of it. I worked for a couple of years with a " remote viewer" that was sort of " assigned to me", Now I wasn't sure that she was the real deal, especially when she started giving me messages from " the other side"... OK.... I will listen to anything until it falls off the cliff. But one day she came to me complaining about how picky my Dad was... that he had awakened her in the middle of the night. She reached for a standard notebook and then complained to me later that she absolutely was encouraged to go get that special style of yellow notebook... that he wouldn't talk to her without it.... so she got up... went to a store , bought the pad and then included all of that with the packet that she was bringing to me. THATS when I really knew that she was the real deal because no one in the world would have know that was one of Dads requirements. No one...

       That is certainly a more than interesting coincidence with regards the yellow paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the "automatic writing/orating"; this is a very intriguing aspect of the puzzle behind your Father's work and I do think this type of phenomena of "channeling information" is far more pronounced among the human species than is currently understood. It seems only certain people know how to adapt the channeling into the necessary and proper temporal mediums, and your father was, in my opinion, most certainly one of them.

       Oh...the comment about Dads insistance ( through the abilities of a very talented woman) to use only a yellow tablet when she was taking dictation from him. Now understand, Anne had never met my Dad while he was alive so her being able to speak so surely about what his specifications were about writing on  a yellow pad. Yes. That taught me that she was certainly the real deal.

       She would bring me packets of scribbled material... some of it I couldn't understand at all. When I asked her what it meant her response was..." I don't know Linda! I just bring this stuff to you. I have NO IDEA what it means. Its FOR YOU not me.

       There are a lot of charlatans on this planet - something which you yourself may be more aware of than others.  However, even amongst the din and hullabaloo of fakers and opportunists, there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed examples of the bonafide real thing that exist:  Off world beings ("ETs" as many call them - some of which, as you yourself experienced first hand, look just like we do), people with bonafide ESP abilities, ghosts, paranormal phenomena, etc, etc.  All these things are indeed a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       real phenomenon.  That there are so many parasites undermining the reality of such things doesn't keep the authentic cases from being any less real.

       Maybe you could help me understand why it is that there is such a horrendous movement to discount these kinds of things ( and my Dads work)
      </p>
      <p>
       I see that people might not understand but some take all of this to a level of energy that goes right into verbal attacks. Its almost as if... they figure...if they tear me down ( or even try to say that I am not my Dads daughter and other things that are substantially meanspirited) then somehow people will be allowed to forget his work. What is at the base of this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it feels like the people that attack me are reading form the same playbook.  Do people attack things that they don't understand? Is it as simple as that? Are we dealing with just a human trait? Or is there something else happening here? It just feels so " orchestrated" sometimes that it is un-nerving.   Linda

       Okay.  Let me take a deep breath as I pull up my bootstraps and get ready to dig in to responding to you here (you should perhaps take a deep breath too, cuz my response will
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be short...).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        PART I
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are various theories regarding the reasons why there is such a horrendous movement to discount these kinds of things.  I'll go over just a small few that I have a certain understanding about.  These are by
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       means whatsoever exhaustive, of course:
      </p>
      <p>
       The oil and energy/fossil-fuel-and-coal-burning industry on this planet is a multi
       <em>
        trillion
       </em>
       dollar one.  The practical entirety of our civilization is integrally connected to it (for better
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       for worse).  Any discovery or technology that threatens to upend and undermine the use of fossil fuels/coal burning as the established medium of energy on the planet - even if such discovery or technology be vastly superior to the established order of things - will be aggressively rooted out with absolute and extreme prejudice.  Work similar to what your father was involved in was sufficiently close to threatening some of that order.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth about the existence of ETs and - no less important - ET craft and their propulsion systems would essentially let it be known beyond a shadow of a doubt that free energy and free energy technology
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       indeed exist.  Once the cat of free energy gets out of the bag - once it becomes understood to the people of Earth that a craft no larger than an averaged-sized automobile can travel multiple light years through the use of a type of energy propulsion technology that is for all practical purposes inexhaustible and eternal - technology that allows it to pull energy right out of the ethers themselves (such would have to be the case, for how else would ET craft be able to travel the vast distances they're obviously able to? by using internal combustion engines?) - then at that point it would be soon realized and understood by everyone on this planet that the application of this same type of technology would render the need for fossil fuel and coal burning technologies completely and entirely moot.  That is to say that if one is able to use the same free energy technology that ET craft obviously use to travel from wherever they come from light years away to here and back again, then that same free energy technology can be used to take care of all one's energy necessities here on this planet - food, warmth, shelter, transportation, etc - all for
       <em>
        free
       </em>
       .  Once its understood that one can have a technology that can address all of one's energy needs
       <em>
        for free?
       </em>
       , then no one would ever need to be a slave to a job in order to make money to pay for all their necessities in life as is currently the case.  This would essentially take all of the power away from those in control of the system because people would not need to be beholden
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       that system or to money in order to sustain themselves.  The system of fiat currency that this whole civilization is based upon would at that point come crashing down.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB will have
       <em>
        none
       </em>
       of that.  They will
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       relinquish that power.
      </p>
      <p>
       And who is this PTB?  Well, it does indeed seem that there is a group of extremely powerful beings on this planet - human and/or non human - that seem to work above those laws that apply to everyone else.  They seem to be pulling the strings of society, and the rest of us all dangle at the end like marionettes.  Who are they and why are they doing what they're doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       that can be said about who these beings may possibly be.  However, for the moment, I shall limit myself to simply offering
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">
        this
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018">
        this
       </a>
       reference for perusal.  The information should not be taken as gospel, but - again - as reference (deep reference) to some of what might be going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suffice to say, it would seem that this group or whatever group that has been demonstrably proven to work above and beyond the law (groups like the ones responsible for being able to get away with the things shown in documentaries like
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvl6kO1Vo8">
        Conspiracy of Silence
       </a>
       ) can also be said to have a significant hand in the type of monolithic, overarching global-wide influence that keeps information like ET existence and technology, as well as free energy system technologies like what your father - among many others - worked on from entering the public forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last but certainly not least, when trying to assess what exactly might be going on in this planet and why, there is also the ancient Eastern concept of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga">
        Yugas
       </a>
       .  Yugas, or ages, can be said to be greatly responsible for some (if not a lot) of what is going on in our planet today.  Please read
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xdy8f/why_is_society_the_way_it_is/cfalrop?context=3">
        this
       </a>
       for a decent understanding of what I mean in relation to how Yugas relate to what we're specifically talking about here (regarding the great negative manipulation that seems so very overwhelming on this planet, the black op projects government and otherwise that exist, and the overall negative energy that exists) and just how it is that they (i.e. the Yugas and what they mean) also may be greatly responsible for why we're living in the exceedingly dark and tumultuous age we seem to be living in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be said that the suppressing of ET reality, energy propulsion systems and technology, and most other things that are known as or considered "paranormal" or "supernatural" are to a great extent about power and the sequestering of that power by TPTB here on this planet.  The more of us that are kept from knowing about the reality of these things, the easier it is to control us and keep us tied and limited to the very small box that we are generally all kept in.
      </p>

      <p>
       Yes.  Some of it has to do with the fact that there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed payed shills - people who are employed to discredit an investigation of those truths TPTB don't want us to know about.  Some of it, however, also has to do with simple (unfortunately simple) human nature.  We are generally a weak and very ignorant species, and we have not been very well cultured and nurtured by TPTB to work as steadfastly toward constructive togetherness and understanding as I feel we would otherwise be able to achieve.  This, likely, is a very purposeful thing.  It keeps us generally in a state of angst and conflict with one another.  Such a thing keeps us divided, and as a result easier to conquer and control.  Society is structured - subtly and sometimes not so subtly - to keep us at ends and at odds with one another for this reason.

       Thank you. Those are some but not all of the conclusions that I have reached. However for me it comes down to a personal relationship with these kinds of forces instead of the theory that they exist. I have watched my Father and others around him come up against forces such as you have mentioned. Some of them are a simple given. Those in power are sure not going to give it up.... but that does not mean that things will not change. The horses had to step away for the motorcar. ( My own Great Gandfather and his Uncles told a young Henry Ford to find somewhere else to build his passing fancy. That the wagon business they had would be there forever and his was just a whim that had no future. So he didn't put his factory in Zanesville Ohio.  I don't expect those in power to give up their stance right away but that doesn't mean that they won't move forward. They are not totally stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of what you have written here I don't entirely endorse but perhaps thats just my problem, having not learned enough.  Its good to see your take on it. I do entirely believe your last comment about human nature, however....I see the " control" that has covered us in a slightly different way. I am looking forward to talking about our differences of perception someday. Thank you so much for answering my question. The time that you took to express all of this means so much to me.

      <p>
       This, of course, is very much correct.  The reason for this is that those human/humanoid forces in power are themselves but a cog in the wheel of even greater influencing on the planet and in the universe, and those
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       forces have a much greater influence on what actually happens and how things actually change.  It can be said that the planets themselves have an identity actually
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       greater than our own, and it is really
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       influence that has a much greater impact on things than ours - important as our own influence may be in a certain context.

       It's an attempt to simply beat you down - discredit you in any way possible, by any means necessary; attack you subtly, as well as in overtly malignant, very untruthful ways.  This kind of method is enough to eventually break many people and cause them to quit whatever truth campaign they were previously on.  It is your job to continue being as balanced and steadfast as you have been.  Simply continue holding to the
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       .  You know what it is (or at least what part of it is) and that often can be enough to keep you from swaying too greatly in the winds of discouragement that many attempt to throw at you.

       Yes.  Most certainly - especially if those things they don't understand attempt to upturn their established world view...and a good portion of the information you are specifically involved with by its very nature threatens to upturn most people's world view.  Understand that the game you're involved with is a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       , very deep one.  It's not simple checkers you're dealing with in a lot of this information you've got your hands in.  This is deep, deep chess at the high stakes international level, if you know what I mean.

       <p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No.  It's not.  Some of it is, of course.  Some of it, as stated above, simply involves people that are just afraid to give up the world view that they are psychologically and emotionally attached and committed to - people who are afraid of the truth of some of your information.  They get scared/freaked out when they come across it, and react by simply lashing out at you for challenging the world view they have.  This is the basis of some of the attacks you receive.  Another portion of it, however, also involves an established power that is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       committed to making sure that pretty much all of humanity remains locked down to a very limited world view and perspective of the world around them.  It can be said that it is to the detriment of at least a certain
       <em>
        portion
       </em>
       of TPTB's aims to have an educated public, so they work hard at fostering and bringing up a civilization that keeps people locked down to a very small view of existence.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are we dealing with just a human trait? Or is there something else happening here?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No.  Not necessarily.  To an extent, yes.  We are indeed a generally limited, primitive species still on this planet.  However, we do have the capacity to live in peace and love.  All of us have that within us.  It seems that the world we live in can be said to be constructed to KEEP this internal reality we all have within us from effectively manifesting itself, however.  There seems to be a power sufficiently superior to us in intelligence that can keep us as a species from arriving at the level of global unity and peace that's possible - that unity and peace that, as I said above, we actually
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       indeed all have within us and want/desire.  So what the heck is going on?  If it's true that such an absolutely
       <em>
        insane
       </em>
       conspiracy as I've implied here is going on in this world, then WHY is it that it's happening?  Well...I'm not really comlpetely/entirely sure, to be honest, but -
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">
        as I linked above
       </a>
       - it might
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       be the case that we human beings here on planet Earth are part of a big, huge, global experiment designed to cause us as a species to evolve into greater beings.  The process of that evolution, however, might entail a
       <em>
        means
       </em>
       toward that development and evolution that (much like the extreme and often painful difficulty involved in training for, say, a triathlon) is quite arduous and difficult...hence many of the trials, tribulations, and vicissitudes that we experience on this planet.

       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       that it is.  I would say that I think you know this as well.  Many of the things you've said in this AMA, as well as
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       you've said them seem very aware of this.  The understanding seems bubbling not too far under the surface of your consciousness.

       Peace to you.  We are all family - it's just that some of us realize it a bit differently (or a bit less) than others.

       You said here "
It's an attempt to simply beat you down - discredit you in any way possible, by any means necessary; attack you subtly, as well as in overtly malignant, very untruthful ways. This kind of method is enough to eventually break many people and cause them to quit whatever truth campaign they were previously on. It is your job to continue being as balanced and steadfast as you have been. Simply continue holding to the truth. You know what it is (or at least what part of it is) and that often can be enough to keep you from swaying too greatly in the winds of discouragement that many attempt to throw at you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want you to know that I am going to keep that statement on my desk... where I can see it...Someone else ( with a background in geology) told me that I had to develop a sense of being TOUGH. Ordinarily when you hear that you think of a big burley fellow who can strike back... demolish his foes but thats not what the word means in his world. To him the word Tough means a substances ability to absorb stress AND NOT BREAK..... seeing your words here has helped me understand that I don't have to take up arms against all of the bullies who have lined up ( almost around the block... it seems) against me. I don't have to do that... I just have to be ME... Townsend Browns daughter.... I have to simply absorb the blows and not break.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for helping me remember here that I am not alone.

       That's it.  That's all it is.  All you have to do is, again, simply stick to the simple truths that you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       you know - that you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry much about "building up".  Instead, break things down to their essence.  Take yourself down to what your truths are.  Go there.  Once you get there, then there aren't really too many things that can damage you or break you down.  Sticking to what you know is true holds you to an adamantine strength that naysayers and disbelievers simply can't reach or get to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best...and cheers! :)  Hold your head up (as I'm sure it already is)!  You're doing AWESOME work! and I mean that!

       The Navy I believe is in control of alot of things that are not mentioned. When Dad developed a propulsion system that "Had no moving parts" and was totally silent... He was Navy through and through.... and one of his friends that he met on a very early gravity Expedition ( in the 30s) was a young jg by the name of Rickover. Do you think that Rickover would have known what to do with a propulsion system that was totally silent? Do you wonder why things around my Dad went so totally dark.... while he was pointing to the skies and involving himself with UFO research... have you ever considered what was happening with the submarines that he loved so much? And since you probably know about these already.... what about the Unidentified Submerged Objects and the reports of some that seem to be able to boom into and back out of the ocean.... at will... thats where I would look for the majority of Dads work.  Go Navy.

       Apparently the genuine ones hide, or have bases underwater. Tim Good and a lot of others have covered this. There have been a lot of sightings surrounding large bodies of water and USOs emerging or UFO's submerging from the oceans. The Russians have spoken and reported such incidents quite candidly.

       There is an area off the western tip of Cuba that was very interesting to Dad.... in both the thirties and much later in life. Apparently there was some very unusual white sand being displayed in odd places. I never knew what that was really all about but I have always figured that there was some major underwater excavations going on out there. And speaking of Russians... they were all over that area with scientific vessels "camped out" over that particular area for months, A place to look into  ( off the Cape of San Antonio if anyone feels like going swimming!  &lt;g&gt;)

       When it first started out it might have actually been with the Navy. But since then and especially after it was fully developed technology in 1971 it was the Air Force that had control of it.

       I haven't looked in that direction yet gravity. (Much I have to learn)...I was told that somewhere there was a ship called the Townsend Brown. Do you think thats true? Of course we are going into what some would call fantasy but I am just asking your opinion here. Could she really be out there?.... with that name on her?

       Don't misunderstand what I said Flytape... I actually said that I hadn't heard about the " Breakaway Civilization" phrase until just recently so I can't put that name on my experiences.... I don't think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The group that I am familiar with I have met a few of the members... though they don't really respond to each other the way a " club" might. I am not sure they even had a name for themselves... it was not important to them.... a name.
      </p>
      <p>
       I met some through the years that I would consider in Dads.... he called it a " consortium"... Mr. Floyd Odlum....William Lear....Beau Kitselman... Sir William Stephenson.... and others.... these are men that I happened to also meet. Where Paul Schatzkin called this consortium the " Caroline Group" I have dubbed it " Nassau" because thats the context that I got to know most of them... they were always somehow connected to that area of the world.....I have no idea what they call themselves.... I doubt actually that they do have a name they all agree on. And strangely I think that some might be "Nassau" members and never know it. Its all reflected by what they are drawn to do.... you can sometimes recognize them by their actions. Most do not worry about getting credit or fame for themselves and are more concentrated on getting whatever they can do for the good of mankind... done.... actions, not words ... count.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe that answers the question about Nassau" Do they wish harm? Absolutely not... do they have knowledge of a cataclysm... possibly... but some of this group know much about the future.... Are they trying to escape? Not without taking everybody along.

       There is a statue of a Lion holding down a big python snake with its paw held firmly on it. Its the essence of what I feel is going on here... the Lion I take as being the Group that My Dad represented and the snake I am taking as the evil that it has historically represented.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statue is in a square in Philadelphia called Rittenhouse Square. I lived nearby ( at the Drake Hotel) one summer. and I used to use that spot... (by the statue) to meet the "love of my life there". He was a young man who had been drawn into my Dads group years before and for nearly fifty years we have lived apart... He went in one direction and I went in another. He has told me that we both followed scripts that had been prepared for us. I am very proud of him. I believe that he has lived a good life and I am even more pleased now that we have sort of " rediscovered " each other and have " met at the Lion of Rittenhouse" again. Sort of a mysterious answer, sorry. Thats why I use the name Rittenhouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       My Dad sat with this young man in that park during the summer of 1966....the decision had been made that "Morgan" would join my Dads group. He had been given a year to think about it....Dad told him that the ability to " travel in time" was possible.... ( in Morgans lifetime).... Morgans response has been written about already....Dad had asked Morgan what he would do if he could travel in time and Morgan gave him a particular answer that I guess my Dad realized was impossible...Morgan wanted to go back in time to save a sister who had died.... Dad said that there were some rules that could not be broken and that was one of them..... Morgan then responded... "then I will do what I can..... and enjoy the experience." Morgan responded to Paul Schatzkin and I believe thats in the biography of my Dad that Paul wrote.... that Morgan  thought for a moment that Dad was kidding ... his flip answer to Dad was.... "Where can I sign up?" then he told Paul...." suddenly I realized that Dr. Brown wasn't kidding."
      </p>
      <p>
       Some will tell you that this character named Morgan doesn't exist. Some will tell you that all this is a "figment of my imagination"
      </p>
      <p>
       It really will be something that you all will have to decide for yourselves. Thats the most important thing.  Linda

       Thats alright. Are some of you getting the strange little message about Reddit taking too much time to answer, please try again. I haven't been able to get back until just now and I had to go another avenue.

       Flytape... don't worry about his name. "Morgan" was what Paul decided to call him and I think the man actually liked that name. He considers himself a pirate from Nassau anyway.... and he would have been a good one! Jan and I called him.... JD Garrett..... he has gone by many other names in his career. One of his mentors ( Sir William Stephenson) called him simply " Smith".... but then again... thats the name that Sir William went by too sometimes! ( If you don't know much about Sir William try reading the book called "A man called Intrepid"  ( Actually Intrepid was his New York cable address.
      </p>
      <p>
       The older "Mr. Smith" and the one that I knew went sailing once on Biscayne Bay. Paul used "Morgans" account to build an entire chapter for his book on my Dad... the experience of the three of them sailing together. I think that Paul named the Chapter.... Reflections on Biscayne Bay.... Thats when I started to lose Morgan.... and drats... that moment in time I had just found him.... Nothing like the passion of a young woman...except maybe the passion of a young man offered adventure and a chance to be another James Bond.  I lost..... then anyway...&lt;g&gt;   Linda

       I really dont think I know enough about all of the different " styles" of ETs that you have mentioned here, Dad did say that the " Entities" that he was aware of had the ability to control our perception of our own reality. And that they used it as sort of a camouflage for their own protection. And THOSE were part of our own history here on Earth.... He believed that they had always been here with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dad was not associated that much with Project Blue Book but was known for starting the network for reporting ufo sightings  ( NICAP)
Some people argued that he did that because he needed more information on various propuslsion systems and they were probably right. He never rejected the idea that learning about saucer sightings all over the world would not be useful to him.

       Do you think it's possible the "Entities" aren't aliens at all? There was an AMA (on another subreddit) with a UFO researcher and that was the conclusion he came to. He said things didn't start getting weird for him until he came to that conclusion (basically that the creatures behind UFOs were some sort of non-human being that has been on earth the whole time, but not an "alien" in the typical sci-fi rendering of such). He implied it could become dangerous for an investigator to start down that line of inquiry.

       But that is almost exactly the concept that Dad had about the "Others"... but he used the image that they were more like a fawn in a forest camouflaged from hunters. To be discovered would mean disaster for them... until we became wiser and kinder. And so far.... thats been a long wait.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is another idea too. Dad felt that they allowed us to remain agressive and warlike... even though it went completely against their sensibilities because we were like a layer of protection from OTHER entities out there... not earth bound who really couldn't give a rip about humans Or deer in the forests.... entities who would take over completely... except that we are so danged warlike its sort of like sticking your finger in a red ant hill. See where that gets you! So while we are not what we should be... and our warlike tendencies are not what we should strive for..... I think that the Home Team uses us as a layer of protection.Thats a common thing if you observe the symbiotic relationships that are someimes created between two species. Does it seem odd then that the "Others" who have lived peacefully with us would " help us slowly develop" in exchange for the protection and warlike attitude that might be needed if we were attacked from beings outside our home planet. Does that make sense?

       It does, and is certainly fascinating to consider. This researcher felt their main power was altering our perceptions, and their actual technology was always  just slightly ahead of our own. When we were hunter-gatherers, they were the elves making things go bump in the night. In medieval times their craft were more like "modern" conventional airfare. Now they have anti-gravity craft etc. Combined with the stories in this thread it makes me think that these entities may derive almost all of their technology from harvesting the ideas of the "best and brightest" of humanity and thus maintain a perpetual slight edge over us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest mystery to me would then be the nature of their evolutionary origins - did they evolve here or have some kind of crash landing many millenia ago? And what they truly look like, as it seems in our encounters with them, their human or humanoid "alien" appearance is a contrived one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some more observations and a "stretch hypothesis":
      </p>
      <p>
       -If ancient legends are to be believed, then these entities previously existed more or less in the open as immortal "gods", and may have been much more numerous than they are presently. Their violent history with us in this time is what gives them suspicion about our nature to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Many of the conspiratorial political machinations discussed in the sub have a timeline on the order of 100s of years - unlikely any humans would have the sustained motivation and willpower to see these plans through over generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Believable tales of abductions frequently involve unusual interest in our reproductive organs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stretch hypothesis: The entities either crash landed or came here to hide thousands of years ago and walked among us as gods. These entities are biologically immortal but unable to reproduce - possibly they could be the  bio-engineered servant organisms of a parent civilization.  We resented and resisted their obviously superior presence among us and they went into hiding, often behind the human structures of organized religion. As time passed on, their remnant parent civilization technology degraded, and their population dwindled. While they have certain gifts, actually developing their own technology from scratch does not seem to be one of them. They then decided to harness human ingenuity to attempt to regain their former technological magnificence, thus enter the renaissance. In more modern times they are primarily concerned with regaining their ability to traverse the stars and become fertile by reverse engineering our own reproductive systems. Having possibly achieved this by now, they are now planning on bringing humanity back to a medieval, sedated state by influencing our leaders to make long term disastrous decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would make a good premise for a sci fi novel, at any rate! But that's the most plausible hypothesis I can weave from my UFO story readings, if they are to be believed.

       So it could be an explanation for why there are "alien-like" figures in ancient accounts, but why wouldn't there be evidence of them? I'm sure that these "entities" would have died, so where are they? I'm sure their crafts would have crashed just like ours. How did they make these things? What raw materials did they use? Where's the evidence of that?

       Just wanted you all to know that there is not very much ativity going on the RESOLUTE right now because she is meant to be a ship only for scientific and solid discussions..... I am looking forward to her starting up again with quality discussions on Dads Birthday March 18th. Until then she is just sort of drifting waiting for her crew and captain to start the process. She is named after the scientific sailing ship that got caught in Arctic Ice and was abandoned by her crew. Later they found her perfectly intact but over a thousand miles from where they had left her. She just sort of drifted away. Dads Resolute has been drifting too but it won't be for much longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telling you this because I don't want you to get disappointed in the lack of activity there at the moment. That is planned

       This is what happened to the " flying disc project in Paris. It fits the same kind of method of moving into even deeper black... and this was a fairly secret project to begin with. Watch what happened according to one of the engineers

       "The team made some hasty tests before having the project shut down for delivery of the vacuum chamber to the new company. The Final Report for the Projet Mongolfier, April 15, 1959, outlined these five tests confirming, as in the prior tests, that there was a definable force. At this point our team was scattered, the project shut down and we were unable to make the further tests to further refine and quantify the results.

       Because this is much to big a situation for just one country. I love the United States and my Dad did too but we have to start thinking like humans on Earth. And no I am not espousing a One World Order.... but we have to start taking care of all of us....and no

       The way you answered that almost sounds like some sort of "expanded consciousness", thing. Do you realy believe there are people working for the good of mankind, or is it just a pipe dream.

      <p>
       "edit" just read your other posts, do you believe there are others besides humans,  working for the good of mankind. Do the others pick on some people to deliver messages.

       The men that I met who belonged to the group that was impacting my Dads life all cared more about getting something done than getting credit for anything.

       I am glad to hear that you would feel better. You know the word " conspiracy" does not necessarily mean that people  would conspire ( breathe together) for something evil. Perhaps there might be a sitaution which exists where people " breathe together" in secrecy to do positive things. Its worth possibly thinking about?

       Hello Linda, and thanks for taking the time to answer our questions.
Can you tell us more about the "entities" your dad spoke of? You mentioned that they could control our perception and perhaps we are not ready for contact. Two years ago I had a close encounter with a silent black triangle. During the sighting, and for about an hour afterwards, I was in telepathic contact with the entity that was controlling the craft. Did your father tell you anything about this sort of thing or have you experienced anything like it personally?

       Alright, it's an incredibly loaded experience but I'll try to give you the short version.
       <br/>
       Some context: I live on the 12th floor. Sighting occurred while looking out my kitchen window around 1:00 am.
       <br/>
       The the UFO was a black equilateral triangle with a red light on each corner. In the center it had a white pulsing light. As the triangle hovered absolutely still about 30 meters away from me (across the street) I looked directly into the center light. It seemed to be transmitting emotions directly to me. To me it felt like an extremely intense "hello", like an introduction or a warm welcome. Suddenly the corners or the triangle broke apart, and it stopped being a triangle and instead two of the red lights spun around each other out to space in about 2 seconds. The third light seemed to transform to a 'classic' silver saucer that moved horizontally in a straight line at a steady pace. Afterwards I looked up at the night sky and could see several red lights around a star. They were not orbiting the star, but also changing speed and direction.
       <br/>
       As I look up at the 'star' I am asking for an explanation about what just happened. Of course there is no physical entity in the room with me so I am really just focusing my attention on the occupant of the triangle. It definitively seemed capable of communicating emotions to me, so i figured I would try to send a message back. This is where things really get weird and difficult to explain.
       <br/>
       The star becomes the center of the all-seeing-eye and I can see the triangle around it. This is the strongest presence I have ever felt. It seemed organic, as I could see the eye move around a little bit. It was definitely looking back, straight at me. When this was over I just sat at my kitchen table. Heart racing. Trying to calm down. I close my eyes and after a few minutes I can see an image of the beings face in my third eye. I had my eyes open, but I could see an overlay that of vibrant colours. The entity was facing me directly. It had the shape of a grey alien, big tilted eyes, very large head. Its colour was something like deep purple/blue. I didn't see the being for very long, it was probably 3-5 minutes. However, i felt like it was giving me a lot of information, like an intense upload of information into my brain that I didn't fully comprehend.
       <br/>
       It's been two and a half years since my sighting, and I've done a lot of research into the experience since. I have also been trying to comprehend and work through the information I was given. I could perhaps go into that in detail in another post if you are interested, but the core of it has to do with frequency &amp; amplitude and some pretty neat things we could around manipulating matter.
       <br/>
       In my research i found a lot of commonalities with my experience and what people have reported about psychedelic experiences, and in case your wondering; i have never taken any hallucinogenic drugs. 
Well, this was the short version. If you want more details or have any questions feel free to ask.

       I just want you to continue to communicate with some of us who are trying to get to the bottom of understanding sightings such as yours. You have not been alone at atll in this experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we get a chance can you tell me more about the " colors" that you are seeing when this happens... are they connected to the information or do you sense that the colors and information are somehow separate. Can you better describe the tones of the colors? Do they change? Trying to ask questions without " leading the witness" if you know what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be that what you are " seeing" as part of this is an image that has been.... manufactured.... for our public image of what an alien should look like. I am not sure exactly when the " Grey" body style showed up in our conciousness... the big slanted eyes... the pale skin...In the fifties they yammered on about " Little green men" Today some are mentioning " reptillians"...but I suspect that is all just a "handle" to help us see something that is way beyond our ability to comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
       With my dream experience ( which is what I realize now was no dream) I saw what looked like humanoid figures.... but for some unknown reason for me their faces were blurred to me. And the one figure ( I knicknamed " the Captain" Looked like every picture of Jesus I had ever seen. A red headed... bearded man with a kind face... green eyes... I remembered looking into his eyes and not being afraid any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how else would you calm a nearly hysterically frightened child. Project a VERY familiar figure. It worked. Unless of course the Captain was actually a very familiar looking figure with red hair... a beard and green eyes. &lt;g&gt;   Linda

       Thanks for the reply,
       <br/>
       The color of the entity was static, and I don't think the information was related to the colors in any way. We just looked at each other "silently" for a while. There were no words associated with this experience, but it was an intense experience, but the entity also had a very calming presence.
       <br/>
       Prior to this experience I didn't really believe in aliens and I was really surprised to see that it was fairly "stereotypical" in appearance. I had the same thoughts when I saw the silver disc that looked like it was straight out of X-Files. It did cross my mind that these were projections of something I already knew and was familiar with. However I had never heard of black triangle ufos before so that doesn't really fit with any expectations I would have had prior to the sighting.

       The fact that what you saw was " sterotypical in appearance" does give you a clue here blcktrngl...as you have suspected.  Why did you see what you recognized? Perhaps what you were really looking at was not mapped in your brain yet. Things not experienced and mapped by our brains are generally not seen. A great help to those Entities which would rather not be recognized. The black triangle I believe is exactly what you saw.... I am totally with you on that and you are not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am stuck on the color and for me it does mean something. Can you give me a better idea of the hue of the color you saw, even though you don't think its connected? Thanks ahead of time!  Linda

       I think the colour would be best described as "deep purple" with a hint of very dark blue. I feel this is a colour outside the humanly visible spectrum. Almost like ultra violet (or something higher in the spectrum).
       <br/>
       I had a similar experience when I was 14. When I came home from school I lay down on my bed and this entity appeared right in front of me. That one was different than the what I was describing before. It was a beautiful female face with radiating "hair" of all colours. It was mostly yellow and red. For some reason this seemed perfectly normal to me at the time and I could feel the bliss of the beings embrace. It was like it was hugging me with warm energy while it stared directly at me.

       Thank you for that. Your thoughts mean alot to me,
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be that we all recieve information in " blocks of color"... or maybe I might be speaking just for myself here because I have never had the chance to compare notes with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me " information" can come to me in a quick blast of color which is a very strange violet almost but a color that seems to have a light on the other side of it... After that happens... whatever came to me is there in its entirety... I mean... scarey amount of information. I can be seeing a man doing something and suddenly I have been with him as he grew up( even remembering his sitting on the side of a dirt road picking the gravel out of his knee from a fall when his bike slid out from under him... I can see his brides face and know what perfume she wore that Day... see him putting baby powder on his newborns little butt and I can feel him being so proud of her. I get all of this all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it takes me awhile to verify it.... and if I am lucky I get a chance to ask the man..." Hey do you remember when your bike slid out from under you when you were nine? Then I have to wait as he looks at me.... not knowing if he should admit to it. But he knows and I know that it really happened.... How do you explain how you KNOW that..... (so I don't.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I can somehow get that impression by touching a persons elbow. I have been told by a martial arts expert that if you control the elbow you can control the entire body but for me its like I have the ability to tap into that persons entire history with one touch......tap... wait for the color ( which is instantaneous) and then spend the next couple of years verifying what I already know.  tough sometimes!
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wondered what your experiences were regarding colors.  Linda

       Wow, thanks for sharing. This is really really interesting.
       <br/>
       I can certainly identify with the light coming from 'behind' the color itself. Sometimes I have these experiences where it's like I'm looking through a tunnel. Especially when I look at the stars. It's like they aren't really that far away at all.
       <br/>
       I had a complete overflow of information from this being and I have felt an enormous sense of responsibility since then.  I didn't want to share it at first because of the risk of sounding a little 'far out', but I think I am meant to build a spaceship. This has become more and more clear to me as I've been working with the information I got. I've focused my work on acoustic space and identifying the frequency sets embedded in objects, but I think my work will translate onto working in the electromagnetic spectrum. I have also done work on translating brainwaves (EEG) into sound and light, which I am sure will come in handy.

       The character of "Morgan" which you may have heard about if you have read Paul Schatzkins book about my Father ( The Parallel Universe of T. Townsend Brown) ... He is a very shadowed character who worked with my Dad and recently has stepped up to help me out with future work. He took to calling me Desdemona several years ago and I didn't quite get why he would pick a code name like that for me. Until he pointed me at a Jimmy Buffet Song. Maybe you are familiar with it... Its called Desdamonas building a rocket ship". We laugh about that alot now because he knows I am not at all interested in rocketry, but he still calls me " Desdemona"

       I'm not familiar with the book, and actually before this AMA I was not aware of you or your father! I am very interested in going to space, but never ever will I go there in a rocket ship. I don't believe the answer to space travel is blowing up as much fuel as we can. It's amazing how much of our technology revolves around "blowing stuff up", which to me seems a very primitive approach. The automobile is built around many smaller explosions, and a rocket is just one big explosion. Absolutely crazy.
       <br/>
       I had a dream in the form of an animated diagram that showed me the direction of cosmic energy flow (like magnetic flow but on a much larger scale) and how tapping into that would allow a vessel to 'go with the flow' so to speak. There is a lot of potential energy in the universe, now i just have make some money so I can build a lab and start experimenting.
       <br/>
       It's been great to meet you Linda, and I'm glad to hear that you and others you've met have had similar experiences.

       I like the name, Desdemona.
       <br/>
       I was wondering about the colours you see when you touch someones elbow... Has this been happening all your life? Do you always get a flash from people or just sometimes?  Maybe you only get shown what you need to know.
       <br/>
       I would really like to hear from more people on this issue. You've definitely gotten me interested in connecting the dots. I had never associated the specific colour with anything else than just being a colour outside the visible spectrum, that for some reason i was seeing for a little bit.

       Strangely I don't get "colors" when I touch someones elbow. I don't exactly know why that is other than maybe the " color" is a " transmission" from somewhere else... while the touch is a sort of inner circuit thing... just between me and that other person. Its usually a very personal thing. Just an intuitive impression of that persons " state of mind" really. I pick up.... deception....anxiety, friendly intent... and then its up to me to go from there. With that sometimes I get a flash of something that means something to that person... an item maybe. Its never exactly the same even with the same person. I usually don't do that when I meet people because I think its sort of an intrusion into their privacy... but if there is no other way to get past the wall of publicity around them ( sometimes I will.) Then I usually ask them something that refers to that impression to give them a chance to share that with me verbally. Sometimes I get really odd reactions... I touched a speaker at a UFO convention...and got the impression that he was REALLY quite concerned about his future safety... And I straight out asked him..." Are you really that concerned about your personal safety... He looked at me with the strangest expression on his face and then actually answered me... without asking me how I knew... but that question was in his eyes"Yes... these people can be serious"

       If I am on a "hunt" for information I do strangely get only what I am looking for,
      </p>
      <p>
       The color for me is a blast of a BUNCH of information all at once.....I guess if you have experienced it you would know. If you haven't I am at a disadvantage because there really are no words yet to describe the experience. Even ? "blast" doesn't describe it properly.  Linda

       Interesting, thanks for elaborating.
       <br/>
       I have a strong intuition too, and I will often make decisions based on strong feelings that to others don't seem rational. I've convinced my friends a few times to "get outta here, fast" when I feel that something is going to go wrong, even though everybody seems to be having a good time. They always complain about leaving for a few minutes until they realize things are actually going out of control. 
I also get vibes from people, and when I get to know them it turns out that the 'vibes' are quite accurate.

       Sorry I seem not to have answered this, thought I had but it was pretty late! I think that we all have very special abilities and each one of us has talents that are sometimes not as well developed or appreciated as we could have , if we became aware of them. Those who SEEM less gifted are just those who haven't become better aware of them. And some just naturally seem to have an unobstructed channel to whatever this flow of conciousness happens to be. My Dad was fortunate enough I think to have no barriers in his knowledge... except for the fact that others around him just would never have understood what he was trying to tell them. So he didn't bother to say much or write much about his experiences. His old saying to me when I questioned him about not being able to figure something out was " Wait For It...." and if I complained about others not " getting" what I might have tried to tell them... it was again " Wait For It." (Eventually things will bubble to the surface and those will understand. What is exciting is that I can see that happening more and more every day.

       Thanks for the answer - I saw another response from you on this question last night, I wonder what happened to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       But what you said has kinda been my suspicion as well.  At some point along the way I realized that coincidences don't exist and that "intuition" is a very real thing.  Sometimes it seems like there's a "thread" (for lack of a better word) that runs through humanity and has throughout history which kind of links us all together, sometimes at completely unexpected times.  I'm not sure how to put in words what I mean but hopefully you can understand.

       Don't worry about disappearing responses. Not particulary been my experience here... this has been great fun... but the topic of Townsend Brown and his work automatically brings out a choir of people singing the same derogative remarks. Its as if they are all singing from the  same song book and if you have been reading and listening to all of it long enough you begin to realize that stuff is connected and might even have a control factor somewherel..... and matching negative comments... are indeed related to that control
      </p>
      <p>
       .... my advice is to do as I do. Follow your gut in uncovering information and Don't stop! Intuition is the cosmic glue that holds so much together. Don't discount it!

       Absolutely what I think. We all have gifts like this, sometimes stronger and different in some of us than others..... each one of us have abilities that we haven't explored yet. But we are stronger all the way around if we work together to appreciate the talents that each of us is discovering. Its a simple thought perhaps.... but since you asked!  &lt;g&gt;

       wow, thats great to hear! thanks for telling me about it. sometimes I think I just went insane for an hour, but this felt absolutely real and I was fully awake and alert. It's comforting to hear that others are reporting the same thing.  Even if people are having the same 'hallucinations' all over the world, that would certainly be worthy of scientific inquiry.

       where did your friend see the ufo? did he say something about the information he received?

       this type of craft has come up In my research, however this is not what I saw.  The black triangle I witnessed was a single solid mass made of the darkest material I have ever seen. It absorbed no visible light.  The red lights were on the corners themselves with no spacing around them.  The body of the object had no distinguishable features other than it was perfectly equilateral and perfectly black.

       Yes, of course. Let's stay in touch! I would like to share my story in case someone can identify with the experience. It's difficult to fully describe the event, especially the bit about telepathy, but I think it's important to get it out there.

       Absolutely... just like your experience in some cases. In others the study of human conciousness was a LARGE part of what Beau Kitselman was doing in concert with Dads work on propulsion systems and communication devices. It all blends together at some point.

       I'd like to ask another question or two if I may. Was your father using platonic solids/ sacred geometry for his work? I am interested in the tetrahedra/ merkabah shape in action as a proposed vehicle. Also curious to know if your father used 19.5 degrees in any of his work? The 19.5 degree mysteries and sphericle geometry fascinate me. Interesting to note that Mauna Kea on Big Island sits at this point on Earth. I wonder if a connection to this and your fathers work here in Hawaii could be made. One last thing. Are you a believer in Star Seeded individuals upon Earth? Again all my Aloha and thank you for answering all of the incoming questions.

       Again... regarding the star seed transmissions... we could go on for several days. All I can say in this short time is that is certainly an area that needs to be looked at closely.  Wish I could help more.

       I don't know about the 19.5 mysteries but I did do some research for a college report on Mokumanamana.  The island was used as a marker and for spiritual reasons but was significant marker for winter solsctice.   I mention this cause the markers on Mauna Kea look very similar and were also used for the calendar.   One sland is farthest south in the chain, and the other farthest north and last island with and mountain elevation.

       Hey dude, have you seen Rodin's rotating double circuit (from vortex math), and these numbers applied to a 3d flower of life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the sum of the digital root of the binary sequence (2+4+8....etc) gives a resulting pattern
      </p>
      <p>
       2 = 2
      </p>
      <p>
       4 = 4
      </p>
      <p>
       8 = 8
      </p>
      <p>
       16 = 1+6 = 7
      </p>
      <p>
       32 = 3+ 2 = 5
      </p>
      <p>
       64= 1+0 = 1
      </p>
      <p>
       128 = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 = 1 + 1 = 2
      </p>
      <p>
       256 = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13 = 1 = 3 = 4
      </p>
      <p>
       512 = 5 + 1 + 2 = 8
      </p>
      <p>
       1024 = 1 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 7
      </p>
      <p>
       2048 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 = 1 + 4 = 5
      </p>
      <p>
       4096 = 4 + 9 + 6 = 19 = 1 + 0 = 1
      </p>
      <p>
       2,4,8,7,5,1 - then applied to a 3d flower of life pattern -

       Fair enough...I am not championing his work, however, he certainly has popularized the importance of the number 19.5 with respect to tetrahedral geometry, and I was referencing that.

       Yes a little in regards to the Cydonia complex. I have never read any books by him. A dear friend of mine Vernon Roth has been helping me to understand the math behind it all. I am mathmatically challenged you could say. It's like a foreign language to me. Although geometry speaks to me deeply. As do the platonic solids. Hoagland goes deep into this too. It is all a process of learning and understanding the numbers right now. But I do appreciate any recommendations on further studies and I will look more into Hoagland's work. Thank you.

       Someone asked about the " little model" that I played with when I was a kid and my Dad said... its the most expensive paperweight in the world" Here it is doing its actual job as a prototype, working in lightweight oil. There should be some other pictures of it on his desk too.

       I really don't think that I should talk too much about Dr. Greer because what I would have to say would not be too favorable. Recently he held a conference here at Joshua Tree and his staff made the horrendous mistake of LOCKING the doors while it was going on. A couple of visiting physicists told me when we met that they were disappointed, All I am going to say. I am sorry I am not familiar with Graham Hancocks work at the moment.

       I too have come to the conclusion that there is something...unsavory...about Greer. I wonder if anyone else has come to the same conclusion.

       Hancock, however, is the real deal.

       If you can check out Apocalypse Pretty Soon by Alex Heard you may find interesting the chapter on Dr. Greer (or, maybe you think it's a bit of a hit piece...one can never be totally sure about anything anecdotal, of course).  Also in this book, in a chapter about aliens but not about Greer, is a brief but nonetheless quite interesting "appearance" of  Dr. Andrej Puharich.  Now there's a character about whom not nearly enough is known, but really ought to be, imho.

      <ol>
       <li>
        Did your dad ever mention his work on the Philadelphia Experiment/ Project Rainbow
       </li>
       <li>
        If so, did he elaborate on the how the resonant field was charged to 10% of light?
       </li>
       <li>
        Did your dad ever discuss gravity's relationship to the proton?
       </li>
       <li>
        Will you write a book? I'd be interested to read it.

       I have written a memoir called " The Good-Bye Man" which is available through Smashwords as an Ebook... but I really ask you to wait on purchasing it for awhile. So much new information has come in my direction and I have the help now of the person that Paul Schatzkin called " Morgan". He has things he wants to add so... hang on if you can.... the first attempt is just sort of a marker... though it was a good book... it just didn't say enough....

       So "Morgan" faked his death for Schatzkin so that he wouldn't have to tell him things he's now telling you. NOW his "quit" begins to make sense.

       No... thats not exactly what happened. Morgans " death" came right after Paul admitted to me that he had hired a military remote viewer to " Look in Morgans direction" At this point Paul had not committed a single word to a chapter and he had been collecting information from me and others for years. Morgan had also spent alot of time with him. I think that they shared over 1200 Emails which really made me jealous....
      </p>
      <p>
       After that admission... just HOURS afterward.... Morgan had a symbol of their friendship returned to Paul without explanation. Paul assumed it had been returned because Morgan had been killed... but I knew that the association between them had been cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Morgan had stepped on the other side of the " curtain". When that happened I thought that I had lost him too. In this situation, when that happens you might as well be gone to your loved ones... so I grieved along with Paul, but I didn't necessarily believe that the man was dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul started writing chapters then and in a couple of years  he was finished..and had a 600 page manuscript to show for it......If Morgan had still been there to engage with him Paul admitted that he might not have written anything... he was enjoying the association... I think had sort of a hero worship going on..... and didn't want it to end. Morgan left so that Paul would actially do his job and get started actually writing the book..
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was Morgan who came back to tell Paul to " walk away" then that all makes alot of sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be the only way that Morgan could have been able to convince me to step up and do what I have been doing. The man is a long term planner, I have to give him that.  very long term.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wouldn't have shared with Paul what I hope he will be able to share with me.... but I wouldn't be here now either... ready for this horrendous project if Paul hadn't quit. It probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense to someone not having to live through it so I can understand if you just shake your head. &lt;g&gt;

       He told me about the remote viewer while we were walking on a beach in New Jersy in July of 2005.. That evening,( just hours later) this big burley fellow handed him the pin that he had given to " Morgan"... without any explanation. (Later Paul wrote about this experience in his book).... but it took him a couple of years to start finishing chapters. Why did he write the book after he figured that Morgan had died? Why didn't he quit then? I don't know. Maybe he felt that he owed it to the man.
      </p>
      <p>
       For my part of it... I took it that "Morgan" had " died" too. When a man like that " steps behind a curtain" You don't expect to see him again....so I grieved right along with Paul on that one,  just with a slightly different understanding and perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once it was finished Paul took several more months off and then met Mikado in Pa in December of 2008.... it was only a matter of weeks afterwards that Paul quit ( Jan 9th I believe, 2009.) So I don't know how or when he hit the tipping point. But thats the timeline.

       It sounds to this ardent conspiracy theorist like the whole “remote viewing” episode was a convenient excuse to push Schatzkin off the ledge.  Like a character in a cartoon, he then spent several years spinning his wheels before he looked down…. and crashed – leaving you and your handlers with precisely the sort of muddled, marginally-credible book they wanted all along.  The result enhances Townsend Brown’s mystique without actually revealing anything apart from a trove of fanciful, unverifiable anecdotes.

       You could be absolutely right.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR...... did Paul want out then..... when he told me about the " remote viewer". Did he know that I would " walk off the boardwalk and into the sand" in shock. Did he plan that move so that I would be so upset with him.... that I would cancell the book arrangement with him.... leaving him with a couple of years of material access that he would NEVER have had before. Perhaps the entire ruse of the book was devised by HIS handlers who once he got that far... wanted to pull the plug.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read my memoir you will learn that there was one element involved in this that Paul did not expect. I called her " the lady in the blue jacket"... this is something he didn't bother to write about in his book. Strangely he writes about being handed his dads pin .... but he does not mention that the " burley man who filled the doorway" was the companion of a woman who "happened to be there" A woman I had known as a remote viewer with ties to Mr. Twigsnapper ( an associate of my Dads... in fact the same person who was with him on the " pearshaped German misadventure in 1945)
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier we had met to talk about Dads " work".... He knew that she knes what had been transpiring for a couple of years with me... Paul went into this long rant which upset me very much... I thought suddenly... I am going to stand up.... tell him to go F&amp;*k himself and cancell this project right now. I was sitting on the floor at the time.... Anne was sitting at the desk and Paul sitting with his arms crossed over his head ... on the couch across from us in the hotel room... she was scribbling something on her ever present yellow pad.... he couldn't see and I couldn't either. Just as I started to stand she flashed the message that she had scribbled.... DON'T DO IT.   DONT DO IT  DONT DO IT.  Knowing her... I swallowed my thoughts.... Paul finally ran down and headed for his room down the hall..... when the silence engulfed us after he left Anne just whispered.... that was a set up dear...he just is trying to get out of what he has to do.... HE HAS A BOOK TO WRITE.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day I didn't know what Pauls plans were. He hadn't mentioned them. Anne stopped by early rapping on my door just as Paul and I were getting ready to discuss our plans for the day.  She was carrying a big yellow beach bag...." Here she said... putting it on the bed... You will need this today when you are at the beach..... Paul just stared at her blankly. He hadn't told me that he wanted to drive to the Jersy shore that day to walk on the beach where he grew up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was during that beach walk that he told me about the remote viewer that he had contacted. Looking back was this his renewed attempt to " bail" on the project.... taking all of the information that he had learned for his handlers with him????? He told me something that he KNEW would light a fire of disgust with me. What treachery.... what a betrayal of trust! He KNEW I would think that.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we got back..... he ordered a pizza and said that he would call me when it got in... and went to his room to shower. He tells the story about how he got a knock on the door... and expecting the pizza man he was surprised to see Annes big traveling companion " filling his doorway" The man just handed Paul his Dads boyscout pin.....and said nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thats the way that their association ended. Now... was Paul just trying to get out then? If so... Annes intervention changed things... he went home.... thinking that the man he had betrayed was dead... and he started writing chapters..... then years later when the manuscript was partially finished.... he quit and walked away.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you tell me Mr. Conspiracy expert &lt;g&gt; WHAT Happened?????
      </p>
      <p>
       Read what he said in his book.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Read what I wrote in my memoir  The Good-Bye Man .... its not much of an investment and it also is incomplete but it will help you see what my side of it was... compared to Pauls side.... and all of this was material written about years ago... so its nothing that has been manufactured for this particular moment. Read and then YOU tell me. What do YOU think was happening.  I do need the help seeing this because obviously sometimes I am way too close.

       Everything you say here confirms my suspicions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds to me like Schatzkin made a genuine attempt to do a credible job with your father’s story and – in true spook fashion – got left out in the cold for his efforts.

       Answering this a little bit better.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.... No.... Dad mentioned meeting with William Moore who at the time was writing the book and had asked him to " proof read " a copy. Dad made a couple of changes in his manuscript and handed it back to him saying that it was "substantially" or " essentially correct."
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to smile at that because when my Dad used that phrase it meant that there was a hole in his story somewhere big enough to drive a convoy of trucks through.... that was a phrase that he and his companions used all the time. To be told that your work was " essentially correct" was NO COMPLIMENT'   It meant that there was an elephant sitting beside you with peanut butter on its breath and you had missed it! So I had to smile when Moores book came out and he patted himself on the back so much for " tricking" a " senior scientist" into admitting his relationship with the Philadelphia Experiment project.
      </p>
      <p>
       That made me angry at Moore and when I reached out to him to express my concern over his words his response was a haughty..." Alot of people are mad at me, whats one more?"
      </p>
      <p>
       My current book out is called " The Good-Bye Man" offered as an Ebook. Its price is less than a hamburger and it might help you see some things that could help in your understanding of all of this... its well written I believe , and I stand behind it.... but it needs to be expanded.... which will happen soon. Thanks for asking.

       Great. Thanks for your response.

       I realized that facts were strewn far and wide; they had to be, for the weight of what was being discussed. Project Rainbow had a classification higher than the Manhattan Project, with participation from the likes of Von Neumann, Tesla and Einstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       To a side-note, I've researched as far as to connect Rainbow with it's cousin project being the Nazi's Bell; two similar streams of research underway, and both were silenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aspects of the Carlos Allende 'varo document,' add to the mixed bag of facts, as does the close of Frank Scully's 'Behind the Flying Saucers,' which has been underestimated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your fathers work was impressive, and brief recognition came when a couple of engineers mentioned to a Jane's Defence reporter that the B2s are extending an EM field, to breakup air resistance..
      </p>
      <p>
       For me it's clear your father's work moved from theoretical avionics, to a practice stage; that other types of aircrafts have taken advantage of his design. That the leap in terms of travel, without 'time' between two distant points has been achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm interested if your dad figured out 'gravity' per se; it's been resolved since the late 50s, however I'm sure his work either contributed, and or shaped how we were able to manifest and attenuate a changing field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your dad lived in a very interesting time; I look forward to your book.

       The easiest to demonstrate is the Ionic Breeze, the fan precipitator which was marketed by Sharper Image many years ago. The "New technology" that was touted by them as being developed in their own laboratories was actually developed in the early sixties by my Dad. He held the original patents on that basic new thought. His patents are all listed publically and I could give you that but I think its easy to research...Dad actually was the one who worked with Jim Lee the man who later  took the "fan" to Sharper Image after he had smoothed out all of the technical marketing details (to make it a safe public device. Jim Lee was able to get a design patent on those changes and then secured a licensing agreement with Sharper Image( showing my Dads work and patents as " prior art").... Of course Lee didn't approach Sharper Image until after my Dads death and the date that his patents had expired.... since Dads patents were now in the public domain Lee was able to make a financial arrangement with Sharper Image to market the device..... thats the easiest to spot.
Dad would have been proud of him I think and happy to see it out there. But actually he had no interest in the fan. It was its other applications which were more important to him. In fact Dad referred to the fan as an " ashtray product".
      </p>
      <p>
       Other developments were  just as valid and so much more important.....but ,without a doubt, you will run into alot of secrecy and problems getting information.....I know for a fact that the " high voltage leading edge) techology was used on the B2 because I was at the meeting at RAND when that was introduced to the boys who months later were running airflow  tests on it.... that can be traced too
      </p>
      <p>
       But the easiest is the fan.... does that help?

       This is an example of what my goal has been, to try to help people understand that he work my Dad did was not all a fantasy. That it was solid and real in todays world. Unfortunately because sometimes of military involvement and the sort of misinformation that sometimes follows very secret programs it is very easy for Dads name and legacy to get swept up in that and then so heavily discounted. That hasn't been fair and I am trying to bring my Dads work out into the open so that people can recognize what he did do.....it will not be easy,
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I can talk about the kind of man he was and how very serious he was about what he did and how much he actually loved it... I hope I can give people a better " back history" when they see the name Townsend Brown. Since you started out asking to have something proven to you by me.... did I do an adequate job? really?  It means much to me to know your reaction.  Linda

       Propulsion? Yes! He developed a disc that demonstrated its propulsion abilities both in air and in a vacuum. It was shaped like the most beautiful " flying saucer" that you have ever seen. This was 1955 and it more than managed to be a " proof of concept." Take a look at the picture that accompanies the AMA site... thats Dad unloading his prototype.

       Yes. Check out a link to something called the Mongolfier Projet in France in 1955-56. Notice the photos too. Those are discs. Is that enough evidence?

       Some of this work went into a deep black cover then. This project information was JUST released in the last couple of years. Those photos and reports were from the project that occurred under top secrecy during 1955-56.

       I have never seen more references to it but that particular arrangement of saucers flying " around a maypole" has actually been done in alot of labs and videos are available now. I don't have the links at my fingertips but I know that Mark Bean for example has demonstrated a small version of this experiment at some UFO conferences... and if you look around a little you will see them demonstrated well. Its all out there thanks to modern researchers.  So the answer is Yes.... and Yes.....

       For me... my major problem is on the other side of the scale. I probably believe that there are fewer " Entities" than there may be. I most likely will be quite astounded that I have underestimated the number by as much as I have. Does that give you an idea where my head it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we continue to look for life forms that are ONLY as we are... we might be looking for a very long time... but Entities based on something OTHER than carbon....heck we are already finding things that are life forms that do not fit our old requirements....and thats here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have a hard time putting my head in the preset boxes of things like the old stories of Greys and Reptillians... because I honestly believe those both might have been a reflection of a very black psychological program that is still ongoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But do I believe that there are valid other life forms out there? Absolutely/! Thanks for asking... Linda

       actually the United States has been flying disk craft for more than 50 years. The first manned craft was flown in 1961 and the technology was fully developed by 1971. I'm sorry but my knowledge of this can not be verified. It goes back to a period of my life from May of 1971 to the end of that year. It is during this time when I first learned about the technology. I had to wait 20 years when I received a copy of electrogravitics systems before I could actually start researching it. Again I am sorry but I cannot say more about this.

       Popular science did a cover  several years ago of an usa  intercontinental disc craft from the sixties and the next month a man wrote a letter to the editor so glad to be able to finally discuss his involvement in the project since it had now been publicly disclosed.

       I know of that article. But again that was let loose because it has nothing to do with electrogravitics propulsion. If you remember the Avro car that was done in Canada, that again was shown that things like this don't work. Even NASA gave them one or $2 million. The ideas you have everyone looking at these things while the same time you produce and develop the real thing. as I have said earlier he United States has been flying these craft since 1961. This includes some really incredible triangular craft one in which is about 1.8 miles long. It is what I call the flying aircraft carrier battleship. It has onboard to magnetic rail guns better known as brilliant pebbles.

       It 's irrelelvant anyway to what TTBrown was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       AVRO was a false cover project by my estimate. "nothing to see here - its all a waste of time. look away."
      </p>
      <p>
       SO can or can't these TTbrown vehicles operate outsie the atmosphere. I'm not talking experimental vacuum tests. I 'm talking real world built craft. Have any of them been taken definitively outside the earth's farthest atmosphere.

       As to your question, do these craft work outside the atmosphere? A big affirmative yes! I do realize that this form has over 400 comments on it but elsewhere I have stated that the United States has been flying these craft for more than 50 years. I first learned about the technology in May of 1971. The first manned prototype craft was flown in early part of 1961. On my YouTube channel page you can see the full Bahnson Lab video. also you can see another video titled Nillis test range UFO video.this video was recorded in November of 1994 over the bombing range. This is the same range for the Groom Lake (area 51) is located. It was not until 1991 when I was able to receive a copy of electrogravitics systems that I was then able to actually do research into this technology without violating the nondisclosure statement that I signed in 71.

       I once went ot a Stanton Friedman lecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wanted to focus on his whole Majestic tweleve stuff which frankly doens't interest me but he was in asmall town I was passing through ona boring night.
      </p>
      <p>
       however inhsi lecture he showed a slide of a disc craft flying low over the desert with aplasma glow at it's leading edge. I knew "lifters" for a while by that point  and so I immediately asked him about it after his lecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was very non chalant saying roughtly" Oh yes that is a hypersonic craft with electroaerodynamic drive using plasma that I worked on at Groom lake in the 60's" (or something like that. dates places and my memory about the details are certainly wrong but i rememebr the picture showed it's glowing plasma leading edge in flight.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway
      </p>
      <p>
       He was just dismissive of it (Freidman really wanted people excited about the fact that Eisenhower met with aliens which frankly I could care less about since if true they obviously haven't done a damn thing for us like cruign cancer or taking us to other planets so he might as well have been meeting with chinese.).

       to me it was a huge thing that there was a photo of this high speed plasma disc in flight in our military way back thing and it was cleary flying well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you follow JLNaudin's site you see he has done a lot of replication of the plasma work as well

       . It is a extension/modification of the early simply lifter work done by thousands of experimenters all over the world now (and now winning science fair projects for teens becuase their teachers apparenlty still don't know this exists.)
      </p>
      <p>
       However I jus thave never seen anyone actually say that yes they worked on a design that abosuletly was sent into space (not rarified atmosphe) and it actually flew and manuevered say half way tot hemoon or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the popular science cover vehicle was even shown in high altitude but not clear space.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just would love to hear someone say yes a craft absolutely worked in space. (not that they were tested in vacuum or worked over groom/nellis/desert)

       I do know Stanton personally and I have never heard him mention anything like what you have just mentioned. He was involved mainly with the development of the nuclear rocket motors. There is a video that came out in 1991 from the space shuttle. It is the STS-48 video showing a craft or object come up on the horizon. This is video taken from the shuttle while in orbit. It moves along for sure. At time and then there is a flash and you see the object take a sharp 90° angle turn and move out away from Earth. The flash is caused by an optical effect of a rail gun being fired. If you look closely in the film you will see two streams moving out from under the space shuttle. This is actually a so-called Star Wars weapon known as brilliant pebbles. What it is is that they take thousands of plastic pebbles and they are accelerated to a speed of 1000 mi./s. The magnetic railgun was actually invented by one of the founders of the L5 society back in the 1960s and 70s.many people have thought that what they are seen in this video is a space battle with us against alien spacecraft this is not true. What they were doing was heating up that part of the atmosphere where satellites can't get to nor can balloons reach. if you look closely you will see at least half a dozen of these craft in the video. These are not alien craft but our own. You can look up yet on you to and you should be able to find a video.

       Are you at all interested in really learning about this technology? If yes, there is a book you should read. It is written by Dr. Paul A. LaViolette which is titled Subquantum Kinetics the Alchemy of Creation. the book is not for just everyone to read it is very technical in nature. It continues on from where Albert Einstein left off. It deals with what Townsend Brown discovered plus a whole lot more. on March 18 we will be relaunching the Resolute which is strictly on research. The date is important for it is Townsend Brown's 109th birthday. Here is a link to it:
       <a href="http://www.thomastownsendbrown.com/forum/">
        http://www.thomastownsendbrown.com/forum/
       </a>
       . You can also go to the family website through here and there you will find access to a lot of documents and all of Townsend Brown's patents. This is a very good area to learn about the technology. This will be my final post on this site because I have much to do in preparation for that date the launch of the resolute. Good luck and I hope to see you there.

       I had heard about that but am not expert enough to really comment...fascinating though....Paul Shatzkin called the group that was dealing with Dad the " Caroline Group" because of the grand yacht he was on when he first met them. I call the same group " Nassau" because that is my frame of reference with them... but who knows how they refer to themselves. I am thoroughly convinced that some members of the "Caroline" Group don't even know that they are members!

       I wish I could tell you more JuzPwn.... I only had that single " strange" experience. I am particularly interested in the ships that boom out of the ocean and dive back in just as easily. Most of the sightings ( did you realize) of UFOs come in from the water usually .... when they are first tracked. At least they used to when I had time to keep track of what was going on. I agree, its fascinating!

       I am sorry it has taken me so long to properly answer your question.
As I hope I explained above. Dad believed that there was sort of a " Home Team" intelligence that lives with us and has always been with us. They count on us as their layer of protection against groups that might find their way here from outer space.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that he understood that time travel and other dimensions was possible. In fact he told Morgan that precisely... that it was possible. Morgans reaction OF COURSE was " Where do I sign up?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course some of the things that we think are alien looking are just our own advanced technologies.... we really have quite a choice, don't we?

       You offer me so many choices but I have to tell you that I haven't come to any conclusions in this direction. I am not quick to just automatically that something strange in our skies is from.... whatever planet or solar system is the current fashion. I just don't go there. Its been my experience from seeing what my Dad developed, and knowing the people who surrounded him at the time... I felt sure that SOME of them were definitely ours... kept secret ( still).
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't had any other face to face experience except for the incident that I told you about which seemed like a dream. Nobody ever said where they were " from" in that experience except that reference was made to " their home" which definitely wasn't " here".

       I do not doubt for a second that many of the sightings of the past 60 years are UAVs. Most likely, exploiting extremely sensitive plasma shields, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.

       My question is did your father's work have anything to do with the famous video of a flying saucer captured over catalina by the news helicopter sjnce your father had moved to catalina island around that time?

      <p>
       (and for those who don't know Catalina island is a private island owned by the Wrigley Gum heirs which makes it a great isolated spot to do secret research yet only 20 mjles from the southern california aircraft industry for talent)

       My Dad is buried on Catalina Island. Of all the places that he knew in his life, all around the world.... he loved Catalina the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       He first visited when he was a student in college and he went over on a student trip....
      </p>
      <p>
       He returned in the seventies, established a " remote lab" at the old " Bird Park Aviary" which he leased from the Island company. He lived there for many years... on and off... traveling to other monitoring stations in Mexico ( basically the Yucatan) and Hawaii and other spots... but he always considered Catalina his home.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was there that he spent his last days... carefully picking a burial spot that happened to have a bench near it... thinking of my Mother... so that she could rest when she visited him in the future. I intend to visit again this next March....
      </p>
      <p>
       I joined him on Catalina to work at the office that he maintained in Avalon... keeping track of his many recorders......my daughter came with me to the Island when she was just three days old and we lived there as a family for the next fourteen years. Can you imagine what that was like for me... to have a home after all of those moves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes... he may have had something to do with strange sightings around Catalina Island.....
      </p>
      <p>
       And to those Islanders who may be reading this......I am so sorry that we have lost our wonderful Jeannie Hill. My love and condolences go to all of you....   Linda

       Haa ha!!!! I am glad that you had a good time there. Did you ever rent a horse at the Catalina Stable and go around the " hour trail" My horse Shadetree and I worked there for several years... logged over 6000 miles on that one trail... but I understand that they have expanded the golf course now and moved all horses to middle ranch so there are no more rental horses available. A shame.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had a Post office box as our mailing address... but that was true of EVERYBODY on the Island. We all had to go into the "arcade" to get our mail. I am sure you probably walked through it. Thats where you met all of your neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dads office was just up the street on the left hand side. I think that the Island Conservancy uses that space now.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Dad first moved to the Island he rented a beautiful home on Chimes Tower road... known locally as the Wolf House. Beautiful modern place with wonderful views.
Then he took two apartments at the Country Club apartments... where I eventually joined him. Dad found another apartment there for me.. so that I could be close with my new baby. Neighbors groused that the " Browns " had taken over the entire place but they were good natured about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dad refurbished Bird Park when he took it over. The last residents had been birds! and it was dormant until Dad came along and hired men and trucks to remove six truckloads of old nests and stuff. He painted the main building and fixed up the big aviary beside it. When he left Mrs Wrigley turned it into the towns Preschool. So all of his work went in the right direction and when he was finished there it was well used! and I think still is! The Aviary has a special meaning to some who knew about Dads work then.

       My book is called " The Good-Bye Man" and it is basically the story of what it was like to work with Paul during the writing of his biography of my Dad. I am proud of it and I think its reasonably priced... but it is an E book and it doesn't say enough. When I wrote THE END I had no idea of all of the things that would happen after. So this book I can recommend only as sort of a primer for the work that I have yet to finish. This time around I will have the input of the man that Paul called Morgan and it is fasicinating to hear what was going on that I didn't know about for so many years!!!!

       The book that you will find on Smashwords is just a start....but it helps get you sort of familiar with things so you might appreciate the second one even more....

       Dad said that he was given that information when he was a teenager and it came to him" in a flash" all at once. Then he spent the rest of his life proving the principle.

       Thanks for visiting Avalon. Dad is at the Avalon Cemetary. When you go through the stone gates turn to the left and look for the bench. He is right there. Say hello to him and tell him I am doing my best out here!

       Dennis R. Ran those trams I believe then.... he also had the UPS contract... and as nice a man as he was.... he was the only man I have ever known that inspired Dad to say something nasty about a human. I laugh about it now.... Dad was expecting a VERY important shipment and somehow Dennis misplaced it which caused Dad great anxiety and consternation... and then Dennis tried to cover up his mistake which REALLY ticked Dad off. He was cordial to the man but as Dennis cleared the door I overheard Dad say......." If that mans knuckles were any lower they would be dragging on the ground" That was his idea of a cut and I laughed and laughed.

       All good friends...alot of us who ran businesses on the island were husband and wife teams... I think that George and I were about the only ones who eventually didn't divorce... it was tough running a business on Catalina...He ran a garage there and we took care of many of the local cars, taxicabs, firetrucks, County units... even the two school buses that the island had... it was hard work
      </p>
      <p>
       ... I had heard about the Zipline that went from the Botanical garden downhill but it was not operating the last time I visited. What fun! That canyon was where the old buffalo " Herman" used to wander down from the Interior. He was an old rogue bull and you never knew what he was going to do. I had to lead my trail group around him very carefully because you just haven't lived until you have seen a bunch of Japanese tourists.... all trying to control their horses and their cameras while being chased by Herman. It was great fun!
      </p>
      <p>
       The only compliment I ever got from Kenny King about my riding abilities and my good horse was the day that he tried to herd two bad rogues up the Hermits Gulch trail and they got past him and came charging back toward me. That high anise was all over then and we couldn't see the bulls charging through it.... Shadetree stood his ground like a trooper and then burst after them when I asked him... going shoulder to shoulder at an all out gallop through that stuff. We turned them... and Kenny said later... "not bad.... good horse"....He was a rancher... you don't get compliments often from those guys!
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't know how Shadetree would have reacted to tourists on a zipline!!!!  Linda

       Yeah the best way to get to the island now is ride share with a local pilot from santa monica airport for the price of gas.

       Or sail!

       Strip chart recorders that were capturing a particular output from some of Dads " sensors"
      </p>
      <p>
       You might think this terminally strange... but the " sensors" were generally rocks that Dad had collected from around the world. The most responsive ones were, oddly, rocks that he had collected from an area on Catalina called "Pebbly Beach"
      </p>
      <p>
       The rocks were reading what Dad called the input from " Sidereal Radiation".... the readings varied widely... and some of the different rocks seemed to be on different channels... this was all carefully noted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I was doing was just an extension of work that had been ongoing since the thirties... Dad had the same sort of " sensors" working while he was in the Navy in the thirties.... and later.... records were kept for years. This was just an extension of that work... this time using simple rocks. Many have written about Dads work in this field so I won't say much more.  The most exciting times came when the recorders captured what Dad called a " Glitch".... a burst of " radiation" that would make the instruments go almost to their limit. We had seven recorders going at the same time  seven days a week, 24 hours... and they ran until Dads death.... I turned the last one off actually about a week after his funeral. So it was a study that lasted for decades.

       Fascinating that certain rocks would be sensitive to the earths position and orientation in a certain siderial time/ direction in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume it was a voltage coming off the rock? Would love try that at home if you can give a quick run down or point to someone else who has described it.

       I am sorry but a " quick run down" is not really possible here and now. But study what is already out there and be on the look out for new information to be released soon.... the variations in the incoming "force" was what interested Dad most of all. over the propulsion systems and everything. At one time he actually said that he had connected somehow to the "Nervous system of the Universe."

       It may have been edited out... the entire film is very chopped up and reassembled. I know that scene is in there because I was so shocked when I saw it. The question has to be asked. Why did Dad point that unit out. It was with us constantly in those years. Constantly. Even in canoes! and it was not a normal short wave. I have come to that solid conclusion.

       My guess would be a gravity  wave radio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since your fathercs devices were able to manipulste gravity fields it would have been right along his line of thinking to be working with other uses of manipulating a gravjty field.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could have been manipulating it in rapid succcession to create a modjlated signal in a gravity field that would have carried through anything including the planet without much shielding effect.

       which is a scalar transmitter than could transmit long distances with virtually no fading and no antenna. and your dad has a peice of equipment inhis lab that seems to look a little like these coils of bands of copper used to make the specific antenna for such a trnassmitter. He could have made it smaller.

       Whatever it was it LOOKED like a standard Short wave radio... leather exteriour with a flip up lid that had an old map on the interior. I used to love that map because it had a sea serpent in the ocean on one side. Paul Schatzkin identified the style exactly of the unit... but I am sure it was not standard off the shelf.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first saw it in what I have called a dream for many years. Now I am positive it was not a dream... the " being" that showed it to Dad said " It can transmit over millions of miles.... instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a link to the pictures of it but that radio went EVERYWHERE with Dad... to Paris in 1955 (he had just " gotten it" before the trip) and then later for about twenty years it was always with him... almost within arms reach. At some point I lost track of it and don't know where it is now.

       Well a scalar pulse transmitter can transmitter faster than light according to eric dollard.

      <p>
       And gravity wave transmissions are said to also be faster than light.

       For all i know a scalr transmitter may be a fprm of gravoty wave transmitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some relationship to electromagnetics and gravity that i dont know the details of bit your father probably worked ojt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also apparently can distort time. I recently read somewhere that gravity is merely an illusion brought about by matter being attracted to areas where time is movong more slowly. Have no idea if that is a valid way to look at it.

       We have so much to learn but do you realize how different our information is now than it was just ten years ago....Things that people would have laughed themselves silly over just a few years ago the " scientists and "experts" are saying.... "Wait one moment." And things that have been hidden from us for years and years are now " bubbling to the surface."

       One of the best things about chatting eith you is that i was aware of your fathers work first as speculative fringe reports 10 or 20 years ago of what might have been then more detailed patent searches and the ttbrown site and always wondered if i could ever hope to speak to a family member.  And now here you are! 
Ha ha.

       Its great. And i am so glad to learn about your dads personality. He always looked like a pleasant ma n and to know he had a good time and really enjoyed what he did and wasnt an evil scientist is really great!
      </p>
      <p>
       Did he personally have any interest in flying? Was he ever a pilot or did he like flying in planes when he got the chance? Is that what partially drove him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did he have any interest in space flight and ever mention he hoped to get there with his work or anything like that?

       Dad was exactly as his pictures show. He had an outstanding regard for every living thing and even non-living material ( like the rocks that he had as sensors) he only picked the ones up that he felt " wanted to be a part of it" Thats exactly what he said..... and before he died he asked me to make sure that most of the sensors be returned to the oceans edge at Pebbly Beach... where he had selected them. And about a week after his funeral I took some of them down and did just that.... put them as close to where he had picked them up that I could remember.  Some I still have.... they don't want to leave yet.... I tell myself!!!  &lt;g&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally he had absolutely NO interest in flying but did it because he had to. Before he got on a commercial flight he always bought extra life insurance ( to the max) in case the plane went down he wanted to make sure that his family was well taken care of.... I would NEVER in my wildest dreams have thought that he actually jumped out of a bomber just before the end of the war in Germany... jumped at 600 feet I was told... which was the standard for the resistance at that time. He never mentioned that adventure to me....but I learned it from the man who helped him " fold his schute down after the jump and then was his companion during the mission. If he hadn't been the one who told me I would never thought it possible that Dad would do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He remained what I would call a "white knuckle flier" for the rest of his life but I think that he did like the seaplanes that flew to Catalina and the ones that flew in the Bahamas. For some reason he didn't mind those!

       Very interesting..so if he wasnt interesting personally in the flying applications what do you think drove his research interest on the flying discs? Whst about it made him happy and interested in it do you think?

       By the way.  I have a strong feeling one of those little rocks wants to take a trip on an ariplane out here and see my backyard! It is a very adventerous little stone! Ha ha

       Some of Dads rocks went on adventures in deep diving submarines that came to call at the Avalon Harbor. The Captain and his officers would visit for awhile with Dad and then hand carry the little thing to their sub and bring it back a couple of weeks later. They always were exceptionally courteous to Dad and referred to him as " Commander Brown" which I thought odd at the time because he had left the Navy in 1943.... but I guess it was courtesy on their part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dad loved submarines. One of his associates called him a sly old fox for pointing to things in the skys as the subs went the other direction un noticed. I think that Dad knew exactly what he was doing. People look at flying saucers but he couldn't have given a rip... unless that saucer could hit the ocean and keep on going.

       I don't have any idea georedd how it was consructed. A very Large breadbox yes. Still hoping someone will supply us with a picture but if not I will try to find a link on Paul Schatzkins old Forum and supply the picture for you. That would just take research time at the moment that I don't have.

       Let me look into that georedd... I don't even know who he says he is right now!!!!! &lt;g&gt;.....I know that he said that Agnew Bahnson believed that space " Brothers" told him to " Contact Townsend Brown... that he was the only one with the information that can help you build a ship..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Agnew believed that he was in contact with " Space Brothers". I have some of HIS lab notebooks and he mentions being upset because the " Brothers hadn't visited him recently"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now exactly who those " entities " that he took for spacemen were... I am not so sure about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know that he wore a very unusual ring and one similar to it was given to me by my Dad as a special gift on a special occasion. I wore it for years....and then gave it to a man who had joined Dads " Group"
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow all of that is connected but honestly, right now... I don't know how.

       Well.... Edward Teller was involved in my Dads group but very much on the outside. Sir William however... if he was talking about Sir William Stephenson was a close personal friend. He and Dad used to sail out of Coral Gables together in a small 26 foot sailboat. They were always met at the opening of the Biscayne Bay by a pod of porpoise that I think had adopted my Dad. Maybe they recognized the sailboat or maybe it was some other kind of wierd attraction but they met us everytime we went out. The same group.....

       I really do have to look at Stan Deyos work again. For some reason I veered away because he took a very strong religious turn and I just didn't accept everything he was saying. But I promise I will look again.

       Communication betwen man and dolphin is great. And others.
Writtne inthe 60cs and 70's.
Early stuff is better than when he took to much special k drug!
      </p>
      <p>
       But he does discuss the world of the dolphin as one in  which becuase they all hsve ultrasound machines in their forehead they can see through everything and everyone and literally project their feeling with sound inside the body of another creature in the water with them and se theor anxiety in their fast beating heart or see gas bubbles in theor stomach and know they are sick!
      </p>
      <p>
       Fasdcinating stuff. He had his wife/lab assistant live in a waist size tank with a dolphin for several months. And set up computers to transmit dolphin speech frpm on edolphin to another etc. Amazing stuff. The movie "the day of the dolphin" was a sensationalized spinoff based on his work .

       I don't know if it might have been something along that order but that family of porpoise KNEW Dad. The first time I was with him in that little boat he told me that they would meet us and right where he said they would be they popped to the surface and followed us along... rolling on their backs sometimes to get a better look. It was amazing.

       Yes. I defintiely got the sense that stan deyo was discussing real technology in that video link i sent you because the physics was right.

       That jlnaudin has a video of a lifter craft big enough to lift his pet mouse! It was quite an acheivement to lift that much weight in the amatuer builders group. He became the first "mouseonaut" and it ws quite celibrated! He only went up a few inches becuase the craft was tied down with thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oops.. he wass an "electronaut" and the mouse's name was orville.

       I heard about that! The only problem with the earliest models were that they were just that... just a " proof of concept" type of thing. To really get a ship that was not tied to some sort of power supply you had to get a supply that was light and powerful enough to supply the ship and still be onboard. Not easy in those days. Thats why he developed what he called the " flame jet generator" which was rumored to be able to supply MILLIONs of volts.

       I only saw one of those in operation in 1961 and it scared the living beejeesus out of me.

       Yes I saw the prototype in action. I am not sure that Dad was supposed to show the thing to me and I am a little hesitant talking about it right now. He had a rather contentious relationship with the folks that were testing and running it... they tried to make him work with a Chinese gentleman as the head of the department and Dad would have none of it. We ended up leaving for Nassau, Bahamas and on the way over Charles Miller was " assigned" to us for protection. So I am sure the fact that Dad walked out of the arrangement there at Meadville had SOMEBODY upset enough to perhaps consider that they might cause a problem for Dad. So he immediately removed us from Western Pa... and only gave us a couple of days notice....without telling anyone that we were leaving. I was not even able to say good bye to my friends at school... but then.... I had only known them for a couple of months and I am sure no one even missed me.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were out of the country for a few months. Not very long.... and I guess Dad made peace with the organization that was developing the flame jet generator. It showed up later ( according to some writers) in the B2 Bomber.... and I never heard Dad mention it again.... but by then he was hot into a new project... so I just got the impression that he had " handed off" the flamejet to another organization and was going on with his own project. Things work out I guess but Charles stayed with us for the next couple of years. I don't think that Dad considered the threat from the first organization was completely nullified.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was loud ( roared)  and it looked like a danged rocket ship.... (like a Buck rogers rocket ship, really). I think that there are some patent applications which will show you what it looked like. A very strange unit. I have no idea what its modernized shape is now and from the company I believe was involved with it... I don't think that I want to ever know.... After I saw it in action I was very pleased to pack my bags for Nassau.

       Regarding Sir William Stephenson. At one point Sir William offered to have us all move to Jamaica. I was in college at the time and Mother was sending me messages about how " Mr. X" wanted to set up a situation there on the Island for Dad and that he was considering it... but that Dad preferred the Nassau area for some reason. I worried that my new relationship with the young guy (" Morgan" by others now....) would dwindle and die with all that water between us.... he was a student in Ohio at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should have known by then that the man Mother referred to in her letters to me as Mr. X had already made my young lover an offer that he eventually couldn't refuse. I mean...."Morgan" had this dream of being a covert intelligence agent and all of the sudden he is sailing with " the man called Intrepid"... No wonder he went in that direction and left our relationship behind! ( I really don't blame him)
      </p>
      <p>
       "Morgan" tells me now, (decades later)That he really didn't want us to be separated... that he went into his association with Dads group thinking that he could have both somehow... a strong relationship with me.... and a lifelong commitment with Stephensons " Group". It just turned out differently than he expected. We have both talked about it recently and realized that we did in our lives what we were meant to do... Thats some consolation I guess.   Anyway... back to Australia and Deyo and a Sir William. How many Sir Williams can their be in this odd field of flying saucers and black operations?

       I may have mentioned that I don't watch UTubes so I am at a distinct disadvantage here regarding Stan Deyo. When you say " Has his notebooks" is he referring there to Agnew Bahnsons lab notes or my Dads. That would be an interesting clarification for me... If you have the time someday.... thanks.  Linda

       "I had correspondence and talked with a man named Townsend Brown and got a hold of a copy of his lab film fromthe bahnson corp 1958 and have 1 of only two copies in existence. and I discussed the philadelphia experiment and other things with him in catalina before he died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Townsend was att eh bahnson copr in salem and and that time he was trying to generate antigravity using the beifleild brown effect. he had failed to understand that you had to recirculate ytourwake like a smoke ring so he was trying to do brute force like many of them are still trying to do. If you recirclulate your wake like a smoke ring you use a lot less energy to move forward...."

       this coil they would slip onto that and put high charge through it.
but it was only half the solution. If he had done the other coil and wrapped it and put those in pahse  if he had known to do it he would have had antitgravity in abig way.

       He was so close .. so close.

       I don't have anything complimentary to say about what Stan Deyo has said here. The word .... Bull.... hovers nearby however. He did NOT have my Dads notebooks, if anything he had some copies of number 1, 2 and 4 ( I think) which were publically released surrepticiously after Dads death by a group working with Bill Moore. Mother did not give her permission on the release though someone had initialled JBB on a release... that was not her... She would have signed her entire name.
I don't doubt that he " had to run"...... &lt;g&gt;
I sense that he didn't know my Dad very well at all and alot of this is his own fabrication. The idea of Dad using " brute force" is absolutely, positively a ludicrous statement.

       My sense was that stan deyo had a bit of arrogance about him that led me to beleive he would embelish his own activities. It was just a feeling i had.

      <p>
       He goes into a lot more about who he was working for and how they were the illuminatti internstional and how they later tried to throw him down a well and he escaped and they kept him out of the country for 30 yrs and he just got his passport back.

       In these rarified levels of security I undersand if someone has been targetted there is no such thing as an "attempt on his life". You are either alive, or you are not, No " failed attempts"....Someone " tried?" to throw him down a well? Twigsnapper would laugh at that one!

       Mikado is a man who has been working on building a prototype of my Dads early gravitator for a few years now..... Years ago he had a meeting with Paul Schatzkin.... weeks afterward Paul quit the project after six years of work. Mikado has continued his research since then, I understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read the reasons that Paul Schatzkin gave for quiting but none of them have made too much sense to me. He was supposed to write about the life of a man. He had finished 600 pages of quality work.
      </p>
      <p>
       He and I agreed before we even started the book together that we were not interested in expanding the science or looking for the missing pieces. Why Paul would quit as he did is still a great mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know who Mikado actually is, though I have met him in person. I have no idea if he works for some " shadowy government group" or not.

       Well.... I thought I did.... but some can be VERY good at getting past you.... calling themselves your " little brother" ... telling you all the things that you hope to hear....and thats not really always the case. Others have said that I needed to go through what I have to call the "Mikado Experience" to understand the dangers of it all. I do have friends... some I have never seen. And sitting at my right hand side in this is the man that Paul Shatzkin called " Morgan". I trust his judgement. The sensitive material will go to the right people.

       These threads can be difficult to follow.  I guess you just answered a question I posed a couple of minutes ago (now deleted to avoid duplication).  So, this "Morgan" character is NOT dead.... and you're still surprised that Shatzkin quit?

       No..the kid I went to school with and fell in love with in Florida... and lost for many years... has come back to stand beside me in all of this, He said once that he felt what shared was so special it was meant to be protected.

       ..I never said I was surprised NOW that Paul quit. Now it makes sense but in 2009 it was a shock........this is an interesting world and the terrain changes constantly.

       That's an odd thing to say.  Why does his quitting make "sense" now if it was such a shock at the time?  Sorry to dwell on this but, but that unfinished book is cited here as a primary source and there is considerable doubt about its credibility.

       In the January of 09 I had no concept that Paul was going to just quit and walk away. The last I heard from him he was going into the rewrite phase. I was trying not to pressure him so I actually had let much time elapse and then all of the sudden I started getting phone calls from all over the world. Forum members from  Pauls Forum. It was down, they said.... why was it down?  Then Paul posted a blog that you can read if you just type his name and " EPic Fail" giving his reasons for quitting.... its an interesting read. See what you think... a few weeks later he suddenly and without any notice to me... published as an Ebook  The Parallel Universe of T. Townsend Brown. Not one iota of proof reading involved. The entire manuscript (600 unedited pages) out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I had a right to be upset.
      </p>
      <p>
       He and I have not actually spoken since then..... except for a short phone call where I asked him...." Paul WHY did you do this? You could have done something else! Why? and his only answer was " I don't know"

       And I agree with you completely. But I had worked alongside with him for nearly every one of those days. He could have called me and said" Linda I just can't go on..what can we do to make things better... I didn't expect him or deserve him to him to publish the way he did... which guaranteed that the book would never reach any kind of a market at all. He effectively BURIED the work and the material. Perhaps he mentally could not do it any more and I am willing to consider that. And perhaps the idea of doing the edit work was just beyond him or Perhaps someone he admired and respected just said...."Its important that you do this. For the eventual good of everybody.... even though Linda is going to hate you for years... she will eventually get over it....."
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know why I think that the whole thing was a nod toward a covert element? Paul named his publishing company " The Embassy Laundry" which is what my Dad called a business he started in Washington DC to convince everyone that he had quit science forever... but that was just a ploy. The minute I saw that name I knew that there was something more going on here than meets the eye. and thats he only clue that Paul could give me. I hope that I am right.

       You can know a person for years and years but that doesn't really mean that you know him. By "in contact with him" you mean that he reads what I write and I read what he writes... then we have been in contact. Do I actually know who he is? or what his true motives are? Absolutely not.

       If you go to the Forum that Paul set up you will find the name Mikado in the waning pages of that Forum. In fact. I think he might have been the one who made a joke about " turning the lights out".
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Shatzkin published his 600 page unedited manuscript and then locked down the Forum. As far as I know he hasn't " revisited" the subject of T. Townsend Brown in any substantial way since he walked off.
      </p>
      <p>
       To his credit he did leave the ttbrown.com Forum open as a "read-only"
      </p>
      <p>
       There was alot of the " scientific foundation of the B/B effect" that Paul left out but he captured some wonderful information about the historical background of my Dads life... which , by the way....was what he was SUPPOSED to do.  Yes... there were many holes in Dads history that Paul could not explain. But he knew that going into the writing project. He was not to pursue the hidden science, just tell my Dads personal story.  It was almost as if , through some outside pressure, he  was strongly encouraged to look for scientific proof that someone ELSE was requiring from him. As if that was his primary reason in writing this book and making such close personal contact with me. Thats my own personal opinion after dealing with the man for so long. He changed. And his goal changed when he did.

       I was invited to post on Unhypnotize .com because another Forum had started a campaign of true sillyness... diverting all of the valid conversations into " Prove that you are Townsend Browns daughter"... nothing else mattered... when I offered to meet the head of that particular forum in person... even buy him lunch.... he ignored that offer and continued the " sillyness"  Unhypnotize.com offered me a place where I could speak about my Dad and not be harried by this ongoing bullying. Its easy to find and the threads that I have there are quite substantial, I appreciate the help that Unhynotize offered me.

       Yes it was. And that particular thread absolutely dwarfs the others on that Forum where a thread normally gets maybe several hundred viewers... that particular thread now has a count of over 26,000. That tells me that there are quite a few out there who value what I might have to say, as opposed to the tiny handful who want to convince the public to go in another direction and to discount my Dad.

       What does the scientific community know about humanity moving from "one age" into the "next"? I am not being coy. I am asking you about the evolution of humanity from this relatively stagnated and destructive form into a more evolved form, beyond what we think humanity is currently incapable of.

       Well perhaps the best thing is for all of us to learn who we all are and what each of our potentials are... and then we need to ask each other... where are we going with what we have learned. I am not sure I agree with you at all about things being " relatively stagnant" Perhaps we are going along as quickly as is safe for us as a whole. I have great faith that we can evolve into the " better human" but I don't believe its going to happen if we can't help each other and understand each other better first. What do you think about this. I wish we had more time and space to talk.

       I think Brown's research came to a dead end.  If he did discover an electrokinetic effect separate  from magnetohydrodynamics it was too small to be useful as a propulsion device, otherwise we'd already see this simple technology deployed to move satellites, and it couldn't be hidden because satellite movements would be detected from ground observers.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Brown we can see that research veered towards superconductors that emit field effects like Ning Li's device.   Schatzkin probably abandoned his biography when he realized this.  There are no man-made flying saucers.  Humans haven't figured out how to do this yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown's research probably contributed to aircraft stealth technology because highly ionized air or plasma like lightning is invisible to radar.

       There is also a home movie available about the work that was done at the Bahnson Lab in Winston-Salem in 1958. ( Google Townsend Brown Bahnson and it probably will show up. I don't have a link available at the moment. Understand that most of these project were VERY secret at the time and thats why its so difficult to get things to show. That remains a problem as I am sure that you understand.

       For those who don't know the history of this " home movie"... It would not exist at all if it hadn't been for Agnew Bahnsons daughter. She decided that she wanted to film what her Dad was doing in his lab . So she did just that... sometimes filming her brothers also in their boy scout uniforms being silly... but she cast around and filmed what else was happening and SOMEHOW that film was allowed to escape the security black out of that operation. It was eventually purchased by Stan Deyo in Australia ( He wrote a book called the Cosmic Conspiracy) and he edited much of it... I have an original copy of it however and I am sure that there are others out there. I especially love watching my Dad in the environment that he loved so much ... in his white lab coat... You might notice one thing that others will not. He intentionally points her attention to a short wave radio that happens to be at the lab with him at the time.... she pans over it for a few seconds... take a look at it carefully. He had a reason to capture that for history. We can talk about that strange radio another time but it is capture on SOME of the copies of the Bahnson Lab that are out there. I don't watch Utubes so I don't know which edition this happens to be but thank you gravity for supplying this link.

       Fascinating and fun to see your dad smiling and cbuckling sometimes.

       GlAd to know he had fun while working.

       Also it seems occassionally the dates on the calender go backward. I am not sure if they are supposed to be marking the testing of the craft that is shown next.
And twjce a bottle of champagne is opened celebrating some occasion. Do you know what?

       I have studied that calendar extensively and yes there were messages going on there. We can talk about that more later.

      <p>
       Dad is easy to recognize and of course he was having a marvelous time! I was actually named Linda Ann Brown because the year I was born he was setting up a Lab.... which was his favorite place.... so he made me a LAB too!
      </p>
      <p>
       He loved every minute of what he was doing. And he used to tell me, if you are not finding JOY in what you are doing.... you need to go until you find it.... and then " drop anchor" there. This setting was his anchorage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen that in a long time but I imagine Bahnson is pictured... and his brother in law... J. Frank King....someone can identify them though. I think its Michael Bahnson in the boyscout uniform.... I was just twelve when this was made but I  was never allowed to visit this particular lab.

       Don't know what the success that warranted the champagne was but it had to have been important for Dad drink any alcohol at all even in celebration. Alcohol gave him an instant headache and made him sick so he generally avoided it. It was a big deal if he was drinking champagne!

       L.A.B. ! Amazing.

       There are about 5 to 10 different men making appearances.

       One woman who seems to be a coworker. And a family with two daughters.. maybe the Bahnson family if she took the film.

       I am guessing it was shot on film which would have higher resolution than the original transfer to old video tape which then probably got uploaded to youtube .

       I think it was old Super 8 film for the camera but I am not a camera buff. It would have been what was available in 1958. Yes.... some folks have thought that one of those girls was me but that was not the case. I was not there.... I am sure that the visitors were the Bahnsons... as I said ... its been a very long time since I saw the video disc that I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a very secretive project at the time. Its amazing to me that she was allowed to do this and that it survived. Perhaps because it was her own special project no one thought that it would eventually be a " leak" that would be so important to us now.
      </p>
      <p>
       While they were there at Bahnsons Dad spoke alot about the " Adamski style" flying saucer and I understand that Adamski himself visited this lab after Dad left. Dad was only there for about a year and then in October he moved to the Washington DC area and everything that he was doing went exceptionally black. He even stopped writing in a set of lab notebooks that he had been using.... making note much later when he continued them that there had been a nine year gap..... from October 1958 to September of 1967. That note was handwritten in his notebook and Paul Schatzkin had a copy of that note in his book.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened during those nine years? Apparently not too many people knew what was happening but I had the advantage... because I was living it with him... and taking careful notes. Thats why I believe that my memoir will be important in the future because I was probably witness to things that I didn't even understand at the time.... but still I took notes. When Dad encouraged me to start keeping a journal in 1963 he told me to be very explicit about what I wrote... "You will be", he said " The moment between the chalk and the eraser"
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time I really didn't understand what he meant but now so many years later and countless journals... I am beginning to understand.

       I have realized in the past couple of years that I was like his little personal tape recorder ( My huband gripes that I have a memory like a steel trap!) and Dad took me everywhere with him. I attended meetings where you wouldn't expect a kid to be... but was always accepted... there were times when he told me to just " blend in" and I knew that all I had to do was type and look like I was reading the copy but in fact I was writing everything down that was being said in the room and then I would hand him all of that later to refresh his memory of what others had said. If it was really a large group... Mother would be there too and Rose Hacket... who was the official secretary when Dad started NICAP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I met Mrs. Clara John in 1955...She was the person who made sure that the copy of the Jessup book (with the odd annotations from Carlos Allende) was sent to Texas to be copied by Varo and then handed out to the various military officers and civilians who used to be there at her meetings.If that sounds familiar that was the seed material for the Philadelphia Experiment... Allendes claim that he had seen the ship disappear. What ever was going on regarding UFOs in the fifties... she was in the middle of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I guess its hard to forget stuff like that when you have an interest in it.

       Yes that was the way it was put together. I am planning on correcting this in the near future. With Linda's help I will be adding information about when her father was there and who some of the other people are. If you have software that you can use to download it go right ahead. That is the reason why I have uploaded the videos to you to, they are for everyone to enjoy.

       Thank you gravity.

       I have a sort of strange personal relationship with UTubes. I don't watch them. My computer is old and not really UTube friendly but it is more than that. I have found in the last several years that I do much better mentally if I limit the flood of input.... I very rarely watch TV.. listening to music during the day... I am a bit of a hermit... I have to admit and basically like it...Its difficult for me to accept new friends because in the back of my mind I have the thought... "Who are you REALLY and why are you interested in getting to know me?" I know that sounds really paranoid but many will understand that attitude. Some of them just call it "responding to advanced and hyper vigilance!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been " wronged" by some that I considered friends in the past and it has been especially hurtful after I realized that those who presented themselves as friends were actually only interested in gleaning information about my Dads work, using me as a dull tool while they were at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the mask fell off the work on discrediting me and eventually my Fathers work began. Those who have gone through this process with me know what I am talking about here, no need to name it.
      </p>

       As far as I am concerned Linda you never have to explain anything to me. I will always be your friend and will back you up whenever you need me.I think that for some reason you and I am meant to be in contact with each other. I have looked over the timeline that you made up for your dad and yourself and I am surprised at how many times we have crossed paths without even knowing of each other. Always your friend!

       You have an advantage maybe gravity because you and I have actually met. There are a handful here who have met me so I don't have to go through the exhausting and irritating process of having to try to Prove who I am all of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I realize that I have had to do this... I have had to become better publically known other wise the other forces who have wanted to discredit me ( and by my association my Dads work)... so... this is part of it I guess. What you see here when I have answered questions is purely Linda Brown.  ( for better or worse!!!) I am trusting that those of you who have read my words about my experiences will realize that this is the truth, no matter what others might try to call it. I stand behind my words.... I am who I said I was....and as the daughter of Townsend Brown I realize that there is alot of work still to be done.

       Details of the Project Montgolfier experiments remained a closely guarded secret for many years until Jacques Cornillon courageously decided to make them public prior to his death in July 2008.   Brown’s proposal, the project’s top secret final report, and an assortment of revealing diagrams and photos are posted on the Cornillon website at:

       Good morning. Some of you have asked repeatedly for pictures of me... or of my family and the difficulty of sending you some has been solved I think for me, I just googled townsend brown daughter and these wonderful shots showed up... some of them having nothing to do with my family but there are also some great shots
      </p>
      <p>
       See the one of my Dad standing in front of the " big fan" That was the fan that never came home from Rand Corp in Santa Monica and has been missing since 1967. Anyway... thats the unit that "Morgan" stood in front of.... and had his life changing " download" of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the kid on the black horse? Thats me at age 12... not looking too professional there but the horse and I were just galloping past and Mom took the picture from the second floor of our log cabin in North Carolina...  Lets see..... see the pretty lady with the short curls.... thats my Moms high school graduation picture!
      </p>
      <p>
       And the bald headed man... is our dear Raymond Lavas.. a kind gentleman otherwise known as Trickfox and whos spirit is encouraging all of us now! He was involved in alot of black operations here in this country but spent his last days in Canada. The REAL "Man in Black!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The picture of my Dad at a desk was taken at his home lab in Zanesville. The lifering VIKING behind him was from a " Captains Gig: that he refurbished as his personal yacht on Buckeye Lake where he spent most of his summers...

       This is something that I wrote years ago when the site of ttownsendbrown.com was established. It was my welcoming letter of the time. I want to make sure everyone here knows that even though that letter still remains I have no further connection with that particular website... or rather I could more properly say... I do not have a positive connection with that site which is also known on the net as the HUT.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have tried repeatedly to have my name removed from the membership but have been denied that by the owners of the HUT. Just making it clear here that the words that I spoke in that welcome letter were the truth except for the connection that it implies that I endorse the rest of the website. I don't know why they insist on keeping my name connected to their site but I want it publically known that I am NOT.

       I don't know what front page you are speaking of so I am not the one to ask. So why did you ask it? and why is it so upsetting to you? I am guessing you are upset because of the language that you have used. Am I wrong?

       Can you comment on the insignificance of extraterrestrial life, aside from the fascination that most have with unidentified flying objects? I was also wondering if you could comment on why you think, as well as your fathers thoughts, on why finding life outside of our planet is necessary and/or significant? Most reasons why, I find atleast, have to do with 'wow, this is significant' but nothing aside from the basic 'well, atleast we know now.'
Thanks, someone on the Internet.

       It would take me all day to visit with you on this subject. I do think that this is exceptionally important but that Dad would have advised that we had much to learn about ourselves before we attempted to communicate with other intelligences. He believed that they were communicating with us.... but we had a way to go before it could be mutually beneficial. If anything... the idea that there are OTHERs out there should be both comforting, and a caution.

       Thank you but that fellow was a lightweight. You should see some of the things that people ( who don't have any idea about the subject) have chosen to say to me over the years. Thats why I wondered if there was some kind of a college for "morons" churning out students. But generally most have been like you folks... courteous and curious. A wonderful combination!

       So I'd like to chime in here, has anyone looked into Van der Graaf. I've been studying the concepts of Tesla and it get me thinking. Why couldnt a saucer exterior be made like the inside of Wardencliffe tower. With a good atomic generator you could generate trillions of volts in the aircraft as static electricity over time and then when ready for takeoff use a system of harmonic oscillators to produce positive and negative electrons out of neutral ions. You could actually have a continuously renewing fuel source in this manner limited only by your ability to shed heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       My other theory deals with using the magnetosphere as an ocean the craft rides on top of. With such a large amount of available ions or plasma you could use the earth and its fields as a capacitor and use satellites to find the most advantageous routes through the field.

       Well either way I just appreciate the response. I must admit I'm a bit jealous Linda. It would have been inspiring to have a father like yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was actually somewhat familiar with your fathers work from my research into Ufos. I actually lived out in Las Vegas for a few years and happened to meet the father of one of my friends. He worked at nellis air force base, he was an atomic scientist from India. This man had a conviction that ets were real and I don't doubt him. I suspect he himself may have worked on newer versions of the same ship your father did. He would never talk about anything he worked on so I don't know for sure but, his son seemed to think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a tiny question at least if you don't mind, do you think these creatures are actually from another star? From what I know you couldn't hide the heat signature of a warp drive from our space observation equipment. Even if you could it would produce spacial distortion like an event horizon and normal satellites would see. So unless thousands of scientists are all in a conspiracy together it would seem they would have to be from here.
      </p>
      <p>
       A legend out of India tells of a race known as the Aryans who possessed flying crafts and more advanced technology than anyone else in the era. Hitlers expedition to the Himalayas searched for these very same people and the earliest references I can find to gravitic propulsion come from this time period. It makes me wonder if They were involved in the outcome of ww2.

       Speaking only from the experience of talking to an older man that I refer to as "Mr. Twigsnapper" I believe entirely that there are MANY different entities that have interacted with us. I may myself have run across at least one " style" but I am not sure what I saw and my mind recorded was what was actually there. My Dad told William Moore that these "Entities " had the ability to control our perception of our own reality. Thats a profound statement that can keep you wondering for years and years and years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that the human team that Mr. Twigsnapper was working for indeed was instrumental in the end of WWII... ( along with millions of others fighting that same war) Intelligence gathering of course was important and Sir Stephenson was well known for his massive disinformation projects that misled the Germans many times into believeing that something was happening... which wasn't and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not shock me that he and Dads group would be entirely capable of orchestrating a plan to keep certain technologies safe from human interactions. Far better to delay its revelations to humans than to have them stumble into a force that they certainly had no understanding of at all. And compared to the damage this new force could do... atomic bombs would be the same as firecrackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alot of people have railed at me.... why didn't your Dad hand all of this over to the public... make it an open source kind of thing so that we could all step boldly into this new age.... but those same people can not even get along and treat each other fairly on a simple forum. They should be given a technology that has the possibility of making matter.... cease to be?..... so my answer to them is.... be as mad as you want. That information has been kept a secret and you are all still here.
      </p>

       There was alot going on near Vegas and even more going on out of Reno that has not been spoken of very much. Maybe someday we can investigate that together.  Linda

       I have wanted to investigate for years but haven't due, to well cowardice. People who have investigated this angle "disappear"or worse. It would be less scary not being alone doing this. I would like to though I haven't an idea where to begin. I'd imagine the reich hid or destroyed anything not recovered by russia and america.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the public documents on the expedition to the himalayas indicate they didnt find anything. I don't know if you've heard of die glocke or the bell but it was a secret weapon of the germans that was soo classified no one is sure what it was and no one ever found it maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read your father was dropped into Germany in ww2 and I suspect that the scientist he was sent to retrieve was involved in this project along with the Horton brothers. There is a mine in Austria that no one has found so far that the reich hid a large sum of gold and other valuables. It is historically documented that the mine existed and if the actual unit wasn't recovered its the only place I know of that could contain it.

       The way you answered that almost sounds like some sort of "expanded consciousness", thing. Do you realy believe there are people working for the good of mankind, or is it just a pipe dream.

       "edit" just read your other posts, do you believe there are others besides humans,  working for the good of mankind. Do the others pick on some people to deliver messages.

       And realgravitywave here might be able to tell you a little bit more about what happens when  the " control" factor is not right on the dime. The unit " wobbles". Where did we hear that word before? In 1957 when Dad handed me all of those saucer reports from NICAP. "Look for the ones that wobble" he said. "Those are ours."

       Well a scalar pulse transmitter can transmitter faster than light according to eric dollard.
      </p>
      <p>
       And gravity wave transmissions are said to also be faster than light.
      </p>
      <p>
       So either might fit..
      </p>
      <p>
       For all i know a scalr transmitter may be a fprm of gravoty wave transmitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some relationship to electromagnetics and gravity that i dont know the details of bit your father probably worked ojt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also apparently can distort time. I recently read somewhere that gravity is merely an illusion brought about by matter being attracted to areas where time is movong more slowly. Have no idea if that is a valid way to look at it.

       Was it aluminum metal under the leather case?
      </p>
      <p>
       My dad's old ww2 navy shortwave is aluminum metal. The size and shape of a breadbox or so.

       Let me look into that georedd... I don't even know who he says he is right now!!!!! &lt;g&gt;.....I know that he said that Agnew Bahnson believed that space " Brothers" told him to " Contact Townsend Brown... that he was the only one with the information that can help you build a ship..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Agnew believed that he was in contact with " Space Brothers". I have some of HIS lab notebooks and he mentions being upset because the " Brothers hadn't visited him recently"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now exactly who those " entities " that he took for spacemen were... I am not so sure about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know that he wore a very unusual ring and one similar to it was given to me by my Dad as a special gift on a special occasion. I wore it for years....and then gave it to a man who had joined Dads " Group"
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow all of that is connected but honestly, right now... I don't know how.

       The only ufo I ever saw I saw over whiteman airforce base in approx 2003, it moved exactly as you described.  A bright light just jumping, then holding, then jumping, all jerky motion.

       I hadn't realized how many intelligence agencies there were in the United States, besides the CIA....( something close to 17 or 18, right?) I believe that the NSA is pretty important but what I would like to know is more about the NRO. ( National Reconnaisance Office.... which is responsible for monitoring the intelligence satellites looking out as well as back at us. Surely these guys could know much more about UFOs than we ever would? Their motto is " We Own the Night".

       I am not sure that I agree that everything about our government is a farce, but it sure can be disappointing.

       Absolutely what I think. We all have gifts like this, sometimes stronger and different in some of us than others..... each one of us have abilities that we haven't explored yet. But we are stronger all the way around if we work together to appreciate the talents that each of us is discovering. Its a simple thought perhaps.... but since you asked!  &lt;g&gt;

       Sorry I seem not to have answered this, thought I had but it was pretty late! I think that we all have very special abilities and each one of us has talents that are sometimes not as well developed or appreciated as we could have , if we became aware of them. Those who SEEM less gifted are just those who haven't become better aware of them. And some just naturally seem to have an unobstructed channel to whatever this flow of conciousness happens to be. My Dad was fortunate enough I think to have no barriers in his knowledge... except for the fact that others around him just would never have understood what he was trying to tell them. So he didn't bother to say much or write much about his experiences. His old saying to me when I questioned him about not being able to figure something out was " Wait For It...." and if I complained about others not " getting" what I might have tried to tell them... it was again " Wait For It." (Eventually things will bubble to the surface and those will understand. What is exciting is that I can see that happening more and more every day.

       I may have mentioned that I don't watch UTubes so I am at a distinct disadvantage here regarding Stan Deyo. When you say " Has his notebooks" is he referring there to Agnew Bahnsons lab notes or my Dads. That would be an interesting clarification for me... If you have the time someday.... thanks.  Linda
