       Maybe you've seen/heard all of these bits before. I'm familiar with most of them, but there are several quotes and some footage that were new to me, and, as always with Hicks, they're just as relevant today (if not more so) as they were 20 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, I hope you can at least find some comic relief in the midst of all this insanity. Please feel free to share whatever you like in his memory; take a break from the madness, have a laugh, try to enjoy this day, and remember: "It's just a ride."

       George Carlin was a great social commentator, cared a lot about society and claimed to not care where humanity was heading to; he was a tough bloke.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always find Bill Hicks to be a very sensitive chap and dealt usually with the most important topics and you'd not expect such stuff from a comedian at all. It's been 20 years and his words gain more relevance, not just mere relevance but mammoth weight, with each day. Sad that he is not alive but glad that he existed at one point.

       <em>
        The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, "Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, "Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride." And we … kill those people. "Shut him up! I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real." It's just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn't matter, because it's just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride.

        Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.

       We have lost so many great comedians. Hicks, Hedberg, Geraldo, and so many more. Comedians give us a unique prospective on the world and are very much underappreciated. Remember to support your local comedy club, it will make you live longer.

       One thing that was really fucked up about listening to Bill Hicks in the mid 2000s, is that a lot of his topics were about the war in Iraq and president Bush. He was talking about the first ones, but for most of it, you wouldn't be able to tell if you didn't know.

       Not sure now, but it certainly felt timeless in a lot of ways. Names and places change, but the human experience doesn't.

       That was when I was introduced to his comedy.

       I imagine if he were alive then, he would have said something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hold on a second. You're telling me...we have another George Bush? Bush the Second? Was I in a coma and y'all decided to usher in an era of monarchs? Wait...what?
