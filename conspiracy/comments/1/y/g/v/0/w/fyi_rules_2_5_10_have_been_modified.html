    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s double edged.</p>

<p>Moderators feel to instead report and not comment violations because they feel it takes away from discussion.</p>

<p>We see it as trying to keep the troll/shill problem hidden and not really fixing it.</p>

<p>Bottom line is it&#39;s plain silly how much censorship there is. And in my opinion this: Rules are necessary. Can&#39;t have a subreddit without rules. But when a rule is broken, it should be visible to all. No removal of broken rules. The rulebreaker shall be warned and everybody can see who was warned for what. If the user continues, ban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like a scary precedent, to make it illegal to harshly criticize the authorities.  I agree there has to be limits, but you also have to agree that you know, and hopefully all the mods know, that there is going to be a concerted effort by the gov&#39;t infiltrators to try and get control over this subreddit after seeing the fact that we have over 215,000 subscribers.  </p>

<p>So hopefully you are all dealing with these things with that in the forefront of your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but we do not really spread that info very far; yes around a quarter of a million people may see it. But at the same time those are the quarter of a million people looking for those types of answers.</p>

<p>Most attempts at getting info from hear to the larger hive mind that is reddit do not go well or disappear shortly after hitting the front page.</p>

<p>They do not even need to infiltrate the sub at a mod level all they have to do is say the right things in a comment section or a post and watch the shit show of people arguing making us all look like a bunch of crazy people.</p>

<p>The shills and trolls want to get you angry, they want badly worded responses and to make you look like a loon so that way when we do get something out in to the wild, they can stand up and say &quot;O but look at the whack jobs post history&quot; </p>

<p>But you do realize that the government has a vested interest in social networks (specifically, to control the message), especially those which receive millions of hits per month, have hundreds of thousands of active members, and propagate ideas and beliefs which tend to run counter to some of their efforts...yes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think that- about &quot;Hey allow the criticism. We want freedom to comment, they should have it too.&quot;  until I started my Sandy Hook subreddit last night. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never dealt with so much trash, mean talk, threatening and harassing messaging - PMs directly to me- horrible things. &quot;Vote brigading&quot; is nothing compared to what happens behind the scenes for moderators of a subreddit where controversial information is being discussed/disseminated.</p>

<p>When I started my sub I was not going to ban anyone, just let everyone say anything they wanted bc - why not. Well soon enough I had threats in my inbox and admins of all of reddit removing, then replacing, my posts, all my posts instantly at -1, every comment I made met with cruelty or derisive comments. Just a mess. Sadly, if everyone was reasonable, we wouldn&#39;t need this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeahhhhh I should have qualified that. Because I agree with what you just said, what I meant was that I&#39;d want to live on an island with other people who did not need to be governed, the type of people who did not need rules that said &quot;No trolling!&quot; </p>

<p>Another mod posted this answer,  my answer is similar but different enough that I&#39;ll answer it separately here.</p>

<p>In the context of reddit, trolling is explicitly or implicitly seeking people out whom with you disagree, and attempting to make their experience torturous.  The intent is important, and the history is important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will be interesting to see how it goes.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this,</p>

<p>What good have the tattle tale comments done for this sub?  The users making the accusations can&#39;t actually ban anyone or remove the comments,  the flame wars that spawn from such accusations often derail and dominate the entire discussion.</p>

<p>Are we here to give attention to trolls? or are we here to discuss &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>I personally think that the answers are obvious and acknowledging the trolls is exactly the response that they want.  Its exactly how they divert the conversation and exactly what they intended to do.</p>

<p>Why then feed them?  </p>

<p>To self validate that you can see the obvious? </p>

<p>To prove to everyone here that you&#39;re smart enough to see a troll?</p>

<p>And beyond that, a solid 50% of the time, the person being accused of trolling isn&#39;t really trolling so much as &quot;not agreeing&quot;.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of regulars here who I&#39;ve had decent discussions with get flamed for not believing 1 specific conspiracy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to force my views on anyone.  Maybe encourage them to see my side, but i&#39;m not going to get violent and punch a coworker for not agreeing with me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you not even recognize that none of what you are saying does anything to fix the problem of trolls/shills.</p>

<p>Just ignore them? Are you ignorant of the fact that does not work?</p>

<p>You can go on and on about an alleged prevalence of false shill/troll accusations but that does not prove your point either, especially when you don&#39;t back it.</p>

<p>It goes furthermore when you also consider that we have a lot of proven evidence to the contrary, evidence which proves how people are trolls/shill and get caught, and then delete their accounts and comments.</p>

<p>There have been so many shenanigans with trolling/shilling here that it&#39;s not even funny.</p>

<p>It seems like nothing serious is being done to actually combat the problem.</p>

<p>A 3 day waiting period to post? Are you joking me?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> version of troll protection?</p>

<p>That&#39;s absurd, that&#39;s so illogical it blows my mind.</p>

<p>A paid shill can swap through 3 groups of 3 accounts and you can set up different operations that are even more complex.</p>

<p>Trolls will just create as many accounts as they like until they become bored.</p>

<p>We are dealing with a lot of trolls, some more dedicated than others ( though they&#39;re all pretty bad and mostly obvious which is why they create so many damn accounts ) but many of them are in control of the shills, such as the ones who run <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> .</p>

<p>Let me give you an example of how I don&#39;t accuse people of things unless it&#39;s justified.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in aliens. I don&#39;t accuse people who don&#39;t agree with me of being shills though when they present a genuine intelligent human answer.</p>

<p>That is where shills/trolls fails, they are not being themselves thus they are not being genuine. They are being themselves in that they&#39;re being really awful which just transfers right into their trolling/shilling abilities.</p>

<p>You see the people that I would accuse of being trolls/shills do not post like I do.</p>

<p>They do not use proper grammar, spelling, logic, more than 2 or 3 paragraphs if they even use paragraphs or just blurt out sentences, and they are generally always rude in some manner or fashion.</p>

<p>So, what do you feel about what I have said here?</p>

I have gotten into arguments with these people about how &quot;shills&quot; don&#39;t exist and they are just part of the tinfoil hat crazy theory.  They are akin to Bigfoot and the Chupacabra.  But then they make a rule saying we can&#39;t call anyone Bigfoot anymore, but at the same time they don&#39;t exist either?

This is also known as the primary &#39;attack the messenger&#39; ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as &#39;kooks&#39;, &#39;right-wing&#39;, &#39;liberal&#39;, &#39;left-wing&#39;, &#39;terrorists&#39;, &#39;conspiracy buffs&#39;, &#39;radicals&#39;, &#39;militia&#39;, &#39;racists&#39;, &#39;religious fanatics&#39;, &#39;sexual deviates&#39;, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.</p>

It makes me think that have a good foundation of general grammar, logic, and rhetoric (The Trivium) truly was systematically removed from common education and only the elites and Ivy Leagues grace their students with the liberty of being able to think on their own.

<p>Address their arguments rather than use personal attacks. Or, if you really believe they are trolling, just report their comment and move on.</p>

<p>We already have a three day waiting period for new accounts to be able to post/comment unless a mod specifically approves it. That already takes care of the accounts specifically created to troll in a particular thread. Other than that, we get an average of 300 new subscribers every day. Making them all wait a month to post is tantamount to making this a private sub.</p>

<p>Would the moderators be open to the idea however of viewing &quot;I think this person is a troll/shill&quot; submission when they meet a certain requirement such as a defined number of examples which are logically supported expositions of their shilling?</p>

<p>This could easily be done by a group of mods who could be held to scrutiny by having to post the results of the case when it indeed turns out that the user is a shill/troll.</p>

<p>This process leading to a ban is not unfair nor is it wrong-doing towards those users who are provable shills/trolls as they are inherently acting against the well being of this subreddit.</p>

<p>Like you&#39;re a MOD and you&#39;re telling me to contact all the mods when you yourself could have instead of posting your comment and making me reply which is in turn making you read this ( I hope ), you could have just send a PM to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of the permalink saying &quot;weigh in on this comment please&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it when you dismissively say &quot;there isn&#39;t a complex troll/shill issue&quot; on reddit, especially here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where the subversion and infiltration and attempts to discredit ( <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> ) are so blatantly obvious and proven and supported by a wide array of multiple sources exposing several degrees and types of trolls/shills ( corporate shills for the oil industry and global warming racket industry, military propaganda shills backed by evidence of the most visits coming from that AF base, Corporate advertising shills ( my &quot;sister&quot; baked me this PRINGLES cake, pringles, pringles, this clearly isn&#39;t corporate shilling to get you to buy pringles, pringles ).</p>

<p>It&#39;s just absurd to dismiss the FACT that the troll/shill issue is a complex issue, and furthermore that the current level of effort to combat the problem is not high enough.</p>

<p>A 3 day wait to post does not stop trolls/shills. That is an unfunny joke.</p>

<p>I assure you I will send a PM to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I will make a self post, not necessarily in that order but it will be done.</p>

<p>I did not say that yet you deceptively put it in quotes. Nowhere did I say that the &quot;troll/shill issue&quot; wasn&#39;t complex. What I was saying was that the revised rules addressing the issue are a relatively simple and that you&#39;re trying to make it sound like every questionable comment should be addressed in public and with all mods present and agreeing. That just isn&#39;t going to happen and it&#39;s ludicrous to expect it.</p>

<p>And this is at least the second time I&#39;ve responded with my opinion on your &quot;one month&quot; waiting period. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve dodged nothing and I&#39;m not the only mod here. I&#39;m not making rules changes unilaterally.</p>

<p>This is what I take issue with, because the troll/shill issue is not relatively simple.</p>

<p>You guys are talking about ways to track vote brigading ( <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xe3aw/i_would_like_to_introduce_myself/cfav6xw">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xe3aw/i_would_like_to_introduce_myself/cfav6xw</a> ) that is not a simple issue, nor is the larger issue of trolls/shills.</p>

<p>I retract that you are dodging certain things I&#39;ve said ( why 3 day waiting period is bogus, it should at least be a week I&#39;ll say a month is too long myself).</p>

<p>I still think that you&#39;re way underplaying the shill/troll issue though.</p>

<p>It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the &#39;ultimate victory&#39; as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a &#39;honey pot&#39; gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/22/1112509/-The-Gentleperson-s-Guide-to-Forum-Spies">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/22/1112509/-The-Gentleperson-s-Guide-to-Forum-Spies</a></p>

<p>Yes everyone needs to remember this, but lets be sure that we read the entire article about forum spies and maybe for a moment, consider that the new rules might just be addressing these very issues that dominate the conversation at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and don&#39;t really add anything to the actual discussion.</p>

<p>Its really super easy to quote one small section of the Gentleman&#39;s guide to forum spies,  which was hilariously renamed by dailykos or someone down the line to make it gender neutral.  And to ignore the inconvenient parts that would actually force someone to become a better debater and not just rely on easy outs such as.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, you&#39;re just a right wing shill so nothing you say is based upon reality.  IGNORE!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>seriously...  Does anyone here see the above quote as a legitimate argument?  This is what the new rules are about.  And to further complicate this problem we have a group of users who have taken it upon themselves to start some sort of shill fighting alliance which has dominated the comments section of just about every interesting topic that comes up.  Has no one noticed the non-stop flame wars?</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t asking anyone to register as a republican here,  we are asking that you don&#39;t make personal attacks, we have clarified that personal attacks DOES include calling someone a shill or a troll.</p>

I don&#39;t use racist language but if someone does and everyone disagrees, are there not already things in place to let them know by downvoting [or educating them]? 
And if everybody agrees, [even if it is perceived as wrong by a mod], isn&#39;t free speech a right?
Moderating this right won&#39;t change anyone&#39;s opinion, it just silences them. Whereas a good counter argument might actually do change their minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We recently had an issue with a user that everyone was convinced was a shill. He/she <em>only</em> commented in threads dealing with GMOs/Monsanto and always supported both. That fact was pointed out by another user with images of the account history. So, we warned him/her for stalking. As far as I know, that account hasn&#39;t been seen here since. </p>

<p>Other than something like that, it&#39;s next to impossible to <em>prove</em> that someone is a shill. Also note that recently we&#39;ve had quite a few people coming here, r/conspiratard regulars for example, accusing conspiracy theorists of being shills and/or trolls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just gonna put in my 2 cents here, with all the complaints I&#39;ve been noticing about accusations of trolls &amp; &quot;shills&quot; I think the mods have made a good call here, in the spirit of keeping everyone happy, &amp; keeping discussion respectable.</p>

<p>With my one-time 2-3 week long mod experience awhile back, I&#39;ll just say Moddin&#39; ain&#39;t easy, especially if you have other shit that requires doing on top of that, &amp; I think these guys &amp; gals are doing a good job considering the amount of subscribers &amp; the topics discussed, &amp; the fragile nature of conspiracy vs. ideology.</p>

<p>We all have ideas, opinions, theories &amp; our own beliefs true to ourselves, sometimes upon conversation these things conflict, sometimes emotions/negativity surface, &amp; things can &amp; have gotten chaotic as a result, it could be avoided if we just remember that we are all human beings, &amp; are entitled to free thought &amp; respect, &amp; that hostility &amp; insults are unnecessary &amp; counter-productive. </p>

<p>That being said, I think these mods have everyones interests in mind, &amp; we need to let them find an equilibrium, I may still be a fairly young redditor &amp; subscriber here, (approximately 5 months now) but in that time I have seen a lot of change &amp; think I&#39;m entitled to say these small changes aren&#39;t negative to the sub.</p>

<p>Besides having issues with troll/shill accusations myself. I&#39;ve read many, many users say the same. Especially new people who are curious about this subreddit. Whether it&#39;s from paranoid users or other genuine shills wanting to sabotage this sub in any way. </p>

<p>I guess there has to be some leeway in the rule. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but you should be allowed to write a short summary of a user&#39;s account (like age and activity) and imply that he or she has an ulterior agenda.</p>

<p>Of course if you want to make a criticism against a mod, please do it in a mature fashion without a string of insults and slurs.  there is constructive criticism and then there is all out witch hunting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay fair enough no posting of accusations which can&#39;t be proven.</p>

<p>Would the moderators be open to the idea however of viewing &quot;I think this person is a troll/shill&quot; submission when they meet a certain requirement such as a defined number of examples which are logically supported expositions of their shilling?</p>

<p>This could easily be done by a group of mods who could be held to scrutiny by having to post the results of the case when it indeed turns out that the user is a shill/troll.</p>

<p>This process leading to a ban is not unfair nor is it wrong-doing towards those users who are provable shills/trolls as they are inherently acting against the well being of this subreddit.</p>

<p>I am not sure how else we would be able to effectively fix this situation.</p>

<p>Also, the three day waiting does not solve the issue of shills/trolls creating a bunch of shill/troll accounts, are you kidding me?</p>

<p>That &quot;entry barrier&quot; fails to accomplish its&#39; purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no proof anyone is a troll or a shill. It&#39;s mostly just a matter of opinion which is okay. Their punishment is calling them a troll or a shill. You&#39;re saying there&#39;s no naming and shaming now. Now they can do what they want?</p>

<p>But what next? No articles submitted unless there is proof? This is equally against the ethos of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>How is a sustained comment history monofocused towards corrupting threads in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> not evidence of this?
Personal interest literally motivates everything you do.</p>
