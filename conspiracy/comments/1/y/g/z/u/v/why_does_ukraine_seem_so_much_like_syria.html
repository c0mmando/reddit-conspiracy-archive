        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In Ukraine, US-backed rebels seize weapons from a military depot and begin firing on police — killing at least ten. The rebel groups occupy and torch government buildings, trade union headquarters, the central post office, and political party headquarters. They occupy local government facilities in other cities and physically attack local authorities. Their goal is to overthrow the elected government.</p>

<p>Reports of rebel reinforcements arriving, with “bulky backpacks near the scene of the latest protests,” are suspiciously reminiscent of the “Internet in a Suitcase” project funded by the US government to provide tools for “activists” in regime-change candidate countries. The US has similarly trained and equipped the Syrian rebels.</p>

<p>US-backed rebels are photographed all over Ukraine with weapons, sometimes photographed shooting at police. In Syria, the US covertly provided the weapons and approved Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other “friends of Syria” to provide even more. A Russian official has accused the US of arming the Ukrainian opposition.</p>

<p>As in Syria, where US Ambassador Robert Ford adopted the rebels from the beginning of the insurrection, US officials have beat a steady path to the Ukrainian rebels to offer their support and assistance. Senator John McCain has even dined with Svoboda Party president Oleh Tyahnybok, shown here in a rather different pose. US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was recorded plotting the overthrow and replacement of the Ukrainian government with the US Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt.</p>

<p>Pyatt, a man surely devoid of any sense of self-reflection, boldly proclaimed that his recorded plotting to overthrow of the Ukrainian government was merely “helping to build bridges between the government and the opposition.” Of course in a strict sense that is true: he is actively engaged in building a bridge to government power for the Ukrainian opposition.</p>

<p>The Syrian rebels are presented as a moderate group of would-be democrats seeking political reform; Ukrainian rebels are presented as a bunch of pro-Western, pro-EU “peaceful demonstrators.” In both cases the real power on the streets has been radical extremists with whom US officials have had considerable contact.</p>

<p>In Syria, President Assad responded early on to the unrest with offers of compromise, including agreeing to hold a constitutional referendum which put an end to generations of one-party rule. In Ukraine, President Yanukovich granted amnesty to violent protesters, rescinded legislation seen as inhibiting protest, fired his government at the request of the opposition and even offered to name opposition leaders to a new interim government. Each move toward compromise and appeasement of the opposition was met with increased violence and escalating demands on the part of the rebels, most recently in Ukraine after opposition leaders met with US and EU officials at a security conference in Munich.</p>

<p>President Obama sternly warns the Ukrainian government against restoring order: “We expect the Ukrainian government to show restraint, to not resort to violence in dealing with peaceful protesters.” He cryptically hinted at possible US escalation, stating: “We’ll be monitoring very carefully the situation, recognizing that, along with our European partners and the international community, there will be consequences if people step over the line.”</p>

<p>He similarly warned Syrian president Assad against taking action to defend the country against armed rebels fighting for its overthrow.</p>

<p>Another red line drawn? This time on Russia’s doorstep?</p>

<p>Here again is the million dollar question: What would Washington do if rebels intent on overthrowing the Obama regime raided military weapons depots, killed at least ten police officers and wounded dozens of others, set Washington D.C. on fire, occupied key government buildings including the US Capitol complex, and demanded a change in the Constitution favoring their ascendance to power?</p>

<p>Obama warned the Ukraine government to make sure the “Ukrainian military does not step in to resolve issues that could be resolved by civilians.” The US military was called in to quell a far less significant protest in Seattle over the World Trade Organization meeting there in 1999.</p>

<p>The US Capitol area has been on “lockdown” innumerable times over such “threats” as a mentally disturbed woman driving erratically — who was unarmed and shot dead by police.</p>

<p>One need not side with either opposing group in Ukraine to point out the choking hypocrisy of the US position.</p>

<p>But what is truly remarkable are the many similarities between what has been happening in Syria and what is now happening in Ukraine. It almost seems as if the same hand with the same playbook is plotting both regime change operations…</p>

The fatal flaw in this trick however, is we are now in an information age where average people can start to connect the dots. Perhaps that&#39;s why everything is happening at once so quickly.

    <div class="md"><p>Right so let&#39;s say you have control of a huge data set of global communications.  You&#39;ve been running the system for 20+ years, and you have predictive ability by analyzing it.  In other words, you can track and in some cases predict unrest.  </p>

<p>You know that several countries are more crucial geopolitically than others.  But in any case, you want to get in, in advance of unrest, to tip the scales in the right direction.  </p>

<p>Who do you arm?  </p>

<p>It seems that you go in and work with far right groups.  The left is too unpredictable and historically is less afraid to partner with the Russians.  So you go in and in Ukraine you arm the far right, radicalize, incite, equip, and train them.  In Syria its again the far right, ostensibly Al Qaeda, but typical violent middle eastern right wing.  </p>

<p>As things heat up, you can reasonably assume that the &quot;normal&quot; folk will go out and call it a people&#39;s uprising.  Because by all accounts that&#39;s what it is.  But the governments of these countries react with more violence than we saw in Egypt or Tunisia or Thailand because the protestors in Syria and Ukraine are using guns much earlier and in much greater frequency.  </p>

<p>Violence escalates fast.  &quot;Normal&quot; people are marginalized.  The fight escalates and wears the country down over several years. </p>

<p>Study this narrative because I think it is important.  We&#39;ll need to see how these things start shaking out before understanding hte end game, but it is also my fear that if anything ever boils over int he US like occupy again, it&#39;ll be the right, not the left on the streets and armed.  That is a hell-like scenario for everyone.  It won&#39;t end well in Ukraine.  It ended disastrously in Syria.  It&#39;s just..not good.  But the easiest way to short circuit and radicalize a peaceful people&#39;s movement is to introduce guns on the protestors side.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s just not a good idea.  Always always ended in more bloodshed and a worse outcome for the people, it turns it into might makes right, so you get either a protracted civil war or right wing coup-style takeover.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know but you should probably do it sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>actually thats not true, first they would probably start firing rubber bullets in to crowds (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0pX9LeE-g8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0pX9LeE-g8</a>) then they would probably kettle protestors and spray them with chemical agents (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ05rWx1pig">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ05rWx1pig</a>) then they would probably lock down the city and instate a curfew(<a href="http://offgridsurvival.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/2013/04/martiallaw.jpg">http://offgridsurvival.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/2013/04/martiallaw.jpg</a>)</p>
