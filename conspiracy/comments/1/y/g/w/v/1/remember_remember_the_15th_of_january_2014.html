       -- Zbigniew Brzezinski (US National Security Advisor &amp; "expert on foreign relations / policies") and good ol' Johnny McCain (Senator Arizona - R) speak to Senate Committee Foreign Relations with special guest Ukranian Opposition Leader (of the few) and Former Foreign Minister of Ukraine on the desperate need for democracy in the country of Ukraine following unrest entirely supported by the West. My favorite highlights so far : minute marker 9:00 to start the hearing. Minute marker 19:31. Minute marker : 33:00 and the rest if it. Incredible.  A call to help the opposition instill our democratic values on the former Soviet Union state. just like Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and south Sudan --- there's a trend of complete failure of democracy and stability in almost all of these countries since United States democracy pissed our hellfire missle urine throughout the other "eastern world." --

       The fact that Brzezinski is testifying in front of our elected officials almost proves the fact that there are "globalists" that are pushing NWO agenda...  In the video it shows Brzezinski was National Security Advisor to President Carter from 1977-81...
       <br/>
       Why is this un-elected official advising our

        Zbigniew Brzezinski
       </a>
       on Bush, Obama, Iran, and Israel:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brzezinski was a leading critic of the George W. Bush administration's "war on terror". In 2004, Brzezinski wrote The Choice, which expanded upon The Grand Chessboard but sharply criticized George W. Bush's foreign policy. He defended the book The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy and was an outspoken critic of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
       </p>
       <p>
        In August 2007, Brzezinski endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. He stated that Obama "recognizes that the challenge is a new face, a new sense of direction, a new definition of America's role in the world." – also saying, "What makes Obama attractive to me is that he understands that we live in a very different world where we have to relate to a variety of cultures and people."
       </p>
       <p>
        In September 2007 during a speech on the Iraq war, Obama introduced Brzezinski as "one of our most outstanding thinkers," but some pro-Israel commentators questioned his criticism of the Israel lobby in the United States. In a September 2009 interview with The Daily Beast, Brzezinski replied to a question about how aggressive President Obama should be in insisting Israel not conduct an air strike on Iran, saying: "We are not exactly impotent little babies. They have to fly over our airspace in Iraq. Are we just going to sit there and watch?" This was interpreted by some supporters of Israel as supporting the downing of Israeli jets by the United States in order to prevent an attack on Iran.
