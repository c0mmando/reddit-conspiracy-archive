       Meditation: Are you good at reading signs? Signs tell us what is coming ahead. The people of Jesus' time expected that the coming of the Messiah would be accompanied by extraordinary signs and wonders. The religious leaders tested Jesus to see if he had a genuine sign from heaven to back his Messianic claims. False messiahs in the past had made extraordinary claims to attract their followers, such as claiming that they could cleave the Jordan River in two or cause the walls of Jerusalem to fall. Jesus knew the hearts of those who came to test him. They were more interested in seeing signs and supernatural phenomena than they were in hearing the word of God. Simeon had prophesied at Jesus' birth that he was "destined for the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that inner thoughts of many will be revealed" (Luke 2:34-35). Jesus gave them no sign except himself and the ultimate proof of his divinity when he rose from the dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Lord reveals himself and makes his presence known to us in many ways – in his word and in the "breaking of the bread" in the Eucharist, in his church – the body of Christ, in his creation, and even in the everyday circumstances of our lives. If we seek the Lord, we will surely find him. And we can be confident that he will give us whatever we need to understand and carry out his will. Most of all the Lord assures us of his daily presence and the promise that he will never leave us.  Theresa of Avila's prayer book contained a bookmark which she wrote: Let nothing disturb you, let nothing frighten you; All things pass: God never changes.  Patience achieves all it strives for. Whoever has God lacks nothing, God alone suffices. Is God enough for you?

       Yea, typing in caps and hyphening your sentences really put the fear of god into me! Oh me oh my.. so you can go on and on about a deity that is the least visible thing in existence but as soon as I say "Nuh uh" you want to throw rule 1 at me like that is supposed to do something? Like rule 1 is supposed to make me go to whichever one of the broken and backwards religion you hail from's church? Na na na, that won't work today, and surely not on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to post something that has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with conspiracy, then get all protected speech and sermony on the one who says "hey I just read a bunch of bull"
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me throw this at you. Your god and the tales of wonder? Man made fairytales. Churches made up and exaggerated to control the people (his flock of sheep, sheeple... yea) Anyways let's speed this way the hell up
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus: real, misinterpreted deeds and powers, was an alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       The god you worship, fake as David Blane. Is their a real god? I don't know.. I'd like to think so, probably doesn't even know we exist. Who knows? Definitely not the Church (believe yourself before you eat more of man made religion's crap)
      </p>
      <p>
       Angles and the like: misinterpreted extraterrestrials
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the tirade? I know for a fact that the church is NOT looking out for your best interest, they never have and never will.

       Dude, in this day and age you'd think that saying alien's don't exist would land you in a phych chair.
      </p>
      <p>
       If their is anything I have learned, it's that space is
       <strong>
        <em>
         HUGE
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are the only living things taking up space, then what a waste of not only space, but time... If my calculations are anywhere near correct, we are roughly a million years old. But that's for another discussion
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's say reptilian's are way off and Grey's are out of the question too.. there is still something that is, statistically, out there. Let's just call them "they"
      </p>
      <p>
       They.. are out there. They have been here before. If the ones that came here way back then are extinct then they know we exist due to our greeting card:

       but they exist in this realm which makes them a biological (or mechanical) beings. Nothing, and I mean
       <strong>
        <em>

       nothing can exist in this realm without an X amount of mass.

       You don't get to decide what is literal and what isn't.  Thats the joy of the bible.  Its so vague and unclear that you can literally make it mean what ever you want.  Same thing you do, my parents do to interpret the bible literally from creation on.

       Point is, its completely subjective interpretation which is why you can say "it means eternal" and they can say that homosexuality is an abomination because it says so in the old testament and god never changes.

       I think placing all of your faith in a higher power absolves you of responsibility in life. I also think the bible is full of contradictions though it still contains many elements of truth (as do all religions/religious texts).

       It always happens, mention God, Christianity or faith, and people tell me I'm a programmed fool. Blind their own programmed biases, God has been removed and defamed from our modern world FOR A REASON. Even the Communist Manifesto recognizes that the godlessness is "necessary" to control the masses. There ARE regulars here who follow Christianity and need encouragement.

       If I went to a church that was filled w zombies, I suppose yes. But my church speaks to the individual, and that has always been the message of Christ, becoming the "best version of yourself", based on the experiences and gifts you've been given by God.

       I just think that if you think you
       <em>
        can't be controlled
       </em>
       because of your beliefs or because of spiritual protection or whatever, that means you are one of the
       <em>
        easiest people to control
       </em>
       because you won't be watching out for it.

       Well, I see you still need to do some digging. When you realize what the "end design" is, you'll realize why I chose God and why I feel "free" because of that choice. I'm not trying to be coy, but we all come into understanding in our own time.

       There is plenty of historical evidence showing that religions (including your own) are designed to control the masses, yet here you say the opposite siting communist manifestos.  Surely the early communists mention this because of the historical corruption inherent in religious institutions.  I feel like you are taking their writings out of context in order to validate your views.  If I am wrong in that, please clarify so that I might apologize for my assumption and better understand what it is you're trying to communicate.

       Btw, I would say that your God has removed and defamed Its' self by its' own inaction and absence.  This is just my opinion, but it is hard to argue against when other gods were so much more active in the past than yours has been as of late.

       Yea, typing in caps and hyphening your sentences really put the fear of god into me! Oh me oh my.. so you can go on and on about a deity that is the least visible thing in existence but as soon as I say "Nuh uh" you want to throw rule 1 at me like that is supposed to do something? Like rule 1 is supposed to make me go to whichever one of the broken and backwards religion you hail from's church? Na na na, that won't work today, and surely not on me.
      </p>

       You want to post something that has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with conspiracy, then get all protected speech and sermony on the one who says "hey I just read a bunch of bull"
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me throw this at you. Your god and the tales of wonder? Man made fairytales. Churches made up and exaggerated to control the people (his flock of sheep, sheeple... yea) Anyways let's speed this way the hell up
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus: real, misinterpreted deeds and powers, was an alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       The god you worship, fake as David Blane. Is their a real god? I don't know.. I'd like to think so, probably doesn't even know we exist. Who knows? Definitely not the Church (believe yourself before you eat more of man made religion's crap)
      </p>
      <p>
       Angles and the like: misinterpreted extraterrestrials
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the tirade? I know for a fact that the church is NOT looking out for your best interest, they never have and never will.
