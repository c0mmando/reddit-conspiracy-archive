It seems ludicrous, but may have more to do with the fact that I cannot stand to live in a works devoid of higher purpose. If aliens made us as an experiment it would be detrimental to so many people.

Maybe I just think too highly of our species or maybe I&#39;m romanticizing, but I just feel that if it DID turn out we were made by aliens that everything I&#39;ve ever believed would be a lie.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t accept that. 
I&#39;m not sure, I really just feel like it wouldn&#39;t sit well with me. 
What if the aliens were just using us for experiment and that our race didn&#39;t matter to them? I can&#39;t say for sure, but at least in my head it&#39;s more comforting to believe that it was by a god, omnipotent and omniscient. </p>

Either way in that situation I&#39;d rather believe a lie.

<p>4) How are the benefits to them of the conspiracy significantly better than the benefits they would obtain by applying the same money and/or effort in more conventional (less risky) means?</p>

<li><p>Fake moon landing (ensuring the complicity of the Soviet government seems well nigh impossible)</p></li>

<p>Who said they were commercial airliners. The first time I saw them, they were military KC-135s. Can you <em>quantify</em> and <em>qualify</em> how you came up with the idea that there are <em>thousands of civilians</em> working on the program? </p>

<p>Look through all of these links and then make up your mind afterwards. </p>

<p>Who said they were commercial airliners. The first time I saw them, they were military KC-135s. Can you quantify and qualify how you came up with the idea that there are thousands of civilians working on the program?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You read a lot into a short, simple response and wrote even more in your reply. I can tell it&#39;s a topic you&#39;re passionate about. But I think you missed my meaning.</p>

<p>My meaning was that I didn&#39;t believe that there is widespread chemtrailing happening from commercial airliners. That is a conspiracy theory that others (possibly not yourself) have suggested on this forum quite a number of times.</p>

<p>The reason for my statement is that there would need to be thousands of civilians complicit in the practice and it seems impossible to keep that many civilians quiet. Again, <em>commercial</em> airliners.</p>

<p>My comment didn&#39;t address military chemtrailing at all. Obviously it&#39;s easier to keep soldiers quiet.</p>

<p>There are other problems with chemtrailing though. In many cases, <em>all</em> the airplanes at a certain altitude band are producing trails. Not just some of them. All of them. In order for chemtrailing to be a &quot;thing&quot;, that would mean that all the planes in the sky at a particular altitude band would have to be chemtrailing at the same time. If you notice something like that, take note of the time and location and do some research on what planes are there. In my hometown, when I&#39;ve done that, there are a lot of commercial planes.</p>

<p>In those cases, contrails are a much more plausible explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the hell, I didnt think people actually beleived this. First of all, how could an aircraft possibly hold enough fluid to spray hundreds of miles of airspace. EVEN if they could hold enough &quot;chemicals&quot; how would spraying so little do anything? The chemicals would diffuse and it would not effect anything.</p>

<p>That is if I beleive any of this crazy notion. The production of these contrails is widely known and researched. <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail</a> , <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_vortices</a>. You can even find wind tunnel videos of such contrails being created.</p>

<p>Being from a military family with 2 military pilots as parents and currently working on a capstone project to do with vortexes on a wing, I have been around my fair share of aircraft. There is nowhere to store such fluod and no reason to store it. I cannot beleive that people still beleive this, open your eyes, have you ever actualy seen a plane?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Military, huh? The first time I took notice of the persistent contrails I was a full-grown adult and they were being sprayed by military KC-135 aircraft. So, in my opinion, the military is the number one suspects performing these types of operations. If you read through the links, all of your questions would be explained, but you obviously didn&#39;t bother. Thank you for playing, we have some nice parting gifts for you, Mr. Military. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is that you dismissed every link provided within minutes, meaning that you didn&#39;t take the time to read through them thoroughly before you formed your opinion. The facts are that there is solid science behind geoengineering and it has been performed for a very long time.

The facts are that because your family is part of an organization that are the number one suspects performing the spraying, your opinion on the matter is biased and means <em>even less</em> to me than your average person. </p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t believe that sandy hook was fake, and so was the Navy yard shooter and Boston marathon bombings all being staged or exaggerated.  I believe they set all of it up.  Brain wash already mentally disturbed people and give them access to guns so they can create fear and chaos, so we can pass crazy gun reform laws.  And that the bombing was definitely false flag terrorism.  Get the medias attention,  Kim a few Americans so we can blame it on someone else.  And scapegoat it on two &quot;Islamic fascists&quot;</p>

<p>Five headshots of varying caliber, none of them show the bullet <em>throwing</em> the victim around in the way the &#39;back and to the left&#39; crowd would have you believe. </p>

<hr/>

<p>So why did Kennedy jerk back after being shot? The same thing happens in my NSFW 2 video - In that video the teen&#39;s whole body jerks when shot the 2nd time. </p>

<p>But bullets do create a little bit of movement, so what about with JFK? - <a href="http://www.jfk-online.com/Closeup_312-313.gif">It sure did</a>, but again it&#39;s not near what movie-goers would have you think. </p>
