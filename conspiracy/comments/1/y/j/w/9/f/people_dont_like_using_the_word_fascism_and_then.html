        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The MSM is 90% owned and controlled by just 6 large Corporations. That includes NBC, which was owned by GE and is now owned by Comcast.</p>

<p>These 6 large Corporations manage and control the &quot;news&quot; that is allowed to be put out.</p>

<p>These 6 Corporations are dependent on the advertising revenues from other large corporations. Have you seen how many commercials there are on TV every day for credit cards of the big banks or for drugs from big pharma?</p>

<p>These 6 Corporations mention nothing of the current system whereby over $2tn a year is stolen from ordinary people to enrich already wealthy elites via Corporate Welfare.</p>

<p>The wealthy elites buy the politicians and their staffers in DC via hundreds of millions of dollars a year in bribes. Campaign contributions and offers of post public life jobs etc.</p>

<p>Corporatism is the merger of State and Corporate power.</p>

<p>This perfectly describes the system in place in America today.</p>

<p>Benito Mussolini : &quot;Fascism should more properly be called Corporatism, because it is the merger of Corporate and State power.&quot;</p>

<p>The word Fascism or Fascist is never, ever used in the mainstream media. </p>

<p>When the vast majority of Congress and all of the White House have been pursuing an increasingly extremist Corporatist, now Fascist, agenda for the last 30 years. </p>

<p>It is by far the best word to use to describe most members of Congress and the Executive branch. </p>

<p>If the word Fascist were ever used in the mainstream media it would wake some people up as to what the government is actually doing and that is the very last thing that the mainstream media wants to do. </p>

<p>This describes the theft of over $2tn a year from ordinary people to enrich crony government elites.

<p>This more fully describes the Corporate owned and controlled mainstream media&#39;s silence upon it.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the West screwed up when it didn&#39;t go after the financiers of Naziism. Wealthy, powerful families in the West financed Hitler and played both sides of the fence during WWII, and got off scot-free. In fact, <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/july2007/240707fascistcoup.htm">Prescott Bush of the Bush political dynasty supported Naziism and supported a coup in the US to install a dictator like Hitler as President.</a> He and future CIA head Allen Dulles were accused by Gen. Smedley Butler of attempting to organize the coup. Why was nothing ever done against people who supported treason? Were they too rich and privileged?</p>

<p>We had a new enemy after the war ended and fighting Communism took priority over fighting Fascism. The Germans knew how to fight the Russians so we imported them and their ways. But by far the bigger blunder was allowing Naziism to continue unmolested in the US.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is a statute of limitations on prosecuting treason?</p>

<p>The document calls for regime change in Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
Mention is also made of Afghanistan and Sudan.</p>

<p>GHW Bush was involved in the assassination of JFK <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2012/12/gwh-bush-jfk-cia-drugs.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2012/12/gwh-bush-jfk-cia-drugs.html</a></p>

<p>GHW Bush was intimately involved in drugs running and money laundering from his days as CIA Director.</p>

<p>It is not known how or why Noriega upset the American authorities. He was an integral part of the CIA&#39;s drug trafficking and money laundering operation from South and Central America.
He must of done something. He was replaced in a coup by GWH Bush.

    <div class="md"><p>Calling the United States in 2014 &quot;fascist&quot; is not entirely correct, if only because of the connotations that history has given to the word. </p>

<p>Under Benito Mussolini&#39;s &quot;Fascism should more properly be called Corporatism, because it is the merger of Corporate and State power&quot; definition, you are technically correct, but there is a major difference.</p>

<p>In a fascist system like Nazi Germany or Mussolini&#39;s Italy, industry and corporations were forced to serve the interest of the state, which still (in it&#39;s own mind) had the best interests of (some of) the people as it&#39;s main goal. In our system, the state is being corrupted to serve corporations, who have no duty (real or imagined) to empower the state or the people.</p>

<p>Great blog post on the word &quot;fascism.&quot;  What it actually means and how to recognize.  His main point is the word has been misused and disassociated from its original meaning that if fascism were to arrive we wouldn&#39;t recognize it.  (it has)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, I think that the corporatism that you describe exists but there is an organized layer above it. Without a real organization, they could not have pulled off 911, or many other lies through history. It is similar to in Europe where the British Monarch allied itself with the wealthy aristocrats and Italian mob to ensure there was no threat to its own power. The incredible revelations of Edward Snowden make it hard to believe that the NSA just allows anyone elected president to just walk in to such a spy system unless they were already approved by NSA/CIA itself.</p>
