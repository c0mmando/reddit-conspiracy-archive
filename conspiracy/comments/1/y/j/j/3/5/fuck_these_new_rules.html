All rules were put into place for a reason, to increase the quality of the sub and subsequent discussions.

<p>Do you make this decision public?  Do any of us other users get to see who was banned or why they were banned?  Or do they just get banned without another word, never to be seen on the sub again?

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I see where you&#39;re coming from.</p>

<p>Firstly, we (the mods) don&#39;t operate like the Stazi or the Gestapo.  We don&#39;t whisk people off in the dark of night because they spoke badly about great leader.  If you want to know just how little I give a fuck about people bad mouthing me just check out my &quot;no rules&quot; experiment <a href="/r/askflytape">/r/askflytape</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, if someone is banned they can make a new account and make a post about themselves being banned.  If you look at the rules you&#39;ll see that there is in fact no rule against posting about yourself.  Of course making one of these posts would need to actually be about &quot;I was banned and I didn&#39;t even break a rule&quot; not &quot;I was banned because flytape is misogynistic nazi&quot;. See the difference?  One of those is an attempt to discover why someone was banned, the other is an attempt to witch hunt a mod for doing their duty.</p>

<p>The simple fact is we don&#39;t see people making these type of posts here because 99% of the time, they know they were being a huge dick because that&#39;s what their intention was in the first place.</p>

<p>Now you might say, well.... what if you guys just delete the posts all these poor souls make while trying to figure out why their main account was banned.</p>

<p>The mods here are not all buddy buddy with each other.  Obviously we have some level of respect for each other but we are also quite critical of each other.  I&#39;ve been questioned on my reasoning for a ban by another mod on multiple occasions, and I don&#39;t mind.  </p>

<p>We typically offer people a reversal if they agree to not break the rules again.</p>

<p>There are multiple checks and balances.  The most important balance is the fact that your mods here were selected by the community here.  And we&#39;ve even had a mod unselected like SWS after he got too friendly with conspiratard.</p>

<p>unpopular speech is still protected, and by censoring it you are no better than the government. </p>

<p>that isn&#39;t even the point i&#39;m trying to make.</p>

<p>you&#39;ve effectively removed public debate about these topics. we can&#39;t even criticize or accuse each other now, let alone the mods or the sub reddit. thats some double speak assbackwards shit right there. </p>

<p>&quot;no trolling/shilling. no attacking/accusing of trolling/shilling. no accusations of rules violations in comments&quot;</p>

<p>that is just absurd. but we all knew reddit has been compromised for some time now. I mean, it is owned by conde nast. And there are documented cases of actual shills, vote rigging, censorship, etc... so I think it is fair to be upset about the fact that the ONE place we can go for free discussion and social awakening is being censored in any way possible</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again calling out people for trolling or shilling does not add to the conversations or help us get answers. It just takes away from the topics at hand. </p>

<p>Go read through controversial topics here and notice how it goes from what ever the original was straight to some other theory all in the effort to discredit the original posts.</p>

<p>By ignoring them you take away their power. By calling them out you feed their ego and drive them to keep going. </p>

<p>You know nothing of me, I have not given up anything. I have come to realize the best way to beat the system is from withing the system. </p>

<p>By being the loudest outside the system you just push people away who otherwise may have wanted to listen. But nobody wants to deal with someone if all they ever do is throw out accusations of being a shill or troll.</p>

<p>Most people here are &quot;awake (I hate that term but its an easy to describe it) </p>

<p>No one is really being limited to what they can post or talk about as far as conspiracies. (aside from ones that would involve this site, I guess) But if your going to come here to try to uncover the conspiracy behind Reddit and be shocked and appuald that you can&#39;t do not act all surprised. </p>

<p>As I just stated to OP, my views on the rule changes is to cut down on the posts that only state that so and so is trolling/shilling and adds nothing else to the topic. If they make some claim that something is not the way you see it, point out why you see it that way. </p>

<p>We can have debates and conversations here without resorting to accusations, even is said accusations are 100% true. </p>

<p>The fact that you can not call them a troll or shill does not take away from the fact that you can still debate them. </p>

<p>As I said I see the rules as a way to curb the posts that just state someone is a shill with no evidence. </p>

<p>If you can prove without a doubt they are one, why not just use that evidence. No where do you have to directly call them anything. Post the evidence and let it speak for itself. </p>

<p>If you want to avoid it, come join the new sub <a href="/r/ConspiracyNoRules">/r/ConspiracyNoRules</a> and call everyone a shill for all I care. </p>

<p>Please go into more detail. I am not opposed to hearing you out. I am just sick of people saying they do not like some thing and not saying why.</p>

<p>If you do not think we should have mods, then how should we do things. Just let it turn into a free for all of garbage image posts that add nothing, people going way off topic to discredit people they see as &quot;shills&quot; (not saying they do not exist here; as they do). But disagreeing does not always mean they are a shill.</p>

<p>And if you hate the new rules, how does a 6 month old post help your case?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im struggling to find my first post where I went into depth.</p>

<p>Basically, rule 10 has always said no attacks on the sub, its users, or its mods. </p>

<p>Being a conspiracy theorist, I look at the bad in that. They don&#39;t explain what an attack is or who gets to decide what attack means. At the time of posting originally, it said the rules were discussed and explained in the FAQ section, and there was no explanation of rules let alone a FAQ page. Could be different now.</p>

<p>And now we have rule 2 which states no accusations of rules violations in the comments. How cab we demand transparency when we don&#39;t even allow it here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well word what you say differently. </p>

<p>My view on the changes is that they are there to curb the comments that just only attack the sub, the user, or the mod. </p>

<p>Just like your post started out, you said one statement with nothing to back it up. How many times have you just seen someone called a &quot;shill&quot; with nothing else but the accusation, or someone attacking someone for a previous post, when the current topic is entirely different.</p>

<p>If you feel someone is up to no good, do not directly call them out as whatever you feel they are; but ask questions to them, get them to stumble when you ask for them to back up their claims, or just move on and ignore them; or comment your opinion of the subject, not the OP.</p>

<p>You can not please 100% of the people all the time. Not I never said I was 100% for the rules my self. I am just curious as to why people will post things such as this with no explanation in to it. I do see you point and thank you for describing your reasoning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The recent rule changes remove almost all oversight from the sub.  Bans will be handed out in secret based on rule violations reported in secret.  Trolls can troll and not have to worry about being called out on it.  Mods can ignore messages sent to them and not have to worry about being called out publicly.</p>

<p>As I said in another post, it reminds me of the FISA Court.</p>
