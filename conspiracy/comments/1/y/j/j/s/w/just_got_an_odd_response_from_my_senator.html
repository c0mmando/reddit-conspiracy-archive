        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A few weeks back I contacted Sen. Saxby Chambliss Via email, basically demanding on behalf of his constituents that he vote no against a TPP fast track.  I just got this (I assume automated) response..</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for contacting me about our nation&#39;s intelligence activities.  I appreciate hearing from you on this issue.</p>

<p>In the wake of a number of media reports disclosing sensitive information about our intelligence activities, it has become increasingly evident that we must ensure the continuation of these important NSA collection programs that have helped in the identification of terrorist plots against the New York City subway system, the New York Stock Exchange, and a Danish newspaper office.  As Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), I am committed to providing our intelligence community with the resources and authorities they need to uphold our national security while simultaneously ensuring the constitutional rights of all Americans are protected. </p>

<p>I was pleased that S.1631, the &quot;FISA Improvements Act of 2013,&quot; was passed out of the Intelligence Committee on October 31, 2013, for consideration by the full Senate.  If enacted, S.1631 would permit the continuation of these important NSA collection programs so long as they comply with the supplemental procedures designed to enhance transparency and improve privacy protections.  Significantly, the collection of bulk communication records under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act is strictly limited to call data (e.g., time, date, and duration of call) and cannot be used to collect the contents of any of those phone calls.  S. 1631 would also establish criminal penalties of up to 10 years in prison for intentional unauthorized access to data acquired under FISA, restrict the access to this data, and impose a five-year limit on the retention of bulk communication records. </p>

<p>The &quot;FISA Improvements Act&quot; would also give Congress greater oversight by requiring reporting to Congress on all violations of law or executive order by intelligence agencies and implementing periodic reviews of certain intelligence collection activities.  Finally, S.1631 would make important changes to the FISA Court by allowing it to designate outside &quot;Amicus Curiae&quot; (&quot;Friends of the Court&quot;) to provide independent perspectives and assist the court in reviewing matters that present a novel or significant interpretation of the law.</p>

<p>These are important improvements to existing law and I will work hard to ensure that they remain in the final legislation when the bill is debated on the floor of the Senate.  The American people deserve to know that their privacy will be protected under these legal and necessary programs. This bill accomplishes our goals of increased transparency and improved privacy protections, while maintaining operational effectiveness and flexibility for the intelligence community.  As the Senate considers S.1631, I will keep your thoughts in mind.</p>

<p>If you would like to receive timely email alerts regarding the latest congressional actions and my weekly e-newsletter, please sign up via my web site at: <a href="http://www.chambliss.senate.gov">www.chambliss.senate.gov</a> . Please let me know whenever I may be of assistance.&quot;</p>

<p>seems very weird, because I never mentioned anything about the NSA or FISA in my email.  </p>
