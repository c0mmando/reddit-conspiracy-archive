        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Rarely acknowledged in the debate on global climate change, the world’s weather can now be modified as part of a new generation of sophisticated electromagnetic weapons. Both the US and Russia have developed capabilities to manipulate the climate for military use.</p>

<p>Environmental modification techniques have been applied by the US military for more than half a century. US mathematician John von Neumann, in liaison with the US Department of Defense, started his research on weather modification in the late 1940s at the height of the Cold War and foresaw ‘forms of climatic warfare as yet unimagined’. During the Vietnam war, cloud-seeding techniques were used, starting in 1967 under Project Popeye, the objective of which was to prolong the monsoon season and block enemy supply routes along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.</p>

<p>The US military has developed advanced capabilities that enable it selectively to alter weather patterns. The technology, which is being perfected under the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP), is an appendage of the Strategic Defense Initiative – ‘Star Wars’. From a military standpoint, HAARP is a weapon of mass destruction, operating from the outer atmosphere and capable of destabilising agricultural and ecological systems around the world.</p>

<p>Weather-modification, according to the US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report, ‘offers the war fighter a wide range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary’, capabilities, it says, extend to the triggering of floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes: ‘Weather modification will become a part of domestic and international security and could be done unilaterally… It could have offensive and defensive applications and even be used for deterrence purposes. The ability to generate precipitation, fog and storms on earth or to modify space weather… and the production of artificial weather all are a part of an integrated set of [military] technologies.’</p>

<p>The USA has, according to this, the ability to modify the weather over other nations for decades, right?</p>

<p>Whose weather have they modified? What enemy nations of the USA have experienced significant, crop and people killing droughts in that time?</p>

<p><em>Russian Scholar Warns Of &#39;Secret&#39; U.S. Climate Change Weapon</em></p>

<p>From Radio Free Europe- A broadcaster funded by the U.S. Congress. Take from that what you will, I just found it to be an interesting tidbit I&#39;d include.

<blockquote>
<p>As Muscovites suffer record high temperatures this summer, a Russian political scientist has claimed the United States may be using climate-change weapons to alter the temperatures and crop yields of Russia and other Central Asian countries</p>

<p>In the article, Areshev voiced suspicions about the High-Frequency Active Aural Research Program (HAARP), funded by the U.S. Defense Department and the University of Alaska. </p>

<p><em>Hugo Chavez Mouthpiece Says U.S. Hit Haiti With &#39;Earthquake Weapon&#39;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Citing an alleged report from Russia&#39;s Northern Fleet, the Venezuelan strongman&#39;s state mouthpiece ViVe TV shot out a press release saying the 7.0 magnitude Haiti quake was caused by a U.S. test of an experimental shockwave system that can also create &quot;weather anomalies to cause floods, droughts and hurricanes.&quot;</p>

<p>The station&#39;s Web site added that the U.S. government&#39;s HAARP program, an atmospheric research facility in Alaska (and frequent subject of conspiracy theories), was also to blame for a Jan. 9 quake in Eureka, Calif., and may have been behind the 7.8-magnitude quake in China that killed nearly 90,000 people in 2008.</p>

<p>Who knows, but it would be a terrifying addition to any arsenal, and one that many powers have investigated as a weapon- including the Soviets with the unofficial knowledge of Western geophysicists. </p>

<p>Logically, the Soviets, and others, investigated this as a weapon, for many reasons- not the least of which would be commanding the fear/respect (in warfare these are near synonymous, &quot;It&#39;s better to be feared than loved,&quot; Machiavelli) of other nations. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_weapon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_weapon</a></p>

<p>Investigate, I should say, as, though Nature reported what I said above, in 1996, the Russian defence minister confirmed geophysical weapons as part of the state arms procurement programme for 2011-2020.</p>

<p>To answer my own, obvious, rhetorical question- A country that could cause earthquakes would command international respect far more than a country with drones. </p>

<p>This statement doesn&#39;t indicate that anyone definitively can cause earthquakes, but it&#39;s a very logical statement.</p>

<p>Yes, it absolutely would command more international fear. Sure. But, as I said, it would need to be <em>known</em> to cause that fear.</p>

<p>At best, at the moment, looking only at world governments, you have the same people who say two men kissing causes earthquakes and women wearing makeup and not covering every square centimeter of skin cause rapes saying the US can do this. Nobody else. Zero credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been a food shortage in America, has there? </p>

<p>However, just to engage in speculation for a moment- if there&#39;s a secret group of conspirators with weapons that the general populace considers science-fiction, who&#39;s to say that civil unrest and a general uprising wouldn&#39;t also serve their agenda? </p>

<p>What would their agenda be? If it&#39;s martial law and total population control, a civil uprising would be a great way to get that instituted and would fit the Problem-Reaction-Solution paradigm perfectly. </p>

<p>Unless the civil unrest, somehow, lead to the overthrow of the government, the identifying of the secret cabal, and the dissolution of those in charge of theoretical weapons. </p>

<p>The benefits of manipulating the weather are quite obvious. If we can create atom bombs, or create the conditions at the start of the big bang, there&#39;s no reason to doubt our capability/motivation for such a thing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, increasingly adverse weather conditions are popping up all over the world, and the MSM is going to continue to use the words &#39;global warming&#39; to explain it. Strange phenomena in the sky are appearing before earthquakes and tsunami&#39;s. It&#39;s there for everyone to see.</p>
