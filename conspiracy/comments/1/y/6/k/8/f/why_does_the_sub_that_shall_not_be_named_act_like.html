Anyone with the ability to think critically would never bash anyone for questioning things that need to be questioned. Is that sub just there to discredit people that research and vet information that needs to be researched and vetted?

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Seriously, this question begs asking. Most of us are not bat shit crazy, most of us are not bat shit insane. We love our countries and people...and do not wish for harm to anyone...so why the f**k is there a WHOLE SUB dedicated to  discrediting us?

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.  </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t justifying it.  I think it&#39;s kind of crazy how they can justify some of the theories they <em>do</em> believe in while thinking you have to be batshit crazy to find any other conspiracy theory compelling.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I find <a href="/r/conspiratardness">/r/conspiratardness</a> hilarious.  They switched it to private I think, but it&#39;s where people go to mock <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> posters for their hypocrisy.  As much as I don&#39;t believe half the things posted here, I feel like <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is disruptive to those who enjoy discussions here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This - <a href="http://imgur.com/OEfDwVH">http://imgur.com/OEfDwVH</a> - is the the current top ranking story on that subreddit. Also, notice how it&#39;s not an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> story.</p>

<p>I think people who think that cancer can be cured by &quot;changing the bodies pH&quot; (incidentally <strong>impossible without killing the person</strong>) is ridiculous. It&#39;s not laughing at people for &quot;thinking&quot;. It&#39;s laughing at laughable claims like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will likely always be the lion&#39;s share of the stories, true - because it&#39;s on the same website, and Reddit is where many Redditors will spend most of their online time. You could say it was started for one reason, but I think it&#39;s changed over time. The mods there have a number of interests that I have no personal alignment to, but they don&#39;t decide what all of their members do - they&#39;re just not <em>that</em> influencial.</p>

<p>As for the pH claim, I have researched it personally. And what I know goes completely against that, so I feel I can disregard it unless they produce something extraordinarily convincing to add to their arguments.</p>

<p>Certainly, like any human I will generally have a initial kneejerk reaction based on what I already know. But then I go out and see how likely the claim is. Probably not everyone does that, but I generally do.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you have to be a scientist to at least evaluate the majority of these claims. Certainly there are limits everywhere on my knowledge and abilities, which means there are some things I simply have to accept when science makes a claim - because those people know more and are more adept than myself and virtually everyone else in their area.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s quite a bit even an amateur dabbler like myself can establish with reasonable backing. Which is why I find it interesting that others make the same claim, but have totally different conclusions.</p>

<p>This is one of the main reasons I hang out here. To see <em>why</em> people have reached such different conclusions, challenging them for evidentiary sources if necessary.</p>

<p>I give you evidence that conspiratard can be open minded when it comes to conspiracy theories with evidence and especially ones that can be proven in history. </p>

<p>I think your preconcieved notion of &quot;Us vs Them&quot; blinds you to the fact we (suscribers to the Voldemort-esque subreddit) are <strong>just as interested</strong> in conspiracy theories as you, we just take a circitous route in learning about them by watching other people take chances, make mistakes and get messy in their investigations of the clandestine activities of TPTB.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so why the f**k is there a WHOLE SUB dedicated to discrediting us? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to think highly of itself but really many of the posts in conspiratard are to other websites other than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This should tell you you&#39;re just an ordinary target for mockery, but instead this sub continues to insist that it is important and somehow warrants special attention.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually pro-their side you could say, but it&#39;s what I feel the truth is. Please do not feel victimized by our mockery of your beliefs. <strong>Only you</strong> can decide to feel victimized by mockery and disbelief.

<p>That&#39;s our way of getting <em>under your skin</em> because conspiracy theorists do seem to also at times get a bit pretentious with the whole &#39;I know something you don&#39;t, sheeple&#39; atitude. We feed it back, a feedback loop, and you know the noise of a microphone held near a speaker that is playing the input of the microphone?</p>

<p>Yeah, we use <strong>that noise</strong> to make CTs think twice about the atitude they hold towards others who do not hold their special snowflake beliefs. </p>

<p>That screeching noise of a microphone feeding back the ambient noise amplified through the speaker. That noise, that&#39;s actually useful <em>to conspiratards</em> because it allows us to let the CTs taste their own medicine and find they do not like being condescended to. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a weapon that works on those whom we feel can be trusted to think about how they try to tell others to wake up; It doesn&#39;t always work, sometimes you can&#39;t save someone who is in too deep with a feedback loop. </p>

<p>Then why do you do it in what amounts to an echo chamber? Yes of course people who suscribe to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> might be interested in learning more about what you want to tell them, but this subreddit also has people who are going to conflate many conspiracies with their prejudiced ideas that they have of other theories. </p>

<p>If you wanted to tell someone you knew something you don&#39;t tell a group of guillible people and have them spread it for you, since that casts aspersions on the story you&#39;re trying to show.</p>

<p>In the related subreddit list at the sidebar you can see other subreddits that have ... less broad categories and I know this <em>sounds absolutely crazy</em> <del>so that&#39;s why I&#39;m commenting on it here</del> but if you have something to say try more than one community. </p>

<p>If this post is too disparaging for polite conversation let me know. It&#39;s just that to other non-CTs this subreddit has connotations of being guillible and easily exciteable. If you have something important try a group that is trusted with informing the public like Wikileaks.</p>

<p>Discussion of conspiracies can take place here, however conspiracies by nature aren&#39;t as obvious as this subreddit makes them out to be.</p>

<p>&quot;Run like you stole something&quot; is a phrase you may have heard before, but the most successful thiefs walk away like they have nothing to fear. </p>

<p>What is your personally held conspiracy, what is the important one? </p>

<p>Exactly. It is, more than he insinuated, a feedback loop, because more rational people who question these things, who otherwise wouldn&#39;t talk down to people, do so because the entire environment is hostile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you say no discussion can take place in that fashion <strong>but</strong> I think it can, it forces people to think twice about their words when they&#39;re treated the way they&#39;re treating others. Some people don&#39;t even <em>care</em> they&#39;re being condescended to with a know-it-all atitude, they&#39;re so bent on making their view be seen as correct they&#39;ll take the effort that someone else puts into it as a validation of their own time and labour in acting that way.</p>

<p>The foodback loop is a useful tool because it may give someone new to conspiracy theories a moment of hesitation when they ask themselves <em>is this what they want</em> in terms of personal relationships. Do they want to enter into a never-ending cycle of losing friends for their fringe beliefs or can they step back to remain calm and rational, losing the mindset of winning at all costs to prove their pet theories?</p>

<p>I think the screechy-noise feedback analogy works as debunkers will often use that atitude as a weapon when confronting CTs. However no one actually <em>likes</em> a screechy feedback noise, it&#39;s in our best interests to discourage it, the atitude and the consequences it has on dialogues. </p>

<p>It really doesn&#39;t. Being insulted usually impedes critical thought. It&#39;s human nature. If someone reasonably tries to discuss something with you and you share your points without ridicule, both can learn something. When you&#39;re immediately attacked (because both sides ascribe everyone on the other side the characteristics of their worst), it does not engender critical thought at all. It entrenches people in an adversarial position, making them <em>less</em> likely to critically examine evidence that contradicts their view.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s useful to those who want everyone to accept what they&#39;re told without question. It&#39;s useful for keeping people &quot;in line.&quot; It is not useful for finding actual truth. I appreciate that you don&#39;t pretend to be interested in such, at least.</p>

<p>People on Digg expected to be able to post content without fuss from a concerted effort to hide that content unfairly and outside the rules but it didn&#39;t go that way. People are susceptible to propaganda whether they realise what&#39;s happening or not. You can&#39;t call it winning or losing when you don&#39;t even know your part of a game, a game that allegedly is for the lulz but shows more than enough that&#39;s it&#39;s a pretty serious effort to silence people.</p>

<p>Constant name calling is the oldest trick in the book and is used by people that wish for people and discussions to go away without revealing that their stance is indefensible. The fact that the name of the sub is called Conspiritard right off the bat shows that it is designed not to engage at all but to use mockery to degrade any serious discussions that can and have been had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it,</p>

<p>For start, the most significance difference between this sub and &quot;that&quot; sub is the reasons people come. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Here, like you wrote, most are interested in finding answers to unknown questions, reading stories that have been banned in other places (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, r/news, r/technology, etc). Essentially people come here to learn and expand their knowledge base, and most are able to differentiate between likely/unlikely/outrageous conspiracy claims, but are not always vocal about it.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;There&quot;, most are interested in laughing at other people, generalizing groups of people, etc.  This is how they view conspiracy theorists: Person 1 believes Theory A, Therefore Person 2 believes Theories A to Z. It is forum dedicated to mocking others, and not in an Onion kind of way - more like the bully at school type.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Take a moment, if you haven&#39;t already, and compare post titles and comments from both subs and you will notice a marked difference in tone.</p>

<p>As for the reasons why &quot;those&quot; people would act that way - there are many reasons, not limited to, nor guaranteed to contain the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Some may work, or have parents that work in the government or at a governmental subcontractor, thus they have a real interest in protecting one of the greatest perpetrators of conspiracies. (by one estimate, 3.2 million people, or 1% of the U.S. population works for the U.S. Department of Defense in some capacity - this is approximately equal to a combination of employment of the top 3 U.S. private employers)</p></li>
<li><p>Some may work, or have parents that work at a large corporation, thus they have a real interest in protecting one of the other major perpetrators of conspiracies.</p></li>
<li><p>Some may have massive debt, lots of things, money in the stock market, and a steady superfluous job that pays the bills. Disruption could cause great havoc in their lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Some may be children trolling for attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Some may be paid to troll.</p></li>
<li><p>Some may have only experienced the greener grass side of life - never having been in a situation that brought them to the edge of their bubbles.</p></li>
<li><p>Some may believe there is a supreme being up in the sky (I&#39;m not referring to drones/satellites/space stations) that knows all and one day, as long as the person stays true to its &quot;word&quot;, the great entity will accept the person&#39;s soul into its invisible kingdom in open arms and they will live eternally in bliss.</p></li>
<li><p>Some may be scared of truth, fearful of the consequences of becoming a target of government/corporate interests (as per TILearnedNothing).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s just the rebound response to the extremes that exist here (which in themselves are result of strong movement agains the mainstream).</p>

<p>If the mainstream is no conspiracies, then this subreddit would be all conspiracies. That leaves the lagrange points between the center and our two extremes.

    <div class="md"><p>they don&#39;t. that critics etc of conspiracy theories believe that conspiracies don&#39;t exist is simply made up. it&#39;s like answering a critic to a conspiracy theory with the words &quot;so you do believe that government has never done anything wrong and only has the interest of the people in mind?&quot;. no one does that.</p>

<p>i, for one, believe that history is full of conspiracies but that doesn&#39;t lend credibility to a particular conspiracy theory. it still has to supported by facts and stand on its own merit.</p>

<p>I would argue that many of the folks on this subreddit are the ones living in a state of fear. They are constantly bombarding themselves with messages that They are out to get them and are working against your interests. &quot;They&quot; being whichever brand of conspiracy you prefer. The Government wants you dead! The Jews are Controlling Everything! Chemicals everywhere! </p>

<p>Another one that reflects back on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Rather than dealing with the true that the world is a chaotic random place filled with people who are incompetent rather than malicious, theorists come up with their own well ordered world. In this world everything is controlled and part of a plan. And in this planned world it is perfectly okay to threaten people who have had their kids murdered and harass them because, Well, they are part of the evil plan right?</p>

<p>People are great at decieving themselves, and once they have seized an idea, people really don&#39;t want to let it go and will go to any lengths to defend it. </p>

<p>All proven conspiracies had to have at least one person (conspiracy theorist) investigating for the conspiracies to ever come to light. Someone had to request that first FOIA. Someone had to ask that first question to get congress to investigate. Conspiracies don&#39;t just reveal themselves.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Pretty close. Any disruptive comments and conspiratards should be downvoted. If this community isn&#39;t already overrun by conspiratards, then this approach should be sufficient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and watch how every other comment turns into an attack or insults?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A moderator can warn a user for the comment. No need to delete the comment. If the commenter persists, ban. But this way the entire process can be seen. Not as much ability for abuse to occur.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There really is no happy middle ground here. If something is deemed inappropriate by a mod or two in this case, why can they not remove it? 
Because the comment&#39;s removal is unnecessary and opens room for abuse.</p>

<p>This is their sub, maybe you can make your own and run it as you choose, and see why things need to be removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I can see that dissenting opinions are not welcomed here. Yet another reason why I am against the censorship occurring. So why not leave? Because this is a huge hub for free-thinkers and I would like to converse with those people. While at the same time I do disagree with the moderation tactics and will speak out about them.</p>

<p>Is Reddit a private company?</p>

<p>If you answered &#39;no&#39; to either of these questions, it&#39;s time to do the research and get off of reddit for a minute.</p>

i dont get that. i want the truth. theres shills and socks and AstroTurfers on both sides.</p>

<p>here they make you look like morons, and on conspiritard they name-call and..well generally act trollish.</p>

<p>Doesnt matter people on the god damn 9/11 commision said there is a cover up and they were mislead.  </p>

<p>Another productive exchange to have there is the murder of Anwar Al-Alwaki.  They dont care he wasnt charged.  Who cares he never gave money to terrorist groups. He got on YouTube and said to kill foreign troops in Muslim lands. Kill him and his family and everyone around him.  If thats the bar there are a lot of people who post on Infowars.com forums that should watch the fuck out.  </p>

<p>I also think there is a circle jerk / troll thing going on.  None of them admit to it, and are appalled by the idea it could be a circle jerk.</p>

<p>Bottom line is they are hateful weirdos that some how think the satus quo is the winning team.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im convinced planes brought down the towers. its simply unfeasible to do a controlled demo AFTER running planes into the towers, too much work with no one seeing it, to many mouths to shut, too much that can go wrong. WTC7 had gold that&#39;s now conveniently missing as well as you know a giant diesel tank in it. it didn&#39;t need explosives, just let the fucker burn and expose metal. its own weight brought it down. no one had to blow up anything, just light a few fires, expose some metal.</p>

<p>what concerns me is that the israli goverment by far had the most to gain from this. im not racist. my family is Jewish, but the Israeli goverment is the most twisted corrupt war mongering monsters this planet has ever seen. who goes &quot;this will be good for us&quot; after a disaster like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i know, which is funny cause my family is largely Jewish. im not anti Israeli, im anti Israeli policy. The whole mess that they purposely perpetuate over there is sickening. and just cause i say i don&#39;t like Israeli policy makes me racist in the eyes of my own family. but if it was the Germans bullying their neighbor countries and inciting unrest in the surrounding area there would be a public outcry.</p>

<p>but the Israeli goverment gets away with it all cause they hold the holly land and i would not be surprised if they had a couple of card up their sleeves. i know for a fact that stares me in the face on a daily basis that the Freemasons and the Templar, Eastern stars, illuminati are real. misinterpreted, but real. how did i find out?</p>

<p>I found that my grandmother and mother are order of the eastern star which you can only be if you are married to a Freemason. so, ive come to the conclusion that my stepfather/father and grandfather are in the Freemasons. I was oblivious until i started digging. I don&#39;t know a lot but im willing to say what i know if you guys want. im not claiming to know any super secret shenanigans or inner workings. but i can say what ive been around and what ive seen. no bs. no theatrics. just the facts jack. would conspiracy like this?</p>

<p>as for proof. that will be slightly difficult but give me time and ill get proof. this isnt easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reasons why Israeli are implicated is because we&#39;ve got evidence of at least foreknowledge and they never told the US. In fact, Israeli agents were in New York on and before 9/11, took pictures celebrating the burning twin towers which is absolutely confirmed by the FBI developing the camera and multiple eyewitnesses, worked at a fake company where they made statements about &quot;taking over US media in 20 years and destroying the country&quot;, being caught lying multiple times under polygraph tests, linked to the hijackers directly through the fake company and a shit load more incredibly sketchy behaviour that doesn&#39;t add up to them just being illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>The FBI (which is shown in the documents) were told to stop the investigation from higher up and to hand them over to immigration. Conspiracy theorist or not, once you&#39;ve read and understood the documents in there entirely, you cannot reason why they were let go and wonder who thought it was a good idea to cease the investigation.</p>

<p>You can find that information contained in the official FBI report which was obtained in 2011 here.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about you -or discrediting an entire sub. </p>

<p>The above sentence sounds like Fox News complaining about John Stewart.  <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a> does not exist to undermine anyone, it exists to mock the ridiculous... which conspiracy theories attract like flies to honey.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about having the emotional detachment to analyze the information presented &amp; make fun of the holes in logic.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect a rational response (seeing as the hatred for &#39;those that shall not be named&#39; is palpable).  In all honesty, I expect to be banned and used as &#39;proof&#39; that <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a> is purposefully coming to this sub and exists solely to undermine it.</p>

<p>I feel that this last edit speaks volumes to how much personal interaction this sub chooses to have with &quot;those that shall not be named&quot; as well as the overall tone of discourse when it comes to people and respectfully finding things out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I have never met a single person</strong> that speaks/acts like the people over at the sub that shall not be named...</p>

<p>Maybe you should go out and meet more people, instead of pointing fingers and complaining... just my two cents</p>

<li><p>The sub isn&#39;t there to discredit you . I believe there is one <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post on the front page</p></li>
<li><p>Just because there has been other conspiracies doesn&#39;t mean that everything is a conspiracy. The people on thesubthatcantbenamed base their views and opinions on <strong>substantial</strong>  evidence. </p></li>
<li><p>Use Common Sense</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Lets take a popular conspiracy..that Sandy Hook was a false flag to get tougher gun control. The first thing that you would assume is that it is a false flag since the government is taking away your guns. Through that we assume that either Adam Lanza was a CIA plant or that the whole thing was fixed. You then get other assumptions like the town was in on it,there was crisis actors,etc. The reason why people think alot of the conspiracies are ridiculous is because they are based in assumption. &quot;But villainousyeti didn&#39;t you see the initial discrepancies.&quot; Yes when there is a chaotic event and a bunch of news stations are all fighting to report stuff first,they will report what they can..so early information is usually false. We also go back to point 2. To make conclusions you need substantial evidence. </p>

<p>Heres an example, Your going to the bathroom and you hear a crash. After doing your buissness you walk into your kitchen and see a glass of milk spilled. You notice your cat on the floor...you also look outside your window and see your neighbor walking his dog. Its safe to assume that your cat knocked  over the milk. However a conspiracy theorist would look and see that their back door was open..and while its a stretch their neighbor could have ran in your house in the time it took to get out of the bathroom,and knocked over the glass and left...and we know the neighbor..hes not perfect and has done some unethical behavior in the past. It was probably the neighbor..Lets look for why else it could have been him...didn&#39;t he get pissed at me at the bbq last year...etc.</p>

<p>Finally Use common sense. Put yourself into the shoes of the conspirator and just think about it. One of my favorite clips relating to the 9/11 conspiracy is in this episode of <a href="http://youtu.be/XjrZj3GXjoA?t=46s">southpark.</a> Do you see how ridiculous these things sound when you go through all the points and actual steps and think about them individually? Regardless if you believe the government is run by elected officials or the world&#39;s elite I think we can all agree that they are mostly intelligent people. What would be easier,doing the plot listed above or have fake attacks on embassies and military bases...I mean the government could probably use that as an excuse for war. Think about Sandy Hook too..Why would our government plan out this whole plot...you don&#39;t have to be the most creative person in the world to be able to come up with an easier plot to get gun control...<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/background-checks-bill_n_3103341.html">Regardless the powerful government couldn&#39;t even get it done with a successful false flag...And according to surveys it was supported by 90% of Americans.</a></p>

<p>This is why they can&#39;t take you guys seriously.</p>

<p>Thats because you all stick your fingers in your ears and have preconceived notions.  There is a lot of good solid evidence and testimony that what brought down the 2 towers was NOT just plane impacts .. solid evidence, not conjecture.</p>

Fully capable of looking to history, and seeing that while the names change...well, that is the only thing that does change.  You cheer your own demise while the world crashes down around you.

<p>Well gee guy, my posts are up voted more in this thread. Surely <strong>I</strong> must be right then. </p>

<p>You are going to need to work on your reading comprehension, especially to deal with the shills. I never said they don&#39;t exist. Only that not everyone that disagrees with you is a shill. </p>

<p>Most importantly I don&#39;t think you realize how much of a target your posting is do your clearly unstable nature.

<p>We do not guess when labeling someone a shill.  It&#39;s far too easy to do it correctly, with valid evidence that the reader can review and decide for themselves.  As the site has been discussing for quite some time, the truth is self evident, and will speak for itself.  Shills however cannot offer valid facts to support their lies.  If someone is incorrectly labeled a shill, their very next post will wither prove or not prove the validity of their posts.</p>

<p>Ok - so I&#39;m glad we agree that people should not be banned for sharing their thoughts because it&#39;s better that everyone be able to read <em>everything</em>. Except here you are supporting a rule that allows you to ban anyone that <strong>you</strong> think is a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, can you even read what the people on conspiratard post? Because it&#39;s just as dumb as the dumbest stuff in here.</p>

<p>If your mind was strong you wouldn&#39;t need to come up with theories to explain the behaviors of others. You&#39;d be able to analyze their arguments and understand why they believe what they do. But instead of doing that you always jump to the most extreme possibility of <em>why</em> - them being a shill.</p>

<p>Also your inability to actually empathize with people that don&#39;t agree with you (as evidenced in your previous conversation with me) would lead you to believe that they are actually paid to sit there and disagree with you. It&#39;s so insane and so far from the most reasonable assumption (that they are people that, programmed or otherwise, don&#39;t agree with you and are proud to talk about it. Just like you are proud to call <strong>me</strong> a liar).</p>

<p>So it&#39;s incredibly ironic that you see the mirror image of yourself and think it must be a falsehood. No, they are people with similar levels of conviction, just different beliefs. </p>
