<p>What I&#39;m asking about is if there are any conspiracy theories -- that spent a long time as fleshed-out conspiracy <em>theories</em> before being corroborated by irrefutable evidence that they were indeed true (as in mainstream acceptance)?</p>

<p>I know there are some, like the JFK assassination or increasingly the questions around 9/11, that many conspiracy theorists believe to be settled... but they&#39;re still not widely accepted by the historian/journalistic/academic community (whether that&#39;s fair isn&#39;t the question I&#39;m asking).</p>

<p>Are there any now-known conspiracies that became uncovered as a result of the theorizing and research of independent investigators (e.g. people like those who subscribe to this subreddit) eventually becoming corroborated and settled as fact?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. It was used as the main justification to go into IRAQ. I can find people who still, to this day, will argue that Saddam probably had WMD&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. What&#39;s your point?</p>

<p>&quot;Operation Mockingbird, as it was called, was exposed in 1975 during the Church Committee investigation, which then published its findings the following year.  The full name of the committee which investigated and uncovered such activities was called, “The United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities” which was chaired by Senator Frank Church&quot;</p>

<p>If you are still confused I&#39;d suggest looking at the sidebar and reading the definitions of conspiracy and theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who investigates a conspiracy is a conspiracy theorist. At some point they would be required to &quot;Theorize&quot; about a &quot;Conspiracy&quot;. Even if that individual is an &quot;Investigative Journalist&quot; they would still fit the definition of a conspiracy theorist. That would also include an investigative panel designed to uncover wrongdoings by the government.</p>

<p>The Operation Mockingbird conspiracy was &quot;UNCOVERED&quot; by an investigative panel. It wasn&#39;t discovered due to government disclosure. Therefore it was discovered by people who had to theorize that a conspiracy was afoot.</p>

<p>I get that you don&#39;t like pop (and neither do I really), but it&#39;s definitely a stretch to say it&#39;s trying to control us (and that not all mainstream music even involves the themes you mentioned i.e. electronic subgenres, rock subgenres). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>have you read any ingredients on the food you eat and researched them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I have, and although most processed food are full of artificial chemicals and stuff, that in no way is true across the board with other foods (i.e. fruits, vegetables, bread, etc...)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Now i&#39;m getting kinda confused, and it seems like you&#39;re rambling (no offense). Can you show me this Jesus story (without referring to any abrahamaic religion)? Not to mention that yes, we know that dinosaurs lived, and millions of years ago at that. I don&#39;t really know what this has to do with religion, unless you&#39;re criticizing young earth creationism.</p>

<p>Finally, much of this is also not really a conspiracy. Processed foods aren&#39;t that healthy, but that&#39;s not a conspiracy. Music might be not as good as in the past, but it&#39;s certainly not controlling our minds. As I said before the bible one was just kinda confusing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the charity. If you donate to red cross/red crescent for example, the money goes directly to aiding people affected. Some charities are admittedly not that great (Susan G. Kommen gives a small amount of the money for example) but that in no way mean that <em>all</em> charities are bad, as many are actually really helpful (i.e. Kiva loans, Red cross, doctors without borders, amnesty internation, etc...). It&#39;s also not really a conspiracy anyways, more of a criticism of certain charities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UFO&#39;s are actually really interesting, as I have mixe feelings about them. Overal, I think it&#39;s probable there is some other life in the universe. However, whether it&#39;s actually taken the time to visit here is more questionable. Not to mention that things like Area 51, and quite a few alien encounters (most notably hopskinville goblin has a hilarious explanation). Many UFO sightings can often be explained (although not necessarily all of them, you do have a point there). Either way, I&#39;m also not sure about said conspiracy, or the provability of UFO&#39;s and aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s so bad about ACA, since it means you will finally catch up to the rest of the developed world in terms of universal healthcare. Fukushima is becoming more and more sensationalized by the minute. and it still pales compared to Chernobyl although it was still pretty bad (still the 2nd worst nuclear plant disaster ever). There is also not really a conspiracy for either, or at minimum, not one that&#39;s been even remotely proven. The Lusitania is well known to have been torpedoed by a U-boat (we even know what boat it was). You have to be a lot more specific about pearl harbor (not to mention that again it&#39;s still not proven true anyways). Same thing with the bailout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not really an answer. If anything the US is too lenient when it comes to guns (although banning them would be stupid and impossible), and I honestly can&#39;t see a reason why background checks, closing loopholes and other such measures would be detrimental. Also, if you looked at some of the suff currently going on in US science you&#39;d be impressed.

<p>that was proven true by the mainstream press, not conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Did the press theorize the conspiracy? Yes. The press questioned the validity to the claims of WMDs. Then the press investigated and proved one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve provided you with an example that fits what you asked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Examples where a group of investigators, skeptics, amateur sleuths, etc.  formed a coherent conspiracy theory and it ended up that their theory was right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Investigators (journalists) formed a coherent conspiracy theory (WMDs are a lie) and it ended up their theory was right.</p>

<p>You&#39;re now changing what you want to be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a theory that was hashed out by a collection of individuals <em>and was viewed by their contemporaries in the mainstream as nonsense,</em> but was later proven to actually have been accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you keep specifying and restricting the response allowed you have the ability to allow for no response to be acceptable to your premise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the charity. If you donate to red cross/red crescent for example, the money goes directly to aiding people affected. Some charities are admittedly not that great (Susan G. Kommen gives a small amount of the money for example) but that in no way mean that <em>all</em> charities are bad, as many are actually really helpful (i.e. Kiva loans, Red cross, doctors without borders, amnesty internation, etc...). It&#39;s also not really a conspiracy anyways, more of a criticism of certain charities.</p>
