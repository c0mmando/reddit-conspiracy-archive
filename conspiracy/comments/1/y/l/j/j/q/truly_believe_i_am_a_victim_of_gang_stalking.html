<p>Maybe there is also something in my ear....? Woke up one day and it was sore. Felt strange like water in it but couldn&#39;t get it out.</p>

<p>Could really use some support and advice. Pretty sure they have been doing things through my internet and watching me through my ipad.</p>

<p>Hear honking outside frequently and barely audible voices. My apartment has fairly thin walls.</p>

<p>Pretty sure they were talking subliminally through my speakers as well.</p>

<p>I had an interaction with a gang when I was backpacking on the other side of the country.
I left 2 days later and was scared shitless, it felt like the entire greyhound bus ride home there were members of the gang or something and people were fucking with me.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve begun missing clothes and sometimes things are in strange places that seem off.</p>

<p>Do you have any family history with mental illness? Did you have a very active imagination when you were young?  More so than your peers?  Are you currently on any type or medication other than cannabis?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a great idea.  The best in the thread.  One in which you can determine if it&#39;s internal or external.  Do you have anywhere can go to drop off the grid for a few weeks?  Somewhere without your cell phone, or with it in a Farraday cage, and not being near your car or a transportation item that could be tracked (ex. Bicycle)?  A place where literally no one would know where you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going two come at this from two different angles so bear with me.</p>

<p>The fact that you say it gets worse when you smoke weed leads me to believe that what you are experiencing is psychosomatic. That it&#39;s all in your head. Acute paranoia can do very strange things. Your not crazy so don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s all going to work out. I would suggest refraining from using electronics and anything else that you associate with being gang stalked. Take a break, do something you really enjoy, something good for yourself. Take some time to remove the idea from your head then come back and take an objective look at the situation.</p>

<p>Now for the second angle.</p>

<p>Gangstalking is a tactic used by the CIA and the like. It&#39;s associated with project MK Ultra  and mind control programming. They will use subliminal messaging to get ideas into people&#39;s heads and make them do what they want. The navy yard shooter was gang stalked before being programmed to shoot those people. If after taking an objective look at your situation you still feel that you are being gang stalked by the control system then I would avoid all electronics like the plague. Minimize cell phone, internet, TV, and speaker use. Then I would become very familiar with yourself. Learn how to meditate and do it frequently. Really get a grasp of what thoughts are your own and which thoughts may not be. Dig roots into your own stream of thought so deep that they could never be uprooted. Tell some of your friends about what has been happening, get them involved. Finally, quit smoking weed or doing anything that will alter your state of consciousness, at least until this has passed. If you are weak and controllable they will target you, if you are strong and firmly rooted then they will move on. </p>

<p>Oh and don&#39;t worry about people who call you crazy. You cannot suppress what you are experiencing just because it sounds &quot;out there&quot;. Some may even call me &quot;crazy&quot; for posting this. Fuck those people. There&#39;s no such thing as &quot;crazy&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe &quot;they&quot; are using weed to gain &quot;access&quot; to more individuals. </p>

<p>Stop smoking weed. Detox any medications from your body, unless absolutely completely necessary, like insulin. (I&#39;m off even caffeine and allergy meds. There&#39;s natural remedies, along with cleaning more often and building your own immunity. Local honey does miracles.) Have a doctor look at your ear, but don&#39;t mention the other shit. Set up cameras in your house that backup to a remote cloud, or research means of &quot;booby trapping&quot; your doors that can&#39;t be replicated. Take pictures with a camera that doesn&#39;t have wifi or data access. </p>

<p>As for the voices part, read the religious texts of your choosing. Pick whatever spiritual path that brings you to the God of your understanding, then build your spiritual armor. I know it sounds terrifying that they might be hacking your body, but they can&#39;t control or possess your soul. Your soul is yours and belongs to God, even if you&#39;ve &quot;sold it&quot;. </p>

<p>The whole diagnostic system of determining mental illness is based on the techniques they have used in the past to defame the people sensitive enough to detect these techniques. Look at religious history, it&#39;s full of ACTUAL martyrs. (I&#39;m not talking about egotistical prophets that have started their own sects, I&#39;m talking about the people that recognized the spiritual battle and were labeled as &quot;nuts&quot; for calling the demons the demons that they are!) </p>

<p>Don&#39;t lose faith in yourself or your higher power. Get your soul clean and stop any activity that you are ashamed or feel guilty about. If there&#39;s nothing to drive you to be afraid of your own actions, then they lose all power.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting. What leads you to believe that?? Not saying your wrong, I&#39;m just curious. It&#39;s entirely plausible. I just thought marijuana, when smoked by a healthy brain, opened you up to your higher self, not distanced you. I know LSD has been sketchy ever since the CIA commandeered the entire SANDOZ stock in the 60&#39;s. What about your take on psilocybin? Obviously tripping when your already paranoid is a terrible idea but it&#39;s always been my view that taking mushrooms in a safe environment can establish a lasting bond between you and your higher self.</p>

I am not seeking a higher version of self, I&#39;m seeking the influence of the Holy Spirit into my soul.

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhh ok I see where your coming from now. I&#39;m forced to disagree simply because I&#39;ve had experiences while meditating and later while on &quot;drugs&quot; such as psilocybin and dimethyltryptamine that put me in touch with &quot;god&quot; it is me and I am it. I believe that we are all aspects of the same light refracted through a filter (perception). There is no god outside of ourselves. This is just MY belief though, I don&#39;t necessarily want you to believe the same, my only wish is that the path you&#39;ve  chosen brings you fulfillment. :)</p>
