    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;show me the evidence&quot; .... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most don&#39;t understand that they don&#39;t really mean that when they ask that question, however, as all one has to do to realize that there <em>is</em> already in fact substantial evidence that there exists a consortium of power that is actually <em>very</em> much above governments, and corporations, and above the laws even is simply study and investigate things like The Franklin Scandal and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asvl6kO1Vo8">Conspiracy of Silence</a> documentary that was made about it where it&#39;s shown that there are powers on this planet that can get caught pretty much red handed raping and killing children and yet <em>still</em> get away with it.</p>

<p>What kind of power can do that?  What kind of power has the ability and the strength and influence to get away with actually <em>getting caught</em> doing the very thing that most people consider amongst the absolute <em>worst</em> kinds of crimes on the planet?  A mind that considers itself a real, critically-thinking mind has to ask itself things like that if they have any hope of getting closer to the truth of what might be going on in this planet.  Otherwise, you&#39;re just kind of skimming around on the surface of things.  All this is to say that what the question you asked tends to really mean is &quot;Show me the evidence that I can <em>believe</em> and that makes sense to me from the context of the limited world view that I&#39;ve been indoctrinated to believe is the only way to look at things in this world.&quot;</p>

<p>Another characteristic of surface skimmers is that they expect the evidence relating to certain matters to be handed to them in big, huge, droves of obvious, universally accepted, &quot;scientifically backed&quot; (lol) information that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; (lol) and likely endorsed by whatever mainstream channel they spend their time watching and listening to.</p>

<p>The real truth of things on this planet doesn&#39;t often come that easy, however, and one usually has to dig a bit deeper and often read between the lines of the obvious and actually do one&#39;s <em>own</em> work in order to get at the deeper truth that&#39;s involved in things.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This could not be more true. Most people are fairly reasonable, the problem is; they don&#39;t want to hear the truth from you. They would rather find out for themselves which of course requires time and energy. It&#39;s kind of a mixture of laziness/willful ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very correct indeed, sir.  It&#39;s also very difficult for many like the previous poster to be able to differentiate what is valid from what is not because, on this planet, we all grow up pretty much entirely influenced literally from birth to regard only as valid that which the establishment condones and christens as such.  Our parents grew up brainwashed, and end up passing that same indoctrination to us, their children.  The problem with this is that, for the most part, we love our parents, and have an emotional attachment to them and much of the deeper things they taught us.  A good portion of this assimilation is subconscious, so we&#39;re not even aware of just how emotionally and psychologically tied we are to certain world views and perspectives - wrong and indoctrinated as they may be.</p>

<p>What ends up happening is that whenever we come across information like the stuff I linked to, we find not only our long-held beliefs and indoctrination greatly challenged, but we also, on an emotional level, find the attachment that we have to the things our parents and loved ones taught us as being directly challenged as well.  In that manner, it becomes EXTREMELY difficult to let go of some of our long held beliefs even if we find that they are wrong or even <em>bad</em> for us because, in letting go of and rejecting those beliefs, we often associate such a thing with letting go of and rejecting the family foundation that reared us.  Accepting certain perspectives, even if they&#39;re true, might be tantamount to rejecting our indoctrination and, thereby, rejecting our family, our upbringing, and at times almost rejecting our very identity.  This is something most of us are simply not willing or prepared to do.  It&#39;s pretty complicated psychoanalytical manipulation that is going on here and that is often time responsible for our being unwilling to even consider alternative points of view that might challenge or be different from what we grew up listening to from the establishment and, often time, from our very own family core.</p>

<p>The powers that be - whoever, whatever they are - are very smart.  They know what they&#39;re doing.  It is <em>very</em> difficult to break out of the matrix that they help perpetuate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had another thought on this which is that this is probably why the people at the <em>very</em> top usually appear to be mystics. </p>

<p>They do not deal with &quot;micro&quot; situations as you or I, which call for the application of evidence, reason, and personal action. </p>

<p>Power has to deal with hopelessly incomplete and inaccurate data, that has been massaged by their reporting hierarchy according to the interests of each man who had a chance to touch the data along the way. They also rule on a mandate that is intrinsically contradictory: the people are too stupid to know what they want, so I must decide for them. And yet, it is the consent of these people by which I claim my mandate to rule.</p>

<p>A man like Barack Obama does not wield power, he simply advocates what he is told to advocate, and signs everything that comes across his desk. </p>

<p>But the power backing him is different. In order to avoid the problems of bad intelligence and illegitimate power, they simply reject reason and turn to mysticism. People will readily accept such rule after a systematic disintegration of their own culture and language. When the people&#39;s ability to think has been frustrated enough, then such power can sweep in uncontested. </p>

<p>I expect we will see the rise of the Vatican in coming years, although it will probably be backed by the same lizard people or whoever it is today.</p>

<p>People like Snowden, Hudes, Assange etc are their achilles heel.</p>

The Roman empire turned into the Vatican, the Vatican into the different Reichs, and now into neo-conservatism/nazism/fascism/zionism (whatever you wanna call it). Remember, Hitler was condoned by the Church.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that this is a pretty large chunk of it yeah, but it&#39;s been my understanding that the groups at the very top don&#39;t even have names. Everyone under them will have been compartmentalized to know only what they need to carry out their duty. A person on the Council of 13 could tell you alot, all he knows, and it still wouldn&#39;t be everything. I&#39;ve also read that all &quot;13&quot; or in this case 15 families are basically of the same blood. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I am most certain of, at least pertaining to the global hierarchy of power, is of the <em>Council of 13</em> being either at or near the top. It is possible there is Council or Circle of 12, and a Council of 5 and/or 9 with jurisdiction over the others, but that has yet to be confirmed. </p>

<p>The groups that make up the Council of 13, 33, Kahila, Old Black Nobility, Commitee of 300, World Supreme Council, highest degrees of the Grand Orient and Chapter 322 would be what most refer to now as the <em>Illuminati</em>. Though, at this point in time they more often refer to themselves collectively as <em>Moriah Conquering Wind</em>, or simply <em>The Group</em> or <em>Council</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I believe the Jesuits are.
The Catholic Church is the single most powerful organization in the entire world and has been ever since it was founded.
Kings, presidents, rulers of this earth bow to the Pope, who acts as God on behalf of the Catholic Church.
I do not remember the amount of people who have died on behalf of the Catholic Church, but if I recall correctly it is around 30 million. More than likely more than that.</p>

<p>However, one should be aware that with every pyramid there is a top, of course, but there is also a secret chamber underneath.
I think that is where the real mystery is at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right.
Honestly, I don&#39;t know. It was just an assessment.
Who is at the top very well could be beyond my comprehension, or maybe it isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>I am going to do some research on the grand council of 13, though.
Hopefully that will lead me to some interesting studies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think <em>who</em> is nearly an important a question as <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> they have placed themselves at the top.  I believe the entity at the top, above the names you do know, have its heart, a desire to aid our spiritual evolution as a species.  They use the Rosthchilds/other families to rule us the rest of humanity forever stoking war, oppression, economic slavery, dependence on monopolies by keeping our own scientific discoveries from us and promoting religion which will ever keep humanity from the truth we seek.  Why would the ruling families help the entities above them?  They have made a deal long ago and it rests on this basic principle:  you may reach spiritual evolution in our reality through polarization either to one&#39;s self or to the other self.  The ruling families are merely pursuing the service to self path.  They believe they are providing a service to us all through negative catalyst which are both obvious and hidden in order that we all may use those catalysts to choose a polarization.  We need to take the catalysts in our life with gratitude and use them to pursue  our chosen polarity.  Hint: It is far easier to achieve positive polarity than negative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. I thought the entities at the top had a more suppressive agenda in mind but the polarities you speak of do make a lot of since. I&#39;m just having hard time wrapping my head around it. Are you saying that they are trying to encourage spiritual evolution by making it obvious what is positive and what is negative so that we can choose our desired path with more lucidity??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the answer for sure, but I&#39;m pretty sure it doesn&#39;t matter if the entity/entities at the top are trying to dominate us or help us.   They may very well be negatively polarized entities who truly believe they are helping humanity by accelerating our spiritual evolution; pitting us against each other using the ruling families and oligarchies as middlemen.   I don&#39;t blame our rulers for their path, they are just testing out the experiment of creation in devotion to the self.  What matters is what we do with our creation.  The worst you can do is remain lukewarm.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the &quot;rulers&quot; know not what they do. You certainly shouldn&#39;t hate them for it. I think there may be more than one race of these entities. Some malevolent others not. Currently it seems that the malevolent ones are in control. I think our spiritual evolution/enlightenment is the last thing the ruling entities want.</p>
