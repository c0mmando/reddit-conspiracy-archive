    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone should do this, it&#39;s just my best idea
Let go of the idea of free will so that people can stop trying to teach eachother lessons via punishment and stop judging eachother via personal accomplishment.</p>

<p>Basically give the entire human race a case of the feels, or really close to chronic depression so that we can slow down population growth and increase introspection and personal development in time for automation since jobs will disappear whether we like it or not, just go to r/singularity.</p>

<p>Like a bent reed it will not break.</p>

<p>When under cover agents come to stir shit up the whole point will be to increase dulldrums while encouraging everyone to find a way to stop punishing eachother and ESPECIALLY themselves...</p>

<p>And to admit that this movement isn&#39;t even a great human achievement itself, just a a response to the limitations on resources, and, like a body in the cold, shutting down external functions to keep internal organs alive at the expense of loosing limbs each person will slow down external energy waste in order to save their internal value.</p>

<p>So, basically what Occupy Wall Street was originally, alternate living in the sense of living without competing for resources, just requesting that we have every right to live wether we can &quot;work&quot; or not since standing around doing nothing is exactly what security guards do and they get paid. I&#39;m sure there will be plenty of opportunities to swet and there will be plenty of people who come to tell the occupier that they are snobs for thinking they are too good to get jobs and the occupiers will just say that opting out isn&#39;t for anyone and it&#39;s only really for people who have no other healthy option.</p>

<p>Amid more and more people will only have the option of working an unhealthy job or starving to death. And I&#39;m sure that starving to death is the last alternative in a country like the USA unless some one chooses to hunger strike.</p>

<p>And then to spread out the Occupation so that it is as harmless and transparent as possible to prevent a Waco. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone should do this, it&#39;s just my best idea</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occupy was diluted, the idea behind occupy was there is a pattern to popular radical movements: Resist, OCCUPY and produce. Resist the economic system and income disparity, occupy Wall Street (prevent it from working as intended by the ruling class) and produce a change for the betterment of the proletariat.</p>

<p>They were prevented from the occupation of Wall Street by the security forces of the state, whom are financed by the rich and puppeted by their interests. </p>

<p><strong>After successfully occupying</strong> a position of power and denying it to your enemy you must produce the outcome you want. Resistance of the enemies desires is not enough, but occupy did not move forward from the occupation of the camp. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you could demand our government fix ONE thing going forward</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hue, that won&#39;t work. Occupy the means/mode of production and deny it to the rich fucks. Produce an alternate economic system that assures social and economic mobility to the proletariat and brings justice to the rich who exploited them for so long. </p>

<p>The government is not interested in helping Occupy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get rid of socialism/communism (collectivism)... oh wait, occupy is preaching collectivism lol. That movement is finished, totally discredited. Democracy aka mob rule is a very very bad thing in the long run, that&#39;s why the US is a republic and not a democracy. People are too uninformed and easy to  manipulate and Occupy has been a nice demonstration of that. Nothing good is going to come out of a socialist revolution.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sticking with the Ron Paul relovution</p>

<p>Occupy <em>couldn&#39;t</em> help him win because Ron Paul didn&#39;t win the Republican nomination. Ron Paul didn&#39;t run as an independent candidate despite not receiving the republican nomination. That&#39;s why it&#39;s obvious that he is a stooge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occupy started before he dropped out. It could have been all he needed to win the nomination as the Ron Paul relovution was getting pretty strong. Instead occupy basically was telling protesters voting was pointless and to not vote or remained neutral thus dividing the protesters. If Occupy had supported Ron Paul he would most likely have won the nomination and Obama would have debated him instead of Romney. Ron Paul would most likely have won the presidency then. We are the 99% after all no? But Ron Paul represents the complete opposite of communism so i guess that&#39;s why occupiers didn&#39;t like him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occupy started before he dropped out. It could have been all he needed to win the nomination as the Ron Paul relovution was getting pretty strong. Instead occupy basically was telling protesters voting was pointless and to not vote or remained neutral thus dividing the protesters. If Occupy had supported Ron Paul he would most likely have won the nomination and Obama would have debated him instead of Romney. Ron Paul would most likely have won the presidency then. We are the 99% after all no? But Ron Paul represents the complete opposite of communism so i guess that&#39;s why occupiers didn&#39;t like him.</p>
