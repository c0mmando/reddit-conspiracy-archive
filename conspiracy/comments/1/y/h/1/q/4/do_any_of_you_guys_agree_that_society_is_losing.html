       Society is losing its morality because humans are pack animals. The 'sheep' follow whatever example they are given. Currently the examples are of narcissistic greedy materialistic sociopaths. The only thing keeping society from deteriorating into the same state as our leaders is entertainment. Movies still offer a degree of reinforcement for the concept that there is right and wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going more socially conservative only seems appealing in that there tend to be more overt 'rules' and a shaming process for those who break the rules. So to an extent they have 'mechanisms' in there to manage the sociopaths that rise to the top. But even that has its limitations... look at Dick Cheney the 'conservatives' supported that guy and he's as bad as they come in terms of being a sociopath (the wars lined his and Halliburton's pockets).
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple reality is that until, as a society, we consider it unacceptable for sociopaths to be in positions of power, nothing is going to change.

       We have always been ruled by sociopaths/psychopaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       History tells a tale of vast destruction because of them but that does not mean that this can't be changed in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple act of labeling sociopaths in power will reduce their negative  impact, reduce the number and influence  of the most aggressive in power  and  thereby reduce the harm they cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       If power driven psychosis was met with mass  rejection we could all have better lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a visible effort now in this direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It represents the only hope for the future.

       I disagree, women deserve equality not to be treated like chattel to be owned by a man. Homosexuals do not deserve to be shoved in a closet merely for the comfort of homophobes. Visible minorities should not be oppressed with political disenfrachisement or social exclusion. Youth can have reasonable political opinions and may in fact be more politically aware than some adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socially conservative views are an anethema to progress because they're reactionary to change. Change isn't always good but socially conservative vews make me sick. "Marriage is between a man and a woman" is wrong, in the eyes of God you may love someone and be loved if you so believe in God (or love). Women can do anything a man can do, and I mean economic production you tightwads. Black people are not inherently primitive, Asians are not across the board greater at math or worse at driving and Aboriginal heritage deserves to be recognized and preserved. Children deserve more autonomy and self-determination.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may enact more socially conservative laws but as an anarchist I merely laugh at your attempts to tell me what you think I will do.

       Anarchism is the progress I speak of. We treated people equally before it was cool, agitated for social progress before it was normal, and we continue to do so around the world and here at home. I'm glad we agree on something.

Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will be from that moment without compass (direction), anxious for an ideal, but with out knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view, a manifestation which will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time"

       The problem is society has been ruled by religion for thousands of years and has been violent, oppressive and controlling.

       It makes no sense from a global perspective either, there are billions who don't give a shit nor have any knowledge about abrahamic monotheism. Still kind of interesting to read these things though, if not for 'truth' but for insight into the fears and prophecies of generations past.

       I also don't really think society is in moral decline. I believe economically and as far as power and wealth go we are fucked, but we our actually shaking off some of the shittier prejudices that have held over humans for so long. Crime is down, equality is slowly improving and minority rights are a thing now, when 50 years ago they were not.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes you think we are in decline, and why is it your business what others are up to?

       This sub seems an odd place to post it, but I'll bite.

       I guess it comes down to how you define words like 'morality' and 'conservative', but in general I've always found the very notion of conservatism faintly absurd. The clue's in the title - to conserve, to keep things the same, to prevent change. It just doesn't work like that, you can't go around unringing all these bells. I mean, you can revive old ideas, fashions come and go in cycles etc., but you can't just 'go back'. What you can do - what a lot people desperately want to do - is force people to
       <em>
        pretend
       </em>
       they've gone back.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if a guy snaps, abducts his ex-wife and their child, then makes everyone sit down to have dinner as a family. It's just like it used to be - same house, same table, same food. The guy's just trying to conserve his family, what's wrong with that? Answer being, obviously, the gun on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       If social conservatives want to have even a tiny influence on the shape the future (and don't want that future to require squads of armed Morality Cops maintaining the fantasy), they really have to pick a direction that isn't backwards. Separate the virtues of the philosophy from the history of the philosophy, and employ those virtues in the creation of something
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       . (At which point, of course, you stop being conservatives.)

       You should try Russia for a couple years to test your theory. Very socially conservative, few regulations. Religion pretty much forced on people.

       If you really want to see if your way is better, try living in Russia for a few years. I'm not kidding.

       Russia is way too socially conservative for my taste. Society doesn't have to choose between cultural Marxism and Russia. There can be a balance and that's all I'm asking. Don't be tolerant of everything.

       The "morality" of a society if you could define such a thing would most likely be based on the net outcome of an idea called crime. So would crime go up in a "socially conservative" society? It only has room to go up, it can't go down unless it goes up from where it was, be it crime of the "offender" or "defender." Since "social conservative" is an extreme view in the paradigms applicable try and maintain what you call order you will find just the opposite. Not extreme as radical but extreme as in there is a direct opposition idealset that can be just as easily assumed. This idealset would also be extreme. Everything between the two extremes wouldn't be normal but it wouldn't be as extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion of holding a loosely defined constantly morphing definition in this way brings us to the crux of the problem. Somebody truly interested in the benefit of society would not reduce their "views" down to a category like our example, there would be no way you could do it with any precision or accuracy worth repeating. Society is constantly changing in great ways every day and it would take nothing short than what the most creative could conceive of "the eyes of god" to understand the magnitude of how ridiculously simplified we view this on a daily basis. These categories that are supposed to represent idealsets are different for many different places and change depending on the times and involvements/interests of those who assume, knowing that they should be used sparingly as no two separate groups even with the same distinction could fully define or explain in parallel, this type of "behavior" is a double edged sword but can be very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truly caring about society or how you put it its "morality" would entail a specific delicacy in the way one would view things. Specifically having a preconceived notion about something can only disappoint you, when you turn out to be right your just right big deal but being wrong isn't the same as "no big deal ur right." Even the disappointment would be different between the two. One
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be educated and not hold any preconceived beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all that crap out of the way how you perceive crime has a lot to do with it. If building scary engines or doing recreational drugs is a crime to a "socially conservative" person then they are in for a bad time. Too many people like to tinker with knowledge and/or do drugs, as a whole, to really achieve this with any "traditional" "conservative" methods.  But, the extreme opposition, if you don't care at all about these things your also in for a bad time. When not kept in check by social acceptability standards (which is basically 50 pages of more bullshit so just get a bit creative with that for arguments sake) people as a whole not only will but are willing in a kind of "born to do" way to push the boundaries of whatever is in front of them. Say hypothetically nobody gave a shit about drugs, it would be much harder for a parent to compromise with their neighbor about smoking pot on the back porch when her kids running around in the back yard. That compromise is where one who wishes to influence society should seek to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my eyes if you come up to me and say something like "im a &lt;insert political category&gt;" in my mind you are effectively saying you are going to or are actively trying to change the structure of society we currently live in to favor whatever that category stands for. An because of this I can't help but think most people don't actually understand their individual role in society. I find more often than not someone with an opinion of how something should be fail at understanding the most basic concepts of integration or mitigation.

       I had a funny friend one time, he kept arguing that cannabis should be completely legal and untaxed. I asked him if cannabis based businesses should be taxed, he said no. Kicker, he wanted to start a business growing and selling weed in colorado. Or an old friend who thinks all drugs should be even more illegal or something, reason? He thinks that harsh legalities is the way to deal with first time drug offenders so they don't waste time doing drugs wasting their life and their communities resources. Kicker, hes not an inexperienced "drug user."
      </p>
      <p>
       Those two views in operation would bring many problems and I think that most sensible people could see how. The only thing they have done is set themselves up for disappointment and helped each other be dicks to each other. Neither more right or wrong than you or me right now.
