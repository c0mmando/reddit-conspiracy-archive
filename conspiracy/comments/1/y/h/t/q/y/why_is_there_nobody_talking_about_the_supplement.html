    <div class="md"><p>Because everyone wants all the <a href="http://infowarsshop.3dcartstores.com/Super-Male-Vitality_p_1227.html">&quot;Super Male Vitality™&quot;</a> for themselves, duh <a href="http://www.infowars.com/the-war-on-men-10-ways-masculinity-is-under-attack/">;-)</a></p>

<p>For realz though, alternative medicine <strong>fund$</strong> alternative media.  Check the links, Alex Jones publishes articles about how masculinity is under attack and then sells products boosting testosterone.  PROBLEM REACTION $OLUTION, amirite?</p>

<ul>
<li>Super Male Vitality™ is designed to aid the body in ways that <a href="http://infowarsshop.3dcartstores.com/Super-Male-Vitality_p_1227.html">may</a> help to support normal testosterone levels in men.</li>

</ul>

<p>Spagyrex, derives from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spagyric">Spagyric</a> which sounds like an insulting name for a cross between an Italian and a Puerto Rican, but is actually &quot;a name given to the production of herbal medicines using alchemical procedures.  The final spagyric should be a re-blending of all such extracts into one &#39;essence.&#39; &quot;
&quot;In 1965, Malaclypse the Younger and Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spagyric#Spagyrics_in_practice">popularized the term</a> as a result of their joint seminal work <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Discordia">Principia Discordia.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The Principia Discordia is a Discordian religious text</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism">Discordianism</a> is a religion and subsequent philosophy based on the veneration or worship of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_%28mythology%29">Eris</a> (also known as Discordia), the Greco-Roman <strong>goddess of chaos,</strong> <em>or archetypes or ideals associated with her.</em></p>

<p>Alex Jones proclaims to be telling truth, selling medicine, but the whole enterprise is really about lie$ and chao$ because look where it always end$ up....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By that logic, there is also a conspiracy against contamination and unsafe food warehousing practices. A conspiracy to ruin the entire food industry by cunningly forcing them to destroy spoiled food, thereby driving up the cost of doing business!</p>

<p>Reading further, apparently there is also a conspiracy against humble pesticide manufacturers! The evil UN is trying to set international guidelines for safe maximum agrichemical use like a bunch of illuminati deathmongers! When will the tyranny end? What is next, manufacturing standards in Chinese exports robbing us of our lead and cleaning solvent additives?! Madness! Conspiracy!</p>

<p>Or maybe the supplement industry is up to some sincerely shady shit, and it has gotten to be a large enough part of the market for large agencies to take serious notice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That hasn&#39;t got anything to do with what I asked. The supplement industry has no regulatory body ensuring that manufacturers don&#39;t simply lie about their products.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m saying with enough funding, the regulation literally does absolutely nothing if they&#39;ve got the regulators in their pockets anyway. It might help a tiny bit. Regulation in a crony-capitalist setup is a joke. Indeed, it is a corporate conspiracy, but I think we&#39;ve got bigger fish to fry. Obviously, there are a lot of people on this sub, and I can&#39;t speak for many of them, but I don&#39;t think many people would disagree with you, and at the same time, it&#39;s not a pressing enough of an issue to garner much attention/support unless you&#39;re over in r/skeptic. If we&#39;re focusing on things that the government should be regulating, which seems kind of futile in the first place as we&#39;re talking about conspiracy buffs trusting the government to effectively regulate a market that is already swayed with billions in lobbying efforts, it&#39;s regulating the Wall St. fat cats. A much more dire and pressing issue than the unregulated supplement market, methinks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I was generalising. Could&#39;ve picked my words better. My point is, lobbying for the right to sell your snake oil is different than lobbying to have your snake oil prescribed to children, or lobbying to have your supplements &#39;unlabelled&#39; so that there&#39;s no way to tell if it&#39;s a proven medicine or not. One is about giving you more choice (even if the extra choice is a bunch of bollocks), the other is about giving you no choice, or hiding your choices from you.</p>

<p>As for manipulations and profiteering; if you find the story, go ahead and post it, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because you are completely wrong about everything you say.  &quot;Big Supplement&quot; actually contributes very little lobbying at all, [last year they contributed a little over 4 million]. (<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/alphalist_indus.php">https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/alphalist_indus.php</a>)  In fact, as I looked up individual contributions from companies in the list, only 1-3 appear to be directly linked to marketing supplements (Herbalife being the main one, contributing $720,000).  The others appear to be medical companies, watchdogs, and investment firms with supplement industry clients.  There is no mention of &quot;alternative medicine&quot; lobbying anywhere.</p>

<p>So are you trying to compare &quot;big supplement&quot; to the biggest lobbying force of them all, the Pharmaceutical industry?  A couple million compared to over 400 million (including manufacturing) a year?  Give me a break.</p>

<p>Supplements <em>should</em> be regulated by the FDA, yes, like in all industries there will be shitty businesses marketing shitty products.  But it is up to the FDA to regulate what is going into these products, and to test the products to meet standards.  It is the FDA&#39;s fault that aluminum-based preservatives and leavening agents linked to alzheimers have been deemed Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) along with a slew of other additives that have been inadequately tested.  Also, which companies do you really think are pushing for deregulation of food (also cosmetic) additives and the like? I&#39;ll tell you: it&#39;s the big food and bev contributors like Coca Cola, Kraft, Unilever that have been putting this shit in our food for years.</p>

<p>Since when has it become taboo to talk about what once was a universal, passed-down knowledge?  Our grandparents knew that red wine, cheese, herbs and oatmeal were good for you.  We researched it and now have resveratrol and calcium supplements, high cavacrol oregano oil, and fibre pills.  This is not &quot;alternative medicine&quot; it&#39;s common fucking sense.</p>

<p>Mercola and Oz are trusted because they generally give pretty basic advice adhering with accepted nutritional guidelines that everyone should know.  They also do some research and occasionally shit on the pharma/biotech/petrochemical/cosmetic and Big Food industries because   these industries fucking deserve it for the shit they pull and it&#39;s just so easy.</p>

<p>People shouldn&#39;t be deceived by &quot;panaceas&quot; and &quot;miracle elixirs&quot; because biology is complicated ( I&#39;m willing to make an exception for cannabis, that shit is miraculous), but if you&#39;re the type of person that can&#39;t figure out what a banana is good for nor figure out what a doctor is good for, you probably don&#39;t deserve to live all that long anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FDA is not permitted to regulate the supplement industry. In the early 90s aggressive lobbying and propaganda ushered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act_of_1994">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act_of_1994</a> .</p>

<p>Mercola and Oz tell people to use coffee enemas and chelation therapy to treat things like autism. Chelation therapy is extremely hard on the body and in real medicine is only used in cases of heavy metal poisoning. Those two are only trusted because of manipulative advertising and support from Oprah and other celebrity names.</p>

<p>Your last statement seems to be a very common one. How are people to know what is or isn&#39;t good for them without accurate information? Those supplements you mentioned for resveratrol, calcium, etc. - there is no data showing that the supplements actually DO anything other than const more money than grapes, cheese, and oats. There is no agency ensuring that the fiber pill you take contains the ingredients on the label.</p>

<p>Of course big companies are all pushing for deregulation. Of course they aren&#39;t trustworthy - that is why we HAVE an FDA in the first place. So why is it that Mercola and co. get a free pass? What is it about the alternative &quot;medicine&quot; industry that makes it trustworthy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you talking about aspartame? Are you just trying to redirect the conversation?</p>

<p>Look, right in the middle of your post you say &quot;take some basic supplements.&quot; Why? What is a &quot;basic supplement&quot;and why should I go buy it? How do I know that the contents are what is advertised? For that matter, without independent verification how do I know that they do what the bottle says they&#39;ll do? How do I know they aren&#39;t contaminated via shoddy manufacturing processes?</p>

<p>If your argument is that Big Supplement can&#39;t be as bad as Big Pharma because S makes less money than P, then does it follow that I should trust crack dealers more than either due to relative poverty?</p>

<p>At the end, supplements have never once been shown to have any positive effect on any ailment. Not one single well-constructed replicable trial has shown that alternative medicines do anything other than cure wallets of obesity.</p>

<p>Probably because there&#39;s no support behind that nonsense. &quot;Review of the biochemistry of aspartame has found no evidence that the doses consumed would plausibly lead to neurotoxic effects. Comprehensive reviews have not found any evidence for aspartame as a cause for these symptoms.&quot;</p>

<p>As far as scheduling drugs devastating civil rights - devastated compared to when? I would say that on the whole it appears people have more civil rights than they did pre-1960s. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for developing smarter and more comprehensive controls on medical costs and care, but the argument that medicine was cheaper way back when is a nonsense argument. Cars were cheaper in the 1700s as well, but I don&#39;t think anyone is advocating seriously for a return to the horse-and-buggy.</p>
