       The supplement/alternative medicine industry has zero accountability, spends millions lobbying congress to stay unregulated, and has repeatedly popularized dangerous and harmful "treatments" for profit. Big Supplement is a multi-billion dollar a year industry. Can anyone explain why Mercola, Dr Oz, etc. aren't as distrusted than the Monsantos and Pfizers of the world?

       I agree OP, and while I would love our FDA to do some real studies on some of the supplements that even the medical community approves of.

       I would like to see a little more um supervision on the advertising, but I am not especially convinced about  all out regulation.

       I don't see how you could verify the accuracy of claims without the same sort of controls that are exerted over regular pharmaceutical companies - mandated testing, independent review, submitted for testing by the FDA, rules regarding manufacturing practices, observation systems in place to ensure that the product sold is the one tested, and so on.
      </p>

       But yes, truth in advertising is a difficult and important thing to enforce.

       By that logic, there is also a conspiracy against contamination and unsafe food warehousing practices. A conspiracy to ruin the entire food industry by cunningly forcing them to destroy spoiled food, thereby driving up the cost of doing business!
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading further, apparently there is also a conspiracy against humble pesticide manufacturers! The evil UN is trying to set international guidelines for safe maximum agrichemical use like a bunch of illuminati deathmongers! When will the tyranny end? What is next, manufacturing standards in Chinese exports robbing us of our lead and cleaning solvent additives?! Madness! Conspiracy!

       Or maybe the supplement industry is up to some sincerely shady shit, and it has gotten to be a large enough part of the market for large agencies to take serious notice.

       Big pharma is getting a little nervous about the low quality high price product
they are selling and they would like to strong arm the supplement market.
Why not use their bought and paid for minions in the fda?  I think this is the

       We have a very easy choice as consumers not to buy. Big pharma makes big claims and does all the same things you just said with regulation. Avoiding supplements is rather easy. Avoiding cooking oil that's tainted with roundup is next to impossible unless you're a raw vegan. No restaurant I can find advertises their frying oil as gmo/ roundup free. I see where your coming from, but it's something we can easily decide not to buy. Much more so than tainted grocery manufacturers of America garbage.

       That hasn't got anything to do with what I asked. The supplement industry has no regulatory body ensuring that manufacturers don't simply lie about their products. This exemption from oversight is a direct result of heavy advertising propaganda and relentless lobbying - how is this not a legitimate corporate conspiracy?

       Yeah, I'm saying with enough funding, the regulation literally does absolutely nothing if they've got the regulators in their pockets anyway. It might help a tiny bit. Regulation in a crony-capitalist setup is a joke. Indeed, it is a corporate conspiracy, but I think we've got bigger fish to fry. Obviously, there are a lot of people on this sub, and I can't speak for many of them, but I don't think many people would disagree with you, and at the same time, it's not a pressing enough of an issue to garner much attention/support unless you're over in r/skeptic. If we're focusing on things that the government should be regulating, which seems kind of futile in the first place as we're talking about conspiracy buffs trusting the government to effectively regulate a market that is already swayed with billions in lobbying efforts, it's regulating the Wall St. fat cats. A much more dire and pressing issue than the unregulated supplement market, methinks.

       The left has a belief cluster around 'food and health purity' which includes the idea that supplements are good. They ironically see this in opposition to "big pharma".    Reddit is overwhelming on the left, so the bad ideas on the left are featured predominantly.

       There never has been and never will be 'food purity'.   This concept is a very recent invention since the 'organic food' movement.

       I dunno, I think it's more of a caveat emptor thing with supplements. If someone tells you their 50$ mojo-berry tonic salve will cure what ails you and you believe them, that's pretty much on you. If Big Supplement successfully lobbies to get that mojo-berry added to the water supply, on the other hand... well, you see the difference.

       I'm not sure what you mean here - I assume you're talking about fluoride with the whole added-to-the-water thing. This has nothing whatsoever to do with fluoride. I am asking why the supplement industry is not looked at on this sub as being potentially guilty of the same manipulations and profiteering that their counterparts in the regular medical industry are routinely accused of.

       Sorry, I was generalising. Could've picked my words better. My point is, lobbying for the right to sell your snake oil is different than lobbying to have your snake oil prescribed to children, or lobbying to have your supplements 'unlabelled' so that there's no way to tell if it's a proven medicine or not. One is about giving you more choice (even if the extra choice is a bunch of bollocks), the other is about giving you no choice, or hiding your choices from you.
      </p>

       As for manipulations and profiteering; if you find the story, go ahead and post it, I guess.

       Probably because you are completely wrong about everything you say.  "Big Supplement" actually contributes very little lobbying at all, [last year they contributed a little over 4 million]. (
       <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/alphalist_indus.php">

       )  In fact, as I looked up individual contributions from companies in the list, only 1-3 appear to be directly linked to marketing supplements (Herbalife being the main one, contributing $720,000).  The others appear to be medical companies, watchdogs, and investment firms with supplement industry clients.  There is no mention of "alternative medicine" lobbying anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So are you trying to compare "big supplement" to the biggest lobbying force of them all, the Pharmaceutical industry?  A couple million compared to over 400 million (including manufacturing) a year?  Give me a break.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supplements
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be regulated by the FDA, yes, like in all industries there will be shitty businesses marketing shitty products.  But it is up to the FDA to regulate what is going into these products, and to test the products to meet standards.  It is the FDA's fault that aluminum-based preservatives and leavening agents linked to alzheimers have been deemed Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) along with a slew of other additives that have been inadequately tested.  Also, which companies do you really think are pushing for deregulation of food (also cosmetic) additives and the like? I'll tell you: it's the big food and bev contributors like Coca Cola, Kraft, Unilever that have been putting this shit in our food for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since when has it become taboo to talk about what once was a universal, passed-down knowledge?  Our grandparents knew that red wine, cheese, herbs and oatmeal were good for you.  We researched it and now have resveratrol and calcium supplements, high cavacrol oregano oil, and fibre pills.  This is not "alternative medicine" it's common fucking sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mercola and Oz are trusted because they generally give pretty basic advice adhering with accepted nutritional guidelines that everyone should know.  They also do some research and occasionally shit on the pharma/biotech/petrochemical/cosmetic and Big Food industries because   these industries fucking deserve it for the shit they pull and it's just so easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       People shouldn't be deceived by "panaceas" and "miracle elixirs" because biology is complicated ( I'm willing to make an exception for cannabis, that shit is miraculous), but if you're the type of person that can't figure out what a banana is good for nor figure out what a doctor is good for, you probably don't deserve to live all that long anyways.

       The FDA is not permitted to regulate the supplement industry. In the early 90s aggressive lobbying and propaganda ushered in
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act_of_1994">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Supplement_Health_and_Education_Act_of_1994
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Mercola and Oz tell people to use coffee enemas and chelation therapy to treat things like autism. Chelation therapy is extremely hard on the body and in real medicine is only used in cases of heavy metal poisoning. Those two are only trusted because of manipulative advertising and support from Oprah and other celebrity names.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your last statement seems to be a very common one. How are people to know what is or isn't good for them without accurate information? Those supplements you mentioned for resveratrol, calcium, etc. - there is no data showing that the supplements actually DO anything other than const more money than grapes, cheese, and oats. There is no agency ensuring that the fiber pill you take contains the ingredients on the label.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course big companies are all pushing for deregulation. Of course they aren't trustworthy - that is why we HAVE an FDA in the first place. So why is it that Mercola and co. get a free pass? What is it about the alternative "medicine" industry that makes it trustworthy?

       Over 100,000 people died last year from prescription drug overdoses last year and multiple millions of people in the US alone are addicted to doctor's orders-only drugs.

      <p>
       Know how many people died from vitamins last year?  Far, far, far, far less than 100,000.  So few in fact, for so many years, they don't really count them.  There's not enough to count.

       At the end, some drugs work for some people.  Some supplements work for some people.  If they don't work for you, move on.  No offense, but you're a little hostile, OP - I bet if you took 1000mg of Niacinamide 3x day, you'd be less of an angry pantload;).

       You might ask yourself why you're not pissed off at Coke, Pepsi, Wrigley's, and thousands of other brands that use aspartame, a deadly neurotoxin as a "diet" sweetener.

       This isn't about big pharma. I'm asking why big supplement is not subjected to the same scrutiny, despite also being a large and profit-driven industry with an active lobbyist presence and zero oversight in the US.

       Why are you talking about aspartame? Are you just trying to redirect the conversation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, right in the middle of your post you say "take some basic supplements." Why? What is a "basic supplement"and why should I go buy it? How do I know that the contents are what is advertised? For that matter, without independent verification how do I know that they do what the bottle says they'll do? How do I know they aren't contaminated via shoddy manufacturing processes?
      </p>
      <p>
       If your argument is that Big Supplement can't be as bad as Big Pharma because S makes less money than P, then does it follow that I should trust crack dealers more than either due to relative poverty?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end, supplements have never once been shown to have any positive effect on any ailment. Not one single well-constructed replicable trial has shown that alternative medicines do anything other than cure wallets of obesity.

       Probably because there's no support behind that nonsense. "Review of the biochemistry of aspartame has found no evidence that the doses consumed would plausibly lead to neurotoxic effects. Comprehensive reviews have not found any evidence for aspartame as a cause for these symptoms."

       Terribly sorry, I forgot that once there is anyone unpleasant in government the best course of action is to quit entirely, tear it all down, and I guess hope that whatever rises from the ashes isn't the brutal military rule that takes over 90% of the time that sort of thing happens.

       I'm not suggesting that at all. I'm sorry if I came off that way. I just want to remove the regulations, taxes, and inefficiencies in the federal spending budget. I want states to take over many of the federal duties. I want to stop killing brown people overseas. I want to stop surveiling the world. I want stop treating drug addiction like a crime. I want to make prescription drugs cheaper and more available.

       Guess what? We can do all of these things, while saving money!

       I would like to see an overhaul of our regulatory agencies, but to remove taxes and regulations is to remove government and allow profit motive to run rampant.

       Less regulation than none? Are you arguing that the way to increase accountability and quality in regular medical industry is to stop testing new drugs before allowing them on market?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did requiring drug companies to prove the claims they make empower the industry?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as scheduling drugs devastating civil rights - devastated compared to when? I would say that on the whole it appears people have more civil rights than they did pre-1960s.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for developing smarter and more comprehensive controls on medical costs and care, but the argument that medicine was cheaper way back when is a nonsense argument. Cars were cheaper in the 1700s as well, but I don't think anyone is advocating seriously for a return to the horse-and-buggy.

       These are not drugs, they are supplements, no one has to buy them.
