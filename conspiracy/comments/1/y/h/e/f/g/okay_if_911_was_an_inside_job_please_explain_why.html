        "Noam Chomsky Debunks 9/11 and JFK Murder"

       Keep in mind that these are
       <em>
        only

       articles that are critical in some way of the official reports.  They are cherry-picked for the documentary and it is not clear from the site what the peer reviews said (they could just be nonsense, who knows?)  And focusing exclusively on them without reading more vanilla papers will not give an accurate sampling of the academic consensus.

       Well you could look up the papers outside the site and see the reviews that way.  I'm sure at least some of them are questionable, if you look at the universities some of the professors come from.  I'm willing to bet the reviews are mixed at best.

       There is logic in my comment. You said that the 9/11 info won't be published into scientific journals because of the jews. I'm saying controversial information on different topics have already been released and you're saying that doesn't matter. Again, why hasn't the majority of the scientific community published their evidence against the 9/11 commission report?

       These journals are run by committees. If you suggest/put forward a certain paper for publication then your position on the committee and your entire academic career could be at stake. It's just not worth it. Certain things are left well alone.

       Whatever "controversial" things you speak of obviously aren't as important as this.

       19 Muslims...several of whom are mysteriously alive and well and not involved in any terrorist organization,several more of whom were U.S government contractors at one time, crashed planes into buildings specifically designed to withstand the impact of MULTIPLE strikes airline collisions but instead fell at free fall speeds (not actually possible if they "pancaked" the way the 911 report claims) straight down, much like an industrial demolition and nothing at all like the "falling tree" scenario that happens when any other tower loses a chunk out of its side. You're right, that evidence needed a lot of twisting...to make it seem plausible that it was anything except a well planned demolition accompanied by a hijacking, designed to further the cause of disarmament and monitoring by the government.

       there are a few issues with that. Firstly, it was designed to be able to withstand the impact of a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_707">
        boeing 707
       </a>
       (which is much smaller then the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_757">
        757's
       </a>
       that hit the tower), and at much slower speeds (also the multiple strikes were never meant to be simultaneous). Also, and I can't stress this enough
       <em>
        the towers didn't fall at free fall speeds
       </em>
       . If you look at the videos you can see the debris around the towers falling faster then the towers themselves.

       You seem to have the wrong person, I am not, nor ever will be defiantshill. Also the proper argument would be "Two planes hit two towers, and the debris severely damaged a third and ignited a fire that raged uncontrolled for hours before causing it's collapse"

       You again are taking what i'm saying out of context. You seem to think that just because it was never hit by a plane it must have been controlled demolition. The fact is that the fire (the main factor), combined with damage from debris (which is still mentioned too) caused it to fall.

       <p>
        For eight years after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged right in center of Philadelphia's business district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners to do something with the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998.

       So yes, it is fucking aplicable. Compare that to what WTC 7 underwent, and damage from debris on top of that. I fail to see how you don't think the fire could cause any damage to the structure.

       Not really actually. Over and over I hear the argument "a fire couldn't have done that (when referring to the WTC 7 collapse)". The evidence I presented shows that not only can a fire cause structural damage, but it also doesn't need to be anywhere near as hot as thermite to do it.

       It's what NIST didn't say which proves they can't use science to back up their conspiracy theory, which is that fire alone can bring down a 47 story skyscraper with 48 core columns cut nearly simultaneously to show free fall in the demolition process.

       <li>
        In a video, it appears that WTC 7 is descending in free fall, something that would not occur in the structural collapse that you describe. How can NIST ignore basic laws of physics?
In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008; available at
        <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">
         http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm
        </a>
        ), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions.

       I don't think that's entirely accurate. I really think that we are all just trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together and when our gov't isn't transparent and they have a lot to be gained from 9/11, it draws attention. Conspiracy theorists' job is to ask questions. We want to find out what happened.

       WTC 7 collapse conspiracies have been completely debunked countless times.  They basically amounted to non-experts watching footage and saying, "Why did that building fall so fast when it wasn't hit by a plane?  Looked like a controlled demolition to me."  It looked like a controlled demolition, of course, because in both cases a building collapses.

        Popular Mechanics did a series

       debunking the most common claims that is a pretty easy read.  In particular, check out

       The only thing truly suspicious about the event and reports on it were the sections made classified that (apparently) implicated high-ranking Saudis as conspirators (Saudi Arabia is an ally, for better or probably worse).

       Conspiracy theorists seem to not want to believe the "government story" because they think that "propaganda" necessarily involves lying.  This is inaccurate--propaganda can be true.  You can bet that when something happens that bolsters a government's positions on something, they are going to report the shit out of it.  Doesn't mean it didn't happen to begin with.

       These journals are run by committees. If you suggest/put forward a certain paper for publication then your position on the committee and your entire academic career could be at stake. It's just not worth it. Certain things are left well alone.

       Whatever "controversial" things you speak of obviously aren't as important as this.

       <p>
        For eight years after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged right in center of Philadelphia's business district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners to do something with the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998.

       Really? Because the videos
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       tend to back them up. Or are they wrong too? Not to mention you can see debris falling faster then the structure itself (although it's much more apparent on the WTC 1&amp;2).
