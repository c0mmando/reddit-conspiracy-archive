        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After 2000 years a small group essentially took back their &quot;homeland&quot;. Is there something more important than the religious artifacts that they essentially abandoned thousands of years ago? I have read that Israel = Rothschild &amp; Zionism = Rothschild &amp; the flag of Israel = Rothschild family crest. The Rothschild family supposedly owns much of the land and built many buildings. </p>

<p>I wonder that with the supposed wealth that the Rothschild family had / has was it able to create or take advantage of the WW to take this land. But on the other hand if they had so much money couldn&#39;t they have just bought it like the US did with Alaska or Louisiana? </p>

<p>But what is it about the land? Is there something secret that was found about that land? Some lost knowledge that was found?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl</a></p>

<p>It was his great idea for the Jewish people to found their own nation. While evidence is thin, I believe that he was working closely with the Rothschilds. After failing in negotiations with the local Sultan to carve out a section of Palestine, the Rothschilds directed the British government to fight the bloody First and Second Battles of Gaza. </p>

<p>Later on, the British would issue the Balfour Declaration, addressed to Lord Rothschild, which handed over Palestine in exchange for drawing the Americans into the Great War. Of course, the Lusitania sank and the rest is history.</p>

<p>But on the other hand if they had so much money couldn&#39;t they have just bought it like the US did with Alaska or Louisiana? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They tried. In 1896, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl#Zionist_leader">Herzl visited the Ottoman Empire</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Herzl] failed to obtain an audience but did succeed in visiting a number of highly placed individuals, including the Grand Vizier, who received him as a journalist representing the Neue Freie Presse. <strong>Herzl presented his proposal to the Grand Vizier: the Jews would pay the Turkish foreign debt and attempt to help regulate Turkish finances if they were given Palestine as a Jewish homeland under Turkish rule</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;The Jews&quot; would pay the Turkish foreign debt???</p>

<p>So what happened?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Five years later, May 17, 1901, Herzl did meet with Sultan Abdulhamid II,[20] but <strong>the Sultan refused Theodor Herzl&#39;s offer to consolidate the Ottoman debt in exchange for a charter allowing the Zionists access to Palestine</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then  what happened?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Young Turk Revolution</p></li>
<li><p>WWI</p></li>
<li><p>The Balfour Declaration</p></li>
<li><p>The Ottoman Empire was dissolved </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe the Sultan should have taken the deal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll copy past the answer I answered just few min ago.</p>

<p>Malchizedek the king of Shalem, the one who gave Abraham (father of Judaism) his name (changed from Abram) as well as his city (Shalem). Abraham renamed this city to &quot;Yerushalayim&quot; (Jerusalem in Hebrew). The Hebrew word for &quot;will see&quot; is Yireh, so the meaning is &quot;I see Shalem&quot;. Malchizedek was an Angle of God.</p>

<p>During its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed twice, besieged 23 times, attacked 52 times, and captured and recaptured 44 times. that must mean something.</p>

<p>A Jewish state can only exists near Jerusalem. and the reason for this is well described in the Kabbalah (and other sources of information), and it&#39;s also a lot more scientific than what you might think related to energy and stuff.</p>

<p>My knowledge in the area is only limited. but further investigation can reveal more. I can try explain just a bit more if you ask something specific.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll add, like you can see this is not &quot;lost knowledge&quot;, just not mentioned much. it&#39;s all described on the books, what people call the &quot;The Bible&quot; is approx 1/5 or 1/4 of the whole Jewish religion, depends on how you count the books. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think when he said the &quot;lost knowledge&quot; he meant as in occult knowledge. The Kabbalah he was talking about is full of that kind of stuff. Which is to complex of a subject to expand on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a religious person, but I do try expand my knowledge on my religion, Judaism, all the time. I have not learned Kabbalah, but I am aware some of the subject it talks about.</p>

<p>Kabbalah is sometimes called &quot;secret knowledge&quot; (occult), but not because it&#39;s a really a secret, like <a href="/u/yellowsnow2">/u/yellowsnow2</a> mentioned it&#39;s a complex subject. It&#39;s complex subject just like Aerospace Engineering is complex. Before you can build your own space ship there quit a lot of prerequisites you should learn first. so does Kabbalah, and it takes many years to master (sometimes a lifetime). you can&#39;t expect it to be easy to understand what God really is.</p>

<p>It is comparable to the knowledge the monks in Tibet poses. essentially it also gets to some form of meditation, clearing and freeing your mind and receiving the energy. Jewish people do this also but in a slightly different ways, and the types of energy they get is different than the monks.</p>

<p>I can try explain some specific things, but it would take pages to really give a detailed information you might be able to understand.</p>

<p>I will say this, Galileo Galilei a physicist who lived only 400 years ago showed the western world that Earth is going around the Sun and not the other way around. people at the time, in Europe were not aware of this. but the Egyptians who lived more than 3000 years ago know this, and a lot more. so this knowledge was kind of &quot;lost&quot; in history.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a similar situation with God, Jewish (and not only) posses the knowledge of God for thousands of years already, and the explanation is not an easy one, this why the Bible and other books were written, for the &quot;common&quot; people who do not learn about God all their life, but what is written in the Bible is rendered in very simplistic manner.</p>

<p>Look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum">Electromagnetic Spectrum</a>. you can see each type of energy have a frequency (you can refer to it as a gap). Gamma rays like shown are energies what the smallest gaps (there&#39;s something smaller we know about? there is actually), they also quite hard to measure compared to radio waves.</p>

<p>The energy of God (or divine energy), is much much much more thinner than gamma rays, this why we today do not posses the electronic equipment to measure this energy (we might some day). but the funny thing is we humans have souls, and our souls are devices that receive this energy all the time, all our life, from all around the universe, souls are &quot;decoders&quot; of the divine energy. and if you learn how, you can train your mind also to understand this energy and understand God.</p>

<p>The place was called Shalem, and what today is Jerusalem, is an energetic spot not a town really, a very special spot because it gives the most direct connection to the energy we refer as &quot;God&quot;. there&#39;s not such thing as &quot;The Jewish God&quot;, it&#39;s just one God that is everything. it was repeated many times in many places but people seemed to always ignore this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever you have a large fanatical movement, such as global warming, or Zionism, it has layers.</p>

<p>The mass is made up of true believers who have bought into the mythology and the fantasy.</p>

<p>In the middle you have technocrats and experts and academics who do the grunt work to make the vision a reality, and they are doing it for money. They are interested in social position, income, advancement in their careers, publicity, fame.</p>

<p>At the top you have cynical bastards who don&#39;t believe in the myth for an instant, but who see the movement as a way to advance their global agendas and make themselves wealthy. They run the show. They give the orders. They are the Al Gores and the Michael Manns of the movement. They tell themselves that even though their movement is a lie, it is for the greater good. And they half believe it, the greater hypocrites among them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with Zionism. The mass of Jews at the bottom believed, at least in part, in the relilgious fairy tales of a Promised Land. The middle level Jews are the ones who pushed the movement forward with their campaigning, and organizations, and studies, and essays, and books, and speeches, and propaganda, but they didn&#39;t do it for belief, they did it for their own career advancement and enrichment. Then at the top, we have the lofty few who run Zionism but don&#39;t believe in the biblical stories to the slightest degree. They view Zionism as their way to further their global agenda, and also as a means of sustaining their own authority and power over the masses of people below them. They are cynics, hypocrites, and probably all of them are psychopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no lost knowledge, it&#39;s been written for thousands of years.</p>

<p>The Bible has nearly 800 references to Jerusalem- called “the City of our God” (Ps. 48:1,8) Jerusalem is God’s city, the city of Zion, he has invested his name there (Daniel 9:19).</p>

<p>Jerusalem is called the city of the great King (Matt.5:35). YHWH is called “the God of Israel,” He is not called the God of any other nation in this manner, The God of Jerusalem is key to the Jewish people, to Jesus and to the end of the age.</p>

<p>Zion is called the city of God. Isa 60:14: “and they shall call you The City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.” It is where the Lord has and will dwell again. Joel 3:21: “for the LORD dwells in Zion.” When the temple permanently replaced the tabernacle and was built in Jerusalem it became the place of his dwelling, his presence was there, thus name Zion.</p>

<p>Ps. 132:13-14: “For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling place: “This is My resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.” Ps. 87:1-3: “His foundation is in the holy mountains. The LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God! Selah”</p>

<p>The days of British colonialism were long over at that point. A British state could never exist in the long term. </p>

<p>By signing it over to a bunch of jews that were already doing them a favor for it, they maintained their hegemony as opposed to returning it to the palestinians. </p>

<p>As you can see today, all of the &#39;solutions&#39; offered are two-state situations. Of course the most likely reality is just one state(Israel) with a repressed majority (the palestinians).</p>

<p>If that&#39;s what you think English hegemony is then sure, that would make sense on your terms. I&#39;m not really trying to make a statement on what that power structure is as much as a comment on what is apparently true about Israel.</p>

<p>One-State solution? Can&#39;t happen - as Jews would quickly become outnumbered and the Zionist Dream of a &quot;Jewish State&quot; will evaporate.</p>

<p>Two-State solution? The moment Palestine is recognized as a State, Israel will declare war, and it will explode into a conflagration that will encompass the region - if not the world.</p>

<p>The only viable solution would be true assimilation - but that is the GREATEST FEAR that Jews have - indeed, preventing assimilation was the impetus that spawned Political Zionism from the beginning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may be fine with you and I, but it isn&#39;t going to fly with the vast majority of Jews inside or outside of Israel.</p>

<p>There is a reason that the Israelis keep snatching more and more land - driving the Palestinians off, stealing their water, burning their groves, destroying their homes and villages - all while investing heavily in settlements and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Historically, Israeli leaders have been hard-nosed ruthless expansionists, and &quot;bad things&quot; happened to Israeli leaders who were seen as &quot;weak&quot;, or as ceding Jewish territory (see Yitzhak Rabin and Ariel Sharon).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that many jews support the expansion of Israel (settlements in the west bank), and it tends to be hardcore orthodox jews who settle there. Also, don&#39;t forget that the vast majority of jews are reform or conservative, and not orthodox (who are probably more open to talks between both sides). Also, the main problem with Israel and expansionism is that the orthodox jews hold a significant amount fo power, and they pretty much abuse it. Overall though, I hope that eventually both sides will come to a agreement of some kind.</p>

<p>You cannot lump an entire race of people into the beliefs of one man. So.. Theodor Herzl was an atheist.. that doesn&#39;t mean all Jew&#39;s are, nor does one man who died in the early 20th century speak or stand for all Jewish people.

<p>They do. Judaism is a very strict faith..
Their dogmas and code of beliefs are very demanding.
I&#39;m not going to explain to you how or why they live the lives they do.
You have a brain, figure it out yourself.
Go ask any rabbi if they live their life in accordance with YHVH&#39;s will.
I double dog dare you.</p>

<p>Israel is not the only nation that plays a part in the end times.
If you know anything about bible prophecy you wouldn&#39;t say that.</p>

<p>I can understand the logic being thought of in your last statement.
If there were no jews, there more than likely wouldn&#39;t be a holy bible, so therefore, there wouldn&#39;t be an endtimes.</p>

<p>However, there are Jews...
there is a bible..
and there may or may not be an end times.</p>

<p>If you read the bible you can learn about how things on earth are before the end days. This time period is called, the time of sorrow, or Jacob&#39;s trouble.
Jesus said before he returns you (humans) will see signs and stars in the heaven&#39;s. 
(That&#39;s just one piece of evidence, there are many more but for the sake of this post I will allow you to come to your own conclusions based on the research you may or may not do).
This means comets, meteorites, etc. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s something cool. 
This year and next year 2014/2015 there will be 4 blood moons.. all falling on major Jewish Holiday&#39;s.
These events have happened many time during earth&#39;s history, but the last time there were 4 blood moons on Jewish holy days were during..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Spanish Inquisition (1492)
The War of Independence (1948)
The Six day War (1967)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very interesting how the bible says that the time we are living in now is known as the time of trouble and how blood moons are occurring sacred Judaic holidays.
This leads me to believe that some major events that include Israel are going to happen this year.
April 16, I believe, is when the first one is going to occur. 
One more this year, and the other two are saved for 2015.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not believe YHVH is all that is made out to be, but it would be unwise to dismiss something just because your ego and your own intelligence cannot find anything in it.
All truths are half truths and all falsehoods are based upon truth. </p>

<p>No need to risk the double-dog. I&#39;m fairly familiar with the subject, thanks. And these days, relatively few Jews are as pious as you portray here: Most are quite secular - nominally religious, luke warm, agnostic, or atheist.

They make enemies out of everyone they make contact with (and blame everyone but themselves), and worst of all, the &quot;shittly little country&quot; is armed to the teeth with every kind of nasty-assed weapon imaginable - nuclear, biological, chemical - YOU NAME IT, Israel has it, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option">THEY WILL USE IT</a>. THAT, LordMandrake, is why I said that &quot;without the <strong>Israelis</strong>, we might not have an &quot;end times&quot; at all!&quot;</p>

<p>Ever hear of self-fulfilling prophesy? If some &quot;prophet&quot; predicts that a church is going to burn down, and LO AND BEHOLD IT DOES - who do you think the Arson Squad will be visiting?</p>

<p>You have your faith, and that&#39;s fine. You believe that Israel is God&#39;s country, and that&#39;s fine too - EXCEPT when cockeyed crazy beliefs become the impetus that rains hell on the Earth and humanity - and that is precisely where Zionism and its adherents - be they Jew or Gentile - seem to be leading us.</p>

<p>Thanks but no thanks. Y&#39;all should treat your religion like your genitals: Love them all you want, admire, adore and fondle them if you like, but KEEP THEM IN YOUR PANTS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Amos, thank you for the conversation.
It was my pleasure to share this with you.</p>

<p>Amos, I am sorry.
I misunderstood your message and I regret trying to make you sound as if you were a fool. I couldn&#39;t do so if I tried, and even if I were to attempt such a thing it would make me feel bad because it&#39;s kind of a dick move to go out of your way to make people sound stupid. You&#39;re not stupid, I&#39;m just an asshole.
Truly, you know what you are talking about and that is fantastic.</p>

<p>The point I was trying to make was not to justify the Jewish people in their actions, or to even make the folly attempt of trying to justify Zionism of all things. </p>

<p>I was trying to express that even if you choose not to believe in the bible there still are some great points that it makes in wisdom and philosophy. 
Some of the  prophecies in the book are a great reflection on modern times now. You can read what the bible says in terms of what is going on now. Rumors of war, peace and security, signs in the stars, esoteric knowledge being made available to nearly anyone, weather disasters, the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>I was just trying to make the point that you shouldn&#39;t let your beliefs in a people reflect on their wisdom itself.</p>

<p>Personally, as I said, I don&#39;t think that the Judaic tribal God YHVH is all that is he cracked up to be.
The myths in both Christianity and Judaism go back to Egypt, nearly 3000 years before Christ ever walked the earth. His tale is predated by Osiris, Mithras, Dionysus, and many many more. 
I am bringing this up because I want to explain that I do not put much faith into the religion itself.
YHVH even states in the bible that he is an angry and jealous God.</p>

<p>If the Jewish people are in fact the children of God, then it makes a poor reflection on their God itself.</p>

<p>I am not a Christian. I do not believe that Israel itself is God&#39;s land.</p>

<p>Just because I made some references to the bible does not mean I follow it. It just means I am aware of what it has to say.</p>

<p>Modern Christianity is a joke.
Most people don&#39;t even know that the bible isn&#39;t supposed to be taken at face value. It&#39;s all allegories.
With an understanding of the occult the messages shine so much more and clearer, but it&#39;s not for everyone.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome, Amos. I hope that you have a fantastic life.</p>

<p>On the contrary, perusing the scriptures can shed much light on the behavior of modern culture(s).</p>

<p>Yeah, that is kind of creepy, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, life&#39;s a crap shoot. It seems He chose poorly. Or they did. Either way, :-(</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If it was, you can bet that the Zionists would be stealing his water, burning his olive groves and bulldozing his houses so they could steal it.</p>

<p>Then again, G-d didn&#39;t have a building permit, did he?</p>

<p>Same to you, LordMandrake.</p>

<p>Sorry if I get a bit sarcastic and cynical, but it&#39;s nothing personal - It&#39;s all in jest. Levity.</p>

<p>Thanks for the amicable discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you provide a source for the rothschilds owning all the land? Also, the reason they wanted it back was because they had just escaped the holocaust, and during which, many countries refused to take them in (Canada for example had a policy of &quot;none is too many&quot;). Because of this, they wanted a homeland that they could have in case something like this were to happen again. Israel/Palestine was just a good location due to having religious significance.</p>
