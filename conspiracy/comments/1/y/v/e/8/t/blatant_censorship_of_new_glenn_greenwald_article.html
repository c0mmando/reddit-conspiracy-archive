        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The newest Glenn Greenwald article detailing how GCHQ attempts to manipulate popular opinion online using over 150 paid employees is being blatantly censored in r/news and r/worldnews.</p>

<p>In r/news, the article has been submitted but was filtered for being &#39;analysis/opinion&#39; (via BipolarBear0) as this somehow violates the rules despite the proof contained within the article and this being completely new information. After finding this out, I resubmitted simply the slides (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1yvcj0/slides_leaked_by_snowden_and_reported_by_glenn/">here</a>) to r/news but that was immediately filtered as well. I have yet to receive a response as to why this is the case.</p>

<p>In the case of r/worldnews, the article was originally submitted several times, with the original not being filtered and the second submission being &quot;inappropriate for subreddit&quot;. After the user complained, the higher upvoted post was filtered and the second lower voted post was reinstated after an hour, ensuring it would not reach the front page. Additionally, my comments on reddit on the article on r/worldnews that was eventually reinstated were deleted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1yu8g8/how_covert_agents_infiltrate_the_internet_to/">here</a>. Bawles and I had a brief discussion on how this was filtered as inappropriate for the subreddit and how he had contacted the mods, bawles then responded saying they had reinstated the post. None of these comments are in the above link.</p>

<p>EDIT: Bipolarbear0 has approved this article, please upvote for visibility: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1yxs3d/government_infiltrating_websites_to_deny_disrupt/">http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1yxs3d/government_infiltrating_websites_to_deny_disrupt/</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Annd I am shadowbanned from r/news. Apparently they don&#39;t like people asking too many questions,</p>

<p>EDIT:
I have now posted this article: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1yx7vl/government_infiltrating_websites_to_deny_disrupt/">http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1yx7vl/government_infiltrating_websites_to_deny_disrupt/</a> but of course it was immediately filtered from new on r/news. I have contacted the mods again asking why this article is filtered, as it is obviously reporting solely on the material and is not analysis/opinion. But of course I have received no response. Considering BipolarBear0 said other articles would be allowed through, it seems that they are simply choosing to ignore me at this point.</p>

<p>EDIT2: My message to the moderators of r/news:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello, I have been in discussion with Bipolarbear0 about the recent Glenn Greenwald information of paid GCHQ agents used to manipulate opinions online.</p>

<p>My original message to the mods of the subject was a request as to why this article <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1yu8ev/how_covert_agents_infiltrate_the_internet_to/">http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1yu8ev/how_covert_agents_infiltrate_the_internet_to/</a> was censored from r/news.</p>

<p>The article was submitted and filtered. My original message included that statement and a request of how this &gt;information could be submitted considering that. In fact you have already responded to my previous request &gt;about -why- that article was filtered.</p>

<p>Bipolarbear0 responded: 
re: Glenn Greenwald article appears filtered from r/news</p>

<blockquote>
<p>from BipolarBear0[M] via <a href="/r/news/">/r/news/</a> sent 3 hours ago</p>

<p>Analysis/opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then posted simply the slides, as apparently the original article was too edgy for r/news. As there are/were no &gt;other articles at the time, this was the only other valid way to add this news to r/news.</p>

<p>This material was immediately filtered and I sent a message to the mods of this subreddit requesting a reason &gt;why.</p>

<p>Bipolarbear0 -again- responded (does this subreddit have no other mods?), here is his response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You linked raw documents.</p>

<p>Two points on that:</p>

<p>The title isn&#39;t from the article, and in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> that&#39;s a requirement &gt;for submission.</p>

<p>Raw documents does not a news article make. If someone wrote &gt;a story about those documents, of which &gt;I&#39;m sure there will be one &gt;soon considering the subject matter, it would be allowed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that Bipolarbear0 responded to my original request ON THE ARTICLE THAT HE&#39;S SURE WILL BE WRITTEN &gt;SOON. I would like a response from a moderator OTHER than Bipolarbear0 on why both of these links were &gt;blatantly censored from this subreddit.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT3: 
Response from CandyManCan</p>

<blockquote>
<p>from CandyManCan[M] via <a href="/r/news/">/r/news/</a> sent 6 hours ago</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All moderators of a subreddit can see all correspondence to and from a subreddit&#39;s mod mail.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> is for news articles from reputable news sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Your link is an editorialized analysis of some leaked slides, and not a presentation of objective facts, ie, news. You can submit a link to any source ABOUT the slides that objective reports the facts without the editorial.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>And my response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to CandyManCan sent 5 hours ago</p>

<p>Please explain to me how this is not a legitimate news source. This sounds dangerously close to you censoring &gt;this article due to the author, as Glenn Greenwald has posted many news worthy articles and has received &gt;many journalistic rewards.</p>

<p>Additionally, please provide am example paragraph from this article you feel is overly editorialized</p>

<p>from CandyManCan[M] via <a href="/r/news/">/r/news/</a> sent 5 hours ago</p>

<p>Sigh, you probably think the moon censors the sun. I will let another mod takeover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No other mod has responded at this point.</p>

Despite ongoing moderator manipulation, the default subs are some of the forums on the internet with the widest reach, and quality articles and comments do still drift to the top with some consistency.  They&#39;re influenced but they aren&#39;t totally compromised.  Don&#39;t isolate yourself from this discourse, make yourself heard to a wide audience while you still can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mine was removed after an hour or so. Had 100-ish upvotes. I submitted, and it went through and for a second I was like, wow, this isn&#39;t in here yet? Coolski. No notifier saying it was already in. Mine was taken down [Already Submitted]. Which I&#39;m sure it had been. Before being removed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blatant censorship. Nothing more, nothing less. They have the burden of proof when it comes to the idea that they may or may not have censored this story. Certainly, it looks like it is nothing more than a shoddy censor job. They shadowbanned you, have been playing games with this story, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sickening. Glenn Greenwald is a world renowned, premiere journalist but because he does not have a specific corporate entity behind him--I mean it&#39;s not like the founder of PayPal Mr. Omiydar is anyone important after all--and because he refrains from keeping an &quot;objective&quot; viewpoint i.e. a &quot;pro-establishment view disregarding the contradiction between public statements and internal records&quot; somehow he is less of a journalist and trustworthy source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who cares? Is this news that those subreddits do exactly what people post about on this subreddit <em>daily</em>?</p>

<p>Is there a reason why we constantly have to point out the entirely made up reasons offered by the mods? Who cares? Move on - post somewhere else.</p>
