<blockquote>

<p>Inundated? Hardly. There&#39;s barely evidence for the handful who have ever been called out officially, and absolutely no evidence whatsoever for 99% of cases in which the word is thrown around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They must be called out when identified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the identification of an actual shill is incredibly uncommon here. Call them out when they&#39;re real, and you have evidence of such, sure. But most use it as an insult and to discredit someone they disagree with. That is unacceptable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What sense does this make? What victory will they claim? How will they claim it, supposedly in their next post?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I don&#39;t think it should necessarily be against the rules to call out a shill, at least when you have proper proof. The reason it has been banned, however, is because in 99% of cases the word shill is used incorrectly and as an insult. This severely waters down this subreddit and is the source if much of its infamy.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have only ever posted on <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> twice, not that its really of consequence or any of your business.</p>

<p>No. You&#39;re clearly entirely missing the point of the bloody ban. It&#39;s to discourage the incredibly common shit-flinging fests that happen daily in this sub. Calling someone a troll or shill (or personally insulting them, which both of these are) only detracts from a conversation. If you can&#39;t converse without insulting someone, you shouldn&#39;t be conversing at all.</p>

<p>Reading through their history, they seem like a completely normal redditor. Putting them into reddit investigator, I see no correlation between the two accounts whatsoever. They have no overlapping interests whatsoever, and were made more than a year apart. Would you like to show me the proof? Even if they are the same... who cares? Having two accounts is not uncommon. Hell, I have two accounts. One is my SFW account which I use at work or school. Does that make me a shill?</p>

<p>Well, there&#39;s your proof. That was easy.</p>

<p>&quot;Preliminary dose-estimation reports by WHO and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) indicate that, outside the geographical areas most affected by radiation, even in locations within Fukushima prefecture, the predicted risks remain low and no observable increases in cancer above natural variation in baseline rates are anticipated.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EVERY SINGLE OTHER MELTDOWN IN THE HISTORY OF MAN HAS HAD NOTHING BUT HORRIBLE EFFECTS AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not as severe as you make them out to be. Beyond the evacuation, there was little death or disfigurement. </p>

<p>&quot; In comparison, after the Chernobyl accident, only 0.1% of the 110,000 cleanup workers surveyed have so far developed leukemia, although not all cases resulted from the accident.&quot; </p>

<p>Here are some nice quotes from people who actually know what they&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>&quot; the radiation release from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant could cause 130 deaths from cancer globally (the lower bound for the estimater being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases in total (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), most of which are estimated to occur in Japan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Estimated effective doses from the accident outside of Japan are considered to be below (or far below) the dose levels regarded as very small by the international radiological protection community&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As of August 2013, there have been more than 40 children newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer and other cancers in Fukushima prefecture 18 of which were diagnosed with thyroid cancer, but these cancers are not attributed to radiation from Fukushima, as similar patterns occurred before the accident in 2006 in Japan, with 1 in 100,000 children per year developing thyroid cancer in that year, that is, this is not higher than the pre-accident rate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments)&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The United Nations predicted that the initial radiation plume from the stricken Japanese reactors would reach the United States by 18 March. Health and nuclear experts emphasized that radiation in the plume would be diluted as it traveled and, at worst, would have extremely minor health consequences in the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It’s really a little hard to predict at this moment which model is correct, said Smith. Either outcome, he emphasizes, is not dangerous to humans because the levels are so low. It’s clearly not an environmental or human health radiological threat,”</p>

<p>The simple fact is, mate, the international scientific community is not expecting any major or threatening levels of radiotion whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing.  It takes a very special type of person to even attempt to argue a semi-rational point that an as-of-right-this-very-moment full blown triple nuclear meltdowns that in some bizzaro-world that is definitely not Earth cause serious human costs.  And that this currently uncontained open.air radiological release is somehow not @_dangerous.  And future consequences..hell, not even worth discussing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid people like this? don&#39;t exist in real life.  Which brings us right back to the original, very interesting point.  Credibility.  Believability.  Who has it?</p>

<p>Thise &quot;99%&quot; figure that you quoted / pulled straight out of your rectum.  I requested one solid example of where a reputable <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> member incorrectly labeled someone a shill when they weren&#39;t in fact a shill.  With how often, at least according to your &quot;story&quot; how often this occurs, it shouldnt be an issue at all to provide a single example of this occurring.  You know, for something that has been such a threat to non-shill <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> members, it should be incredibly easy for you.</p>
