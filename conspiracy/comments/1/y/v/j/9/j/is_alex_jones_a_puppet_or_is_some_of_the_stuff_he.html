       He brings up some legitimate stuff.
Most his movies are somewhat decent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can't watch his show every day, or else youll go crazy lol.
He does overly exaggerate a lot of things, and a lot of times he gets his facts wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't think he's a puppet.
I believe deep down, he's on the 'good' side.

       Yes, one marginal click higher than the morons that claim to have nothing to hide, nor reason to hide.  He is still however a worthless piece of shit that makes you, the conspirscy believer, look like a goddamn nutty fool.  Do not allow yourself to be associated with this shill.

       I wish.  Simply an insane hatred of sold out, busted up, bullshit acts preach "truth," while doing the exact opposite.  He is so clearly an actor, a poor one at that, makes us all look bad.  Some of the outlandish "predictions" he has made are simply unbelievable as chance. He is fed certain information they are ok with release and discussion of.  The rest is.just fear-mongering nonsense and product shilling.  Just like he does.with the politics.  Selling exaxtly what and how his master tells him to.

       You obviously don't know his background then.
He's been fairly consistent on his views since he was in college.
You think he's been a shill-actor since then? There are videos of him from around age 23, talking against the NWO.
You think they wanted him to sneak into Bohemian Grove?
I agree he doesn't expose israel very much, and his wife is jewish, but that doesn't mean he's a pro-israel disinformant shill. It probably means he has some sponsors that are jewish. Exposing jews isnt the only way to get the "truth" out. He does inform of some truth....
      </p>
      <p>
       and everyone knows how easy it is to be called anti-semitic, which is probably something he doesn't want to be labeled as.

       He was propped up from a young age, yes.  Look to his family history in the corrupt intelligence community.  He has been a paid disinformation agent as long as he has been on the air.

       He makes us look bad with his poor acting.  I'm glad to see many are waking up snd recognizing his corruption.

       Fight for freedom? Wow, you've been blinded by the intense douche light right here, it would seem.  Name one time where the paid actor Alex Jones has EVER fought for or scheived freedom.  He keeps his listeners in perpetual fear, doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  He is doing his job of being controlled opposition fairly well, if he had been able to capture you.

       He's not a puppet. There are just certain things he will never say. Not because he doesn't believe them, but because he knows that to talk about certain topics will damage his radio business. First among those taboo topics is Jews. Alex is never going to say anything against the Jews who control Congress, the Fed, Wall Street, the major banks, and the mainstream media in America. He doesn't even like to say anything against Israel. Every now and then he will offer a tepid criticism of Israel, but it is always muted. He never rants against Israel. he never even mentions Jewish control over the media, or Jewish bribery of Congress.

       he is connected to certain elements of the power structure. i wouldn't call him white hat. But i haven't come to the conclusion that he is a black hat.

       Looking to what he does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       say should speak volumes to you.  He is 100% corrupted bullshit.  Meant only to cause fear and inaction for his viewers.  He is controlled opposition.  A very poor actor.

       I put him on the same shelf as schiff and celente. I like to watch them from time to time and they do offer some good information, but they're doom mongers. If you know that, you can use them for what they are just as you might the nyt or nbc. Understand their bias and you can filter out the good bits.

       He is nothing more than a pro-Israeli piece of shit paid actor.  He releases controlled information.  Telling you about the event, and also how to view the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way, he is s Rush Limbaugh for those who see through the constant conspiracies.  Do not buy his lies, or his shitty products.

       The one were discussing here is 100% controlled opposition.  Proven clearly time snd.time again.  His 9/11 knowledge places him with the group that executed the attack on innocent American citizens.  It was not Al Qaeda, though this terrorist group does hate us for our freedoms.
