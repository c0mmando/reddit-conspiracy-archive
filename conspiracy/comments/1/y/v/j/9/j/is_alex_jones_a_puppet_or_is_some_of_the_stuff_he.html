    <div class="md"><p>He brings up some legitimate stuff.
Most his movies are somewhat decent.</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t watch his show every day, or else youll go crazy lol.
He does overly exaggerate a lot of things, and a lot of times he gets his facts wrong.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a puppet.
I believe deep down, he&#39;s on the &#39;good&#39; side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish.  Simply an insane hatred of sold out, busted up, bullshit acts preach &quot;truth,&quot; while doing the exact opposite.  He is so clearly an actor, a poor one at that, makes us all look bad.  Some of the outlandish &quot;predictions&quot; he has made are simply unbelievable as chance. He is fed certain information they are ok with release and discussion of.  The rest is.just fear-mongering nonsense and product shilling.  Just like he does.with the politics.  Selling exaxtly what and how his master tells him to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously don&#39;t know his background then.
He&#39;s been fairly consistent on his views since he was in college.
You think he&#39;s been a shill-actor since then? There are videos of him from around age 23, talking against the NWO.
You think they wanted him to sneak into Bohemian Grove?
I agree he doesn&#39;t expose israel very much, and his wife is jewish, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a pro-israel disinformant shill. It probably means he has some sponsors that are jewish. Exposing jews isnt the only way to get the &quot;truth&quot; out. He does inform of some truth.... </p>

<p>and everyone knows how easy it is to be called anti-semitic, which is probably something he doesn&#39;t want to be labeled as.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not a puppet. There are just certain things he will never say. Not because he doesn&#39;t believe them, but because he knows that to talk about certain topics will damage his radio business. First among those taboo topics is Jews. Alex is never going to say anything against the Jews who control Congress, the Fed, Wall Street, the major banks, and the mainstream media in America. He doesn&#39;t even like to say anything against Israel. Every now and then he will offer a tepid criticism of Israel, but it is always muted. He never rants against Israel. he never even mentions Jewish control over the media, or Jewish bribery of Congress.</p>
