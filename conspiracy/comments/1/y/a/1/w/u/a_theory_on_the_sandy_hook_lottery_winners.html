    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked into this - and was in fact the OP of the banned content. </p>

<p>I think this is the conclusion people thought/assumed I had come to.</p>

<p>In fact, I think it may not be related- directly- at all.</p>

<p>I think the lottery holds lies, and SH holds lies.</p>

<p>I think sometimes conspiracies overlap for myriad reasons, and this may be one of those &quot;correlated not causal&quot; relationships. </p>

<p>eg. Family of John Doe is victim in shooting. Doe wins lottery 4 times in past 3 years.</p>

<p>Well, maybe Doe is just a man who gets involved in bad shit, scandal, and is not a straight shooter. Maybe Doe was involved in Operation Scum Lottery, <em>and</em> involved in some SH false flag event. </p>

<p>I do not think the lottery is the source for victim&#39;s families getting any money, after being the one who found the facts amounts dates winnings etc.... and a lot of research, I do not <em>think</em> that is the case.</p>

<p>I believe both have conspiratorial elements, and on initial inspection the sighting of an overlap of names was shocking, but I do not think it is necessarily a direct causal connection. </p>

<p>Edit:  Where there is smoke, there is fire. Sandy Hook and Newtown lottery repeat winners occur at a  higher frequency than other locations in CT, and CT overall has the highest repeat lottery winners that I could find of any state that posts its winners. I think there are easier, safer, more likely, more commonly used, less detectable ways for LARGE SCALE OPS to get funds moved (Non profits and donations are BIG)</p>

<p>I think the lottery and gambling is much more typically tied to mafia connections and less politically affiliated events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What seems odd to me is that we have seen some of the crisis actors use different names at different events.  For example <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDMzbmxISIA">Victoria Munoz/Brenda Baca King/Liz</a>.  Why would they use the same name again when cashing the lottery tickets?   Have you found any instances where 2 psuedonyms of the same crisis actor have both been lottery winners?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not, and I also have never made any statements or implications about &#39;crisis actors&#39;.  I don&#39;t know enough about that area of speculation to make a statement on it. Even when I researched it, I couldn&#39;t really come to an opinion about it.</p>

<p>So, my point is, is that people with the same name as 2 of the SH parents (or those people themselves) had won the lottery several times. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have an opinion or idea about the concept of crisis actors. </p>

<p>To be honest, I do not know what is real about this whole event at all.</p>

<p>I do not know what I believe yet about what really happened, and what was staged, if anything, etc. so I&#39;m not speculating until I have more solid footing.  If there was no staging a crime scene, there may have been no crisis actors. I just don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lottery winners are announced publicly. Also, these things are kept under a pretty tight lid specifically to prevent lottery rigging. The amount of people in the public eye you&#39;d have to keep silent, despite the fact that obviously someone would see it and start questioning it... pretty complicated and easily fallible scheme, right? Hell, the whole scheme would probably cost <em>more than the amount of money they transferred.</em></p>

<p>Now, compare that with dropping off a few hundred thousand dollars cash. It&#39;s practically trivial. That amount of cash you could stick in a coat pocket. And nobody would ever figure it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, and also would like to point out how there <em>may</em> be the (false?) security of, &#39;Hey put it out in the open because NO ONE would think we would have the balls to do this.&#39;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it done first hand, not with financial things or lottery, but a large &quot;spin&quot; on the truth within the govt org I worked for at the time. There were meetings, and memos, and everything in writing and it seemed so....obvious and overt. I was fresh out of college and mentioned it to a more seasoned coworker and he explained to me that often times, as he had seen, the worse the lie, the more open aspects of it. It served many purposes.</p>

<p>It made the wrongdoers feel less guilty, it made them feel safer, and the feeling was &#39;If this were true, this horrible LIE, would we <em>EVER</em> put it right up in our memo minutes onLINE?!&#39;</p>

<p>In government, if you are going to lie, it is this unspoken indoctrination of Lie Big. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is an instance of that, just that based on my experience I can&#39;t rule it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, very likely proof that the lottery is a scam, and has been used in the past to make dirty payments appear to be clean.  The 150k is a small amount.  But couple that with the many millions they will see from congressional funds, donations to the people and the inordinate amount of non profits the &quot;victim&quot; families run, and the free homes, and the picture becomea quite clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the issue with the boston marathin bombings is that the pictures werent convincing. In none of the photos that were released did any prove the guilt of the suspect. That, coupled with the part where one of the suspects or whatever was killed during an FBI interview, and the part where they wont release any of their supposed &quot;hard evidence&quot; makes people skeptical of that event.</p>

<p>Sandy hook is similar, but without any photos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An elementary school i went to in a small town in virginia that was built over fifteen years ago had and still has several security cameras set up. But, not all elementary schools are built equally. However, i remember reading that sandy hook elementary had a security protocol that used a camera to see who is at the front door before unlocking it to allow them to come in. SHE shouldve had plenty of cameras and opportunities to get his photo.</p>

<p>So, i wouldnt question that part, just the part as to why we havent seen those photos.</p>
