        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I call it &quot;the limited hangout theory&quot; for its overarching explanation, but its more like the leading hypothesis because of the minimal information that we have been exposed to. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been sitting on the fence for a while now, honestly trying to view this situation without any bias and hoping for future &quot;revelations&quot; to convince me that Snowden was a genuine whistle-blower (because the leaks kept showing up periodically). Prominent people that made me curious about the &quot;limited hangout&quot; idea were Webster Tarpley and Naomi wolf:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/06/18/309609/how-to-identify-cia-limited-hangout-op/">Tarpley&#39;s article</a></p>

<p><a href="http://naomiwolf.org/2013/06/my-creeping-concern-that-the-nsa-leaker-is-not-who-he-purports-to-be/">Wolf</a> </p>

<p>And <a href="http://publicconspiracy.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/rconspiracy-links-for-snowden-limited-hangout-op/">here&#39;s</a> a collection worth mentioning of other bloggers that someone gathered. (Edit: seems to be <a href="/u/ObeyTheCowGod">/u/ObeyTheCowGod</a>. Thanks for the links).</p>

<p>Their biggest argument was that we have only seen garbage revelations heretofore, which benefited the NSA and not the other way around. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t entirely convinced, so I looked into it. The best timeline of the &quot;leaks&quot; I&#39;ve found is <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/multimedia/timeline-edward-snowden-revelations.html">Al Jazeera&#39;s</a>. I don&#39;t think you need to doubt its validity, since it&#39;s a collection of mainstream articles anyway. </p>

<p>You can follow the timeline for yourself, and you would find that the most incriminating article is from <a href="http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/10/ministerio-das-minas-e-energia-esta-na-mira-de-espioes-americanos-e-canadenses.html">Globo</a> that showed how companies in Brazil were being spied on. The big catch? It&#39;s the only leak showing that it was perpetrated by the Canadian intelligence agency, not the NSA (besides monitoring Canadian citizens in airports). There is another one that tells us the NSA <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/how-the-nsa-and-gchq-spied-on-opec-a-932777.html">spied on OPEC</a>, a collection of <a href="http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/25.htm">Arab countries and Venezuela</a>, most of which have had their sovereignty compromised anyway. A worthless leak. Spying on Iraq is supposed to be big news after the entire country has been leveled to the ground?</p>

<p>Those who doubt the Snowden charade also say that the NSA&#39;s main motive is to make people aware of the fact that they&#39;re being monitored. Sort of like sending a clear message of &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot;. The diplomatic leaks fall under this category as well, but they also imply a serious threat to the nations&#39; autonomy, like intercepting the calls of Germany&#39;s Merkel. Nothing came of it, but people are now a tiny bit more accustomed to the idea of a one world government.</p>

<p>Besides these leaks, it&#39;s all garbage. Many were waiting for anything on 9/11, but all they got was that the NSA was pushing its spokespeople to promote the official 9/11 narrative, in order to <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/30/revealed-nsa-pushed911askeysoundbitetojustifysurveillance.html">to justify the program</a>. An idea so prevalent in society that it&#39;s used as satire in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YOh-rpvjYg&amp;t=0m46s">cartoons</a>. </p>

<p>Some articles are even used as a mouthpiece for the NSA, like how <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-documents-detail-al-qaedas-efforts-to-fight-back-against-drones/2013/09/03/b83e7654-11c0-11e3-b630-36617ca6640f_story.html">&quot;Al Qaeda&quot; are trying to hijack the drones</a>. You should also know by now that anyone even using the words &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; is full of shit.</p>

<p>The spark that lit the fuse for me was the leak released today: <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/02/18/snowden-docs-reveal-covert-surveillance-and-pressure-tactics-aimed-at-wikileaks-and-its-supporters/">Wikileaks and other activist groups being monitored</a>, which by the way was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1y86j0/glenn_greenwald_topsecret_documents_from_the/">top post</a> in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> a while ago. The article clearly shows how the NSA was <strong>only</strong> targeting foreign activists like Anonymous. An organization that doesn&#39;t include domestic activists, as we all know. My BS-detector went haywire after that, which made me write this post. (Tarpley mentions Wikileaks as another limited hangout operation, which I&#39;m undecided about).</p>

<p>Another argument for it is that Snowden has received a lot of attention from the MSM. This only hints to him being controlled, it&#39;s not proof. But it still makes you consider why.</p>

<p>Does it mean that Greenwald is part of it as well? I have no idea. There is a possibility that he naively releases the leaks without being compromised. That&#39;s for you to decide, and I would love to hear your opinion on it. </p>

<p>If you feel like I&#39;ve made a factual error somewhere or want me to include anything of importance, please say so. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

<p><a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/multimedia/timeline-edward-snowden-revelations.html">Here&#39;s</a> the source, but you can look these up anywhere.</p>

<p>How are these &quot;garbage&quot; revelations?  What more, exactly, could you possibly be expecting?  This is a whole array of smoking guns, and you want what...?</p>

<p>Your logic is exactly what one might expect from the mainstream media apparatus. </p>

<p>Revelations from Edward Snowden haven&#39;t changed the military-industrial-media complex. In fact, now that Americans know all this &quot;garbage,&quot; (I agree with OP) what has the NSA done to stop recording conversations?</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s reforms to the NSA are a joke:</p>

<p>In allowing the NSA to continue its actual bulk collection of the phone metadata, Obama defended the need for sophisticated surveillance in a digital world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We cannot prevent terrorist attacks or cyber-threats without some capability to penetrate digital communications,” Obama said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What more could I be expecting? <strong>Change</strong> the policies.</p>

<p>Informing the public at large that they are indeed being spied upon isn&#39;t change.</p>

<p>I agree - but that&#39;s not his fault, and neither does it prove that he&#39;s a fake.  Again, what more do you want from the guy?  He gave up his career and his home to get us this information.  If we have been unable to act on it, it isn&#39;t his fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We ought to be angry at the journalists. Journalists and media elites run the country. It&#39;s they who mold the public&#39;s group mind. Yes, in theory, every citizen may come to an independent judgement on important questions and demand change. In practice, the media makes us think whatever they want. Only the media, and certain public figures, can loudly speak truth to power. These individuals and entities largely decide what the masses are to believe. This is a sad fact, but it&#39;s true. And it&#39;s never been more clear. You can march 50,000 activists to the steps of the Capitol tomorrow. If the media calls you a bunch of lunatics, that&#39;s what you are in the minds of America, and the government is free to deal with you accordingly. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tagged him multiple times as being a possible subverter, you have to look out for these people.</p>

<p>You can tell he&#39;s suspect because he always uses extremely poor attempts to derail conversations, mostly false assertions and false equivocations.</p>

<p>I think <a href="/u/cutanddriedamericana">/u/cutanddriedamericana</a> may be a subverter too, look at how he tries to look legitimate, but then instantly resorts to all of the known rhetorical shill tactics of discrediting and derailing comments.</p>

<p>My advice is keep your feet on the ground. Don&#39;t try to make people work for you, ya know? If you like everything about him, but the sex is only okay, train him.

<p>You just built a retort on whether Snowden is fake or not. It doesn&#39;t matter. Nothing has changed since his revelations were revealed. Your list of leaks doesn&#39;t prove Snowden is legit so technically you aren&#39;t commenting on the topic either. Switching the goal posts is a simple tactic.
Well done.</p>

<p>However, this leak is the &quot;only big one&quot;, even though it&#39;s huge, but it is explained by Tarpley and co. with: it was their intention from the beginning. You&#39;re supposed to know that they&#39;re monitoring you, otherwise the surveillance state is not as effective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, you are right to question this. I do too. I mean with the glaring evidence of 9/11 and other false flags, we should question everything. </p>

<p>I still think Snowden is legit. Of course the only way to know is if he gets caught, will he end up like Chelsea Manning? </p>

<p>From a lot of independent accounts, he seems to really be hanging out in Russia. There seems to be no advantage to him; no big payout. Unless branches of the US government threatened his friends and family if he didn&#39;t do this, it seems like there&#39;s no advantage to him. Unless he&#39;s a true brainwashed believer, trained to spread this type of dis-info.</p>

<p>Not a lot has happened, that&#39;s true. But I think that&#39;s more of a failure of an immovable system that is the US Empire. There are so many Americans and non-Americans constantly protesting  over the domestic spying, trying to do what they can, but the US congress and senate just sit on their hands. </p>

<p>The revelations are major, and it is odd that the US acknowledged that it was all true instead of denying all of it. Could the US actually not have any of these capabilities (they are all very technology challenging, especially broken encryption) and be using this as a means to trick the world into thinking they have more power than what is technologically possible? It seems like a valid theory.</p>

<p>Still, in light of balancing everything I&#39;ve seen and heard, I&#39;m still going to tip to the side of Snowden being a legit hero to the human race, just like Manning and William Binney. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Id be careful about labeling people with stereotypes like hero or traitor or terrorist. The mind has a tenancy to cling to stereotypes in an attempt to make meaning of something when we don&#39;t have enough information. This tends to create positive or negative polarity charges in the brain which is part of the divide and conquer strategy powerful people have had in effect for hundreds of years now. When we believe or disbelieve too much, we create barriers between each other. We will never be free of manipulation if we can&#39;t break free of the duality these states bring.   We have to constantly be vigilant of being drawn to strongly to either side of a situation. It has the effect of blinding people from truth.</p>

<p>It also seems to support the limited hang out theory, when you believe in something you tend to have loyalty to it without question. I can already see many of these posts with strong negative opinions against this idea. And the only reason why that is is people dont want to consider the fact that they took too strongly to a view.</p>

<p><em>&quot; The Masses have never thirsted after truth. They turn aside from evidence that is not to their taste, preferring to deify error, if error seduce them. Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master; whoever attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim.&quot;</em></p>

<p>-Gustave Le Bon.</p>

<p>Remember that when you go off your rocker about some opinion that isnt in line with what you believe. And remember that when you have an opinion that goes against a group with a strong mindset to believe anything that frees them from any real action on their part to discover the truth for themselves.</p>

<p>And besides nobody is a hero or a traitor or a thief. We are all shades of grey looking for the right action to take in a world of lies and deceit. We can&#39;t ask people or put more onto people than what there actions dictate.</p>

<p>As for me, I don&#39;t know if this is true or not. It frustrates me because I dont know what to believe. so you know what, I&#39;m just not going to believe anything an act as if everything is a lie. The only truth for me is in right action toward making me free and when I become free everyone else becomes free.</p>

<p>This does remind me of a movie I recently watched though. If you get a chance go watch &quot;Promised Land&quot;. </p>

<p>(spoiler alert)</p>

<p>In that film the gas company employes people who setup fake activist groups to take a fall so that they can control the debate around fracking. And this sounds an awful lot like what is happening with Snoden. Plus I dont think it would be possible for him to stay alive this long, regardless of the reasons that have been brought up. They would find a way to make it look like an accident. If he was really spreading truth it would be over real quick. But thats MHO.</p>

<p>Since he has such a calm demeanor and considering what he gave up, I&#39;d say he must be convinced that he is completely safe. Did he make a deal to go through a potential Hollywood style court-hearing in the future, just to be exonerated? Or will he get got? Only time will tell us. But even if he was made to disappear, it could mean that they screwed him over. </p>

<p>Tarpley explains this with him being a &quot;triple agent&quot;. Don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sufficient explanation, but my suspicion is that Russia is keeping him on a tight leash, without any privileges besides giving the US the benefit to claim that he resides there. </p>

<p>You are almost certainly not looking for truth because if you were then you would see that the facts do not line up with your conclusions. Look at the parent comment which highlights a plethora of new information revealed by Snowden. Suggesting or highlighting claims which are unsubstantiated are useless to having intelligent discussion, everyone agrees this is bad when you look at Fox News, but when you look at unsubstantiated or refuted conspiracies, suddenly it&#39;s something controversial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is another tidbit from the book &quot;The Crowd&quot; I was reading today. It came to mind to share it in regards to this topic and is very relevant.</p>

<p><em>&quot;To understand this phenomenon [contagious acts on the part of the hypnotizer, hypothetically we could regard the contagion being Snoden&#39;s revaluations if we agree that it’s possible that he could be a NSA plant.] it is necessary to bear in mind certain recent physiological discoveries. We know today that by various processes an individual may be brought into such a condition that, having entirely lost his conscious personality, he obeys all the suggestions of the operator who has deprived him of it, and commits acts in utter contradiction with his character and habits. The most careful observations seem to prove that an individual emerged for some length of time in a crowd in action soon finds himself--either in consequence of the magnetic influence given out by the crowd, or from some other cause of which we are ignorant--in a special state, which much resembles that state of fascination of which the hypnotized individual finds himself in the hands of the hypnotiser [In this hypothetical case Snoden]. The activity of the brain being paralyzed in the case of the hypnotised subject, the latter becomes the slave of all the unconscious activities of his spinal cord, which the hypnotiser directs at will. The conscious personality has entirely vanished; will and discernment are lost. All feelings and thoughts are bent in the direction determined by the hypnotiser.&quot;</em></p>

<p>--The Crowd, by Gustave Le Bon</p>

<p>I really think this happens when someone with enough influence attempts to deceive the public by creating false prophets to maintain a level of control by divulging information already in circulation [Which is in fact what Snowden’s revelations are doing for the most part and also keeping people hooked into these small divulgances.] to the point where it builds in credibility due to popular opinion. Without conflicting information, groups tend to take this information as creditable simple because of the way it was circulated without really looking at all of the angles as to why it was circulated and under what circumstances it was circulated.
If are really committed to the truth we have to look at this. I think the OP has a point.</p>

<p>I love this birds-eye view over the situation. It&#39;s actually one that I hadn&#39;t considered before. Just shows you how cunning the American intelligence agencies really are.</p>

<p>People who don&#39;t understand the power of the public knowing that it&#39;s being watched haven&#39;t experienced something similar. I known people who have, and they tell me how they feared that even the walls had ears. </p>

<p>Moreover, everyone has skeletons in their closet, which really does paralyze some from doing anything. Either consciously or subconsciously, which makes the bulk-collection an evil action in and of itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you care to elaborate then, on the implications of said documents, and how these &quot;revelations&quot; prove Snowden is not being used to advance the global spy apparatuses power?</p>

<p>All he is doing is revealing documents exposing the DETAILS on information that was already revealed to us over 20 years ago.</p>

<p>I quote from page 200 of &quot;Behold A Pale Horse&quot; published by William Milton Cooper in 1991: &quot;The secondary purpose of the nsa was to monitor all communications and emissions from any and all electronic devices world wide for the purpose of gathering intelligence&quot;</p>

<p>ALL communications, ANY electronic device, WORLD WIDE.</p>

<p>This information was revealed 20 years ago, how are Snowdens details of said program helping anybody but the powers that be?</p>

<p>Is nobody considering the possibility that all of these gigantic political issues ( poverty, privacy, corruption ) are all seemingly coming to a giant head in what appears to be an engineered period of chaos?</p>

<p>Look at all the propaganda they are constantly putting out in an attempt to brainwash us into becoming violent at the first signs of social disorder ( American Blackout is just one recent example ).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. So no actual specific reason then. Their are supposedly around 2 million documents. Only 900 have been released so far. Greenwald was just given 250 million dollars by one of the tycoons involved in the constellation of companies involved in NSA internet spying to set up his own media business. Can you say quid pro quo. Snowdon doesn&#39;t have a problem with this and hasn&#39;t complained about the obvious conflict of interest that greenwald has. If snowden is legit why isn&#39;t he screaming blue bloody murder that his leaks now and always were vetted and sanitised by the very same security agenda he claims is a problem? The answer is because as snowden has said himself he is actually ok with spying.</p>

<p>And of course he doesn&#39;t have a problem with spying. Why would he?
He has a problem with the systematic gathering of information of private citizens who have done nothing to warrant surveillance.</p>

<p>There is a pretty big difference between spying on one&#39;s opposition, and spying on <em>everyone</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So my spell checker sometimes put in surveillance and other times put in subservience. Each time I meant surveillance but for my argument it worked out better than I could have ever have come up with on my own so I left it that way. I have been busy with stuff but have been thinking about this and letting it brew away in my head. I think it is important so I put some effort into it. I did search for the perfect link for you. The blogosphere has plenty of material on the topic and I did consider just linking you to the google search of &quot;Greenwald Omydiyar Criticism&quot; and letting you do the leg work yourself but I thought that was too chancy. In the end I couldn&#39;t settle on just one so first up we have Yoichi Shimatsu</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/saving.html">http://www.rense.com/general96/saving.html</a></p>

<p>For my purposes I sumerise the important points as follows</p>

<p>Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Jeremy Scahill are being bankrolled in the launch of their new media organisation by Pierre Omidyar who</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In stark contrast to his libertarian posturing, Omidyar is connected at the hip to the very same intelligence nexus that he publicly condemns, particularly Booz Allen Hamilton, the NSA security contractor that employed Snowden in Hawaii and Japan . One of the major investment partners with Omidyar Network, Salvadore ”Sal” Gambianco, sits on the board of directors of Booz Allen Hamilton Holdings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and later in the same article</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The relationship, simply put, is corporate collusion, and if businesses could be married, Booz Allen and Omidyar Network are husband and wife.</p>

<p>Inside the NSA’s Big Tent</p>

<p>Booz Allen and Omidyar Network are corporate members of an NSA-linked consortium called Innocentive, a consultancy focused on crowdsourcing (read: data-mining of public-opinion polls, consumer surveys and Internet-based personal data). Other member-companies include In-Q-Tel, a developer of communications monitoring software spawned with millions in start-up capital from the CIA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t it seem kind of suspicious that a bunch of investigative journalist like that wouldn&#39;t have done their due diligence on Omidyar</p>

<p>And then we have this from Arthur Silber which I will let stand on its own.</p>

<p><a href="http://powerofnarrative.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/the-doctrine-of-exceptionalism-extends.html">http://powerofnarrative.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/the-doctrine-of-exceptionalism-extends.html</a></p>

<p>Both of the links are about Greenwald rather than Snowden and the Yoichi Shimatsu article in particular paints Snowden as a dupe rather than a co conspirator.</p>

<p>Another important voice in the critisim of Omidyar is of course Mark Ames over at Pando if you want to look that up.</p>

<p>As to the difference of mass surveillance compared to spying and Snowden&#39;s attitudes himself towards this question that is rather more complicated. In Snowdens own word he doesn&#39;t seem particularly concerned if his leaks have caused positive change or not. The act of leaking was enough for him and it seems he never was an activist. He gave the public a chance to make a choice and if the choice of the public was to accept mass surveillance then he is ok with that. In his own words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn’t want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.</p>

<p>“All I wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/24/edward-snowden-i-already-won">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/24/edward-snowden-i-already-won</a></p>

<p>Now that just seems like a very fucking luke warm kind of justification for betraying his past. Lets remember this is a man that claims to have trained as a special forces soldier. Yeah right. He was CIA too. Allegedly. And supposedly I am to believe he betrayed these very serious gentlemen, his brothers in arms, and now after it all goes down with a whimper and the mass subservience continues he is cool. He asked the question if the people were ok with mass surveillance and the answer is in. Surveillance continues and Snowden is happy that the question was asked and answered. Never mind the odd call from &quot;enemies&quot; on the internet that he be &quot;suicided&quot; or warning from &quot;friends&quot; that he should be worried about being &quot;suicided&quot; or that call from an actual member of the establishment that he be killed judicially, he is all cool with that. Hey he asked the question and that is all he ever wanted to do. Give me a fucking break. His mission is accomplished all right. His mission was acclimatisation to mass subservience all along and it is mission accomplished. High fives all around. Soon he might even get clemency of some sort and be canonized as an <em>American Freedom Saint</em> <sup>TM.</sup> . Where is the detailed plan to role back mass subservience again? Where is the billionaire Omydiyar complaining that the plan to role back mass surveillance will hurt his business. OH that&#39;s right. Neither private sector surveillance oligarchs like Omydiyar or public sector subservience Czars like Feinstein are complaining about the plan to role back surveillance because that plan doesn&#39;t exist. I guess we forgot that small detail of seeing actual action while we were busy basking in Snowden&#39;s awesome bravery.</p>

<p>As always, this is just my opinion. Of course I could be wrong and Snowden could be a real hero. I would feel a fool then. As it is now I can only call it how I see it and this is how I see it. I did write this other bit before and the OP linked to it in his original submission. It might give you more of an idea of where I am coming from.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1we1kd/new_edward_snowden_interview_instead_of_circling/cf1c5e0">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1we1kd/new_edward_snowden_interview_instead_of_circling/cf1c5e0</a></p>

<p>Another person in this thread wrote that the OP&#39;s submission was just preaching to the choir here in r/conspiracy. I up voted that because I am part of that choir, or less charitably echo chamber if you prefer, yet I still think that within this idea that Snowden is manufactured there is still much to discuss and many different possible interpretations.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim any sort of special knowledge and welcome your insights and criticisms.</p>

<p>Great. This is not a source that the general public or MSM take as credible. Just because one widely perceived loon was spouting it twenty years ago doesn&#39;t mean it was in the public focus.

<p>FTFY, we tend to assume that one account equals one person, but that is not the case. There is a lot of &quot;persona management&quot; software out there making it trivial for one person to have hundreds of accounts, including services where each account would have a different IP.</p>

<p>USA and UK monitor foreign diplomats - How does that revelation help me?</p>

<p>NSA keeps tabs on German citizens - Again, how does that help me?</p>

<p>Australia is doing it too - See France</p>

<p>NSA listens to latin calls - Whoopty fucking doo, how the fuck does that help me as an American citizen?</p>

<p>US illegally takes my emails - I guess this benefits me so I know not to do illegal stuff over email? Oh wait, I&#39;m not supposed to do that anyways and if I do and get caught it&#39;s my fault regardless of how the information was obtained for knowingly committing illegal acts. This &quot;revelation&quot; does NOT benefit me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even going to continue because YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT.</p>

<p>All Snowden has revealed is information that WE ALREADY KNOW.</p>

<p>Knowing this stuff DOESN&#39;T HELP US when nobody is willing to overturn any of it.</p>

<p>TL;DR - ALL OF THIS INFORMATION WAS REVEALED IN THE YEAR 1991 BY WILLIAM MILTON COOPER.</p>

<p>AND I QUOTE, from Page 200 of &quot;Behold A Pale Horse&quot; - </p>

<p>&quot;President Truman created the supersecret Nation Security Agency (NSA) by secret Executive order on November 4,1952. It&#39;s primary purpose was to decipher the alien communications, language, and establish a dialogue with the extraterrestrials. This most urgent task was a continuation of the earlier effort. The secondary purpose of the nsa was to monitor all communications and emissions from any and all electronic devices world wide for the purpose of gathering intelligence, both humans and alien, and to contain the secret of the alien presence. Project SIGMA was successful.</p>

<p>The NSA also maintains communications with the Luna base and other secret space programs. By executive order of the President, the NSA is exempt from all laws which do not specifically name the NSA in the text of the law as being subject to that law. That means that if the agency is not spelled out in the text of any and every law passed by the Congress it is not subject to that or those laws. The NSA now performs many other duties and in fact is the premier agency within the intelligence network. Today the NSA receives approximately 75% of the monies allotted to the intelligence community. The old saying &quot;where the money goes therein the power resides&quot; is true. The DCI today is a figurehead maintained as a public ruse. The primary task of the NSA is still alien communication s, but now includes other extraterrestrial projects as well.</p>

<p>Let me quote the relevant part again:</p>

<p>&quot;The secondary purpose of the nsa was to monitor all communications and emissions from any and all electronic devices world wide for the purpose of gathering intelligence&quot;</p>

<p>Oh man, it&#39;s like Snowden is a JOKE and EVERYTHING HE IS SAYING has already been revealed OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO.</p>

<p>His &quot;detailed information&quot; of who is spying on who is a fucking joke and benefits nobody but the global power structure who is using this as a SHOW to exert their power of total control over the masses.</p>

<p>We SEE and HEAR EVERYTHING, AND THERE&#39;S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT, AHAHAHHAHAA!!!!!!</p>

<p>THAT is the purpose of Edward Snowden.</p>

<p>I believe he very well may be genuine, but that they&#39;re using him, because all he&#39;s doing is revealing details about information that was already revealed over twenty years ago.</p>

<p>I feel that you may be right. People have known about illegal government spying for a very long time, yet it is only now that the media decides to run the story. You are right, he has only released garbage so far - no information about who took out the put options on the airlines in the days before 9/11, no startling revelations other than &quot;Our panopticon is fully operational, citizens.

<p>also interesting to look at Snowden&#39;s first words to Greenwald: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edward Snowden: &quot;My name is Ed Snowden, I&#39;m 29 years old. I worked for Booz Allen Hamilton as an infrastructure analyst for NSA in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Glenn Greenwald: &quot;What are some of the positions that you held previously within the intelligence community?&quot;</p>

<p>Snowden: &quot;I&#39;ve been a systems engineer, systems administrator, senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency, solutions consultant, and a telecommunications informations system officer.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...now connect the CIA-Booz Allen dots via GHW Bush and James Clapper...and Mike McConnell (etc)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current of director of national intelligence (DNI), <strong>James Clapper</strong>, who issued a stinging attack on the intelligence leaks this weekend, is a former Booz Allen executive. The firm&#39;s current vice-chairman, <strong>Mike McConnell</strong>, was DNI under the George W Bush administration. He worked for the Virginia-based company before taking the job, and returned to the firm after leaving it. The company website says McConnell is responsible for its &quot;rapidly expanding cyber business&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>James Woolsey</strong>, a former CIA director was also a Booz Allen vice-president, and Melissa Hathaway, another former company executive also once worked as the top aide on cybersecurity to McConnell when he was DNI. The company headquarters in the leafy Washington suburb of McLean in northern Virginia, close to CIA headquarters and home to former and current intelligence officers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Snowden as a limited hangout would also explain how there has been no blowback within the intelligence community (no loss of funds, no firings of top officials, no prosecutions).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have 0 idea what is going on. all i can do is guess. but i like to listen to like to watch old videos of radio shows on youtube or whatever. sometimes they are 5-10 years old. i can&#39;t recall which one but it was opie and anthony and the reason i listened to it was because of patrice o&#39;neal was a special guest. they were talking about conspiracies. a guy calls and says pretty much everything snowden is saying. how he works for our government but he can&#39;t say what that he can look into anyone he chooses. they started asking him questions like &quot;if this is true why are you allowed to say anything.&quot; supposedly this guy was out in a motel and it didn&#39;t matter because &quot;they&quot; were already looking for him anyway and he doesn&#39;t have much time until he&#39;s &quot;black bagged&quot; he said this back in 2008-09. opie, anthony and patrice didn&#39;t give much merrit to the guy at the time. but u could hear it in there voices that they didn&#39;t doubt him either. i think most people think like that though. </p>

<p>but what im trying to get at is i think a lot of things are shown to us but we choose to write people off quickly and that&#39;s what makes it so easy for our government to do things like this to us. it takes something giant like this to finally get people to believe.</p>

<p>again i don&#39;t have the answers i but i figure this is a good place to post this</p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure what you mean by </p>

<blockquote>
<p>in 2001, he never got in trouble because he just predicted this stuff would happen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As copied from the link you provided it looks like he had a bit of trouble. All depends on your meaning of trouble</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After he left the NSA in 2001, Binney was one of several people investigated as part of an inquiry into the 2005 New York Times exposé[11][12] on the agency’s warrantless eavesdropping program. Binney was cleared of wrongdoing after three interviews with FBI agents beginning in March 2007, but one morning in July 2007, a dozen agents armed with rifles appeared at his house, one of whom entered the bathroom and pointed his gun at Binney, still towelling off from a shower. In that raid, the FBI confiscated a desktop computer, disks, and personal and business records. The NSA revoked his security clearance, forcing him to close a business he ran with former colleagues at a loss of a reported $300,000 in annual income. In 2012, Binney and his co-plaintiffs went to federal court to get the items back. Binney spent more than $7,000 on legal fees.[13]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally having a gun pointed at me while getting out of the shower, I would deem that as trouble.</p>

<p>Binney is brave man and if you are unsure of his background look him up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong about your dates with regard to the phone hacking scandal.</p>

<p>According to Al Jazeera&#39;s Snowden timeline the Guardian broke the story in June 2013.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia David Cameron announced a public inquiry into the phone hacking scandal in July 2011 and after relentless public condemnation and boycotts The News of The World printed its last paper just a few days later. A criminal police investigation into the scandal was already completed by this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My best guess is that Greenwald is compromised. Snowden let Greenwald acquire the rights to all leaks. Which is why in the recent interview, every time Snowden was asked a pointed question, he had to defer to the journalistic proclivities of those in the know. Which was to say, he has a deal with Greenwald for exclusivity, and cannot violate that deal. Probably because his safety depends on it. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also note that stormtroopers raided the Guardian offices for Snowden&#39;s original laptop and took extreme efforts to destroy it. Even after they had been assured that many many copies of the data had already been made. Why would this happen, and moreover why would it be made public? </p>

<p>Two reasons, that I can see. 1) it gives the Guardian plausible deniability of being &quot;on our side&quot; and up against the State. 2) even if Snowden gave up all rights to the leaked docs, he might be able to make a claim on his own laptop as his own property and the contents of. </p>

<p>So the destruction of the laptop strikes me as a finalization of whatever deal was made between Snowden, Greenwald, et. al. because if I remember correctly, the Russian interview came shortly thereafter. </p>

<p>If Greenwald is compromised, then it&#39;s nothing to make sure that the most incriminating leaks never come out under the guise of being Snowden&#39;s &#39;nuclear option&#39; should he come to bodily harm from those other than his employers. Greenwald still needs to produce every so often, however. So he works from an approved list of leaks. </p>

<p>This is all my speculation, based on the premise that this is a operation and not a legitimate leak. In reality, I think it&#39;s a mix of the two. I think Snowden was genuinely not expected, and that there are many forces at play behind the scenes, wheeling and dealing, all fighting for their livelyhood. </p>

<p>As an addendum, I think these bankers are dying because some major banking revelations are about to drop to the press. Earth shattering, economy destroying revelations. Whether they come from, as a result of, or in spite of Snowden is still anyone&#39;s guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s why I think you have a flawed premise. If you think this was a &#39;normalization&#39;  psy-op, then the NSA didn&#39;t do a very good job of &#39;scaring people about big brother&#39;  but has rather pissed people off, a lot more than expected. </p>

<p>Trust me, a better way to normalize this would have been to come out after some kind of false flag and say the solved the &#39;crime&#39;  due to their surveillance techniques. Something like that would sell the entire project easily. What these leaks did however was to remove trust people have placed in the Govt. and no amount of PR could let them gain it b back as seen from the response to their YT video (most downvotes in history).</p>

<p>And with so many prominent  people mad and talking about these programs, it suddenly becomes easier and  cool to say &#39;fuck the Govt&#39; . And trust me, no &#39;State&#39;  or TPTB like to see that happen as they would lose all power as well as the moral high ground. </p>

<p>Lastly, look at the repercussions.. One state&#39;s government has pushed forward to not fund the NSA&#39;s water supply (or was it the power?).  No resources = no more ability to collect data and the entire operation gets bricked. Now, tell me why the NSA with such an elaborate plan didn&#39;t anticipate such petty things that would get in its way? </p>

<p>Some of you guys are giving TPTB more power than is deserved! Are they powerful? Yes.. Smart? Absolutely!  Omnipotent? Hell no.  They have the biggest war toys in the history of the world, very cunning people on their side, and amazing organization.. But they&#39;re still human. </p>

<p>This reminds me of stuff like &#39;Ron Paul is a false flag and a massive psy-op&#39; .. Always made me lol.  Some people need to realize that not every Damn thing is a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Rebuke my claims and maybe I&#39;ll take you seriously. </p>

They way he keeps dropping these gems for us to find, it&#39;s like this guy must have been the head of the NSA with everything he seems to know about.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all over the mainstream media because it started with Greenwald and the Guardian... And the Guardian promoted it. All things being equal, people get news from NYT, HuffPo, and the Guardian and in the internet era do not associate The Guardian as &quot;that Brit newspaper&quot;. It&#39;s all money. So, because The Guardian couldn&#39;t possibly horde all the stories, they gave many out to other newspapers with a list of conditions (for purposes of integrity).  That&#39;s the reason this caught fire. It is a genuine concern, and now, for the first time, someone had proof... And not just &quot;we&#39;re the NSA so don&#39;t fuck with us&quot; proof, but proof that got a lot of people very angry at Google, and Google very angry with the government for what they felt was an end around.</p>

<p>Now I know we only know what we have been told, but do you really think Snowden is sitting someplace in Russia, not guarded, talking to American officials because the whole thing was a planned charade to begin with. Then all the newspapers, including Greenwald would be in on it. Because either Greenwald and (that woman) got all the documents last June after discussing a strategy for release with Snowden and its the real deal, or he is duping Greenwald (and all of us).</p>

<p>Initially, when Snowden first contracted Greenwald, he has to teach them PGP and hashing...would the government/NSA in charge of this Op really go to that trouble...?? that&#39;s a lot of extra work. And further, when they finally did meet, Greenwald grilled him for several hours as GG wasn&#39;t going to get embroiled in something that was going to discredit him or worse. </p>

<p>So frankly, if Greenwald believes him, I do too. I have been reading Greenwald for enough years that I know he has very acute radar for government ruses and typical bullshit...And therefore, I do not believe this is one if them.</p>

<p>The Risks of Trusting the Snowden Story</p>

<p>Posted on January 1, 2014 by Kevin Ryan</p>

<p>Last June, Glenn Greenwald at The Guardian revealed that Edward Snowden was the NSA insider behind “one of the most significant leaks in US political history.” Snowden explained his motivations through Greenwald by saying, “There are more important things than money…. harming people isn’t my goal. Transparency is.” Such altruistic motivations were welcome news at the time but have come into question recently given that only a tiny fraction of the documents have been released nearly a year after Snowden started working with Greenwald. Perhaps more importantly, billionaire Pierre Omidyar is funding Greenwald’s slow release of those documents and Omidyar’s Paypal colleagues have highly suspicious links to NSA spying and other dangers to civil rights.</p>

<p>It was originally reported that the number of documents Snowden had stolen was in the thousands. Today, however, that number is said to be nearly two million. This calls into question Snowden’s early statement, as reported by Greenwald, that he “carefully evaluated every single document… to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest.” The huge, new number also reveals that less than one tenth of one percent of the documents (only about 900) have actually been released to the public.</p>

<p>How could Snowden have “carefully evaluated every single” one of what is now being said to be nearly two million documents? He only worked for Booz Allen Hamilton for a few months. According to NSA Director Keith Alexander, Snowden also worked directly for NSA for twelve months prior to that, which is interesting. But still, that would require carefully evaluating thousands of documents a day during that entire time. Didn’t he have a job apart from that?</p>

<p>Journalist Margie Burns asked some good questions back in June that have not yet been answered. She wondered about the 29-year old Snowden who had been a U.S. Army Special Forces recruit, a covert CIA operative, and an NSA employee in various capacities, all in just a few, short years. Burns asked “How, exactly, did Snowden get his series of NSA jobs? Did he apply through regular channels? Was it through someone he knew? Who recommended him? Who were his references for a string of six-figure, high-level security jobs? Are there any safeguards in place so that red flags go up when a subcontractor jumps from job to job, especially in high-level clearance positions?”</p>

<p>Five months later, journalists Mark Ames and Yasha Levine investigated some of the businesses in which Greenwald’s benefactor Omidyar had invested. They found that the actual practices of those businesses were considerably less humanitarian than the outward appearance of Omidyar’s ventures often portray. The result was that Omidyar took down references to at least one of those businesses from his website.</p>

<p>In December, whistleblower Sibel Edmonds wrote that Omidyar‘s Paypal Corporation was implicated in the as-yet-unreleased NSA documents from Snowden. Moreover, Edmonds had been contacted by an NSA official who alleged that “a deal was made in early June, 2013 between the journalists involved in this recent NSA scandal and U.S. government officials, which was then sealed by secrecy and nondisclosure agreements by all parties involved.”</p>

<p>Omidyar, the son of Iranian exiles, certainly has had some highly suspicious business associates at Paypal. Here are a few of the most influential of Omidyar’s Paypal colleagues.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Max Levchin, a co-founder of Paypal, has openly stated his support for NSA spying on Americans.</p></li>
<li><p>Alex Karp used the Paypal framework to start Palantir, the most important company providing spying technology to the NSA. Palantir’s advisors include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet. The word Palantir refers to the seeing stones used primarily by the dark lord Sauron in The Lord of the Rings novels. From 2005 to 2008 the CIA was Palantir’s patron and only customer.</p></li>
<li><p>Peter Thiel has some interesting right-wing connections. Thiel started his career working for the CIA-linked law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and then Credit Suisse Group. In 2009, Thiel said, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These facts about Omidyar’s Paypal colleagues should raise the level of skepticism about his new media venture with Greenwald and the slow release of the documents stolen by Snowden. It’s clear that Snowden’s whistleblowing has been co-opted by private corporate interests. Are those involved with privatization of the stolen documents also colluding with government agencies to frame and direct national discussions on domestic spying and other serious matters?</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless, it seems. Presenting documents at a measured rate could be a way to acclimate citizens to painful realities without stirring the public into a panic or a unified response that might actually threaten the status quo. And considering that the number of documents has somehow grown from only thousands to nearly two million, the few insiders could release practically anything, thereby controlling national dialogue on many topics.</p>

<p>We live in an age of information war. It does not serve the public interest well to ignore that fact at any time based on pre-conceived notions of what corporations, governments or journalists are capable of. Let’s hope that Greenwald, who has done some good work revealing government misconduct, will immediately release all of the stolen documents, speak to the claims of an alleged deal made with government officials, and admit the risks with regard to Omidyar and his Paypal colleagues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, 100% agree. I&#39;ve thought this from the first I heard of him. But I&#39;ve been wondering and looking around. What exactly do we know about Snowden&#39;s past?  I&#39;ve never seen a feature about his childhood. Interviews with friends. </p>

<p>Got any good info?  I can&#39;t shake the suspicion with his Booz Allen past, that he was a spook all along and this was designed along time ago as a psyop. I mean why go to all the effort to spy on everyone, if just making everyone think they&#39;re spied on is just as effective?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask again, name one solved crime, one recording of a call that the NSA has illegally made. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure they are doing any spying, just making everyone think they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do find it very odd.  I&#39;m leaning towards him being a plant/op.  That being the case, I&#39;m still not sure if he himself is &quot;in on it&quot; or not.  However, I still have some doubts about that angle too - I think it&#39;s possible that he&#39;s legit.</p>

<p>Maybe a more likely scenario is that, as others have said, he&#39;s being &quot;used&quot; or that Greenwald has been compromised which would explain the &quot;softball&quot; leaks we&#39;ve gotten thus far.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know - still not quite sure what to make of it all.</p>

<p>Edit: Though I have to say, the fact that he&#39;s gotten so much MSM airtime in direct opposition to other whistleblowers who have been ignored, marginalized, murdered, arrested, etc. - very suspicious to say the least and probably the main reason why I think the whole thing isn&#39;t legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is an elephant in the room which is being conveniently ignored by the &quot;Snowden is a plant&quot; section of this subreddit. Why would the US government deliberately do something so incredibly damaging to its reputation, both domestically and internationally? </p>

<p>I also think we should also zero in on a specific incident which reinforces the notion that Snowden was a genuine whistleblower. Namely the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/05/latin-america-us-morales-imperialism">forced grounding of Bolivian President Morales&#39;s plane</a> because the US thought Snowden was on board. The international shit-storm was huge, even though it was played down in the US - and why wouldn&#39;t it be, it was one of the biggest humiliations for US diplomacy in decades because it made the administration look both heavy handed and inept.</p>

<p>Now, there is no way on earth that the US would have taken the risk to do this if they didn&#39;t really, really want Snowden caught. </p>

<p>The fallout from all this suggests to me that Snowden is probably not acting for the US government.</p>

<p>Like most intelligence operations, there would be multiple goals of the operation, on multiple levels.</p>

<p>One could be the takedown of the NSA itself, to be supplanted with a privatized NSA that can never be held accountable by Congress. </p>

<p>A second but more likely goal will be passing new laws against all whistleblowers, including previous NSA whistleblowers who did not go directly to the press, but went to Congress first, and went through legal channels.</p>

<p>If a foreign government is involved, there could be a motive behind the takedown of the U.S. tech sector.</p>

<p>Some important points:</p>

<p>Snowden needn&#39;t be aware of his role as a limited hangout.  Like Zacarias Moussaoui &amp; others, intelligence operations love to select a true believer to cast in their stage play.  Greenwald absolutely fits the description of a true believer.  That&#39;s not always a bad thing, but it is easy to manipulate.</p>

<p>Also, be careful of generalizing about &quot;the CIA&quot; or &quot;the NSA&quot; when talking about such an operation.  It could be institutional, OR, it could be a rogue network within these institutions that is loyal to its own agenda -- or a foreign government&#39;s agenda.</p>

We need Snowden to unearth, if indeed he even has, dirt about the planning, financing or execution of the 9/11 attacks?  That you would like to see specific dirt on specific leaders surfaced?  But of course not to shame or degrade anyone, only simply to show that dirt has been gathered?  To this, i sadly agree to a certain extent.  And i say sadly because it seems we have been conditioned to expect that burden of proof.   To expose someone to the alter of sacrifice only to have plausible evidence of the transgression accused.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, there is no reason to expose all these secret programs. Just like it happened with the Patriot Act and the implementation of the NSA in the first place, they could slowly push for more and more control.</p>

<p>In fact, that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening in Europe: they are blocking porn sites and &quot;controversial&quot; subjects , all done legally.</p>

<p>People know they are being monitored.</p>

<p>Secondly to claim these leaks are &quot;garbage&quot; is just... incomprehensible. It started a huge debate not only among the population, but specially among the legislators, many of whom didn&#39;t or claimed to not know how bad it was. And that doesn&#39;t make people &quot;afraid&quot;, that makes people finally move their asses.</p>

<p>Finally, what most people missed in the first interview is that he implied that there is no enemy, that there is no big terrorism threat. It&#39;s all fabricated and these massive surveillance programs are useless (for its &quot;main&quot; purpose)</p>

<p>And that alone is enough to prove he isn&#39;t deceiving us, but rather informing us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are awesome dude! I have been saying this almost since day one. </p>

<p>How can Greenwald be that stupid? How can he not see that what he is &quot;exposing&quot; is not mind blowing! </p>

<p>He has to be in on it. He is a journalist and he should know that these are not revelations or paradigm shifting discoveries! That entire Laura Poitras/Jereme Scahill/Glen Greenwald website has to be full of shit...it has to be controlled opposition because it is not telling us anything! </p>

<p>The possibility that Tarpley is trying to point a finger at the CIA (instead of Mossad or Israel) is also highly likely. Not that the CIA are incapable of pulling it off, it is just that the CIA really is not benefiting from &quot;Snowden&#39;s leaks&quot; therefore they are probably not behind it. Just some thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly suggest you get RES so that you can not have your time wasted by people like <a href="/u/redditeditard">/u/redditeditard</a> who appears to only reply to comments in an attempt to completely discredit or derail them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tagged him multiple times as being a possible subverter, you have to look out for these people.</p>

<p>You can tell he&#39;s suspect because he always uses extremely poor attempts to derail conversations, mostly false assertions and false equivocations.</p>

<p>I think <a href="/u/cutanddriedamericana">/u/cutanddriedamericana</a> may be a subverter too, look at how he tries to look legitimate, but then instantly resorts to all of the known rhetorical shill tactics of discrediting and derailing comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, <a href="/u/lumpnoodler">/u/lumpnoodler</a> commented &quot;in sync&quot; (more false assertions, do you know how to do anything else?) with me because we were both in the same thread at the same time, YOU were trying to troll him and I got his back by calling out your trolling.</p>

<p>He did the same for me, that proves nothing more than there are other intelligent users here who are tired of letting your bullshit stand.</p>

<p>Do you honestly think you can accuse me of the exact tactics that you are using in an attempt to discredit me?</p>

<p>YOU are the one who is trolling with the support of others, one being <a href="/u/redditeditard">/u/redditeditard</a> , did you think people wouldn&#39;t notice that or the other people helping you.</p>

<p>Your insults are funny but know they are worthless and ineffectual ( because I know they&#39;re a load of shit ).</p>

<p>Nice try, have a nice day.</p>
