       have any of you done a reddit search for the link?

       . over 70 times in the last 24 hours!

       I honestly can't remember ever searching for a single article that has been posted over 70 times like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's received thousands of upvotes, some more than even the post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , just because only 6 people have voted one way or the other on the
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       one doesn't make it censorship

       But what do I know, I'm just one of those guys who keeps getting called a shill, and I doubt this article is going to help alleviate that and turn me back into a real boy again.

       You must now be aware that putting something in the spamfilter still renders the post viable, while affecting the ability of the story to be voted on from the new queue.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must also not be aware that each subreddit has approached the censorship differently. For example, worldnews likes to allow two articles out of the spamfilter. Then they remove the one that gets more upvotes, leaving the other topic to fall into obscurity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       mods actually use automod wiki settings to cull any unapproved words or topics, and this article was something that they continually removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal here is to keep the story from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       at all costs and if you're not aware of how the spamfitler works or how mods operate in the defaults then you would be well suited to keep your hostile tone to yourself.

       I wasn't aware it had been filtered. It was on my front page via several subs. So whatever steps the mods have taken, they havn't been successful. This post has still been seen by thousands of eyes.

       edit: I'm not really very aware of how the spamfiltering/modding systems work on reddit. I've been interested in the posts and the comments. I don't rely on reddit or any other single source for my news/information

       I'm not attacking anyone. I'm stating an absolute truth that can be verified thru searching. I am talking about a form of
       <em>

       being harassed thru this constant labeling and name calling simply because I often take a skeptical position and play devil's advocate.

       I'm sorry if that's pushing a line I'll stop referencing it directly, but I think the mods can look at the history and see that I am a reasoned and polite commenter despite the names I get called. Banning me would be way out of line.

      <p>
       tell me and i'll stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If relaying the fact that I get called a shill (which
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a violation of rule 10) is a violation of a rule then I'll stop.

      <p>
       If it is however I suggest that you clarify it in the sidebar because it doesn't appear to be that way. I though I could speak freely about things people have said so long as I was talking about things that you can look up in my history.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all stems from an article about shills. All I can think about when I read the article and see the discussions of it is how many times I get called a shill simply for the views I hold and my ability to argue them. So I felt it wasn't out of place for me to reference it. Again if someone who is a mod and who's account isn't 2 months old would like to clarify I will gladly oblige. My only aim is reasonable discourse.

       What often can happen to this sub is organic, often from getting exposure from the front page or at the very most stems from a post on
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       . Not quite the organized attacks that those slides are referencing. And perpetrated by individuals not intelligence and security agencies like the article is discussing. But that, I'd imagine, is precisely where we differ.

       I read
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       every day, for the past couple years. Several times a day. I am also a professional data analyst, to interject a bit at least to my skills to noticing irregularities. All of the Snowden leaks have been near the top of Reddit very quickly. This one is getting "old" in internet time, and it never came close to the top. If Reddit was my job, I would be spinning off time to devote to figuring out why that irregularity occurred. Part of it may be due to Greenwald running his own site recently, maybe people don't know about it. But all it takes is one link to get upvoted, and if you search you find tons of submitted links.

       The last Firstlook article (pertaining to the use of drones and using cell phone data to assassinate people) went pretty high on the front page, so i dont think the fact that this source is new plays into the lack of traction.

       That's interesting. We have that same anomaly here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       regarding cliché posts and images. You seem to attribute it to linking it to other websites, but I suspect that they run a form of up- and downvote script. Sometimes, there's a discrepancy between comment- and post upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not surprising. If Reddit gets millions of visitors per day, controlling it would be their top priority. Check top posts on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       this last year and it's all Snowden images. It could be because of the short attention span of people and mobile use, but I think there's more to it.

       It's on a few but it doesn't have the traction it deserves. And yes, it really does deserve close scrutiny because of the fucking sinister nature of it. Apart from being spied on, the Five Eyes want to change perceptions about topics being discussed freely on the internet amongst like minded people. It shows that there is a need to change discussions because it is out of control of an editor that is part of their agenda.

       A link about Obamas ACA was quickly up voted to the top which claims no one is facing problems and it's all made up by Republicans and the GOP which seems to be the vast majority of blame on

       That bit about manipulating online discussions might be a bit esoteric for the general public to digest.
      </p>

       What's more blatantly evil is the stuff about manufacturing false flags, in their words, spreading lies about people to destroy them, including sending e-mails to your friends and family and altering your Facebook page.

       honest question:
      </p>
      <p>
       the last few years we saw reddit change into the infected mess it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
       do we really need an article by GG to know that ?
      </p>
      <p>
       to tell people who don't want to hear that we knew all along ?
      </p>
      <p>
       we knew, especially this sub was the litmus test for the rest of
       <em>
        serious
       </em>
       reddit.

       After joining reddit in support of Dr. Ron Paul during the 2012 presidential election, it was obvious this site was full of astroturfing sockpuppets.  You can even see it happen on local news sites.  Quite a shame, really.

       Remember that digg fell because of artificial manipulation, reddit inc knows that and this is why they try to put up the facade of free flowing information. Countering that narrative with threads like this is the only hope for keeping this place in check.

       Call me crazy, but I kind of understand why it's being removed. It does break the rules of the default news subs because it's an analysis piece by Glenn Greenwald. It's technically not news. Get a news organization other than Greenwald to do a story on this piece and I think they'll allow it. But I doubt that will actually happen because of how the media is these days.

       That's probably because it is an editorial, not an actual news piece. Glenn admits as much at the bottom of the story:
      </p>
      <p>
       *We submitted numerous questions to GCHQ, including: (1) Does GCHQ in fact engage in “false flag operations” where material is posted to the Internet and falsely attributed to someone else?; (2) Does GCHQ engage in efforts to influence or manipulate political discourse online?; and (3) Does GCHQ’s mandate include targeting common criminals (such as boiler room operators), or only foreign threats?
      </p>
      <p>
       As usual, they ignored those questions and opted instead to send their vague and nonresponsive boilerplate*

       my thinking on that is that GCHQ is a service provider, they prob don't originate operations, just support other groups doing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       theres a serious size and resource difference between US and UK TLA orgs, in the UK resources are tight, here in the US there are multitudes of ex veterans who need jobs when they leave the military, they go to work for the TLAs and still want to be 'GI Joes' in their new office jobs, so active operations are going to be in vogue, anything to make their new office jobs more exciting and relevant for funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       just witness how the DHS/FBI/ATF/DEA all think they are paramilitary 'Team Americas' and need all those AR15s and millions of rounds of ammo, they are building a domestic security army of sorts

       GCHQ as service provider is an interesting thought. I hadn't went down that road. I was wondering why so vague and only GCHQ. This makes sense.

        </strong>
        is how western intelligence agencies are attempting to manipulate and control online discourse with extreme tactics of deception and reputation-destruction.
        <strong>
         It’s time to tell a chunk of that story, complete with the relevant documents.
        </strong>

      <p>
       So it comes from the trove of documents that Snowden leaked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some questions for you...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why are former NSA and security analysts verifying the documents?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why has the UK and the US said themselves the documents are real and are pursuing prosecution of Snowden and Greenwald including intimidation and deleting hard drives, stealing laptops from Greenwald's home and breaking into Jacob Appelbaums apartment in Berlin?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why has no one from anywhere claimed that the documents are fake?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The only way this Is fake is if everyone concerned is involved and pushing the narrative.

       two angles to that aspect of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       domestically for US citizens/residents, the concern is the NSA being nosey bastards in our domestic lives, the blanket monitoring of everything everybody does in the US, what they do (snooping) to foreigners is not really of much concern to anybody here in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       people outside the US should be concerned about the NSA, but whatever they say and do is relative to their domestic govts, its their problem, their local solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       two separate problems, each relative to domestic and foreign, but both exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its OUR 4th amendment rights in the US being violated, thats the concern of people in the US.

       that really didn't address what i posted at all. But thank you for explaining to me that people in the US are concerned that the NSA is infringing on our 4th amendment rights, I had no idea.

       man this is the last time i post in r/conspiracy. I even came up with my own conspiracy to share but you all have your own agenda.

       in the real world there would be many groups, but a lull suggests central control, or somebody sent out memos at least.
