<p>I was having a discussion with a friend and he was 100% sure that cures like these exist everywhere. He was so sure that I began to doubt myself. So I turn to you, reddit. Is there evidence that there are actually cures to all the major diseases lying around everywhere and rich healthcare providers keep them from getting released to profit off of people&#39;s sickness?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real conspiracy here is that it&#39;s a way for the Egyptian military to claim legitimacy. They can take over and claim a moral high ground because they&#39;ve spent all this time developing the cure for HIV and HEP C and care so much about the people.</p>

<p>Their claims sound very suspicious. Supposedly the HEP C cure has been ready since 2006, yet they wanted to wait 8 years for the HIV cure to be finished before releasing them both in one device?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t require a blood sample, and only has a success rate of 90% in identification?</p>

<p>Where is the peer reviewed research literature on these?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, but highly improbable, that such a machine has been made.</p>

<p>I believe the most significant fact is in the last paragraph - </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Egypt continues to rank as one of the highest countries in the world Hepatitis C infections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who better to find the cure than the people who want to take over!</p>

<p><del>------</del></p>

<p>Now, on the matter of cures being hidden, I have no idea. I see where the incentive exists to hide such cures, but if the medical/pharma companies really didn&#39;t want a cure, why would they waste the time/money developing one only to hide it? From their perspective, surely the money wasted on such an endeavor would be better kept in their pockets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the face of it, yes. The conspiracy is that it&#39;s a way for the Egyptian military to claim legitimacy. As designated by this article (sorry it&#39;s in arabic and I couldn&#39;t find an english translation) <a href="http://ow.ly/tXEA5">http://ow.ly/tXEA5</a>
The article basically says the inventor of the cure was offered $2 billion to sell it to the US and then when he didn&#39;t they kidnapped him and the Egyptian equivalent of the CIA rescued him.</p>

<p>So the narrative is gonna be: the egyptian military is about to release the cure, everyone rejoice! On it&#39;s way to being released an american CIA agent destroyed it. They&#39;ll hope the people believe them and they&#39;ll regain legitimacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a few issues I have with the cure hiding theory. Firstly, there are tons of independent groups working on cures (lets use cancer as an example or all of these since it&#39;s easier to explain). For example all the doctors, researchers, universities and other medical professionals/organizations share data, but are not necessarily linked to each other directly. So you would expect that if one of them had a cure, that they refused to release, then the others would likely eventually just reach the same cure and release it. Also, the entire premise trivializes most of modern medical research, and the work that is boing done. For example, for Leukemia, the survival rate has risen dramatically in the past 50 years. Also, cancer doesn&#39;t have any form of &quot;super cure&quot; as it&#39;s not one disease, but instead multiple different kinds and forms (which is why some are easier/harder to treat). Finally, there is the issue that there are also many countries not affiliated with anyone you talke about (despite them not even being bad) that are also working on cures (i.e. europe). Also, have you considered the possibility that the army is just simply lying? (due to needing more support, and Egypt having a huge amount of hep c cases)</p>

<p>I have a friend who is an anthesiologist and I have ran this idea past him.  He agreed with me.  But if you go down the list of foods that cause cancer and those that prevent it, you will see the correlation.  Tobacco smoke causes lung cancer because it makes the lungs acidic.</p>

<p>Diabetic ketoacidosis is a state of decreased pH, and has no relation to cancer. On the other hand, if you took blood gases in a vast majority of cancer patients, they would have no change in pH. </p>

<p>Bone density has no relation to pH. Indeed, the release of PTH---the hormone responsible for dissolution of bone---is responsive only to calcium levels, not pH. Age-related bone density changes primarily due to the influence of sex hormones. </p>

<p>It does not. Tobacco smoke contains compounds that mutate DNA, leading to activation of oncogenes and inhibition of tumor suppressors. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Or, more accurately, I&#39;m repeating what I have learned, what countless studies show, and what I have seen in <em>actual patients</em>—not conjecture about &quot;water disease,&quot; but actual human beings, and the oxygen content, carbon dioxide content, bicarbonate concentration, and pH of their blood—over a course of about 10 years. There is no evidence that demonstrates a link between pH and cancer. There <em>is,</em> however, over a century of research on mutagenic compounds, and decades of research on the exact genes responsible for various cancers, as evidenced by cancer syndromes associated with genes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and familial adenomatous polyposis.</p>

<p>A brief look at the things Dr. Mercola believes does nothing to credit him as any sort of authority. He claims microwaves emit dangerous radiation and alter food chemistry. This is demonstrably false. Having studied organic chemistry for four years, part of which included working with microwave spectroscopy, microwaves have essentially no effect on molecular structure. He also believes that contracting the HIV virus does not lead to AIDS. This is also demonstrably false, and even more of a harmful claim on a population level. There are other false claims that I won&#39;t go into.</p>

<p>Otto Warburg discovered an important fact about cancer cells—they do not use aerobic respiration. They utilize the glycolysis pathway, but divert the produced pyruvate molecules instead towards lactic acid fermentation. That is, <em>cancer produces acid,</em> not the other way around. His discovery was correct; his interpretation was not. We now know this, due to 80 years of advancement in medical science.</p>

<p>Do not spread incorrect claims that alkaline diets can cure cancer. If an alkaline diet could alkalinize blood pH—which it does not—the neoplasm would not be affected. The patient would only have an alkalemia to deal with on top of their tumor. But again, that&#39;s a moot point, because <em>diet has no significant effect on blood pH.</em> Spreading claims like this only serves to drive cancer patients away from <em>actual</em> treatments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is being spread already over the internet.  The alkaline diet especially. </p>

<p>I actually  came up with this theory by learning how to run a hot tub with chemicals and a swimming pool with salt.  70% of our body is water and it is not only our blood that holds water but our organs also.  A mutant gene does cause cancer, I agree.  But we produce these every day.  I believe that it can only grow if the ph in the body is acidic, or more specifically our organs.</p>

<p>If I were to develop cancer, I would choose to take a specialists advise at this time.  But I also believe there is too much money being made by the drug companies and researchers for these people to ever cure cancer.  It is too profitable not curing it.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I will also try to put more thought into my diet as the things doctors have told us cause cancer are consuming acids.  The thing doctors tell us to comsume are alkaline.  Now can you explain that?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Like what, exactly? Be specific.</p>

<p>Acids are extremely common compounds, and I think some of the blame is simply to be ascribed to how many different acids exist. But what about vitamin C? Certainly the body needs that, and that&#39;s an acid. So is vitamin B3, niacin, aka nicotinic acid (unrelated to the nicotine in cigarettes). Niacin deficiency is often quite fatal. Citric acid is a critical part of the TCA cycle, used for generating energy in the body—indeed, older names for the cycle name it after citric acid itself.</p>

<p>Likewise, there are plenty of non-acids to be blamed for cancer. One of the first carcinogens to be discovered, benzo[a]pyrene, is neither an acid nor a base. Benzene and other aromatics are similarly neutral compounds, yet are identifiable carcinogens. Asbestos can lead to lung cancer, but does so as a function of its size, not because it&#39;s chemically reactive (e.g. as an acid). Older chemotherapeutic agents like nitrogen mustards are, in fact, alkaline, and while they can help fight tumors, they can cause new tumors themselves by damaging DNA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read recent information that Vitamin C is not as important as once thought.</p>

<p>I would also agree that not all cancers are caused by a ph imbalance.</p>

<p>I also would agree that not all acids are harmful.  The point is to eat a balanced ph.  Acids are necessary.  They just need to be balanced with the proper alkalines.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing that I found is our viewing of salt.  We are salt water animals so it is necessary for our bodies.  I found this out when my electolites were out of wack  and I got sick.  I cant remember the name but it was a defiency in sodium.  I got all confuse and was hospitalized in a Psych unit.</p>

<p>So naturally I wanted to find out all about it.  The salt we primarily consume is table salt.  It is refined by super heating it which removes some valuable minerals our body need to maintain ph.  Magnesium is one of these minerals.  It also changes the chemical nature of salt.</p>

<p>I have since switched to a more unrefined that the salt company would tell you is not fit for human consumption.  I also take Epson salt baths which is magnesium sulfate. </p>

<p>Salt is an important regulator of ph in our bodies.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I have read recent information that Vitamin C is not as important as once thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may be referring to a recent study on multivitamins, which said that they weren&#39;t really needed in most people. This came as a shock to the lay public, yes, but within the healthcare field, nobody was really that surprised. In a developed country like the United States, the vast, vast, vast majority of people do not have significant vitamin deficiencies. Vitamin D deficiency is somewhat more common, and vegans can often get vitamin B12 deficiency (because B12 comes almost exclusively from animal sources), but deficiencies of vitamins A, C, B2, B3, K, all of these are quite uncommon for anybody with an average diet. Thus, multivitamins were not indicated for most people.</p>

<p><em>However,</em> vitamins are still extremely important compounds in the body. Vitamin C, for example, serves not only to scavenge free radicals—compounds, which I may add, that can lead to DNA damage and thus cancer—but is also extremely, extremely important in collagen formation. Vitamin A is required for proper vision, and you can go blind without it. As I said above, vitamin B3, or niacin, deficiency (&quot;pellagra&quot;) is an extremely serious condition. What should be taken away from that study is not that vitamins are not important, but rather that most people get perfectly adequate amounts through food.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also would agree that not all acids are harmful. The point is to eat a balanced ph. Acids are necessary. They just need to be balanced with the proper alkalines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re saying, and I&#39;m glad you agree that acids are necessary; but what&#39;s important to understand is that there is essentially no evidence that the pH of your food changes the pH of your blood. It seems like it <em>should</em> make sense—if I ingest an acid, shouldn&#39;t it still be acidic in my blood? But that conclusion neglects the fact that there are two important factors that control your blood pH—your lungs and your kidneys. This statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Salt is an important regulator of ph in our bodies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is somewhat true, although not for the reason you may think. Table salt itself—sodium chloride—is an entirely neutral compound. Technically speaking, the kidney does use sodium to help regulate pH, through a somewhat complicated mechanism also involving potassium ions. But the mere ingestion of salt, biologically and chemically speaking, will have zero effect on your body&#39;s pH.</p>

<p>The other aspect, as I mentioned, are your lungs. Imagine yourself exercising. As you exercise, your muscles run short on oxygen, and in order to keep breaking down sugar, they need to replenish a compound known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or simply &quot;NAD.&quot; Without oxygen, the only way to do this is to produce lactic acid, the same chemical which I said in a comment above is produced by cancer cells (this is no coincidence—I&#39;ll explain in a bit). Lactic acid is converted, through a series of chemical reactions, to carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>Now, while you exercise, notice your breathing speeds up. This serves two functions: 1) you increase the amount of oxygen that is delivered to your body, your muscles in particular, and 2) you exhale more carbon dioxide. In effect, you are breathing out acid. Is it <em>actually</em> acid? No, it&#39;s just carbon dioxide. But the effect is that the more CO2 you breathe out, the more alkaline your blood pH will become. For example, above I mentioned a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a state in which blood pH is lowered (a &quot;metabolic acidosis&quot;). One of the key signs of DKA is the patient taking extremely large, deep breaths. That is the body&#39;s compensatory response to their lowered pH, them desperately trying to &quot;blow off acid&quot; and raise their pH back to 7.40. Or, on the flip side, take somebody who overdosed on heroin, and is barely breathing. Because they are <em>not</em> blowing off CO2, their pH drops (a &quot;respiratory acidosis&quot;), leaving the kidneys to compensate.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s my point here? It&#39;s that any change in pH that may be caused by food—and indeed, any such changes are generally small—are pretty much immediately compensated for by the body. When food enters the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, the pancreas floods the area with sodium bicarbonate, a molecule that quickly neutralizes any acids. The point of that is to neutralize any stomach acid that came in with the food (which is going to be thousands, if not millions of times more acidic than any acids found in food anyway), but it will neutralize food acids as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cant remember the name but it was a defiency in sodium. I got all confuse and was hospitalized in a Psych unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#39;Hyponatremia&#39; may be the word you&#39;re looking for, which is just Latin for &#39;low sodium.&#39; Hyponatremia is a serious condition, and I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that. It&#39;s uncommon, however, that simple lack of salt intake will lead to hyponatremia. There are certain conditions that can <em>wash out</em> salt intake; for example, <em>psychogenic polydipsia,</em> a condition where, more or less, people go bonkers and start drinking ungodly amounts of water. But for anybody with a proper diet (because, don&#39;t forget, food contains plenty of sodium regardless of how much salt you add to it), a lack of sodium in the diet is low on the list for causes of hyponatremia.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing about this &#39;hiding an easy cure&#39; business that really gets me in this whole thread.</p>

<p>What has to be understood about cancer is that it&#39;s <em>your own</em> cells. See, when someone gets, say, a bacterial infection, we can exploit the differences between our own cells and bacterial cells. For example, penicillin targets cell walls. Some bacteria have cell walls; <em>none</em> of our cells have cell walls. And so you can take penicillin and walk around all day, without a single thing happening to you, while the bacteria slowly dies. We can do this with fungi as well, or some viruses like HIV (where we exploit an enzyme that HIV is dependent on, but our cells generally do not use).</p>

<p>But in cancer, what&#39;s happened is that one of our own cells has lost the ability to tell when something has gone wrong. So now, as it divides, it propagates mutations as though they were your correct genetic code. And then all of a sudden a mutation happens that tells the cell to start growing and never stop. A normal cell would recognize that that&#39;s not okay, and kill itself. A cancer cell does not; it listens, and continues to divide, and divide, forming a tumor.</p>

<p>But what makes treating cancer so difficult is this: what do we target? This cell is <em>identical</em> to the rest of your body&#39;s cells, except for one or two slight, slight, <em>slight</em> differences. If you try to target and kill that cancer cell, aren&#39;t you going to also target the rest of the body&#39;s cells?</p>

<p>Yes! And that&#39;s why chemotherapy is such an awful process for almost every patient—while you&#39;re killing the cancer cells, you&#39;re also killing your own cells. We hope that we can kill the cancer before we wreck you too badly, but it&#39;s extremely, extremely difficult. I know people like to deride chemotherapy as &quot;literally poison,&quot; but the thing is, it is so, so, so hard to find something that targets cancer cells and <em>only</em> cancer cells, because it is so hard to tell the difference between a cancer cell and a normal cell.</p>

<p>And to top it off, remember that cancer cells have lost the ability to detect when and where genetic changes have happened, and thus never change them back. So if a mutation occurs that causes the cell to be resistant to whatever treatment you&#39;re giving—say it now refuses to bring your drug inside itself—that cell now <em>explodes</em> with growth, and you have to tell the patient that they have no options left.</p>

<p>Now, let me be fair to this subreddit. The base argument—&quot;nobody would want to cure cancer, because almost treating it is such a money-maker&quot;—makes sense, at face value. But it ignores a few things. First of all, the other treatments for cancer: surgery and radiation. Surgery—you take it out, and it&#39;s done. Hopefully it doesn&#39;t come back. (Radiation is a similar process, although it takes a few visits.) And for a lot of people it doesn&#39;t. Does that not count as a cure? I know someone personally who had a lung mass, and had part of her lung taken out. She&#39;s now fine. The problem is, that&#39;s not an option for many people. If you have a single, solid tumor, okay, take it out. If you have a mass in the prostate, take the whole prostate out, great. But what about a leukemia? You can&#39;t remove people&#39;s bone marrow. Or someone with metastases? You can&#39;t remove a dozen visible tumors, and who knows how many microtumors. They&#39;d never make it.</p>

<p>So we resort to chemotherapy. And, yes, unfortunately, in many cases, chemotherapy is not curative, and that&#39;s unfortunate. But imagine, the first company to cure a cancer—they would be rich beyond their wildest dreams. And they would continue to make money. Why? Because people will never stop getting cancer. It originates with inherent flaws in how our biochemistry works, and it&#39;s unlikely to change.</p>

<p>Consider the drug imatinib, trade name Gleevec. Imatinib is a fascinatingly unique cancer drug. It was developed for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a blood cancer that often arises from a <em>very particular</em> chromosomal abnormality. Imatinib was designed for the specific purpose of targeting the protein created by that abnormality. There were, to my knowledge, no or vanishingly few cancer drugs that did that before imatinib, and it has been wildly successful. And what&#39;s more—the company that produces it is making <em>bank.</em> They are rolling in money. Because curing cancer is just as profitable, and there is motivation to do so.</p>

<p>My final point is this—it&#39;s just not as simple as the pH of your food. It really just isn&#39;t. Cancer is an <em>incredibly</em> complex, diverse family of diseases, and as wonderful as it would be to create one final cure for all of them, the mechanism of cancer just makes it impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what else to say. Some foods are carcinogenic, like charred meats or nitrites. That is an issue of environment. But their carcinogenicity has nothing to do with pH. It just simply is false. Cancer locally produces lactate. But it is compensated for by the body, and no acid-base derangement occurs. I&#39;ve explained how that works. That food pH causes cancer simply just...doesn&#39;t happen. I have studied it for years, I have seen it happen in people for years, and I tried to give you a thorough explanation of how and why cancer occurs, and I don&#39;t know what else I can say to you other than it&#39;s not a pH issue, and there is just not a single shred of evidence to suggest that it might be. It&#39;s like trying to explain that the sky is blue. I&#39;ve seen the sky for years, I&#39;ve said that it is blue, and I&#39;ve said why it&#39;s blue, and I&#39;ve said why it can&#39;t be green, only to hear back, &quot;No, I believe the sky is green.&quot;</p>

<p>I have read about researchers and universities studying the work of Warberg and believe it may be the answer to cancer so it is not a dead issue.

<p>My background is in business and economics.  All I can tell you is what I have read as a layman.  But when I was in school, I found an exception to an economic law that the community regarded as infallible using their own math and formulas.  I missed a question on a test because it was regarded as fact.  I saw the professor after test and disproved the law with this math.</p>

<p>I am confident that since research is being done on Dr. Warberg that this information will turn out to be correct.  The reason I believe that his findings were lost is the depression, no money was available, and WWII where everything that was German was evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does this prove that diet changes your blood pH to any extent?</p>

<p>And, no, it does not—the pH of your blood is regulated by the lungs and the kidneys, and does not need to damage parts of the body to do so. It is done by changing the respiratory rate, or by altering how much bicarbonate is reabsorbed from or secreted into the urine. In fact, that urine pH is so much more variable goes exactly to show this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not entirely true.  Yes cancers can appear in different places in the body, but there are defining factors that are inherent in all cancer.  For one, all tumours feed on glucose.  Another somewhat related example would be the fact that there are billions of different species of bacteria, yet alcohol will dissolve the outer membrane and kill all of them.</p>

<p>A selective mechanism in identifying mutated cells seems to be how THC and other cannabinoid analogues are able to target mutated cells for apoptosis, while leaving healthy cells alone.  Obviously this mechanism isn&#39;t fully understood but there is a lot of good science showing that Cannabinoids can kill a variety of cancers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying certain chemicals, both in our edibles and environment, are helping to disrupt the balance of our bodies. </p>

<p>That sounds an awful lot like you&#39;re referring to humors. Which haven&#39;t been widely accepted by the medical community since the 1300&#39;s</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Certain vaccines are linked to cancers. New GMO foods are causing alarming rates of diabetes, etc. Parkinson&#39;s and aluminum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you provide a link to that? Especially aluminum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not just the high fat diets causing heart disease. There&#39;s systematic ways the chemical companies are saturating our bodies with disease, so they can then charge for the &quot;medicine&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You assume that food companies, pharmaceutical companies and biotech companies are all secretly working together. Not to mention you seem to think that all medicine is ineffective which leads to the question; what should we use if not for the medicine that we know for a fact works, and is commonly used to treat said medical issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are repeating what you have learned and is commonly  thought to be true.  This is what is keeping us from curing cancer.  It is only preached because it is more profitable to treat cancer than to cure it.  The medical wants cancer to be scary and mysterious.</p>

<p>It is merely a water disease. </p>
