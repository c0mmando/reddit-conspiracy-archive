<p><a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">Snowden leak: In 2008, the White House’s head of the Office of Information &amp; Regulatory Affairs proposed sending covert agents into “chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups” which spread what he views as false and damaging “conspiracy theories” about the government.</a></p>

<p>We should be collectively upvoting these posts to the front page. This new leak concerns this subreddit and website as a whole more than any of the others. </p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> A team of people seem to be going though my post history and downvoting everything. Also AZSnakepit is upset about the use of the word &quot;complete&quot; followed by secret. So lets just humor him and try not to lose the <strong>point</strong> behind my post. Word semantics do not invalidate my post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ongoing operations, as in everything they do every day as if @therealCIA is listing the itinerary on twitter? Not at all. Do we know more about conspiracies, potential conspiracies, and overall deceptive behavior from our government? Yes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need a CIA operative to post his mission on Facebook or take a selfie while torturing a soldier to benefit from social media. The fact is, radio, television, and newspapers were the only ways to get current news, and you were limited to the main sources which have always had the influence of the government.</p>

<p>Today, we aren&#39;t limited to a few methods of news which are represented by a few major groups with political interests of their own. Sure, we are doomed to drown under a sea of the truth, lies, misdirection, and disinformation, but we&#39;ve got choices. Beforehand, questioning the reported news was considered such a nutjob move because there were no inklings of truth leaking out. There was no reason to be skeptical when the only sources weren&#39;t giving any indication that you should be.</p>

<p>Today, anyone can post a website, write an email, tweet, post on a forum, or deliver a podcast, all available to the masses. There are tons of inklings of truths out there, we just have to wade through the shit to find them. Seventy years ago, there was no shit to wade through, let alone indications that you should even go through the trouble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They could have, but why would they have? There are some solid and reasonable motivations for someone to, say, expose a 9/11 conspiracy or something. It would mean we had a basically malevolent government, and the person would be performing a really heroic act. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t even necessarily have to implicate them as the leaker -- they could try to get some solid evidence (any documents, communications, email accounts, proof of travel, really anything whatsoever that would back up anything you guys regularly claim), and send it and their testimony anonymously to University labs, foreign governments, or the media.</p>

<p>In extreme contrast, during the Manhattan project we were at war with foreign powers and had no guarantee of victory. The main beneficiaries of a leak would have been the people we were at war with, Germany and Japan, who (for all they knew at the time) would take that research, turn around, and start nuking US cities. I really can&#39;t figure out a reason someone from that project would have leaked something.</p>

<p>Again, this is in extreme contrast to a 9/11 conspirator, who would have lots of perfectly valid reasons to want to expose the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Is it harder to keep a secret now?  Yes, absolutely.  That is part of the reason why the vast majority of the world&#39;s population regards 9/11 as a state-sponsored terrorist event rather than the actions of a few cavemen.</p>

<p>There are simply not that many folks left that don&#39;t realize 9/11 was an inside job.  The one and only thing the regime has left at this point is to desperately hang on to the illusion in your mind that some plurality or small majority is against you.  But it isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>Not to mention things like bulletin boards and Usenet. Internet forums were definitely alive and strong in 2001.

<p>Seriously? Just because our cell phones didn&#39;t have cameras, and only <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0933563.html">half of Americans</a> owned one, and instead of Facebook and Twitter people used LiveJournal, ICQ, and AIM, that makes 2001 more similar to 1940 than to today? </p>

<p>In 2001 you were lucky if you had a cellphone with a camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t recall any actually existing, and I&#39;m in Europe where mobile phone technology has always been more advanced than the US for some reason.</p>

<p>First time I saw a phone camera was circa. 2002ish, and it was a detachable accessory for a Sony Ericsson T68i.  The quality was truly awful as well.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe people who go on YouTube 9/11 vids and say &quot;people would have captured the plane attacks on their cellphones!&quot;.  No they wouldn&#39;t - back then, 35mm cameras with film, VCRs and analogue camcorders were the norm.  We got a digital camcorder in 2001, it was bleeding edge and very expensive.</p>

I remember bitching that I had to carry both devices to have the tech I wanted in the palm of my hand. Also, pulling out the pda/camera to take a picture of all the students huddled around the TV on 9/11.  So yeah, camera phones were pretty much nonexistent and only the most hardcore &quot;geeks&quot; had anything like it.  There were bunches of digital cameras though.  1-2 megapixel things, like the powershot series.  I had a canon XL2 at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what&#39;s the real story of 911 according to you? I read all kinds of conspiracy theories on the Internet right after 9/11.

    <div class="md"><p><em>I don&#39;t know</em>. </p>

<p>There is a misconception about &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; that says they&#39;re all paranoid elitist assholes who think they have it all figured out.  That they&#39;re convinced they know something others don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what happened.  All I know is that I am unsatisfied with the official account, and that the stated reasons for how &amp; why 9/11 happened are inadequate.  There are dozens and dozens of questionable circumstances, coincidences, and unsatisfactory explanations, and I see nothing wrong with people rejecting the official story and wanting a new investigation.  But it doesn&#39;t mean any of us have it figured out or claim to know the truth.</p>

<p>I have suspicions and ideas.  But I do not claim to know what happened, and I don&#39;t believe I ever will.  But I will likely forever reject the official account. </p>

<p>I think the most recent thing that has come out that, in my opinion, is the clearest documentation of all of the suspicious occurrences from that day, is Massimo Mazzucco&#39;s documentary &quot;A New Pearl Harbor&quot;.  It&#39;s been linked quite a bit around here and maybe you&#39;ve seen it, but if you haven&#39;t I would highly recommend it.  I&#39;m not saying it is 100% correct or flawless, but it is well organized and very compelling and packed with sources and information.  It may not tell us exactly who was responsible or involved, but I think it makes a very compelling argument that, at the very least, we were lied to about much of the event.</p>

have a lot more ability to get stuff on the internet.
To get people to care or read it is a different matter.</p>

<p>We have Manning, we have Snowden, and others who have 
come forward and shared things.  </p>

<p>There have been other whistleblowers before them. </p>

<p>That said I firmly believe that a lot of still kept secret.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the primary driver for spilling your guts is the availability
of Twitter/Facebook/Cellphone.   I think its a detractor.  I am sure that sounds crazy.    If you write on your facebook profile, on twitter, on your cellphone about what is going on, then chances are the NSA knows and you are out of a job, out of the industry, and quite possibly in jail.</p>

<p>Perhaps Snowden proves me wrong. I think he collected lots of
documents and then ran away before posting, but I could be 100%
wrong on that.   But even if I am wrong, I still think its close to 
suicidal to go &quot;Yeah I work on this super duper secret black government
projects and we are doing this really cool thing now with... .. ... .... ....

    <div class="md"><p>I think NSA and the public&#39;s general apathy can diffuse a lot of controversy and scandal. They don&#39;t have to remove posts. Look at Julian stuck in the Ecuador embassy on trumped up charges. They called him a rapist and then there was some outrage on facebook and twitter about Manning&#39;s material... which got everyone aware in minutes and then...... well we talked about it then stopped. There is footage of soldiers mowing down journalist and we just stop talking about it. No crazy cabal, just some people calling names and then the public moving on to twitchplayspokemon... Which come on is way more fun than watching war crimes and having an honest discussion with yourself and your neighbors about what you all know to be true. 
TL;DR NSA doesn&#39;t have to remove content, apathy will</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fun story: Many years ago, this guy shows up in a yahoo chat room, and goes &quot;hey guys, I can get anybody&#39;s IP, you just have to visit <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/cgi-bin/phf">http://www.nsa.gov/cgi-bin/phf</a> and I&#39;ll give you your own IP.&quot; So we did, and he made good on his claim.</p>

<p>Apparently, the nsa (/NIST) had some honeypot cgi scripts for the sole purpose of collecting data on script kiddies trying to exploit vulnerabilities that shipped in ancient versions of apache. And that guy was being paid to get bored out of his mind staring at screens scrolling filtered logs of suspicious traffic targeting the site.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t checked recently. Maybe it&#39;s still there. If it is, make sure to load the script 3 times to make sure your attempts get flagged in real time to someone. I don&#39;t know if they see your user-agent, but if they do, it might be a good place to say hi.</p>

<p>Personal experience, A friend spent his entire life prepping himself for the air force, ROTC program and everything...All of a sudden he&#39;s at home sitting on a pile of money, and no job...He never told anybody as to why, accept for a tid bit that he saw transformers....Take that for what anyone can...But, It is very possible for today&#39;s government to keep things from the public. Not as easy, But plausible. </p>

<p>edit: This was back in 2009, Right before the rollout of drone programs on US soil..My guess is that he probably saw them servicing one in a hangar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you have modern governments like china and korea, you can see compartmentalization on a mass level. </p>

<p>Darpa works out of the University of Texas..Does every student studying their technology know what its development is for? no, That is a form of compartmentalization. </p>

<p>I see you are stuck on the 9/11 thing because of the post, But i&#39;m way past that. </p>

<p>Another good example of compartmentalization is the Navy seal team assassinating <del>obama</del>Bin laden...How many people in the intelligence agency new about that operation? Something that is very rare, Black Ops or not, People within the circles still hear about things...To me, that is a form of compartmentalization. </p>

<p>Project Manhattan in my opinion shows the fruits of the tree. If something wants to be hidden, Governments find ways. So the idea is not a logical leap. </p>

<p>Like the 9/11 drills occurring at the same time, The stand down called by dick Cheney, all of those events somewhat contain compartmentalization. </p>

<p>So you&#39;ve described yourself as a debunker about 5 times now. We get it. Have fun with that. </p>

<p>Until you or NIST releases their computer input simulation data for WTC7&#39;s collapse initiation sequence, you have no footing regarding anyone who questions the official story because the official story doesn&#39;t show proof of their official conspiracy theory (that fire alone brings down WTC7).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really boggles my mind how people can take the NSA leaks, which contain tons of information about a wide range of activities the NSA actually engages in, and then just assume that those activities being real makes it ok to just assert that the NSA is just doing whatever nefarious activity they can imagine.</p>

<p>Snowden scrubbed the NSA databases and stole millions of pages of documents.  He then gave those pages to journalists who have been reviewing them for several months.  Those documents have thus far revealed the existence of several heretofore secret programs.  But they have not revealed the existence of anything like the blackmail program you imagine.  In fact, they haven&#39;t revealed anything that support the claims of any of the major conspiracy theories from the last ten years (9-11, sandy hook, chem trails, HAARP, etc.).</p>

<p>Now, maybe the documents supporting those theories have yet to be revealed, or maybe Snowden was unable to steal them.  But, if anything, it seems to me that Snowden&#39;s leaks (especially when viewed along side Manning&#39;s, which likewise did not reveal anything supporting those major conspiracy theories) strongly undercut the likelihood of those conspiracy theories being true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you do not need that data to verify whether those conclusions are reasonable. All you need is to substitute a reasonable range of potential values for the missing data.  It&#39;s a very simple exercise that anyone with the expertise to understand the simulation model could carry out.  If no reasonable values allow the model to reproduce the NIST report&#39;s collapse scenario, then you can invalidate the conclusions of that report.</p>

<p>This is actually how most academic work has been done for the past 100 years.  While having that missing data would be helpful to evaluating the NIST report, it is not at all necessary.  Your fixation on that data is thus very strange to me.  I really think you are missing the big picture.  You should just be focusing on whether or not he NIST report&#39;s conclusions are valid under reasonable assumptions.  The report has been out for around 6 years now, and yet there is zero peer reviewed work that finds their model unreasonable.  Conspiracy theorists are constantly telling me about how many &quot;experts&quot; they have on their side, but I cannot understand why none of those so-called experts are able to do the work necessary to cast serious doubt on NIST&#39;s model.  Though they would not need NIST&#39;s exact calculations to do so, they have access to the vast majority of those calculations, as well as the detailed assumptions and data from the report itself.  In the absence of even a good faith effort to produce an alternative model, why should I take their criticisms seriously in the shadow of the extensively reviewed report by 200+ undisputed academic heavy weights (including governmental and nongovernmental engineers) that has been cited by countless other actual structural engineers around the world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d rather be a broken record that is playing a correct recording than one that is endlessly repeating nonsense.  Again, the data is not necessary for verifying the conclusions of the report.  A structural engineer could verify those conclusions independently with their own model.  You are fixated on the data because you know that you have (1) no comparable support for your own ridiculous theory (a theory rejected by those who stood to lose billions of dollars by rejecting it), and (2) no countervailing data that even challenges the assertions of the NIST report, let alone refutes them.</p>

<p>So keep beating the drum: the NIST report must be invalid because none of the so-called engineers who parade about stealing money from talks for conspiracy theorists have managed to do actual academic work to challenge its conclusions.  Its sad that that makes sense to you.  I suppose you also doubt the existance of the Higgs Boson because you cannot verify all the supercollider data?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve explained this to you at least three or four times now.</p>

<p>To verify the conclusions you do the following:</p>

<p>(1) build an alternative model;</p>

<p>(2) test that alternative model for a reasonable range of possible parameters and scenarios;</p>

<p>(3) determine whether any reasonable combination of parameters and scenarios allow for a collapse scenario that is substantially similar to the one outlined in the NIST report (if the model does allow for a substantially similar scenario, you can largely verify the report, and--depending on the particularity of your results, perhaps even completely verify it); and,</p>

<p>(4) if no reasonable combination of parameters and scenarios do so allow, then use the data generated by your model to develop an alternative hypothesis for what accounted for the collapse.</p>

<p>Again, this is something any group of academic structural engineers should be able to do without much difficulty.  It&#39;s how most academic work dealing with extremely complicated empirical questions is carried out.</p>

<p>So why can&#39;t this be done in this situation?  What is stopping the so-called experts who believe the NIST report is incorrect from doing the basic work they would be expected to do in criticizing any other such report?</p>

<p>As to withholding the data, neither you or I have enough information to determine whether NIST was correct in withholding that data.  The proper place to determine that would be federal court.  Those who filed the FOIA request with NIST had a statutory right to challenge NIST&#39;s determination on that withholding data (which, again, was only a fraction of the total data).  Why didn&#39;t they exercise their right to appeal?  I can&#39;t say and neither can you.  But they didn&#39;t.  That, however, would not stop you or any engineer who buys into your beliefs from requesting the same data and then appealing NIST&#39;s determination.</p>

<p>But, again, you have no counter for the reality that the data is <strong>not needed</strong> to verify NIST&#39;s conclusions.  And you have no explanation for why you believe in an alternative hypothesis for which there is exactly zero academic evidence.  Your fixation on the data is just a way of avoiding the truth: NIST&#39;s conclusions, were they invalid, could easily be countered by a competent structural engineer with an alternative model.  You lack such a model, so you scream to high heavens about the data you don&#39;t actually need.</p>

<p>And, for the 10th time, you do not need the data to independently verify the conclusions.

You think you need the data, but that&#39;s only because you have no alternative model.  What you don&#39;t seem to realize, sadly, is that you have no alternative model because no serious academic structural engineer actually finds the NIST report&#39;s conclusions so questionable as to test them in that way.  The only engineers who make such claims, unsurprisingly, are those who make money by touring about and talking to conspiracy theorist groups.  And those individuals have a strong monetary interest in <strong>not</strong> building an alternative model, because they know such a model would either (1) corroborate the NIST report&#39;s conclusions, or (2) fail to meet the standards for publication in a peer reviewed journal.

<p>NIST hid their science. That&#39;s a good reason. You&#39;ve bought a lie without any proof to back it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>an independent, alternative model that uses reasonable assumptions could and would test all aspects of the NIST report&#39;s science.  their exact science is not even important by itself (though there are <em>plenty</em> of details about their method in the 2000+ pages published with the NIST report and the hundreds of input data spreadsheets they released with the FOIA request); the important thing is the conclusions.  and, by testing those conclusions, you are testing the entirety of the science of the report.  that seems to be the jump you cannot understand.  perhaps its because you&#39;ve never done serious graduate-level research work or something, but this type of independent analysis, far from being a rare thing, is the standard in academia.  if you want to know whether their model could reasonably explain the events that day, you have everything you need already.  just keep ignoring the forest for the trees, though.  </p>

<p>it all comes down to the fact that you do not have an alternative model because there is no serious work done in support of the conspiracy theorist version of events (despite, again, the fact that insurance companies lost billions by not having it done).  again, your fixation on data that you yourself cannot even use or analyze is just a shield for your ego: you&#39;ve bought into the monological psychology of the conspiracy theory, but you now recognize that there is zero academic support for your theory, so you contrive to invent a technical problem with the NIST report where none truly exists.  by doing so, what you really want to say is that the NIST report is no more legitimate than the garbage turned out by the so-called experts conspiracy theorists like to give their money to.  but the only way for that to make is to ignore the fact that there really is no technical problem.  those so-called experts you rely on (despite the fact that they have no actual alternative model of what happened, not even roughly sketched out) would not need to rely on the data from the NIST report to do actual academic work that tests it.</p>

<p>in any case, we&#39;ve gone through this enough now.  you either are too dense to get it or just don&#39;t want to get it.  you choose the unsubstantiated garbage spun out by self-interested individuals over an exhaustive report put together by a coalition of over 200 prominent structural engineers from academia, the private sector, and the government.</p>

<p>you&#39;ve been demonstrably wrong about both the FOIA process and the testability of NIST&#39;s conclusions but that doesn&#39;t affect your views.</p>

<p>(1) finding persuasive the extremely detailed and well-documented work done by over 200 preeminent structural engineers over a 5 year period--a work that clearly states its major assumptions and conclusions and presents and rejects several alternative hypotheses</p>

<p>AND</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not asking <em>you</em> to do the work.  I&#39;m asking structural engineers who espouse different theories to do the work.  This has been done with WTC 1 &amp; 2, for example (see <a href="http://www.kz.tsukuba.ac.jp/%7Eisobe/187.pdf">http://www.kz.tsukuba.ac.jp/~isobe/187.pdf</a>, in which an alternative model concludes that the WTC towers would have fallen even without the fire).  You&#39;ve fallen into the logic trap of claiming you can invalidate the NIST report without actually having any proof that you can do so, which means you are holding alternative hypotheses to an entirely different standard than you hold the NIST report.</p>

<p>The NIST report was reviewed and certified by over 200 preeminent structural engineers from varied fields (academia, private sector, government), all of whom had an independent say on its methodology and whether or not they would certify the final report&#39;s contents.  That level of input, expertise, and consensus is almost unprecedented, which is why the report is not seriously challenged by any academic structural engineer: it&#39;s entire drafting process was far more rigorous and thorough than that of even typical peer reviewed work.  That you don&#39;t grasp this is just because you obviously are not familiar with academic scientific reports (as you made patently clear with that little &quot;newton&#39;s third law&quot; snark)</p>

<p>Thus, as with any peer reviewed work, the NIST report&#39;s conclusion stands until challenged and invalidated by an alternative hypothesis.

<p>As for WTC 7, it had major fires across many floors for several hours, a broken sprinkler system, and no fire fighters working to stop the blaze. (It was also damaged heavily by the spire and other parts of the north tower, which is what triggered the fires, but that structural damage did not play a major role in the collapse initiation, at least according to NIST.) The fatal flaw of WTC 7 was an unusual column configuration that allowed it to straddle a con ed power substation over which it had been built. NIST published over 2000 pages on the subject of exactly how the particular pattern of fires led to a failure of those columns, so I&#39;ll defer to them on the details, but, suffice to say, the fires eventually did enough damage to the floor trusses (as they did in WTC 1 and 2) to disallocate crucial support columns and trigger a systematic failure across floors 8-16, which lead to total collapse.</p>

<p>And NIST concludes the special structures over the con ed substation were not at fault.  But you obviously don&#39;t understand the NIST report if you think the con ed substation did not play a role in the design of the column and truss layout beyond the special structures.  The long truss (40), which met column 79 (the point of failure and collapse initiation), was elongated due to the way the building straddled the substation.</p>

<p>I seriously doubt you&#39;ve even read the report as published at this point (or, if you did read it, you read it with the same level of reading comphrension that allowed you to think &quot;that structural damage did not play a major role in the collapse initiation&quot; means that damage from the twin towers was an issue according to NIST).

    <div class="md"><p>And yet the NIST reports are far more scientific than any alternative theory.  And they even provide enough information that they can be challenged by structural engines with alternative hypotheses, as I have already pointed out and you subsequently ignored and tried to change the subject (see <a href="http://www.kz.tsukuba.ac.jp/%7Eisobe/187.pdf">http://www.kz.tsukuba.ac.jp/~isobe/187.pdf</a>, in which an alternative model concludes that the WTC towers would have fallen even without the fire). You&#39;ve fallen into the logic trap of claiming you can invalidate the NIST report without actually having any proof that you can do so, which means you are holding alternative hypotheses to an entirely different standard than you hold the NIST report.</p>

<p>The NIST report was reviewed and certified by over 200 preeminent structural engineers from varied fields (academia, private sector, government), all of whom had an independent say on its methodology and whether or not they would certify the final report&#39;s contents. That level of input, expertise, and consensus is almost unprecedented, which is why the report is not seriously challenged by any academic structural engineer: it&#39;s entire drafting process was far more rigorous and thorough than that of even typical peer reviewed work. That you don&#39;t grasp this is just because you obviously are not familiar with academic scientific reports (as you made patently clear with that little &quot;newton&#39;s third law&quot; snark)</p>

<p>Thus, as with any peer reviewed work, the NIST report&#39;s conclusion stands until challenged and invalidated by an alternative hypothesis. Which brings me back to the question you have been thrashing to avoid answering for three days now: why are there no independent analyses that support an alternative hypothesis?</p>

<p>NIST hid the work that shows WTC7&#39;s collapse initiation. You&#39;d think with credentials like that (plus a $16,000,000 tax-payer funded budget) NIST would feel confident in their findings. Yet NIST hid their computer simulation data.</p>

<p>Well, guess what, the experts don&#39;t need that data either.  As I&#39;ve pointed out over and over, expert structural engineers have all of the info they need to independently assess NIST&#39;s work.  Thus the fact that there have been ZERO alternative hypotheses offered leaves NIST&#39;s as the most persuasive.</p>

<p>All the NIST model is doing is describing an event.  Either that event happened the way NIST described or it didn&#39;t.  If it didn&#39;t, you don&#39;t need to know why or how NIST reached their conclusions to say NIST is wrong; all you need to show is that there is a better explanation.</p>

There&#39;s a big difference between a military operation kept secret from our people for a few years (not a conspiracy) and some of the large scale conspiracy theories that many people back</p>

<p>That is not why we have compartmentalization.  It&#39;s the whole &quot;need to know&quot; thing to minimize the number of people who have knowledge about x, y, or z.  Although as pointed out, &quot;minimize&quot; is kind of a misnomer based on how many people have clearances.</p>

<p>Sibel Deniz Edmonds is a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) translator and founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition (NSWBC). Edmonds gained public attention following her firing from her position as a language specialist at the FBI&#39;s Washington Field Office in March 2002. She had accused a colleague of covering up illicit activity involving foreign nationals, alleged serious security breaches and cover-ups and that intelligence had been deliberately suppressed, endangering national security. Her later claims gained her awards and fame as a whistleblower.</p>

<p>In March 2012, she published a memoir, titled Classified Woman – The Sibel Edmonds Story.</p>

<p>Edmonds testified before the 9/11 Commission, but her testimony was excluded from the official 567 page 9/11 Commission Report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even comparable though, so no, not by parallel, you are presenting a false parallel.</p>

<p>The people involved in the Atomic Bomb project had absolutely no idea what they were contributing to, they were just working on pieces to a compartmentalized puzzle in which they could not gain enough pieces to link together to form an accurate idea of what the puzzle is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty fucking sure whoever planted the Thermite charges in WTC7 and the Twin Towers knew exactly what they were doing, and were paid handsomely to do so and to keep quite about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like you all pretend that there aren&#39;t reprehensibly evil people in this world that are willing to commit mass murder for money.</p>

<p>Marvin P Bush was a head of the company Securacom when it had contracts with the WTC complex, Dulles Airport, and United Airlines during the times of the attack.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to see how 9/11 could have been kept a secret when all of the prime locations of the attack were covered by a security company operated by a relative to the at the time President.</p>

<p>TL;DR - The reason people involved in the manhattan project have come forward afterwards is because it is legal for them to do so, and they were not engaged in illegal activities, the manhattan project was 100% government approved.</p>

<p>9/11 is not a government approved project, however, so it&#39;s easy to understand why nobody has come forward, because those involved explicitly committed illegal acts, so illegal that it is only logical to assume that not only have they been paid off financially so as to keep the secret, but also are put under threat of death should they choose to reveal sensitive information that could indict a person.</p>

<p>Please answer me a single question. Just calculate how many miles of cable would be required to detonate a destruction of the WTC buildings, and then tell me where all those miles of cable were hidden, and how they were brought <em>to</em> the buildings in the first place, and then into the buildings, and then to the required floors and rooms and fixed onto the structural members of the buildings&#39; skeleton, and how many man hours were involved. Don&#39;t worry about all the tonnes of thermite that would be required, I&#39;ll give that to you for the sake of the argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you&#39;re thinking with conspiracies!</p>

<p>And it wasn&#39;t thermite, it was C4 and detcord. They didn&#39;t have to &#39;blow up&#39; the building, just weaken the structural members enough so that a plane strike would finish the job. So they didn&#39;t need to carry as much. </p>

<p>OH! OH! WAIT! I got a better one!  It wasn&#39;t RADIO controlled detonators! Those are too prone to interference and accidental triggering. It was a top secret piezo-electric detonator system, which, once armed, can be calibrated to detonate on a seismic shock of a certain intensity... so once the plane hit, the ones nearest the plane went first, then the amplified shock wave from those first detonations triggered the rest in a ripple effect that enhanced the shockwave, thus amplifying the effects of the explosion and allowing them to use less charges and explosives so that it would be harder to find residue and bomb components in the rubble!</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really matter, because it&#39;s STILL more likely than a structural collapse at free fall speed for 2.5 seconds.

<p>Sure, maybe 1-2 seconds below free-fall.</p>

<p>The smoking gun is WTC7 (the one that was barely on fire, with no plane that hit it) - which did, according to NIST.</p>

<p>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).</p>

<p>Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A portion of the building (the back wall), falling for a portion of the entire collapse (a distance of about 8 floors) is not the same as the entire building falling at free fall speed.  No matter how many times conspiracy theorists try to conflate the two, they are never going to be the same thing.</p>

<p>The timeline you provided was for the observed collapse of the north face of the building.  Notably, this time line <em>starts several seconds after the collapse had already begun</em> (at the SE corner penthouse).  The reason the portion of the building fell so fast was because it was the last part to come down and all of the major support structures had between floors 6 and 18 had already collapsed or been severely compromised, making their resistance negligible (hence only 8 floors of &quot;free fall speed&quot; for only a portion of the building&#39;s edifice).</p>

<p>It&#39;s very funny to me that people post the NIST report as evidence that the collapse was physically impossible without explosions when the NIST reports explains--in excruciating detail--how the collapse sequence allowed for that.  If you&#39;re going to post the NIST report as evidence for your theory, the least you have to do is create an alternative hypothesis that shows why (1) NIST version of events could not have happened, and (2) your version of events likely did happen.  We never get that.  We just get, &quot;the building fell at free fall speed, that&#39;s unpossible!&quot;</p>

<a href="http://911review.com/articles/ryan/demolition_access_p2.html">http://911review.com/articles/ryan/demolition_access_p2.html</a></p>

<p>Alan Reiss was the PANYNJ&#39;s World Trade Center Director, and as such was considered &quot;mayor&quot; of the WTC. [24] Reiss was employed at the WTC since 1984, working on building systems, the engineering and capital program, and eventually helping to secure major leases for tenants like Banker&#39;s Trust and Fuji Bank. In 1988, he was promoted to the position of the World Trade Center&#39;s supervising engineer, in charge of the complex&#39;s major systems. He was later promoted to Special Assistant to the Director, and eventually, WTC Director.</p>

<p>Reiss took the lead in the response to the 1993 terrorist bombing at the WTC, and it was reported that -- &quot;As Special Assistant to the Director, he managed the design and construction team that restored the World Trade Center&#39;s infrastructure, allowing the Twin Towers to reopen within a month.&quot; [25] At the time he was put in charge of reconstruction, &quot;a job that required him to meet with top brass twice a day.&quot; Reiss said about this period -- &quot;there were so many innovations we made.... After the 1993 bombing, we implemented a ten-year redevelopment program. We were spending half a billion dollars on upgrades. It was an engineer&#39;s dream.&quot; [26]</p>

<p>Part of these upgrades involved constructing new command and control centers throughout the buildings. A new Security Command Center was built on the 22nd floor of the north tower (WTC 1), and a new Operations Control Center was constructed in the B1 level of the south tower (WTC2). [27] Additionally, NYC officials responded to the 1993 bombing by establishing The Office of Emergency Management (OEM), over a period of years, &quot;to promote unified operations between and among the various city emergency responder departments.&quot; The OEM was controversial, in that it was not appreciated by the NYPD, which already had an emergency center. But ultimately, &quot;on September 11, 2001, the OEM center located at WTC 7 became ineffective as WTC 7 was evacuated.&quot; [28] During Rudy Giuliani&#39;s run for President, he and his former employee Jerome Hauer traded accusations about who made the choice of putting the OEM in WTC 7. [29]</p>

<p>When interviewed after the attacks, Alan Reiss &quot;compared the energy of the planes&#39; impacts to the detonation of a tactical nuclear weapon. But he said the buildings&#39; construction may have saved some lives.&quot; [30] Reiss had the highest level of access to the towers, as would be expected for the Director of the WTC. But what is most interesting about Alan Reiss is the evidence that he was not telling the truth after the attacks. The first part of this evidence has to do with his surprising story of what happened to him on that day, and the visible evidence of his experience. </p>

<p>Many senior managers at the PANYNJ who had knowledge of the buildings died on 9/11 trying to help others escape, [31] but Reiss survived. In his testimony to the 9/11 Commission, Reiss stated -- &quot;We were stunned when 2 WTC was also hit by a plane. The police officers and I rushed to the rear emergency exit and looked up at the tower and realized we were at war...At the Port Authority Police&#39;s request, I then returned to the vicinity of 6 World Trade Center to assess the condition of One World Trade Center with then-Captain Whitaker, commander of the PA Police at the WTC, just as the tower began to collapse. We were both enveloped by this churning black debris cloud as we ran north on West Street. It was darker than any burning building I have ever been in as a volunteer fireman, and it was next to impossible to breathe due to the debris in the air.&quot;</p>

<p>One problem with Reiss&#39; testimony is that people who had been &quot;enveloped by [the] churning black debris cloud&quot; were completely covered in dust. [32] But Alan Reiss, who is said to have narrowly escaped the 1993 bombing as well, did not appear to have any dust or debris on him despite having been covered by the dust clouds. An interview with Reiss just moments after the destruction of the towers, in which Reiss&#39; police escort turned his back on Reiss and appeared unusually uncomfortable, demonstrated this fact. [33] </p>

<p>A second piece of evidence indicating that Alan Reiss was being less than truthful after the attacks includes this quote -- &quot;Even if someone had told me the threat was a missile, I don&#39;t know what I could have done, let alone if someone had told me it was going to be a plane. No one ever thought about a hijacked plane being rammed into a building.&quot; [34]</p>

<p>We heard this same false claim -- that no one had ever thought about a plane being rammed into a building -- from George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice. [35] After the public was presented with considerable evidence that many people in the US government had, in fact, thought about and planned for such an event before 9/11, Rice had to correct her comments in her testimony to the 9/11 Commission. </p>

<p>The reasons that Reiss should have been aware of the possibility included the fact that several people Reiss would have known had thought about this very scenario, including the WTC tower&#39;s design engineer, John Skilling. In a 1993 interview, Skilling said that, in the event of an airliner crash into one of the towers, &quot;the building structure would still be there.&quot; [36] One of Reiss&#39; own staff members, Frank A. DeMartini, the Manager of WTC Construction, was videotaped explaining how the towers could have withstood multiple impacts from aircraft. [37] Another person that Reiss would have worked with closely throughout the security upgrades, Brian Michael Jenkins, had also assessed the possibility of an airplane attack on the WTC. [38]</p>

<p>From 1989 to1998, Jenkins was the deputy chairman of Crisis Management for Kroll Associates. Kroll directed the PANYNJ&#39;s response to the 1993 bombing in terms of security upgrades, as stated by Reiss&#39; program manager for WTC security systems, Douglas G. Karpiloff, who died on 9/11. Karpiloff reported -- &quot;After the bombing, we had the top security consultants in the nation, Kroll Associates, do a complete security analysis for us, and we followed their recommendations.&quot; [39]</p>

<p>Luckily, it appears to me that if you had been leading up the team planning the attacks in 2001, it probably would have went a lot like the attacks in 1993 went. Planned by people whose only apparent knowledge of physics is derived from cartoons involving roadrunners.</p>

<p>Why are you fighting against logic? 3 buildings do not collapse from things that cannot cause them to. A 737 hitting the WTC is like a dinghy ramming an aircraft carrier. Even if it starts a fire, the ship isn&#39;t going to melt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. Imagine a project, a half of a billion 1993 dollars, or $809,xxx,xxx.xx 2014 dollars, focused on fire suppression, security, and modernization. A ten year deadline. That would have a lot of activity in areas that the general population does not go. </p>

<p>When a new store is put into a shopping mall, do you get to watch the work through the windows? It&#39;s a work zone, hard hats, insurance, all that. To say that it is outside the realm of possibility that there were explosives placed into the wtc building in advance of September 2001 is ridiculous, especially when considering the odd way all three of the buildings fell. Either way, it was one hell of an insurance payday for the owner of the building, Mr. Silverstein.</p>

<p>And the happy coincidence that evidence related to an investigation being conducted regarding the 2.3 trillion dollars(3.04t, after inflation) that were missing from the pentagon was contained in wtc7. Information and investigations were also going on in the exact portion of the Pentagon that was destroyed also after undergoing recent renovations.

<p>Who needs to wire explosives? Even in 2001 remote detonators were used. Also, have you seen the latest military tech for roadside bombs? It&#39;s a microwave. Apparently, blasting metals, like the ones used in high explosives, with microwave radiation will ignite them. Who knew? Aside from every person who has ever put metal in a microwave. </p>

<p>Now, It&#39;s possible to consider that a compound like thermite, with it&#39;s iron oxide, the aluminum, and maybe a little sulphur would ignite if placed in a microwave. right? I would test it out, but, I really don&#39;t need that kind of attention. Plus, I don&#39;t have an extra microwave. </p>

<p>Do you know what Radar is? Do you know what the big emitters are on top of our &quot;aerial command planes&quot;? The same planes circling the towers before they fell? </p>

<p>See, that&#39;s a bit of a crazy theory. But it could work. You could use a spray on nano-thermite, call it a rust prevention repaint for the bolts in the building, or a fire retardant spray for the steel columns to protect them from a structure fire that wouldn&#39;t be hot enough to melt them unless they were made of aluminum. </p>

<p>You know, as a safety measure, it would be wise to apply this stuff to any steel bridge you can find. In case of a viral outbreak, or civil uprising, it would be useful to be able to destroy vital infrastructure, for the greater good. Now, maybe 9/11 was just a weapons system demonstration... </p>

<p>See, because the official story doesn&#39;t add up, you then have to wonder what actually happened. Were the planes just for show? Because it really looks like it to me. </p>

<p>Then you&#39;re an idiot.</p>

<p>This is, so far as I can tell, how it works.</p>

<p>Everybody watches as the first tower burns. Footage soon comes in of the aircraft hitting the building. </p>

<p>After a while, a second aircraft, clearly deliberately, flies at speed into the second tower. That too burns.</p>

<p>For an hour – an hour, mind you – smoke pours skyward. Black smoke. And flames stream from the building.</p>

<p>Then one of the towers collapses. Every reasonable person watching goes ‘Oh my god. Those poor people. Jesus fuck. God, I hope the people in the second tower make it.’</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, the second tower collapses. Every reasonable person watching it goes ‘O shit. That’s awful. All the policemen and the firemen too.’</p>

<p>People like you, however, think like this.</p>

<p>‘Wow! I never saw a building that tall collapse. I never saw a building that <em>big</em> collapse. I never saw a building made <em>from that somewhat unusual structural design</em> collapse before. I mean, nobody in the world ever saw those things before – because it’s never happened. Not accidentally, not due to enemy action, not due to demolition. Nothing. </p>

<p>So-o, look. There’s absolutely NOTHING to compare this to. Not one previous event remotely like it.</p>

<p>But you know what? Working on nothing but what pops into my head sitting in my bedsit watching TV, and applying no proper principles of inductive or deductive reasoning, and with no axioms from which to proceed, I think – having no previous experience of demolishing buildings myself – that these buildings ought to have collapsed differently. I don’t know how, exactly, but they seemed to just – fall along their own axis. Admittedly, from about half way down there was too much shit in the air to see what happened, but still, just that bit above the dust was… fishy.</p>

<p>Don’t you think they ought to have collapsed in some other way? I don’t know – listed to the left a bit. Or listed to the right. Or maybe to the front. How can it be that they fell down straight? I mean, trees don’t do that, do they? Nor lampposts.</p>

<p>Nah, I’ve decided – again, without any experience or expertise to go on – that this is Suspicious with a capital S. This was done deliberately, by my government, in order to do – well, something, I’m not sure right now, but something they couldn’t do without surreptitiously destroying the WTC and killing the 3,000 people working there, something really devious that regular Joes would never suspect, only smart buggers like me who can fathom the Machiavellian depths of our politicians.</p>

<p>Well, shit. I better start hitting up the internet for plausible scenarios which support my gifted and intuitive analysis of what I just saw only on a TV screen. First, coffee.’</p>

<p>Either that, or you just like writing horse-droppings on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow...you totally debunked everything without even posting a link or anything but your own opinions.  You must be the best your middle school debate team has to offer.  Bravo!</p>

<p>&quot;Non-Americans&quot; are still &quot;humans&quot; to many.....so we dont excuse death based on national borders.  Great if you do, but that isnt proof OR evidence of anything but your jingoism.</p>

<p>Why would it take hundreds of Americans to carry out 9-11?  Where is that number from?  The hijackers certainly werent American....14 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi.  There is no doubt that Israel either had information about the attack before it happened, or possibly even helped.  There were several countries in play...there is no doubt of that.  Why would it take 100 Americans?</p>

<p>Tell me who Valerie Plame is and I will continue this discussion.  The fact remains that many people are ignorant to what goes on....most are overly skeptical (without being overly knowledgeable), and those who HAVE COME OUT about 9-11 (the ones that DIDNT keep a secret) are easily dismissed by people like you.  All of a sudden those Eyewitnesses that &quot;didnt exist&quot; are now &quot;flawed by the eyewitness dynamic....it really is the least accurate form of proof&quot;.   The thousands of engineers and architects wont matter to you either....the words of military leaders and politicians are now easily dismissed...and people in the actual buildings (maintenance workers who heard explosions, bystanders who heard countdowns, and firemen who said the fires werent bad enough to warrant more hose for example) have less to say than some troll without any links to share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your link sites one sloppy article published in a newspaper 3 years after the project started. An article that was not picked up by any major outlets and is only notable when looking back after the facts had already come out, as per the phrase &quot;hindsight is 20/20&quot;.</p>

<p>And here are some points I find interesting from your own link: </p>

<p>After finding out about the leak, Col. Ashbridge, the military head of Los Alamos wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The action of the newspaper in printing such an article shows a complete lack of responsibility, compliance with national censorship code and cooperation with the Government in keeping an important project secret. It is hoped that some steps can be taken to deny the paper certain privileges as a result of their disclosure of this project in such an article.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what did [General] Groves end up doing? First he made sure that it wouldn’t spread further — he put the kibosh on any follow-up stories or further syndication. Time magazine was going to write a follow-up regarding West Coast atom smashing work, but the Office of Censorship stopped them. Then he had the reporter investigated and interviewed. For awhile he thought about getting Raper drafted to the Pacific Theatre — a rather bloodthirsty approach to the problem. He relented on this when, as it turned out, Raper was in his sixties. Not exactly Army grunt material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: AzSnakePit is harping on the word &quot;complete&quot; by sourcing a link about an article that made it into a newspaper, then was immediately squashed out like a candle flame. And the only reason we can even look back on that article is because the truth eventually came out. But when the article came out, it was nothing more than a blurb in a newspaper. But congrats to AZ for successfully sidetracking the post and focusing on word semantics and the definition of complete to try to disregard the information. Notice his post immediately starts with &quot;You are wrong&quot;. That sounds to me like someone who doesn&#39;t even want to learn something new, and immediately found the easiest hole to squeeze through in order to discredit the entire post.</p>

<p>So here is the new headline of my post:</p>

<p><strong>If they claim the conspiracy was too big to keep secret, remind them that the Manhattan Project employed over 130,000 people and remained a secret until President Truman announced 3 years later that Hiroshima had been bombed.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The aim of censorship was to prevent all mention of the atomic program in the American press; however, on the advice of the Office of Censorship, the District permitted a limited amount of information about certain aspects of the project to appear in newspapers published in communities near the Clinton and Hanford sites. Office of Censorship officials pointed out that complete suppression of information about activities at these locations would actually draw more attention than a policy of judicious release of news of local interest.</p>

<p>I’ve sometimes heard people suggest that were the press like this during World War II, things like the secret of the atomic bomb could never have been kept as well as they were.

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t get what you post is meant to say.. Germany and Russia knew full well the US was working on a bomb... Worldwide Academia knew as well. A congressmen even investigated it. The only people who didn&#39;t know were the people actually working on the bomb..so yes quite a bit of people did know. they may not have known the US is working on a bomb called fat man who will be dropped from this plane on this city, they may not have known all the details but they did know the US was working on a bomb. again.... this is a FACT: ACADEMIA KNEW A BOMB WAS BEING BUILT. LETTERS WERE WRITTEN ABOUT IT. </p>

<p>Hell Russia pretty much built the bomb for us with all the spies they had working with us. </p>

Your commitment to the truth is exemplary, its important the general public know that there is zero validity to the claim that los alamos was kept relatively secret from the masses, and that large scale false flags like hitler burning his own parliament building to create a boogie man out of the jews never happens, and certainly arent kept secret when they do. </p>

<p>So, how long did the Manhattan Project remain a secret <strong>after Hiroshima had been bombed</strong>?  Answer: we knew about the Manhattan Project THE NEXT DAY, the New York Times writing an in-depth front-page article on August 7, 1945. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about here. Not pre-execution planning - where I can see compartmentalization allowing people not to put the pieces together. But we&#39;re now <strong>12+ years</strong> after the alleged 9/11 plan is carried out, and there is not one credible claim from anyone involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many reasons why this is a <strong>terrible</strong> comparison to how hard it would be to keep a conspiracy/secret anywhere even close to that today.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As has been mentioned social networking (Twitter, email, Facebook, etc) didn&#39;t exist. A lot of today&#39;s news stories start out via these methods. Heck revolutions have begun with these new technologies that were non-existent even 10 years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>The 24 hour news cycle. There are literally thousands of cable and online investigative reporters <strong>dying</strong> for stories like this to report on and expose...</p></li>
<li><p>Which leads us to voluntary censorship of the press. Google &quot;The Office of Censorship&quot; and &quot;voluntary press censorship&quot;. Nothing like this exists today.</p></li>
<li><p>Some real life examples of this censorship: FDR died in 1945 with nearly all of America never knowing that their four (elected) term President was confined to a wheelchair. Let that sink in for a minute - we elected a man 4 times w/o knowing he was handicapped, and confined to a wheelchair.</p></li>
<li><p>How about a slightly more modern example: Most of the press that covered the whitehouse knew of Jack Kennedy&#39;s penchant for other women, most said nothing as a courtesy to the man and the office. Watergate and Nixon pretty much ended all those good feelings though.</p></li>
<li><p>In WWII there existed a patriotic inspired &quot;loose lips sink ships&quot; mantra around any and all discussions about military/government matters that is mostly entirely absent today.</p></li>
<li><p>We also now know that the Russians knew very well exactly what we were doing, and where we were doing it. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying conspiracies couldn&#39;t exist today, only that they&#39;d be orders of magnitude harder to keep secret, especially as time goes by and more and more smaller leaks and other clues get discovered.</p>

In your &quot;original post&quot; (since apparently that&#39;s the only content by which your character may be judged) you never once addressed the issue of compartmentalization.

<p>I pointed out many reasons why that was not a fair comparison.</p>

<p>There was no &quot;compartmentalization&quot; in the OP&#39;s post and no mention of any specific conspiracy by me or OP.</p>

<p>So you tell me, how did &quot;compartmentalization&quot; keep the entire country from knowing that FDR was confined to a wheelchair if the world wasn&#39;t just a very different place in 1945 than it is today.</p>

If you read further, you can see that he was capable of walking when in public and only used the wheelchair in private. 
So no, this had nothing to do with the technology available at the time. You are either dreadfully uninformed on matters you pretend to be an expert upon, or you are deliberately spreading false information. Either way, your conclusion is wrong as shit. </p>

<p>Additionally, I can say that your comparison of FDR and Manhattan or 9/11 is no more than anecdote, just as OP&#39;s statement. It&#39;s literally not even applicable either. Obama isn&#39;t in a wheelchair. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was no &quot;compartmentalization&quot; in the OP&#39;s post and no mention of any specific conspiracy by me or OP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You actually did mention 9/11 multiple times and this is truly a tired argument. Why you choose to continue to claim you never referenced a specific conspiracy when you in fact referenced two (FDR and 9/11). The only thing you got right is that the OP didn&#39;t reference anything but the Manhattan Project. However, you came here with your blades sharpened and ready for war and entirely missed the intention of the post. OP assumed that readers would understand that if a project as massive and expensive as the <em>covert invention of the most powerful weapon on the planet</em> can be hidden from the people it is supposedly being undertaken for, then when the the cavalry of ignoramuses come riding in on their high horses and claim big secrets can&#39;t be kept, we can offer them this anecdote of a time when a gargantuan secret <em>was</em> kept, and like a 22 caliber bullet can slip through a kevlar vest, maybe it will actually make an impact. </p>

<p>The 22 certainly won&#39;t always penetrate a Kevlar vest, however, and in this case, it doesn&#39;t appear to have done anything to got one well-conditioned wage slave all hot and bothered. </p>

<p>Too hot and bothered to address the issue of compartmentalization as a concrete counter-argument to his argument that big lies can&#39;t be hidden from the public eye. </p>

<p>And too hot and bothered to see that his argument, by directly citing a conspiracy in which the president of the United States had deceived his people about the state of his illness, defeats itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FURTHERMORE, since you <em>do</em> need your hand held to actually undertake the learning process, allow me to offer a few authoritative quotations that may, with luck, resound in the empty cavern between your ears:</p>

<p><em>“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”</em> 
- Former Nazi Officer, Joseph Goebbels</p>

<p><em>The essential English leadership secret does not depend on particular intelligence. Rather, it depends on a remarkably stupid thick-headedness. The English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.</em>
- Once more, Goebbels</p>

<p><em>In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.</em>
—Adolf Hitler , Mein Kampf, vol. I, ch. X</p>

<p>But American Leaders probably don&#39;t know anything about such skullduggery and treachery, surely?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">Well, not if the American Leaders recruited the Nazi officers who read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and became enamored with lying big.</a></p>

<p><em>“No matter how big the lie; repeat it often enough and the masses will regard it as the truth.”</em>

<p>And the compartmentalization angle only works if you overlook the fact that there was no expectation of secrecy after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That&#39;s my biggest beef with this &quot;But the Manhattan Project!&quot; argument: it uses the three years of secrecy around the atomic bomb <strong>before it went off</strong> to rationalize the continuing secrecy around 9/11 <strong>after the towers came down.</strong> The compartmentalization thing only works to a certain extent, because a lot of 9/11 truther theories I&#39;ve seen hinge on the idea that certain things that happened on that day could&#39;ve only been done by inside actors, people who were at least partly conscious of what they were doing. Like, all the compartmentalization in the world isn&#39;t going to remove the doubts of the hypothetical guys who rigged Building 7 to blow. It could keep them from realizing what they were contributing to when they were contributing to it, but it&#39;s not going to keep them from putting two and two together on September 12th.</p>

<p>I disagree with you about nuclear weapons development being a public matter post-WWII. All military research and activity is classified, and they only chose to let us in on the Manhattan Project because they could spin it as a necessary evil that turned out to be a roaring success anyways. </p>

The invasion of a country that had nothing to do with the attacks any way you spin it isn&#39;t fishy. The fact that Al-Qaeda itself was created and funded by the CIA 3 decades ago isn&#39;t fishy.

<p>The above is blatantly untrue. More people than ever are aware that there was a cover-up of the true events of 9/11. However, the efforts to quell such dissenting opinions is greater than ever. I&#39;m not smarter than everyone else, but I sure as hell feel smarter than <em>you</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, thanks for the polite, respectful response. I&#39;ve seen much less of that than I expected based on my reasonable original comment.</p>

<p>The original poster, whom I was responding to had not said anything about compartmentalization. His post was simply that the Manhattan Project being successfully kept secret was an example of how large conspiracies today could be kept secret.</p>

<p>I simply pointed out many reasons why I believed this was not accurate as a comparison of how we (the press, the public and technology) interact and interrelate today. It is very different than in 1945.</p>

<p>And as others have mentioned the MP was something we were working on for our own self interest at a time of great tension and patriotism as we fought a world war.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think the MP secrecy is comparable to huge conspiracies of today. In my opinion of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a dead on exact comparison because aren&#39;t there <em>many</em> Black Projects going on right now that the public doesn&#39;t know about?

The Church Committee was not allowed to review the MKNaomi documents because they had mysteriously been destroyed.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s almost been 50 years. Still, no one knows what MKNaomi is about. How does that work out? We have the internet, the 24 hour news cycle, Google, etc etc. How is it possible for this secret to be kept?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the simple answer may be that MKNaomi wasn&#39;t ever really anything. Who said it was? What did it do? Who felt its effects? </p>

<p>I mean just because somebody mentioned something doesn&#39;t mean it was ever anything important. If a secret falls in the woods - did it really ever do or mean anything?</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about events that don&#39;t need to be proven to have even existed. The Manhattan Project existed. No doubt about that.</p>

<p>But conspiracies about things that have occurred (9/11. JFK, Sandy Hook, etc) or something else on such a huge scale haven&#39;t ever been successfully kept secret.</p>

<p>Anyway, we&#39;re beating a dead horse really. I get your point, and do agree there are many things ongoing we don&#39;t know about. I&#39;m (personally) just doubtful any are or ever will be on the scale of the MP ever again.</p>

<p>My man. 23% of the Pentagon&#39;s budget goes into &quot;Black Projects&quot;. Almost half of all government documents are classified. Have you ever heard of Operation Paperclip? The Manhattan Project never ended. It was combined with the Nazi Kammlerstab (their MP) and continues to this day as the MK Umbrella operations of the CIA, NSA and Pentagon. </p>

<p>Most of the men that work in these projects and a lot of men in politics acknowledge that they belong to secret societies. GWB and John Kerry both have admitted to being in the Skull and Bones sect of the Jesuit Order. Have you ever read the <a href="http://www.reformation.org/jesuit-oath.html">Jesuit Order Oath</a>?</p>

<p>There is literally a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj2qrl6Q2rk">Secret Space Program</a>. Do you think that we would actually be cutting the budget for the exploration into space? Hell no. Space is the most important frontier for all military&#39;s. NASA (the public space program) is the only one getting cuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it&#39;s not usually participants with actual evidence (documents, unpublished pictures, video/audio recordings) that &quot;come forward&quot;. It&#39;s third party theorists and/or investigators. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a big difference between &quot;yeah I planted charges in the south tower on 9/10 and here&#39;s my proof&quot; and &quot;it sure looks on this CNN video like a charge was used to bring down the tower&quot;.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t equal situations at all. Can you point out actual participants of any of the bigger conspiracies that have admitted being involved AND produced irrefutable proof of the conspiracy?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you can and THAT is what people mean when they say &quot;something that big could never be kept a secret - something would have leaked&quot;.</p>

<p>For the Kennedy assassination this is one of my two biggest problems. If it was a conspiracy it would have had to involve so many different groups: the CIA, the FBI, the Dallas police, the doctors and Parkland, the doctors at Bathesda, etc. Just too many people to coordinate and keep quiet all these years, through all the multitude of investigations, etc.</p>

<p>My second biggest problem is the second or third shooter conundrum. If you&#39;re planning this shooting, and you&#39;re using more than just LHO in the book depository, then you&#39;d plan a story/deception to throw ALL the shooters under the bus (so the really big conspiracy would stay secret) such as &quot;disgruntled cuban trio kill President&quot; or some such backstory. You couldn&#39;t plan on there being poor enough ballistics to hide/confuse the presence of a 2nd or 3rd gunman. But yet there was only one suspect being sought immediately afterwards, only one backstory of a single disaffected communist/cuban sympathizer. And only after that fact did wed see how the ballistics looked very odd but not conclusively odd enough to if there were other gunman. </p>

<p>TL;DR: How do you have other JFK shooters, expect confusing ballistics and have no backstories for the others if they get caught/found.</p>

<p>Well, they certainly have a very strong disincentive to come forward, don&#39;t they. Following your logic there were no serial killers since they didn&#39;t come forward.</p>

<p>I heard Hunt&#39;s sons just coached a senile old man for financial gain. None of what he said could be verified by third parties.</p>

<p>But by your own logic where are the deathbed confessions of all the other Kennedy conspirators? Shouldn&#39;t there be a bunch more, and at least one with a smoking gun (no pun intended lol)</p>

<p>Also you failed to answer my 2nd gunman question. How do you plan a huge conspiracy, with two gunman, then only throw one under the bus immediately and have NO ballistic evidence of the 2nd gunman? Luck?</p>

<p>It should be common sense. But nowadays common sense goes out the window when dealing with people who pick and chose what fits nicely into their media-generated version of reality.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: it is sad that I have to keep adding edits to point out how many people have made it their job to sidetrack this, argue about word-semantics, and use their 20/20 hindsight vision to try to re-write the past. <strong>The Manhattan Project was a secret.

    <div class="md"><p>OK.  But do bear in mind this isn&#39;t necessarily transferable to anything.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t say that the Manhattan Project was kept under tight wraps and therefore 911 could also have been a government op.  The two don&#39;t follow each other.</p>

<p>For starters, even if people tried to explain what they were working on in the MP no one would have understood it or it would have sounded like they were insane.  &quot;Oh you&#39;re going to split atoms and blow up the world eh?  Yeah yeah, sure you are and I&#39;m superman about to fly back to Krypton.&quot;</p>

<p>Had nuclear weapons already existed there is no way the MP would have remained as secret as it did (see the problems Iran is having).</p>

<p>For me the lesson here is less that big conspiracies can remain secret and more that extremely ambitious scientific projects can labor in obscurity because no one knows what the heck they&#39;re doing or believe it will even work.  As an example if I tried to tell you I&#39;m working for the government on a time machine so we can go back and kill Hitler you&#39;d dismiss me as a nut.  And rightfully so.  If I told you I&#39;m working for the NSA collecting the phone records of all Americans in contravention of the Constitution you&#39;re more likely to believe me.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>not saying that this is what happened, just explaining how it could have worked:</p>

<p>things you need:</p>

<p>1)  a cell of fundamentalists thinking that they are working for a terrorist organization. they gonna die anywa, so they wont talk even if they knew something (and they don&#39;t)<br/>
2)  a leader, an actual agent possing as a terrorist &quot;serving a greater organization&quot; and not sharing any unnecesary info to the rest of the team based on the compartmentalized nature of those orgs.<br/>
3) a handler for that agent.<br/>
4) another team smuggling supplies and money to the targeted regions under the belief that those resources are used on another different black op. nothing they didn&#39;t do every other day.<br/>
5) another team of analists working as an op-force and searching for weak points in the defenses (ex: reaction time for the airforce to intercept, security on airports and planes, possible routes and targets etc, ways to get the training without anyone raising a flag,etc). this is also a routine job, if fact there was a dossier a couple of months/years before 9/11 exploring the posibility of this exact type of attack that was presented.<br/>
6) the guys planing this. it can be done by one or two high ranking officers alone.<br/>
and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>6) plans the whole thing and uses the intel provided by 5), the resources provided by 4) and feeds them to 3), who gives that to 2), who trains and arms 1).</p>

<p>the whole operation takes the cell, who cant tell anything because they went kamikaze and died, plus 4-5 people who know the whole thing and maybe a hundred that only did their regular jobs and have no idea how it was used.</p>

<p>further, you can kill 2 and 3 in a number of ways once everything is in movement and reduce the whole thing to only the 2 people planing it.</p>

<p>you dont even need the idiotic amount of people involved that some theories use, as you already have most of the infrastructure needed.</p>

<p>again, not saying that this is what happened or anything, just pointing some things that are pretty basic yet most people here get them wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What this infers is that if over one hundred thousand people could be &quot;made&quot; to &#39;stay quiet&#39; then getting a few hundred people to &#39;keep a secret&#39; is orders of magnitude simpler.</p>

<p>Granted few would have known much more than a small part of the &#39;whole story&#39;, people would have worked on a purely &quot;need to know&quot; basis, but no doubt thousands would have known it involved some type of a &#39;weapon&#39;, although, as it was a completely &#39;new&#39; type of weapon,   chances are no one would guess &#39;atomic&#39; anything, let alone a bomb, it would have been easier to let people think what they liked, but as they were all sworn to secrecy &#39;or else!&#39; talking about the project outside of work was strictly prohibited and would have been minimal.</p>

<p>Another thing is that <em>thousands</em> of people left the program, and yet nothing was ever divulged, which shows how successful they were at keeping people &#39;in the dark&#39; via a &quot;need to know&quot; basis  .... and the same strategy still works today, especially with enlisted military who know not to question any orders, and we know that mercenaries quite happily follow their employers &#39;instructions&#39;. </p>

<p>And it has been conclusively shown, at least since the &#39;war&#39; in the Yemen back in the early 60&#39;s, that &#39;private&#39; forces are extremely effective and have unique  &#39;benefits&#39; for the country which is clandestinely &#39;supporting&#39; (funding) them!  </p>

<p>Since then, countless coups and other military actions around the world have been done by paid mercenaries, and aside from paying them they have several ways of &#39;keeping them quiet&#39;, with &#39;tragic accidents&#39; and suicide being a favorite way to go for those who <em>might</em> pose a threat ... after a while you end up with a pretty trustworthy core &#39;corps&#39; of men who will do whatever is asked of them ... for a price.</p>

<p>As we already well know. And as for &#39;clandestine govt forces&#39; aka &quot;black ops&quot; we really have no idea at all and probably never will. Add to that the more overt CIA activities around the world and there&#39;s no doubt shit&#39;s going down we may never know about until it&#39;s waaay too late ... as has happened too many times before.</p>

Show me a link that says the NIST report was peer reviewed that&#39;s not from their own website. and the 9/11 commission report was complete bullshit, and even the scientific community seems to think that, although they might word it nicer..</p>

<p>Even if It were peer reviewed still would not settle things.
If the government manages to round up a team of 10 -20 scientists willing to give their approval that is sufficient for you.
No more questioning..</p>

<p>Over 2000 architects and engineers disagree with the official report, how o how is that not peer reviewed??</p>

Now I would like to see you meet every 2000 plus of these individuals and calmly explain to them how they are batshit insane and need their head checked...
Now you show me the peer reviewed article supporting the official explanation of the collapses, especially that of building 7.</p>

<p>If you find it, take note if it is a government agency or not and then take a look at some independent research and see where that leads you..
Maybe just google the subject thoroughly before showing off your ignorance :) 
Not trying to be condescending here, but this is really important...
There are two theories out there regarding the 9/11 event.</p>

<p>1 A group of powerful people behind the scenes orchestrated it.
2 Some talibans with boxcutters penetrated the most sophisticated and advanced military empire that has ever existed on this earth....
Now one of these theories does indeed require the logical part of the brain to take a leave of absence and for multiple instances of unbelievable coincidences to occur.
The other requires people to take a hard look at how they perceive the world..
Can you tell which is which my friend? </p>

Or that this example is talking about a 3 year window where a secret group was operating isolated from everyone else, and how radically different that is from the notion of keeping a secret like masterminding 9/11 for over a decade? And also even this &quot;secret&quot; wasn&#39;t actually kept secret from the Russians as many have pointed out in this thread?

Even what foreign intel agencies and law enforcement knew would be relevant.  FBI, CIA, NSA, State, DOD, NTSB, NYPD, Wash DC PD, etc.</p>

<p>And since we weren&#39;t at war, there was no unified public sentiment to keep D&#39;s from ratting out R&#39;s, and vice-versa.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the EPA and the trial lawyers.</p>

<p>The EPA was testing and publishing analyses of the wtc dust nearly every day for over 8 years.  Yet conspiracy theorists will still claim that there was no testing for explosives.</p>

<p>Yet, even if the EPA were lying, what about the trial bar?  9-11 was a multi-billion dollar event that caused health complications for hundreds of thousands of people in the NYC metropolitan area.  If the attacks that day were carried out or sanctioned by non-judgement-proof individuals (e.g., the US government), then trial lawyers would have a field day recovering.  Billions of dollars of incentives on the table.  And many of the best plaintiffs&#39; firms are located in Manhattan, with no few downtown.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re telling me best plaintiffs lawyers in the country were walking through and breathing the wtc dust on the way to work--dust that conspiracy theorists insist <em>obviously</em> came from those within the US government attacking its citizens--and they would not even try to assemble a class and state a claim for billions of dollars?  Seriously?</p>

<p>At a minimum, conspiracy theorists have obviously never worked closely with the plaintiffs&#39; bar.</p>

<p>EDIT: I should also point out that the plaintiffs&#39; bar has, in fact, vigorously argued and apparently won cases on behalf of those with respiratory ailments stemming from the wtc collapse.  Those cases doubtlessly involved sophisticated analysis of the composition of the WTC dust.  See, e.g., <a href="http://www.post911attorneys.com/#top">http://www.post911attorneys.com/#top</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point.  Everyone points to Silverstein&#39;s victory over Swiss Re on certain insurance policies as evidence of his obvious complicity in the attacks.  Well, if it were so obvious, don&#39;t you think the insurance companies, using the best lawyers in the world, would have pointed it out?  There was billions on the line and a drawn-out fight in the courts for over five years.  The insurance companies were represented by Simpson Thatcher.  It&#39;s not like they would have missed a provable contributory negligence claim.</p>

<p>As far as these workers were concerned, they were just working on another weapon in a period of chaos. And this isn&#39;t mentioning the fact that the project was <em>crawling</em> with Soviet spies. Basically, this is a <a href="/r/badhistory">/r/badhistory</a> field day. </p>

<p>Comparing the Manhattan Project to whatever conspiracy OP thinks happened on 9/11 is comparing apples to hand grenades. </p>

<p>Edit: just leaving <a href="http://debunking911.com/">this</a> here so that <em>maybe</em> one of you will read it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Soviets knew. That&#39;s not semantics - it&#39;s disproof of your premise. We couldn&#39;t keep the Norden bombsight secret from the Nazis, either. Information this important is nearly impossible to keep quiet for any significant length of time. Even Snowden is talking about spying from within the last decade... and he wasn&#39;t the first. We knew about Room 614A just three years after it was installed. </p>

<p>And as people have noted here, all that compartmentalized work became obviously related once the bomb fell. So the idea that someone could unwittingly, for example, rig the WTC with explosives and then <em>not</em> put 2+2 together when the buildings collapsed, is still pretty goddamn implausible. Detcord isn&#39;t something you can mistake for wiring, and it&#39;s not exactly easy to cram plastique into support beams and believe you&#39;re doing something else entirely. Truther meetings would be full of people comparing notes about contract work related to the towers instead of collecting signatures from random electrical engineers.</p>

<p>And even then, none of this would address the root problem: huge conspiracies are inherently kind of ridiculous. Little conspiracies, even among big names, are manageable, plausible, and potentially effective. Getting twenty people to pretend to be al-Qaeda and plow airliners into buildings is a thing that could happen. Getting thousands of people to produce the world&#39;s most impractical pyrotechnics show, <em>without any of them knowing they&#39;re involved,</em> strains credulity beyond reason. </p>

<p><em>And even then</em> - the goddamn Russians would&#39;ve called us out on it by now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some secrets are kept better than others but this can be a dangerous line of thought. </p>

<p>If whistle-blowers got more protections then we wouldn&#39;t have to seek questionable news sources for a critical opinion on what&#39;s happening in our country/the world.</p>

<p>Each lazy journalist who does more to whitewash public opinion than to inform is lending more credibility to even the worst of conspiracy theorists. We&#39;ve advanced to the age of linkbait and it&#39;s only gotten worse.</p>

<p>We may never reach the truth, whatever it may be. </p>

<p>The system is very organized and the punishment for true patriotism is treason. Both politicians and the media are more beholden to sponsors than the public which the politicians and the media supposedly represent and inform. They continue to operate in this fashion without any fear of backlash because everyone has accepted that this is the way things are.</p>

<p>Public discourse consists of a group of like minded people who have all been taken advantage of. Rather than rally together people argue different talking points that were disseminated through their preferred brand of corporate media. </p>

<p>In my lifetime I&#39;ve seen the fabric of the American community wither and die under foreclosure, student debt, medical bills, divorce, and isolation. Corporate profits are at an all time high but across the board many generations are struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p>I hope that someday we can stop bickering about chem trails and moon landings and acknowledge the fact that there has been a major consolidation of power and wealth into the hands of the few.  </p>

<p>There are bigger things to address and as a populous, our lack of organization guarantees the victory of any conspiracy, no matter how viable or far fetched.</p>

<p>The news would have you believe there is more outrage about Justin Bieber than any social, economic, or climate issue. The cult of personality has failed us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not comparable at all. First off, the manhattan project was not successfully kept a secret. But more importantly, a secluded research project in the middle of the desert is not even remotely similar to a multi-location attack in an urban center. When the goal of the manhattan project was accomplished, it wasn&#39;t a secret anymore! </p>

<p>This would be comparable only if they had bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and THEN people STILL didn&#39;t know about the project. That&#39;s the level of absurdity that is being claimed with 9-11 conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>You are saying that the NSA has been snooping under our noses for decades, despite the fact that the internet has been used heavily. And this is the one argument you have put forward to argue that the existence of the internet in 1939 would not have effected the ability of the Manhattan Project to stay secret.</p>

<p>A) What does technology existing have to do with the NSA or any other organization being able to spy? It only increases that ability. </p>

<p>B) This very spying you are talking about has been exposed through the use of modern information technology. Do you not understand how this fact disproves what you are trying to say? Or did I misunderstand the point you are making. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be a dick, but if you would care to stop calling me names one for a moment and explain what I&#39;m missing here, I would be glad to find out.</p>

<p>Not their ability to spy.  The fact that they are spying.  Thousands of contractors spying on Americans daily and not one bit of it got out to the public until Snowden came along.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was exposed by a reporter who worked at a newspaper.  The internet took it and ran with it.  But the Snowden story broke then same way stories broke in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>until</p>

<p>as in it did come out, and the NSA spying program, while deplorable, is less deplorable than fabricating 9/11 by a magnitude of infinity. And yet it took just one of their guys just a small amount of exposure to it to know it was wrong and needed to be leaked. And yet you don&#39;t think anyone involved in the far more deplorable 9/11 would have a bit of remourse?</p>

<p>Also you are speaking as tho Snowden was the only government whistleblower. Since 9/11 we&#39;ve had a spying scandal of some sort be exposed by whistleblowers every few years going back to W.&#39;s &#39;warrantless wiretapping&#39; scandals. </p>

<p>So many in fact that I forgot for a moment that Snowden went to the guardian, because Manning and so many others have gone through wikileaks. </p>

<p>But more to the core, Snowden was working there because he was a computer specialist. Technology was infused with the very reason why he was brought in in the first place. And why he was able to physically make the leak. </p>

<p>But again, the A#1 key point here is that it did get out, and so did warrantless wiretapping, and everything wikileaks ever put out, and you cannot say that living in the information era did not aid in those processes. </p>

<p>Every single spying program you can point to as an example of their ability to be covert, you only can point to because they have been exposed. </p>

<p>This was an enormous project that at one point consumed more resources than the atomic program, and was considered the ultimate weapon as it was extremely effective against aeroplanes and even V1 buzz bombs. Radar proximity shells could be used everywhere, while the atomic bomb was a untried experiment with limited use. They were not allowed to be used in any situation where the enemy might recover and reverse engineer one. </p>

<p>Even today, it is rarely discussed, and most people are not aware that radar triggered shells were used in WW2 at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cell phones have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>The infrastructure of the internet wasn&#39;t tiny back then.  Most Everyone from the middle class on up had the internet at home, and everyone who worked in an office or in government had access to the web.  </p>

<p>You are right that somethings were in their infancy. Internet security wasn&#39;t remotely the issue that it is now. If an expert now went back revisited what was under the hood even for most e-commerce (back when it was still called that) websites they&#39;d laugh. It would have been absurdly easy for a knowledgeable and careful person to leak information back then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another good one to remind people of is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a>.  That one cannot even be considered theory, it&#39;s conspiracy fact.  The CIA planned a false flag attack using hijacked aircraft to be blamed on Cuba/Communist Terrorists.  Our great president JFK shot that one down  and declassified it for the public.  I personally believe this played a significant role among the reasons why he himself was eventually shot down.  Just goes to show that the intention by our shadow government to use conspired false flag attacks on the unsuspecting American public was absolutely there, and clearly there was no concern by them of not being able to conceal it properly and get away with it.  If <em>we know</em> they were prepared to do this in the past, what makes anyone think for one second that the same doesn&#39;t still hold true?</p>

<p>I&#39;d be remiss in my duties if I didn&#39;t also mention Building 7.  That has to be the single biggest piece of evidence we have for government malfeasance on 9/11.  We <em>know</em> that bulding was brought down by controlled detonation.  <strong>We know it.</strong>  So, the question is, how did they get that building rigged with explosives while concealing this operation from the thousands of employees that worked inside?  Why were people allowed to go to work inside of a building that was fully prepared for demolition?  (<em>Can you say OSHA violation?</em>)  So we know they were able to lace the building with thermate with no one being the wiser, we know they allowed people to continue to work inside the building that could have potentially exploded at any moment, and we know they brought that building down in controlled demolition fashion at 5:45pm on 9/11.  Now, what makes anyone think for one second that they weren&#39;t able to do that to Buildings 1 &amp; 2?</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to be delusional to not draw a pretty frightening conclusion from those two facts alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would certainly seem more reasonable. So, by parallel, you could <em>plan</em> something like 9/11 in secret, but once the towers came down, everybody involved would presumably also &quot;pretty much figure out what they had been contributing to.&quot; But here we are, 12 years later, and no-one credible has claimed involvement in any aspect. That&#39;d be like America keeping its involvement in Hiroshima and Nagasaki secret through 1957. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look girlfriend, the original post that I responded to here was how the Manhattan Project was a great example of how really huge secrets can be kept.</p>

<p>I pointed out many reasons why that was not a fair comparison.</p>

<p>There was no &quot;compartmentalization&quot; in the OP&#39;s post and no mention of any specific conspiracy by me or OP.</p>

<p>So you tell me, how did &quot;compartmentalization&quot; keep the entire country from knowing that FDR was confined to a wheelchair if the world wasn&#39;t just a very different place in 1945 than it is today.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll repeat once again my original point. Comparing the secrecy of the Manhattan project to modern conspiracies (whether real OR imagined) is simply an invalid exercise. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have the skills to verify the data, you have to rely upon a structural engineer&#39;s assessment of that data, anyhow.  But if you are relying on the work of a structural engineers, you don&#39;t need to data because a structural engineer would be able to verify NIST&#39;s conclusions without NISTs data, as I&#39;ve explained like ten times now.</p>

<p>Also, I should note that its very odd to respond by quoting your own arbitrary rule against personalizing the issue in response to my answer to your own personalized inquiry.</p>

<p>How does one verify NIST&#39;s science without the science NIST used?</p>

<p>Edit: NIST&#39;s computer input data &#39;variables&#39; are hidden so NO ONE can replicate this experiment except for the good fraud &#39;dr&#39; shyam sunder and co.</p>
