    <div class="md"><p>How many times to conspiracy theorists have to be proven right in order for people to wake the fuck up and realize what is going on?</p>

<p>As more conspiracies become known, people just stick their heads deeper into the sand.  This is profoundly atypical human behavior.  Humans have been conditioned to act against their own self interest.  Humans used to be good at recognizing danger in their environment.  That quality has allowed us to evolve into becoming the animal at the top of the food chain.</p>

<p>What the fuck happened to us?  Conditioning, propaganda and brainwashing.  That&#39;s what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that some kind of cataclyms happened around 100,000 years ago that caused a deviation from that. Studying philosophy and Egyptian mysticism has led me to some interesting ideas about human nature being directed since the times of said cataclysm made us go into fight or flight mode, which is easy to take advatage of if you control any resources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is in our nature to desire to be part of the group, you have to believe what the group believes, see how the group sees, or you lose your self esteem and identity.</p>

<p>If this whole escapade has made me realize anything its that the ones trying to control us are right, humans are irrational and very few deserve to be free to make their own decisions, especially when their decisions effect everyone else. It is a hard thing to come to grasp with, but in some sense they are right for what they do, if humans were better none of this would be possible. Shitty way to look at it but its all i got. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the reason humans aren&#39;t &quot;better&quot; is because TPTB have fucked with the natural order of things to benefit them and it has created a system of false incentives that cause people to work against their own self interest.</p>

<p>Perhaps the people you think are right for trying to control us because we lack the ability to conduct our lives properly ourselves are the exact cause and reason things are so fucked up in the first place.</p>

<p>You should not revere sociopaths so much.  They are not better than us.  They are worse because they want to destroy and control human beings.</p>

So even if we are wrong about 99% of our shit, they still don&#39;t want us convincing other people to come around to our perspective. They&#39;d much rather discredit us with reptilian theories and set any potential allies against us. </p>
