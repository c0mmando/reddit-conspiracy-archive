       Conspiracy is the planning of malice. The theory that nineteen Arabs planned and carried out the 9/11 attacks is a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary activity of 9/11 "Truthers" is to skeptically examine the official story, and debunk parts of it which are not supported by the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what you are getting at would be better summed up in this question: what could convince you that the official narrative of 9/11 is credible?

       It is a grand illusion that it would take so much to commit such a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few people at key points in the process could have easily rigged explosives into the WTC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have worked in buildings in the NYC financial district and seeing a team of people doing construction or building planning is not uncommon and everybody observing would "stay in their lane" and not say a word about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even as far as the bomb rigging went, it could very easily be accomplished with one person, in a high enough management position with the team, to give a "dummy box" designed to look like something normally used in the construction but actually containing explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the only people who would need to know about that part of "the plan" would be a single construction manager and whoever bought or convinced said construction manager.
      </p>
      <p>
       To go even further, the construction manager may not even have known that they were planting explosives. They could have been told a cover story like they were planting devices used for recording to be used in conjunction with covert insider trading. "Very hush-hush. CIA wants us to plant them, for the good of the country. Don't tell anyone."
      </p>
      <p>
       The possibilities are endless.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you really only need one person with enough power to be able to make a command like that and have the underlings blindly follow their direction. Which describes nearly every job in existence. And the idea that the world is full of whistleblowers or people willing to lose their job over a random suspicion is laughable. The world is full of sheep who only have the desire to worry about their own problems and take direction from those in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you happened to be in the exact right place at the exact right time and noticed something funny going on, some switch that you knew made no sense or was not supposed to happen, what are the actual chances of that particular person also being bold enough to confront their boss, or their boss's boss?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then what? This person who had the perfect storm of luck leading them to be a direct witness to this suspicious activity, what are the chances that they would be so convinced as to say something AND have the knowledge to know that it was something bomb related or sinister on the level of actually blowing up the WTC?
      </p>
      <p>
       So this person is going to step way out of their lane and say "Listen Mr. Manager, I know enough about construction to know that we should not have switched those boxes with these suspicious new ones and I feel like this may be the start of some massive conspiracy to blow up the buildings we are working on, killing thousands of innocent people. Please explain."
      </p>
      <p>
       Not likely.

       Supposedly one of the floors right around the one that got hit was full of banks of batteries that were never being used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something like this is another possibility. A data center that rarely has employees is filled with things said to be batteries but aren't. No one would question if a battery is a battery, why would they? They'd just do the installation like any other.

       I don't think you have the slightest concept of how much effort it takes to do a controlled demolition of a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       The largest building ever demolished stood 26 stories tall (the JL Hudson department store in Detroit).  That's just over half of the height of WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       To wire up that one 26 story building took 12 men 24 full days.  They used 4118 charges in 1100 locations, nearly 3 thousand pounds of explosives and 36 THOUSAND feet of detonating cord.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, those 12 men were working in an empty building and had unfettered access to wherever they needed to go.  They knocked out entire sections of wall to get to the support columns.  They also didn't have to subject their wiring to a dozen floors burning out of control for 7 hours.  Generally speaking, charges and wire don't work so well once they have been burned to a crisp.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, take the cumulative effort in terms of manpower and supplies and roughly double it to wire up the 47 story WTC7.  Now set 25% of your work on fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying a world record sized demolition could have been pulled off surreptitiously by a single person veers into fantasyland.

       How did this incognito operation get to the thousands of blast points needed to bring the building down, what with the support columns being buried behind drywall, desks, cubicles and employees?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did they get thousands of pounds of explosive and tens of thousands of feet of detonating cable ran without being visible?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did the thousands of pounds of explosive and tens of thousands of feet of detonating wire survive being burned up by the dozen floors of uncontrolled office fire?  Wire tends to stop working when it's burnt to a crisp, and there was fire in 25% of the building.

       So this job pre-dates the Bush administration?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize the further you go down the rabbit hole with these explanations, the more ridiculous you sound, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       To bring down a building half the size of WTC7 took a dozen men 24 days of unfettered access to a completely vacant building, during which time they knocked out walls to get to support columns.  They used 4118 charges at 1100 separate points, nearly 3000 pounds of explosive and 36000 feet of detonating wire, and they had no giant infernos burning up all their carefully laid explosives as they worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       To suggest that one man could have pulled off a job of that size is completely and utterly ridiculous.

       I think you've presented a pretty strong argument. I'd love to hear the rebuttal to this. I know I've heard of some major construction projects going on in the WTC in the months/year leading up to 9/11 but I'd like to see the theory fleshed out more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to point out though that no one ever said it would be one person pulling it off. It was suggested that only one person would have to know the true nature of the job.

       OK, but that raises a whole new set of issues.  Are you going to trust the clandestine wiring up of thousands of pounds of explosives and tens of thousands of feet of ignition wire to a crew
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       familiar with building demolition?

       I think there are layers upon layers. If we still don't have definitive proof about JFK, I doubt we'll "know" about 9/11 for centuries. Any "big reveal" would be questionable, because of whom would stand to benefit. It's just safe to assume "evil" was at play and we all need to build the "good" to combat the fallout from 9/11. Fight fear with LOVE.

       The only way it couldn't be a conspiracy is if only 1 person pulled off the entire thing. With either side of this coin, there is a conspiracy. It's just a matter of which conspiracy you think has best made it's case.

       I agree with you to an extent. I personally lean more towards the orchestration of the event. Past that, I have to speculate heavily.

       I think it's healthy to look at your opinion purely from the opposition's point of view, so that we can make our own case as clear and logical as possible.

       What is this about agreement and opinion? There are no opinions on fact, right? Do we agree that 2+2 is 4 or is it simply so? The definition of conspiracy is accepted. I haven't asserted any point of view, unless you are assigning to me a POV based on the sub within which we are talking which seems to be the case since there has appeared 'opposition' in your post.

       Probably CIA, we already had a past with bin Laden. The fact alone that we trained him and along with other radicals to fight the russians is unsettling. Then, 20+ years later he's involved in a very conspicuous plot to destroy the WTC and pentagon, and we just didn't see it coming. We knew it'd happen, specifically the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a large conspiracy, including the federal government of the United states, most likely the CIA, the owner of the WTC, and the president and his cabinet. Nobody in congress or anywhere else needs to know the truth, just as long as they believe what they're told with the 9/11 commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a conspiracy for multiple reasons. A way to go back to the middle east and secure opium money laundering and oil obviously. Cover up the fact that trillions went missing from the Pentagon just before it happened. To instill a profound hatred for "terrorism", "islam", "middle east", and "al-qaeda" in the American people, to pretty much safeguard against nationwide protest against wars that would otherwise make no sense, and to guarantee the success of future endeavors in the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is corrupt, completely, and it needs the people on its side. It'd do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my opinion.

       There are some explanations for a bunch of those though.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2 planes knock 3 buildings
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       More like two planes knock over 2 buildings, which causes severe damage to a third that combined with a raging uncontrolled fire brings it down (not to mention why take down WTC 7? What value did it have?).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        no planes in pentagon, no video showing a plane ever released
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We found debris from the plane, and they did release the security camera footage, which is all there is about that can be released (save perhaps the black box, which they likely took for investigation)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but a paper passport survive
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And many, many other things that were ejected from the plane during the explosion (people were finding stuff all over midtown manhattan).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        first time fire melt steal?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That seems to be kind of a hasty conclusion, since not only has fire
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Meridian_Plaza#After_the_fire">
        caused significant structural damage to buildings
       </a>
       , and was able to deform steel. Combined with sever structural damage from debris, it would be understandable that it would collapse.

       You're free to argue these, and i'm all or it, as debates can be great for both sides. However calling me a shill is more of a personal attack than anything (not to mention that you are saying anyone who disagrees with you is a shill).

       You actually defend the idea that there were WMD's in Iraq.

       And everything you just wrote about 9/11 is utter nonsense that tries to cleverly side-step how many absurd and illogical things occurred on that day.

       My opinion on the matter is that Iraq
       <em>
        did have
       </em>
       a chemical and biological program (which well known and proven) that was disbanded before the Iraq war (in fact Saddam used it on his own people). I wouldn't be surprised if remnants of it still remained. Not to mention that that is also not the main reason for the war (it's the invasion of Kuwait, and also arguable the oil).

       Would you mind countering these arguments then? Instead of attacking me by calling me a shill? I'm willing to debate these and hear your arguments (since as i've said before it's great for both sides to hear each others arguments), as long as neither of us resort to ad homenims or name calling.

       Well your exact comment was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We did find shit tons of chemical weapons stockpiles, and biological weapons research. Both of those are WMD's.

      <p>
       And that conclusion is completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as 9/11 goes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Your counter to this: that WTC7 was damaged, completely ignores the fact that it fell at freefall speeds into its own footprint. Like two other towers did on that same day.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        no planes in pentagon, no video showing a plane ever released
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You say we found debris from the plane, show a source if you are going to make such a claim. Because as far as I know, we didn't find the same kind of wreckage that should have occurred when a plane hits a building. The entire crash scene was extremely questionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you say that "they did release the security camera footage" of a plane hitting the pentagon. In 2001, in Washington DC, there were hundreds of cameras pointed at that building or in the area where a plane should have been captured entering that airspace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe when you say "security camera footage" you are referring to that single cell with a strange blur on it. If that is enough to appease you, then no wonder you come to the conclusions you come to.

      <blockquote>

       And once again you deflect this strange coincidence by saying "many other things that were ejected". You seem to be doing a lot of sidestepping.

      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as the buildings go. Despite your misinformation, WTC 1 and 2 were the first buildings in history to be "destroyed by fire" and fall they way they did. At this point, why should I even argue about that when people like you are going to rely on the faulty science of the 9/11 commission report.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_9/11_Commission">
        Here is what you should know about that report.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know, each of your claims appears (on the surface) to make sense. But once you combine them all, plus the numerous others, you need to start questioning things instead of falling back on the official BS you were spoon-fed to keep your brain turned off.

      <p>
       There's two problems with this. Firstly, how else was it supposed to fall? The footprint is oft used as an argument, but no other answer is ever given (not to mention
       <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/wtc7pile.jpg">
        it wasn't directly in the footprint
       </a>
       ). Secondly,
       <em>
        it didn't fall at free fall speeds
       </em>
       . To quote NIST:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Whether or not you agree with the rest of the report, that is something you verify yourself from watching the videos of the WTC 7 collapse.

       Yes there were many security cameras in the pentagon. However they are CCTV cameras, not ultra-hi-def slow motion capture cameras that can see the plane as anything but a frame long blur (all the other cameras would show you is a slightly different angle of the same thing).

       No, I'm saying the debris was all over midtown Manhattan. They found everything from passports to luggage to personal belongings (see

       Am I saying the report is perfect? No. I am saying it provides a legitimate, and probable explanation for the collapse of the towers. Again, my opinion is that it's far more likely the planes caused the damage, then to place massive quantities of explosives in the building inconspicuously (and WTC 7 apparently, even though I have no idea why it was targeted).

       My point is that although there were many CCTV cameras, none of them are powerful enough to see the plane as anything but a frame long blur (since you seem to think the gas station CCTV cameras would somehow see it in better quality or slower speed). It's not moving the goalposts at all. If anything it you moving it (CCTV not enough for you since it's not good enough quality)

       You're the one saying it wouldn't be good enough quality. As long as the shot is sufficiently far out that wouldn't necessarily be the case. Combined with the likely hundreds of videos that exist I'm sure we could make heads and tails of what's being seen.
I do not believe that there isn't a video of the pentagon being hit. I also don't know why they would keep all of the other videos secret. If they don't show anything like you suggested then why not just release them along with any other info that has been released?

       The problem is that you assume a) There would be a camera at the exact angle and distance to capture the plane, and not be blocked by anything (buildings, trees, etc...) and b) that it captured the plane flying at 530 mph in anything more then a frame or two at max. You seem to be moving the goalposts with your argument.

       We found debris from the plane as I said and showed in my previous comment. there was also two different security cameras that had their footage released to the public. My point is what else is there to release? More CCTV footage from different angles of the same quality? The only thing that they can release that would be new would be the black box that the FBI likely confiscated for investigation.

       you think hit the Pentagon if not a plane? Also, I fail to see how any of the other CCTV cameras will magically have amazing quality and capture fast moving objects, since almost all CCTV cameras are mean more for surveillance in case someone breaks in/trespasses/tries to rob you (as with places like gas stations) then for capturing fast moving objects.

       You actually defend the idea that there were WMD's in Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       And everything you just wrote about 9/11 is utter nonsense that tries to cleverly side-step how many absurd and illogical things occurred on that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are either a shill, very young, or a really, really naive person who has not bothered to use your brain in many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       believe that WMD's were in Iraq?

       Well your exact comment was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We did find shit tons of chemical weapons stockpiles, and biological weapons research. Both of those are WMD's.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And that conclusion is completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as 9/11 goes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2 planes knock 3 buildings
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Your counter to this: that WTC7 was damaged, completely ignores the fact that it fell at freefall speeds into its own footprint. Like two other towers did on that same day.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        no planes in pentagon, no video showing a plane ever released
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You say we found debris from the plane, show a source if you are going to make such a claim. Because as far as I know, we didn't find the same kind of wreckage that should have occurred when a plane hits a building. The entire crash scene was extremely questionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you say that "they did release the security camera footage" of a plane hitting the pentagon. In 2001, in Washington DC, there were hundreds of cameras pointed at that building or in the area where a plane should have been captured entering that airspace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe when you say "security camera footage" you are referring to that single cell with a strange blur on it. If that is enough to appease you, then no wonder you come to the conclusions you come to.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but a paper passport survive
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And once again you deflect this strange coincidence by saying "many other things that were ejected". You seem to be doing a lot of sidestepping. Instead of acting like we are all idiots for focusing on the fact that a paper passport fell from the sky and landed right into the FBI's hands, you should be asking yourself why you think that is such a normal thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as the buildings go. Despite your misinformation, WTC 1 and 2 were the first buildings in history to be "destroyed by fire" and fall they way they did. At this point, why should I even argue about that when people like you are going to rely on the faulty science of the 9/11 commission report.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_9/11_Commission">
        Here is what you should know about that report.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know, each of your claims appears (on the surface) to make sense. But once you combine them all, plus the numerous others, you need to start questioning things instead of falling back on the official BS you were spoon-fed to keep your brain turned off.

        To suggest that one man could have pulled off a job of that size is completely and utterly ridiculous.

      <p>
       I think you've presented a pretty strong argument. I'd love to hear the rebuttal to this. I know I've heard of some major construction projects going on in the WTC in the months/year leading up to 9/11 but I'd like to see the theory fleshed out more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to point out though that no one ever said it would be one person pulling it off. It was suggested that only one person would have to know the true nature of the job.

      <p>
       Maybe it's just your grammar but I have no idea what this means. Please explain this comment. Why is that all that can be released? Do you know how many security cameras are on the pentagon? What about the gas station security cameras?
