        The Earth curves faster than most people think. On a small lake — say, 2.5 miles across — there’s a 1-foot-tall bulge in the middle of the lake due to the curvature of the Earth. On some larger bodies of water, if conditions are right, you can actually perceive the curvature of the Earth when this sort of bulge blocks your view of the opposing shore.

       Here's a great thing you can do, all by yourself and you do not require anything except your own eyes. At dusk lie down on your back so you can enjoy the sunset. As soon as the sun goes below the horizon(meaning out of view), quickly stand up. You'll be amazed that you can now see the sun!

       Edit: then congratulate yourself, because you've entered into the scientific understanding of around 200 C.E.

       argument, there is none, just laziness on your part, go do it yourself there's a huge CONCAVE world out there if you can "SEE" and i don't mean with your eyes, that comes later, you are easily "programmed" by the system like the rest

       How do you account for the mountains of evidence that point to a spherical earth? How do you explain orbital dynamics? How do you explain that planes are not continuously "flying up" to avoid crashing into the concave planet? Where does the sun go when it sets? How do you explain the thousands of photographs, from space, of all sides of the planet, video of it rotating, and evidence if the curvature?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not how a scientific theory works, you cannot just omit evidence that doesn't fit with your narrative.

       I don't see a reflection of the whole shore...I see a reflection of the top part including the bushes on top. I think this guy is misinterpreting his Photo's whether or not his measurements are balls on accurate. I think it's pretty clear lakes are convex as I frequent Lake Tahoe often and and it's pretty obvious there.

       Lol. I think you don't understand what you've read and also claim that the calculations are wrong. Prove it. You wouldn't see the reflection on 5,65 km on the water because the convexity should block it. But it doesn't.

       How tall is the far shore and at that range what would it look like IF you could see it all. Are you claiming you can see the entire far shore? If not Why if this lake is concave? I never said his calculations were wrong, I just said even if they were dead on balls accurate. Do you have the reading comprehension problem?

       Basically, there was a "test" performed a while back that the results have not been proven conclusive, and op claims that we have to prove that test wrong. That isn't how it works. Yet, op ignores the mountains of evidence that point to a spherical earth. That's not a scientific theory.

       So we have to do the leg work and should we have a dissenting opinion then we are, as the op said "blind"?

      <p>
       How is the op any different than religious fundamentalists who say they are right and everyone else is wrong and it is everyone elses' responsibility to follow along and those that don't buy what they're selling are haters?

       Exactly. It's shifting the burden of proof, cherry picking evidence, and then calling my blind is an ad hom. Zero substance to their argument.

       lol, you guys are ALL convinced at what you are taught is true without confirmation, so simple to see CONCAVITY but you rather avoid this SIMPLE test like a plague, figures, look at your comments, like i said to op, don't bother posting here you guys are clueless and LAZY and rather ridicule than actually try this simple test, Idiocracy is here decades ahead of time, you guys are proof of how dumbed down society has become, got BRAWNDO lol

       And there's the shifting of the burden of proof. If it's so easy to for a Not Sure guy like yourself, then you can easily do it and prove to us Brawndites, the error of our ways. Then get ready to accept a Nobel prize for proving the world is not spherical using only basic math.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cherry picking evidence part means that op ignores the mountains of evidence that do not support this theory. The evidence that points to a spherical earth. That's not how a scientific theory works, you must look at all the evidence fussy, not pick and choose which ones you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit and oh yea, there's the ad hom., referring to us as the people from Idiocracy; your argument is very strong.

       it's a do it yourself test, instead of babbling like an educated tool would, go and prove this to yourself, like i said your avoiding this simple task like the plague and rather ridicule what your oblivious about, laziness sure is dominant here, you'd rather argue than prove it to yourself, typical mindset it's a disease of ignorance, stay in school bud you deserve all of the lies YOU believe
Theory what theory the visual proof is beyond any theory, stop your nonsense, your playing dumb, very dumb, your lingo is that of a shill, go look for yourself, look at your comment, this is evidence enough , get over your educated ego son, your acting like a system tool and looking like a fool, simple stuff and it's not registering in your head

       Wow, just wow. Well this is not as simple as you claim it is. I don't have access to a lake that wide, I don't have a camera lens that powerful, I don't have over 4,000 ft of piano wire to hang a plumb in a mine shaft, or rather 2 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your aggression to the accusation that YOU need to fulfill the burden of proof says it all. Now you resort to name calling, if your argument wasn't demolished already, it is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, explain how orbital mechanics work, explain why airplanes do not need to continuously "fly up" to avoid crashing into the concave surface, explain the millions of photographs and videos of and spherical earth rotating from space. Explain this evidence which you ignore. You can't just pick and choose what evidence you like that fits your narrative, that's not how a scientific theory works.
      </p>
      <p>
       These links barely have anything scientific to them at all. I can barely find anything from the test of the plumb in the mine shaft, other than claims. What were the procedures of the test, what were the results? Other than "they were father apart at the bottom than the top". Need numbers to be able to repeat the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, while you are trying to figure out how orbital mechanics work, take some time to learn some grammar. EOT
