       Why can't we talk about those who.must not be named, it is a legitimate conspiracy, and is even more legitimate to this sub because it's obvious how we get gamed by not only that word that's so fucking bad I can't even mention it, but by users from a subreddit devoted to actively trolling us

       Because that doesn't limit discourse at all.. anyways, there's a subreddit devoted to.talking shit about this subrrddit, and planning/organizing trolling raids. Why can't we call them out, doesn't seem fair I can't defend myself on my favorite subreddit when some one is harassing me just because I post here. And why not just limit everything that's discussed here. Let's not talk about fluoride because it's good for your teeth. Let's not talk about the illuminati because they're not real. Let's not talk about trolls and shills because those don't exist, and if they did we wouldn't want to hurt their feelings with a "personal attack"

       You just pointed out that they broke a rule. That is against the rules. You are supposed to submit a report. (I know me calling you out is hypocritical.)

       They say it's to keep the comments to the discussion of the article not the comments themselves. I get that but I simply disagree. I've been told I can leave if I don't like it. :/

       You were misrepresenting what the rule actually says. And you still are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main purpose of Rule 10 is to prevent all of the back-and-forth name calling that goes on. They call you a liar. You call them a troll. They call you an idiot. You call them a shill. They call you... you call them... and on and on and on. None of that ever has anything to do with the topics at hand and only serves to disrupt and derail discussions. If that's the kind of "discussions" you like then have them somewhere else. They are not allowed here.

       So let me get this straight, if conspiratard links a discussion from this sub to theirs, and I am being harassed on that particular discussion, if I call someone out on being a conspiratard, do I get repercussions?

      <p>
       Does the rule say anything about "conspiratard"? No it doesn't. Is calling someone "conspiratard" an attack? If a person has elected to be a part of the r/conspiratard force then it's pretty obvious that they have chosen that name for themselves.

      <p>
       Are we done now? Can we get back to the topic at hand instead of nitpicking the rules?

       Name calling in the first place, is not a very good argument on anyone's part. Why do you feel the need to call someone this? It's better to stick to the topic at hand.

       It's name calling. Even if it isn't, as you say, what exactly does it add to the discussion? It's a derogatory term meant to then discredit anything the person says. So what if they are a troll or shill? Use your logic and debate skills to show them up. Name calling is bottom of the totem pole.

       I'm getting really tired of having to go through this in every single thread where users are trying to disrupt discussions by complaining about the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the rule: Posts that attack the sub, users or mods will be removed. Accusing another of being a troll or shill is considered an attack. Repeat offenders are subject to a ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very clear. Follow the rules and there's no problem. If you have concerns about the rules then message the mods or create a new post instead of derailing discussions.

       Look, you are clearly in the right on this issue. You, being a mod, would know about the Rule structure more than a 10 day old account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've finally been seeing this sub get organized since we saw the new mods a few months ago. Now with this new information coming out they are going to be getting a lot more defensive and aggressive. The mods need to have a serious discussion on this issue and need to revisit Rule: 10.

       We discuss the rules regularly and, at the moment, the consensus is that the net result of the recent revisions is in the positive. Once the complaints die down it'll be even better. The same thing has happened with every change that's been made in the past.

       I was referring to a consensus amongst the mods. As a group, we see everything... all of the reported comments, all of the name calling, all of the personal attacks. And those are decreasing. Discussions are staying more on topic. That's the "positive" side. So far the only "negative" is the oft-repeated complaints about the rules from a select few individuals.
