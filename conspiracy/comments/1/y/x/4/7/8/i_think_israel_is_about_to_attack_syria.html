        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This may sound far-fetched and I won&#39;t go into too much detail but the context clues are there. First the Egyptian president stepped down, followed by Israel attacking a shipment of weapons in the Qalamoun region of Syria where Hezbollah was stationed and then placed troops that specialize in rapid invasion on the Syrian border. Al Assad&#39;s forces are depleted, Hezbollah has their hands tied and Egypt is without direction. There is currently no one standing in Israel&#39;s way. To top things off, Russia is distracted with the Ukraine. It is the perfect time for them to strike. America has failed in toppling the Assad government and Israel is desperate. </p>

<p>Yet again, I know this is insane to think but I am almost certain that Israel is about to strike Syria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is already attacking Syria - via proxy and manipulation - their preferred method.</p>

<p>Israel does NOT want to risk the lives of <em>their</em> people, that is why they trick the US (and others) to do their bleeding for them. </p>

<p>While I could see Israel launching missiles, air strikes and other &quot;safe&quot; methods, it would seem highly unlikely that they would put Israeli boots on the ground in harm&#39;s way.</p>

<p>What <em>does</em> seem plausible (to me) is that they may be &quot;predicting&quot; (<em>wink wink</em>) major chaos to cut loose within Syria, and that they are readying themselves to launch a major land-snatch from the Golan Heights...</p>

<p>You know - for &quot;security&quot; purposes.</p>

<p>Overall, indcations are that they plan to continue to arm and support the &quot;rebels&quot; (terrorists) that are attacking Assad - the goal being to let them fight one another into exhaustion - after which a friendly puppet can be installed in its place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t insane to think. </p>

<p>If you really think about it, the founders of Israel(Rothschild&#39;s and others) had their tentacles wrapped around u.s. politics for quite a while. Israel is more a symbol for the power that is the NWO. They get away with attacking anyone and everyone they want. The whole destabilization of the middle east was to foment an easier take over of their supposed original sacred land. Obviously other things like Oil and natural resources came into play. </p>

<p>The real question is after a world war 3 would Israel and its new found parts still be called Israel? or would it be called something new? </p>

<p>Makes you wonder when you have someone like Henry Kissinger who doesn&#39;t think Israel will be there in 10 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I think Israel plans to annihilate the SAA to the point that they are useless, so that the ill equipped &quot;rebels&quot; can take over. Likely, this will cause a civil war, as seen in Iraq and Libya. This will mean that the SAA is no longer a threat, Iran can no longer get arms to Hezbollah and Israel can do as they please. Israel is trying to avoid another ass beating from Hezbollah like what was seen in 2006.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm">A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the &quot;Clean Break&quot; report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by Richard Perle for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel&#39;s security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on &quot;Western values&quot;. <strong>It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;.</strong></a></p>

<p>People seem to think that Al Qaeda will take over and threaten Israel which is not the case. The US, think tanks and foundations have already infiltrated the Syrian National Council with shills to make sure the new Syrian leadership plays ball.</p>
