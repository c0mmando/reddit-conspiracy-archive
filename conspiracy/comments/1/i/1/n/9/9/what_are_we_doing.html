<p>Well, the thing is that aside from planning for emergency as best as one could estimate and not letting stories die, trying to educate others and riding our representitives asses to pursue issues there is not much TO DO at the moment.</p>

<p>We keep talking. That is what we do. And that is something, and considering how vital and scary information can be for the powers that be that is a LOT.</p>

<p>When the day comes to go out and act we will all know it or have it shoved in our faces. On that day everyone of us will.</p>

<p>The real issue is the incrementalism of it all. There is no way to justify force without having real. in-your-face force brought to each person. And the &quot;city here&quot;, &quot;city there&quot; shit keeps us seperated.</p>

<p>The ONLY thing that keeps us together is communications. They know it too. </p>

<p>My advice is to make the most of this chance to record events, and inform the entire planet by hitting enter while you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I beg to differ. Certain federal judges and congresspersons and other nations are beyond pissed and are taking action at the urging of people like the ones here. Have you SEEN how many people just here on reddit have been going &quot;Oh SHIT! I had no idea how right some of you were.&quot;</p>

<p>This will matter. It will matter a lot. Personally I think the is still a chance (slim perhaps) that this will all implode under its own weight soon. Then the states can pick up the pieces.</p>

<p>Should it ever BECOME what we fear, that is, a final push of force, we will have the justification we need to defend with force. If they don&#39;t come with force we can still work on what we CAN do, which is force truth in court and keep working at getting those who need to be arrested, arrested. Iceland showed us how to do some of it with out coming to blows. We already know what to do/what will happen if it is ever taken to the streets.</p>

<p>But until it actually IS, talking is GREAT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like what you&#39;ve said.  The internet has made it possible to expose corruption in a matter of minutes to literally every person on earth that bothers to read it.  The age of religiously absorbing every word announced by biased news casters on prime time television has been replaced by the age of every single person having a voice that can be heard just as loudly as any others (pretty sure democracy is supposed to work something like this).  </p>

<p>It&#39;s true, the age of accountability is here.  People exposed can no longer hide behind commercial breaks, or surrounding themselves with others whom they influence to back up their claims.  What we have done, is create the perfect tool for holding those exposed to criminal and unethical practice accountable for what they&#39;ve done.  This means more to overall progression of society than any public figure, party, even network has been able to achieve.  We owe it not only to ourselves, but to our future children, and their children, to uphold accountability as a major changing outcome from the creation of the internet.  Of course, we could always just tab back over to babyanimals.com, it&#39;s so much easier.</p>

<p>In the future, the internet today will be regarded as either the worst, or greatest invention known to mankind.  It&#39;s up to US to decide that outcome.</p>
