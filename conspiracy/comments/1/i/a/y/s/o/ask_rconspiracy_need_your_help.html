       As someone who believes that 9/11, newtown, the boston bombing were inside jobs performed by the government in order to take away our civil liberties, I have one simple question. What am I to do? Should I leave the country in order to escape it all? I believe that the new world order is planning to "silence" people like me who would oppose them, and it makes me feel helpless. If anyone can give me some advice on what to do or where to go, I would greatly appreciate it.

       I have thought this before. But why run out on your country when it needs you most? It will come to a tipping point that is decide by the ratio of submissive to resistive. When that tipping point comes the home of the free and land of the brave will put things back in order.

       They haven't really gave the bear a good poke yet. When the poke is financial you'll see this bear roar like hell.

       The bear better wake the hell up and
       <em>
        fast
       </em>
       then, because right now it's allowed itself to be lulled to sleep, and there might be a chance that if it
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       wake up soon, it will be fully ensnared and locked up in a cage so by the time it does wake up, it'll be too late, and all the snarling and growling in the wold won't help it break out of the cage that's being built around it...so it seems it's going to, again, have to wake up SOON and act SOON.  Times running out, it seems.

       You can't escape it. The regime is moving on the whole world. It's not just the American government, although they lead the charge. You should spend as much time and energy as you can spare educating yourself on exactly what crimes they are perpetrating. R/conspiracy is a good source, as is r/worldnews and r/politics. But I encourage seeking news from as many sources as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       After you have some idea of what's going on, I suggest rebeling in the form of infrastructure attack. We can't oppose them with overt force. It has to be guerilla tactics. Knock out their base. They are always ont he verge of insolvency now anyway. It won't take much. Just make sure you don't hurt anyone or the public opinion will sway against us and the rebellion will fail.

       They want you to feel helpless because their Achilles heel is you being informed about their crimes and sharing it with others.  The only way they maintain their power is through this fraud.  It's also why they try and intimidate you into not speaking out.

       It's like this, bro:  If you knew that there was a school bully that wanted to punch you and take your lunch money
       <em>
        regardless
       </em>
       of whether you tried to hide from him or not...and if you knew you
       <em>
        couldn't
       </em>
       hide from him forever cuz he would indeed find you eventually, then why on Earth would you want to run and hide from him?  If you KNOW he's going to find you eventually, you might as well stay and fucking FIGHT and simply get ready for him.  It's a bully you're dealing with here, so the more scared you are, the more power over you that bully's going to have.  However, on many occasions, when you pull your boot straps up, take a deep breath, swallow hard, stand your ground, and motherfucking
       <em>
        swing back
       </em>
       , then a lot of the time that bully will either back down, or even if you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       get your ass kicked, he'll now know that he's not just dealing with a yellow bellied eunuch.  If you fight
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       , there's a good chance you'll show more power than you think you have and back that fucker up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay put and fight.  You have no choice anyway really, as what's happening to the United States is
       <em>
        global
       </em>
       .  It ain't national.  This shit is controlled on a
       <em>
        planet
       </em>
       scale, so regardless of where you go, TPTB will have eyes on enslaving populations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay put and get ready to fight - one way or the other.

       From the small amount of research I've done, switzerland sounds pretty corrupt. And not only am i trying to escape the government, but also the greed exhibited by the entire population. America is just to consumerist for me. We have such a high standard of living, but at the expense of the cheap labor outsourced to developing countries. I fear switzerland may be the same. However, it can't possibly be worse than here. Good luck moving, I hope you live a happy life there.

       If the new world order really does take control there are countries I would rather be in than the one that founded it. Im sure there is somewhere to go and get off the grid. Also, trying to enjoy my time while i can is what I'm doing, but I always end up thinking about the way things are and the inevitable. I think I cant be happy here.

       the government's job is to defend your liberties.  you come in posting that kind of shit... it's just tired.  now, does the gov manipulate things and sometimes hold it's own feet a little to close to the fire and get burned?  yes.  but it's a far different concept than pro-actively trying to cause chaos/death/destruction.

       Face it, our system of people's government has been fully infiltrated and subverted by those wishing to destroy it. That doesn't mean the system is at fault. A couple hundred years is a great run compared to other systems of government. The apple is rotten to the core, time for a fresh apple.

       I totally agree, I would much rather stay and change things then move and let the problem continue. We need a major overhaul.

       Then why have my civil liberties been repeatedly taken from me ever since 9/11. Do you know what the patriot act is? Do you know what PRISM is? As someone who found my post on

       I figured you would know about how the government is failing their "job". I came in posting a question and if you think I am so dumb then don't say anything and move on to another post. If you can't look at the evidence and see that at least 9/11 was an inside job, then of course you are going to disagree with me. And 9/11 was indeed chaos/death/destruction.

       you are far to rash in your thinking.  you say they are behind 9/11 but who?  was it Bush?  was it Cheney?  Hardly, it was spies working hard using our very freedoms to set up such an attack.  How many spies there are, we will never know but they are out there and are beholden only to their own motives.  They aren't part of some demonic scheme to enslave humanity.  The Newtown and Boston Bombing is more of the same.  Possibly, agent provacateurs were at play, but agents for whom.  We blame our own government 99% of the time but you forget that we have real adversaries in the form of Nation States out there.  The fact you are willing to believe your own government is working against you when it's really a misguided monolithic bureaucracy shows that some enemy propaganda has retuned your way of thinking.

       I've done my research and I know what I know. If you are naive enough to think that the government is working for you than you will disagree with me left and right. Perhaps it isn't me who has let propaganda tune my thinking.
