What am I to do? Should I leave the country in order to escape it all? I believe that the new world order is planning to &quot;silence&quot; people like me who would oppose them, and it makes me feel helpless.

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t escape it. The regime is moving on the whole world. It&#39;s not just the American government, although they lead the charge. You should spend as much time and energy as you can spare educating yourself on exactly what crimes they are perpetrating. R/conspiracy is a good source, as is r/worldnews and r/politics. But I encourage seeking news from as many sources as you can. </p>

<p>After you have some idea of what&#39;s going on, I suggest rebeling in the form of infrastructure attack. We can&#39;t oppose them with overt force. It has to be guerilla tactics. Knock out their base. They are always ont he verge of insolvency now anyway. It won&#39;t take much. Just make sure you don&#39;t hurt anyone or the public opinion will sway against us and the rebellion will fail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like this, bro:  If you knew that there was a school bully that wanted to punch you and take your lunch money <em>regardless</em> of whether you tried to hide from him or not...and if you knew you <em>couldn&#39;t</em> hide from him forever cuz he would indeed find you eventually, then why on Earth would you want to run and hide from him?  If you KNOW he&#39;s going to find you eventually, you might as well stay and fucking FIGHT and simply get ready for him.  It&#39;s a bully you&#39;re dealing with here, so the more scared you are, the more power over you that bully&#39;s going to have.  However, on many occasions, when you pull your boot straps up, take a deep breath, swallow hard, stand your ground, and motherfucking <em>swing back</em>, then a lot of the time that bully will either back down, or even if you <em>do</em> get your ass kicked, he&#39;ll now know that he&#39;s not just dealing with a yellow bellied eunuch.  If you fight <em>hard</em>, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll show more power than you think you have and back that fucker up.</p>

<p>Stay put and fight.  You have no choice anyway really, as what&#39;s happening to the United States is <em>global</em>.  It ain&#39;t national.  This shit is controlled on a <em>planet</em> scale, so regardless of where you go, TPTB will have eyes on enslaving populations.</p>

<p>Stay put and get ready to fight - one way or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the small amount of research I&#39;ve done, switzerland sounds pretty corrupt. And not only am i trying to escape the government, but also the greed exhibited by the entire population. America is just to consumerist for me. We have such a high standard of living, but at the expense of the cheap labor outsourced to developing countries. I fear switzerland may be the same. However, it can&#39;t possibly be worse than here. Good luck moving, I hope you live a happy life there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are far to rash in your thinking.  you say they are behind 9/11 but who?  was it Bush?  was it Cheney?  Hardly, it was spies working hard using our very freedoms to set up such an attack.  How many spies there are, we will never know but they are out there and are beholden only to their own motives.  They aren&#39;t part of some demonic scheme to enslave humanity.  The Newtown and Boston Bombing is more of the same.  Possibly, agent provacateurs were at play, but agents for whom.  We blame our own government 99% of the time but you forget that we have real adversaries in the form of Nation States out there.  The fact you are willing to believe your own government is working against you when it&#39;s really a misguided monolithic bureaucracy shows that some enemy propaganda has retuned your way of thinking.  </p>
