They are more willing to give up their liberty, bit by bit, in exchange for a false security the government offers them from the false threats it manufactured in the first place.</p>

<p>Plus, the World Trace Centre was riddled with asbestos and would have needed demolishing in any case at some point - and dealing with that asbestos would have cost tens of millions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>^ this</p>

<p>To OP:</p>

<p>To see the motive you have to see what happened AFTER the fact, who benefited,  why they benefited and when did they start positioning themselves to benefit.</p>

<p>Oil was indeed a concern, but not the main one. We have control over their oil but gas is expensive. why? because that oil isnt coming to us directly, its being goose-necked and controlled by oil companies. However, a main thing to look at is the implementation of the Patriot act which began the much quicker erosion of our rights. Extending of government power and control. &quot;never let a good crysis go to waste&quot;.</p>

<p>in reality thats what it comes down to: power and control.</p>

<p>PS. there are many other things that happened because of and after 9/11, alot of people benefited, everyone except the common man. redditers can find a slew of reasons, but figure out the ones you think are most important for yourself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>our language when having these discussions is half the problem. this question presupposes much. it could have been an inside job without nay incentive for the us government. The incentive was the insurance policy on the building the insider trading and short selling. the decades long war and the no bid contracts that went with it benefited many. there is enough incentive to go around. frame the question correctly use your five senses and reason ask qui bono and connect it yourself. i personally do not have an understanding of who did it or how but there are enough questions to demand further inquiry. It is o.k. to say we don&#39;t know and seek better information. the government on the whole itself would not benefit but perhaps some folks in building seven investigating enron or other securities fraud for the SEC might have some incentive for ending those investigations prematurely. It is possible the WTC was more valuable as an insurance claim than a real estate liability. It is possible those who desired to invade the middle east to protect the petro dollar and opec may have had an incentive. who are you talking about when you say the government? think for yourself please. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are the puppet masters the corporate entities that funded Bush&#39;s campaign? If so, how was he so beholden to them that he would kill 3,000 people in 9/11? And I get that Neocon&#39;s are super pro-Israel, but to the extent that they would bankrupt the country over it; why would Israel control the US government?
Lastly, Cheney is only worth 90$ million today. When you say he has ties to Halliburton, the relatively small amount of money he made off the war doesn&#39;t seem like it would justify the killing of 20,000 people (9/11+ soldiers and civilians in Iraq.)
You&#39;ve pointed out a lot of fishy and interesting things about the last ten years, but I still feel its a bit unsupported to claim 9/11 was staged (at least a billion$ plus operation) so the vice president could make a few million bucks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll respect your questions and give you my perspective. About 1% of the population have the mental disorder of sociopathy.  (anti-social personality disorder). Such people are self-centered, have no conscience or guilt, and commonly act to harm others. Many rise to head companies or go into government high positions, because their ability to lie and harm facilitates this. For such people, anything that grabs power for them is justifiable. For such people operating on global levels, anything goes if it gains them power and keeps them in power. Much of what&#39;s been done to the US has been done by such people for their benefit, regardless of the consequences to all the rest of us. Sociopaths will willingly destroy a company or even a nation if this gets them what they want.</p>

<p>By the way, 1% on Reddit too are sociopathic. Some visible examples are &#39;Griefers&#39;, destructive people here who laughingly do damage in subs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks guys for the answers but no one has answered the fundamental question: When George Bush left office he was the least popular president in history; partly because of the bailouts, but mainly because of the Iraq war and the patriot act. I understand that corporations have a huge influence in politics, but what leverage would they have to make the Bush administration go to war? Why would Bush ruin his presidency, perpetrate 9/11 and go to war because a corporation is somehow controlling him? How could they have that much leverage over the presidency?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve grown increasingly wary, cynical of these so-called &#39;elected&#39;. This War Machine has been afoot since before my time. Long ago there were three news channels, newspapers and a few radio stations. </p>

<p>My father, RIP, got the SHTF gut punch in the 60&#39;s. He was looking at his family and his two eldest sons being 1A Prime fodder. His Legacy, tho flawed, was well intentioned and he did his best to stand firm in his convictions. </p>

<p>He looked at the government contract drawings and weighed the toll on families like his own. He said no. Others said HELL YES! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The corporate profits resulting from the war were tangential to the real purpose. The war itself was tangential. The real purpose was the passage of unconstitutional legislation like the AUMF, the PATRIOT Act, the amendments to the 2011 NDAA, and Executive Order 13603, among many others. Without the shock and fear of a large-scale attack on home soil, the American people would likely have rejected legislation of that ilk wholesale. </p>

<p>There were actually quite a few things accomplished by the 9/11 attack, but the militarization of American law was foremost. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious, are you skeptical about whether or not 9/11 was an inside job? Because if you are, I can direct you to the proper evidence that will change your mind, and I hope you&#39;ll give me the chance, although we can certainly agree to disagree. You may think you&#39;ve heard every argument, but many people who&#39;ve thought the same were of a different opinion once I was finished. Just a few paragraphs is all it takes. </p>
