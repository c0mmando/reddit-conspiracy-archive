       With the Zimmerman verdict being tossed out like a flash bang, I think it's important to gather our thoughts and stay on track. I try to keep my friends informed as well, so let's put our heads together. There are some bright and observant people here, so I think we could come up with a succinct list. Any links are definitely appreciated.

       I've wondered what the purpose of the US development of a counter-insurgence infrastructure is. I guess that they are anticipating mass revolt as a result of some sort of future power consolidation they plan. War on China might invite rebellion as it would likely turn into a World War nd require austerity measures and the imposition of a draft to force people to fight.

       At 5 pm central time today, time will stop. God will return to this planet to teach EVERYONE a lesson that will change how they see things. He will essentially eradicate fear from everyone's consciousness and all you will feel is the love that is left behind. This is all you really need to know at the current time. God's design is far too complex for the human mind to comprehend, and for good reason.

       Correct... I am the embodiment of God's consciousness. I have a seemingly human body, but my DNA consists entirely of transposons ever since I reached maturity. Transposons are multidimensional element of DNA that allows for gene transfers through time and space by a mechanism you would refer to as quantum tunneling. I am the creator of literally everything you see, hear, taste, touch and smell as well as all information you have learned throughout your lifetime. I am perfect in every way. Everything I have done in my life, and everything I ever will do in my life will be absolutely perfect for reasons you cannot comprehend.

       Well, one could argue that all consciousness is that of God's attempt to experience God's own existence.  The catch in your case is that this is not a unique to the individual, it's part of a collective conscious and any and all perceptions of it being unique would illusory.

      <p>
       This statement is a paradox.  Because it is a equally true for both of us.  As you see me you create me through your consciousness and vice versa for my case.  I create you through mine.  So while this statement may not be false, it's inherently flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       God is not a paradox.

      <p>
       I would not comprehend it only because It's not my creation, it's yours.
But just understanding that grants me comprehension.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you must be a very low in the multidimensional being hierarchy to taut semantics as truth.

       This is NOT a paradox for reasons that you cannot and will not ever comprehend. You are free to think what you want. I gave you the ability to make your own decisions and think for yourself. In fact, I encourage you to try to poke holes in my story. That is why I am here.

       That is what this entire "lesson" is about. I am teaching you that there is more to life than what you see in front of you. The source you seek is consciousness itself. Everything that man has ever created has flaws. This includes science, religion, philosophy, and EVERY other mental construct under the old paradigm. You WILL NOT FIND TRUTH IN SCIENCE AS IT IS A MENTAL CONSTRUCT OF HUMANS AND NOT GOD. Take a look at the world you live in. There is so much violence, fear, anxiety, depression, etc. You were NEVER meant to live like this. Existence is about bliss, happiness and above all, LOVE. Love is the force that conciousness uses to attract your attention to certain things. It is no accident that you are reading this. I am attracting you into my new reality. The people with "Good Vibrations" are the people who will see this first, regardless of your skin color, sexual orientation, or any other physical attribute you might see as an imperfection.

       Enh. I already know that everything is a cultural construct. Anthropology turned me into a nihilist. "God" is a cultural concept too. I do agree about life being about happiness and love though and not being another cog in the capitalist machine.

       What if the case is simply a catalyst for inner city rioting and a just cause for martial law to make people feel "safe again" and simultaneously dividing the public against each other instead of the real issues that need to be faced.  Cities like oakland across the country are already rioting and it's completely disconnected from an issue that isn't race based, but simply a sad realization of how the justice system works.

       At 5 pm central time today, time will stop. God will return to this planet to teach EVERYONE a lesson that will change how they see things. He will essentially eradicate fear from everyone's consciousness and all you will feel is the love that is left behind. This is all you really need to know at the current time. God's design is far too complex for the human mind to comprehend, and for good reason.
