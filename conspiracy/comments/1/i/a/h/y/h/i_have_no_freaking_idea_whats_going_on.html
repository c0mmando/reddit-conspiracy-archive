    <div class="md"><p>I agree, Sooner or later, MAXIMUM 10-15 years, the financial system will collapse, and what we&#39;re seeing is the government trying to get a stranglehold on the people before the situation gets worse. 9/11 regardless of false flag or not, was used to get the ball rolling on the NSA and Patriot Act. The Patriot Act sounded like it was with with good intentions enough to get people to stand behind it and it worked. But it lacked any verbiage denying that the NSA spying that we see today was the eventual goal. They&#39;re not afraid of a public that pushes against them, because then they will be able to crack down. Any disaster large enough to justify to the people the declaration of Martial Law will eventually happen. Once Martial Law is enacted it will allow the President at the time to Suspend the Constitution and Elections to allow them to better &quot;control&quot; the problem. and then there is no turning back. and I believe as of now we&#39;re beyond the point of no return and we&#39;re simply waiting for either civil unrest or a &quot;Terrorist Attack&quot; of proportions we cannot yet imagine. After the NSA scandal became widely known it may have pushed the agenda up several years, if it wasn&#39;t planned this way from the start</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>MK Ultra, which many people have heard of but incorrectly assume was limited to LSD testing, involved over 100 subprojects all related to mind control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MK Ultra also involved the use of sexual abuse to program children. They wanted to &quot;partition&quot; the minds of people in their formative years so they would have multiple personalities insulated from each other. This way, theoretically, they could be called upon to do things (assassinations, seduction for the purposes of espionage, etc.) and could subsequently be interrogated but the  truth wouldn&#39;t come out.</p>

<p>MK Ultra also intersected with a child pedophilia ring, during the Bush Sr. presidency. They would literally fly orphans to Washington DC for sexual abuse. The truth of this ring was brought forward by John DeCamp (former Nebraska state senator IIRC) and he was backed up by William Colby, former CIA director. Watch the documentary &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; that&#39;s free online (it was supposed to be aired on the Discovery Channel but was pulled). The world really is stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>As far as the big picture goes, I&#39;m not sure. I mainly pay attention to the stuff that goes on on the surface: the US state&#39;s development of a massive counter-insurgence apparatus, the alliance of the US/Israel/Saudi Arabia, Israel&#39;s considerable influence on US foreign policy, the attempt to erode the concept of sovereignty in preparation for global government, etc. Rather than one monolithic power, I think there&#39;s a coalition of powerful interests behind these efforts (check out the Bilderberg meetings for the kind of people likely involved).</p>

<p>Technology makes global tyranny possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for the CIA and American foreign policy it is necessary to note that they have a horrific track record of known successful and unsuccessful actions. And that the western elite and their intelligence agencies have no interest in supporting truly democratic governments or leftist governments. The past centuries worth of history clearly shows this. In fact, the history shows that they support exactly the opposite, and have many times aided radical Islamists and right wing groups in order to justify perpetual war and spread US hegemony. It&#39;s all in the history and track records, look objectively at what is happening around you and examine it&#39;s historical precedence and what similar events lead to in the past. Realize that trends are inter-generational and that things such as the Cold War are still being played out and relived. </p>

<p>The CIA facilitates all of this by being the intelligence arm of the right wing US corporate elite, an organization which has constantly sought to undermine legitimate democracies and socially control people to turn them against liberalism, socialism, anarchism, and communism, (see CIA activities and operations in: Italy, Iran, Greece, Egypt, Hungary, Turkey, Honduras, El Salvador, Cuba, Haiti, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Congo, Angola, Ghana, South Africa, Vietnam, Laos, Libya, and many more.))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>14-year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has confirmed the CIA mind control experiments never ceased. He, and others, have stated the mind control projects involved radio frequency interaction with the human body. </p>

<p>CNN did a special report on Radio Frequency Weapons (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMNa4RcmKqA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMNa4RcmKqA</a>). It has interviews with scientists working on black projects related to this, Russian scientists smuggled in to do such work, and, perhaps most amazing, a radio engineer who builds a device, according to Russian psychotronic literature, that transmits images directly to a CNN reporter&#39;s mind using 1/1000th the energy of the earth&#39;s natural background radiation. The shocked engineer says that, given a couple weeks time, he could build a radio frequency weapon that could take care of a whole town- driving people insane with words and images beamed into their minds. </p>

<p>The Nazis developed this technology, and, as the Nazi scientists were spit between the USA and Russia as spoils of war, Russia and the US are the world&#39;s leaders in psychotronic mind control weapons. </p>

<p>People are reluctant to believe this, yet there is ample evidence. Aside from thousands of victims recounting similar experiences (often word for word) to the bioethics commission (bioethics.gov), Russian President Putin recently came out and said he had psychotronic mind control weapons that are more powerful than the atom bomb but more politically acceptable. (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2123415/Putin-targets-foes-zombie-gun-attack-victims-central-nervous-system.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2123415/Putin-targets-foes-zombie-gun-attack-victims-central-nervous-system.html</a>)</p>

<p>Judy Wall, Editor/Publisher Resonance
Newsletter of the MENSA Bioelectromagnetics Special Interest Group, has written some illuminating objective articles on the history of these weapons, and how they have already been deployed in combat by the US in Iraq and other locales.

    <div class="md"><p>If the government is do corrupt and evil and performing mind control experiments how come they publish their documents through FOIA? That sounds less like a conspiracy and more like a government trying to be transparent. </p>

<p>And do you know much about science and psychology? You claim it&#39;s far behind the truth but how do you know? You read it on that guys blog/site? What makes you think he&#39;s right compared to peer-reviewed scientists? </p>

<p>Also the rabbit hole thing mixed with the mind control is kind of cliche conspiracy theorist. You have no reason to believe these things, you shouldn&#39;t be so credulous of everything you read. There is nothing in those documents that show that mastered mind control and hypnosis. They tried some experiments in the cold war and they didn&#39;t really work. </p>

<p>Hypnosis can&#39;t make you do anything you really don&#39;t want to, it can just slightly open you up to suggestion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stock for each of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks is owned by all the member banks in that region. The stock cannot be traded. Each member bank is required to own a certain amount of stock based on the member banks balance sheet.</p>

<p>The stock entitles each member bank to an annual dividend equal to 6% of the value of the stock the member bank owns. The rest of the profits (the vast majority) goes to the federal government.</p>

<p>Unlike private corporations, more stock does not equal more votes. Instead, each member bank gets two votes for directors; one for a class A director and one for a class B director. Class B directors are not allowed to be bankers. The voting is divided up into three groups by bank size, so that the big banks in each region get to choose 2 directors, the medium size banks choose 2, and the small banks choose 2. In addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, an independent federal agency, appoints 3 class C directors.</p>

<p>So, even if all the large banks in a region collude to choose bank directors, they can only choose 2 of the 9 directors for that region. And there are 12 regions.</p>

<p>Now, can you show me any evidence that the Rothschilds control even one central bank in the world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please note OP, We don&#39;t 100% know, however there is a lot of well documented stuff out there and with some critical thinking skills the puzzle can become pretty clear. There is a lot of information out there, but there is also a lot disinformation. Every single person in this sub is not entirely on the same page (however for the most part we are). I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all fallen victim to trusting things that are actually disinformations/misinformation to some extent, some more than others of course. With that said: you really need to do your own research, be open an any possibility, and never claim any level of certainty until you&#39;ve done some serious research. </p>

<p>However, over my years of following such a practice, I am pretty sure I have come to some of the better sources, and weeded out some of the poorer ones. Of course, as I said, trust no one, including me, but check out these and they should give you a pretty good idea of how things work, what the &#39;truth&#39; is, and what the endgame is. </p>

<p>Also be careful with how you present this stuff to friends and family, if you intend to do so.I strongly recommend months of research before you even start bringing it up to them. If you can&#39;t back up every single claim, you will get called crazy and a conspiracy theorist, and even when your evidence is exceptional, most people will say you&#39;re crazy or wrong or stupid Without even taking time to look at evidence. Whenever possible, let your sources argue for you--even the best of us are not capable of presenting every piece of evidence off th top of our heads during arguments, and often it&#39;s very easy to get frustrated, making it impossible to get through to people. Do your best to stay calm, rational, Devoid of ANY and ALL ad hominem, and just present the facts--if they refuse to listen, just cut your losses. </p>

<p>I&#39;m new to this conspiracy stuff after Edward Snowden fucked up the government by revealing phone tapping and stuff like that, there&#39;s a whole world of crazy corrupt shit going on that a sheep like me has no idea what&#39;s going on, and what all of this is leading to.
Quick explanation please?
Edit 1: I think i&#39;m on the NSA&#39;s watching list now...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You already WERE on the NSA&#39;s watchlist if you had a Facebook page, email account, or a cell phone.</p>

<p>Come to realize that this time in human history is no different than any other except in the level of technological and scientific advancement. What happened in <em>every single other time of human history</em>, and in <em>every other society in human history since the very beginning of nation-states?</em> Small groups of wealthy, powerful men(small relative to the total population size) conspiring together with one another to gain greater and greater control and power for themselves over the world and over the masses of people who they perceive to be beneath them and who are in need of controlling. The masses are exploited and the intelligent among the masses who would otherwise rise up out of the muddy hordes and change things are <em>recruited instead</em> by the people with all of the money and all of the power.</p>

<p>Think about it in real terms like this - you and basically everyone else has been convinced that it&#39;s a good idea to pay the government hundreds of dollars and then ~$60/month every month after the cell phone purchase in order for you to <em>have the privilege of carrying around your own personal name-tagged and ID-numbered GPS tracking unit, which informs them of all of your calls, who your friends are, who you are talking to and when, where you are based on your cell tower signal bounces, what your texts are about, who you &quot;like&quot; on facebook, you PAY THEM AND THEIR CORPS. MONEY in order to give them all of your information and completely and total access to your life and your mind that any ruling class in the history of Earth would have KILLED FOR.</em>..</p>

<p>People are completely fucked. Think of what you thought of your society previously, and all that you were taught to think about it? Basically, the exact opposite is the actual truth - but it&#39;s much easier to keep a population docile and easily controlled/directed if they&#39;re fed/clothed/housed/entertained. Even slaves - you couldn&#39;t keep 20-100 slaves unless you made them all feel &quot;happy&quot;, give them wine, entertainment, clothes, food, housing ..they&#39;re your slaves, but they think &quot;<em>but look at how bad life would be out there as a barbarian!</em>&quot; ..such is life as a well-kept slave ..HOWEVER! If you keep these slaves in terrible conditions and constantly remind them you are in power over them and they are basically expendable little nothings/economic units you use to profit off of, they will almost invariably rebel and be badly behaved. Which is the best way for the masters to go? Where are WE?</p>

<p>The greatest thing now for the powers that be is they don&#39;t even need to give us REAL spaces for entertainment, we now have computers and a virtual landscape where we&#39;re entertained all day and night by things that aren&#39;t actually even happening or will never factually exist or take place, by bits of data and pixelated images and our own imaginations to keep us busy and occupied in between our work days where we go to make &quot;progress&quot; while giving 20-50% of our total income to a group of men who will send a team to come knock our doors down and kidnap us if we don&#39;t pay them that for life, called income taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, it&#39;s like this...money is the most important thing in the world, you are under the impression that &quot;government&quot; is in control of the creation of our currency, actually you on&#39;t even think about money or how it got there after its been made, you just know you need it to survive... you think the federal reserve bank is part of the government when in fact its the other way around...There is thi thing called &quot;money as debt&quot; or money printed as debt....start there....in sysnopsis&#39;</p>

<p>A private for profit &quot;bank&quot; is in control of creating money, they have no money, just the right to make it as granted by government, so they make this money out of thin air and then charge you 28=40% of your income your entire life for the privledge of using it....its a pozi scam, a pyramid scam, a confidence scam and a credit scam all rolled into one...</p>

<p>nuther way to think of it....the fed is like visa, but instead of having a bunch of money to loan out, they get to just make it, and then think of the government as 565 people who are in charge of the credit card spending for 300 million people....they are in with the banks and there job is to rack up the credit card bill which in the long run you and I get stuck with paying the interest off on the loan....</p>

<p>that&#39;s what the NWO is , its just a gang of corporations within corporations that control every thing....</p>

<p>the federal reserve bank s private and for profit....it is made up of and owned by many of the big banks, so not only do thyey ontrol all the money  after it has been made, but the control the making of the money....and stick the hell out of you with compounding interest....you owe them 21 trillion dollars</p>

<p>that&#39;s all its about, snowden is being used to rile you up, the csam is falling apart based on over printing, now they need a way to escape, a planned and instigated revolution is a great way to escape...</p>

<p>MONEY PRINTED AS DEBT, MONEY AS DEBT, M.A.D</p>

<p>Israel indeed has a lot of sway in American policy, but the thing about that is that the Israeli lobbyists are pushing on an ideologically open door in the US. America wants more power in the middle east, as does Israel. It&#39;s common sense. This big ass Jewish conspiracy is just nuts.</p>
