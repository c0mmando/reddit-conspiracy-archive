        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This whole case has been a dog and pony show. It has dragged on for 3 weeks now with no evidence to convict George Zimmerman.  The media should be talking about the NSA leaks and other topics other than this. We all know it hasn’t and it is the number one topic on the minds of the black communities throughout the nation.  While the country should be angry and rioting about the Snowden leaks and the IRS, the real anger lies in the Trayvon Martin case.  The country is being divided methodically to White and Black. Proof of that was brought to my attention <a href="http://frontpagemag.com/2013/matthew-vadum/government-approved-race-riots/">HERE</a> The Obama administration deployed government-paid community organizers to Sanford, Florida after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in order to foment racial tensions. </p>

<p>Black communities are planning to riot and pledging to murder whites. It is already happening. Facebook groups are popping up. Black on White crime is already happening.  Look at your twitter feeds. What happens when every ghetto in America is rioting? What if there are riots similar to the LA riots in every major city? Imagine if Twitter and Facebook had been around in the 90s. Other cities may have joined LA in rioting . Cities are preparing and have made it apparent. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LM2bRU_Tsc">Broward County Anti Riot Video</a></p>

<p>This may spiral out of control.  Every American city has a ghetto and the uninformed and uneducated are angry. Black communities finally have one thing to agree on throughout the country and it’s justice for Trayvon.  </p>

<p>Look at the propaganda being thrown at them. The only thing on the news is the case. Check!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.Nbcnews.com">www.Nbcnews.com</a></p>

<p>Look at the music being fed to the youth. Kanye West’s  new songs are “Black Skinhead” and “New Slaves” off of Yeezus. Look at the rest of the rap music industries’ <a href="http://rapgenius.com/search?q=Trayvon%2C+Martin&amp;hide_unexplained_songs=checked">artists and lyrics</a></p>

<p>Look at the movies <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wonLfgO5p8">“White House Down”</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwx1f0kyNwI">“Olympus Has Fallen”</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0LLaybEuzA">“The Purge.”</a> Is it some kind of coincidence that all of these movies came out this during this period of our country? Or are TPTB giving us ideas and provoking us?</p>

<p>Two boys in Boston shut the entire city down and sent it into martial law. One man in LA disrupted the entire SoCal area and sent it into martial law. You can call those situations anything you want but police were going into people’s houses without warrants. TPTB would now have a reason to flex that new muscle in the form of the DHS, NSA, and any other three-letter agency you want to include. They have been preparing. There is a reason that Blackhawks are skimming skyscrapers in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV4MnhWlnMQ">Miami</a> and Special Operation Forces are rappelling from helicopters in downtown <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LvbWxFsM50">LA</a>. Is this the “false flag” for a civil war?</p>

<p>Are TPTB antagonizing the American masses?</p>

<p>EDIT: DONT FORGET A HURRICANE IS GETTING READY TO BLAST THROUGH FLORIDA. REMEMBER KATRINA. I know it won&#39;t be that bad of a storm but it&#39;s easy to blame the mess on Mother Nature </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it will be that big. It&#39;s not like the only people who live in ghettos are black. Latinos are a larger minority than black people are and Zimmerman was Latino. Also, it&#39;s not like every black person lives in a ghetto and is frothing at the mouth about Trayvon. Many people, regardless of race, are too busy with their lives to worry about this to the scale you are talking about.</p>

<p>If anything, I&#39;d agree with your implications about a false flag a bit. This whole deal is being used as an experiment for when real riots come about over the issue that truly divides this country: $.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I am not looking at this situation with worry for myself. I have a worry for these communities where rioting takes place. It will be a perfect opportunity for something to go wrong. What happens when an innocent is killed by a police officer like in Turkey? What would happen here if that same shit happened? DHS is itching to prove themselves. Remember you NEED the DHS! You&#39;re not safe!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you believe in the 4322 day Theory? Essentially The 4 rise of Fascism will be 4322 days after 9/11. That&#39;s this week. They could be using the trial as civil unrest. I&#39;m down here in Florida and we have people outside the courthouse protesting somewhat plus they Trayvon&#39;s dad is supposedly a black freemason. Son could of been a sacrifice in order help bring the NWO. Either way I think the ghetto area Trayvon was living will most likely riot at the verdict of Zimmerman be let go. And we also have the Dzhokhar Tsarnaev trial where if he is actually found not guilty, like he pleaded, could also lead to civil unrest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the reason Zimmerman suspected Martin was because he was hanging around a more affluent neighborhood (gated community but I might be wrong). Turned out he lived there. Not exactly what I would call a ghetto. Even if people in Florida rioted I don&#39;t think the rest of the country would, like other people have said I think most people are too caught up in their own lives. The black people I know haven&#39;t shown any kind of riot like anger. Sides we all know Florida be cray! But it is an interesting thought :) </p>

<p>Second, the MSM chose to cover this for the ratings turning something that&#39;s common into a high profile case.  The ensuing riots would also get great ratings.  </p>

<p>NOW - Is this case useful for the gov&#39;t or crisis opportunists in some way?  Possibly.  </p>

<p>Another thing is, I don&#39;t know why Zimmerman is considered white.  Does he claim to be white or is that what the media says?  </p>

<p>Well, first off, fine demarcations of subcategories of race don&#39;t make the general broad racial divisions invalid. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they do: it&#39;s why we in America call Obama black, but to another culture (perhaps a Brazilian slum) Obama could be referred to as white: yet he is 50/50....we in America have certain demarcations for why we choose one 50% over the other 50%. See what I&#39;m saying? It&#39;s all cultural perception: race is not a &quot;real&quot; or scientific thing. You can draw fuzzy phenotypical sets for fuzzy geographical areas, but there is no scientific subclassification below <em>homo sapiens</em>. Race and ethnicity are dependent on subjective perceptions of phenotypes associated with a perceived region, the definitions of which change through time, location, and culture. I&#39;m not making any of this up: these are the biological and social scientific definitions in academic study. You have a high positive raiting on my RES from this sub, so obviously we come to the same conclusions on many things. Perhaps further research down this field may behoove you?</p>

<p>Zimmerman is not white which makes the who thing even more ridiculous. I am not sure who started it all. Race just kinda got drug into the spot light really quickly. Almost like a psy op to see how groups react? The paula dean &quot;nigger&quot; story and and then immigration talks have only worsened tensions between whites and non-whites. Immigration talk gets white people fired up.</p>

<p>He was, unfortunately,  reacting to what was known about the case at the time.  It did seem to help diffuse the tensions at the time, as it gave a lot of disenfranchised people the idea that they were being heard, and justice wouldn&#39;t be ignored.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone took control of that case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report from the police chief specifically states they were being pressured by local officials.  &quot;Someone taking control&quot; is  metaphor for the Mayor basically telling them there needed to be an arrest, not a litteral statement that someone else showed up and took over.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also evidence points to the DOJ funding protest efforts.</p>

<p>I assume you&#39;re talking about the Community Relations department of the DOJ?  Yea...  they show up at every major protest; their mission is to diffuse things and offer impartial mediation.  This is not &quot;funding protest efforts&quot;.  It&#39;s the exact opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre right. The uninformed, uneducated sleeper drones are very angry about the Trayvonn case. Meanwhile, the people who follow politics are angry about NSA spying. Now, im only in my early 20s so take this with a grain of salt, but i dont think a situation like this has happened before; where EVERYONE is tense about something.</p>

<p>The media is also trying very hard to MAKE this a black vs white scneario. They refer to zimmerman as a &quot;white hispanic&quot; because his mother (i think) was white. (even though Obama isnt a white-black man).</p>

<hr/>

<p>Youre also spot on with the movies. What better way to prep and condition society to accept the events more than saturating their brains with visual representation? much more easily malleable. However, keep in mind there are Anti-NWO movies aswell, Superman being one.</p>

<hr/>

<p>There WILL be riots. Rather than martial being implemented at once place at a time, they will be in multiple places. Then the media will report it and play it down like its nothing big. </p>

<p>Weve already walked to the edge, once these riots start, we begin the process of falling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the belated response. </p>

<p>Im of course speculating, but if we weer to look at it and analyze the movie the same way we analyze &quot;pro nwo&quot; movies (the purge for example), It will show the exact opposite message. There have to be some people in the industry who are awake to whats happening and are fighting against it. </p>

<p>For instance, superman at some point destroys a drone, in another scene basically tells the military &quot;fuck you what youre doing is wrong&quot;. I havnt seen the movie in over a week and suffer some memory loss (too much extracurricular activities ;P). The way Krypton functioned and the way it collapsed have an eerie similarity to today.  I also like to point out that G. Zodd (NWO domination) was actually killed by superman. Note that Superman NEVER kills  (or is incredibly rare when he does it) and he did it so fluently without an ounce of regret in the movie against his first enemy.</p>

<p>PS. now, as i was googling this to help jog my memory, i found that Alex jones made a video saying the same thing! I dont listen/watch him, so its kinda creepy to know he has a similar viewpoint. I havnt watched it yet, but give it a listen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q25UkVZKUoU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=q25UkVZKUoU</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as far as riots go, a riot is a construct of a mob.  The mob is a construct of community communication, and the media is dominant there.</p>

<p>The media will decide if it wants a riot or not.</p>

<p>As far as Zimmerman shooting the gun, deeeeerp! Nobody, including Zimmerman, is denying that he fired the gun.</p>

<p>The evidence that needs to be present to convict him of murder is that he wasn&#39;t acting in self defense.  And based upon the facts of the case that I&#39;ve seen while following this trial, even the prosecution&#39;s witnesses seem to be validating Zimmerman&#39;s version of events.  </p>

<p>Of the people who I&#39;ve encountered that seem &quot;hell bent&quot; on punishing Zimmerman, the overwhelming majority are anti-gun advocates and have based their opinion of the whole case on &quot;guns shouldn&#39;t be legal&quot;. But guns ARE legal, precisely for the purposes of self defense.  Guns are legal so that we can shoot people with them.  I know that sounds foolish but its not only true, its necessary.   </p>

<p>If you disagree that its necessary then I suggest that you study world history.  Specifically all incidents where a technologically inferior people were oppressed and virtually exterminated.</p>

<p>Native Americans, European Jews, Chinese, several African tribes.  The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>And you can&#39;t just trust your government to keep an army to defend you from such things.  See Nazi Germany, and 3 hour wait times for police to respond in Detroit.  </p>

<p>Guns are legal!  I walk around every day of my life with 2 of them, I&#39;ve only has to draw one them one time, and I&#39;ve never had to fire one them in self defense.  </p>

<p>Better to have and not need than to need and not have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all due respect, I think you&#39;re lying.</p>

<p>You&#39;re all about guns, but when someone uses one then suddenly they were playing cop and chasing people down.</p>

<p>Ummmm, Zimmerman was on the neighborhood watch, which they set up to combat a string of burglaries.  I guess he should have left his gun at home while doing the most dangerous task of his day.  Or wait! Maybe he shouldn&#39;t have attempted to protect his community&#39;s property as a part of a watch group.  </p>

<p>Why would he call the police at all if he was looking for a good old fashioned killing of an innocent minority child?  </p>

<p>Yeah, I just don&#39;t don&#39;t believe you.  I&#39;ve seen so many similar comments about this case (I&#39;m all about guns but this was murder!) I just don&#39;t buy it any more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the reason Zimmerman suspected Martin was because he was hanging around a more affluent neighborhood (gated community but I might be wrong). Turned out he lived there. Not exactly what I would call a ghetto. Even if people in Florida rioted I don&#39;t think the rest of the country would, like other people have said I think most people are too caught up in their own lives. The black people I know haven&#39;t shown any kind of riot like anger. Sides we all know Florida be cray! But it is an interesting thought :) </p>
