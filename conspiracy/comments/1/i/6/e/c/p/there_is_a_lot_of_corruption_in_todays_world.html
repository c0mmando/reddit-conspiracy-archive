       <strong>
        The following post is an opinion based post from the POV of a skeptic
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1i5lbn/now_wrap_your_mind_around_this/">
        This submission to /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is what got me to write this. Yeah, we get it. There is a lot of corruption in the world. Some of it even backed by evidence. But please, let a skeptic try and explain to the conspiracy theorist why it is we have trouble and issues supporting you, and what we need to overcome before we can get the ball rolling on any sort of mass support, in lieu of a revolution of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its simple really. We agree with a lot of the stuff you guys say, that is until someone walks in and makes a blunt claim about a conspiracy theory that is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       backed by evidence. We'll protest right there alongside you in the name of our privacy, in the name of having the war on drugs stopped, all of that. because its
       <em>
        factual
       </em>
       , because it can be
       <em>
        proven
       </em>
       that we're fighting against an unjust cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       We tend to have issues though, with people like 9/11 truthers for example. They claim to be truth seekers, and demand more investigations into 9/11, simply put because they do not agree with the previous investigations. I'm sorry, but quoting bad science, false claims and long ago discredited fireman saying they heard a bomb (retracted once he realized the 2nd building had come down) does not imply that there is a conspiracy. Stacking up a pyramid of bad evidence does not make a good theory. Thats just not how things work.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have your backs, brothers. But really, if you really want the support of the masses, you're going to need to let go of a couple of some of the bad and dangerous conspiracy theories. Give you an example of a dangerous conspiracy theory, you say? How about the anti vaccination movement claiming vaccines are bad and cause autisim? Thats causing a resurgence in diseases that should have been wiped out by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be right there next to you marching on the capital if its regarding domestic spying or the war on drugs, or privatization of prisons (just a few examples) but I'm sorry, I can't be there if a bunch of people are screaming about 9/11, if alex jones is on the horn, if Icke is there with followers claiming the leaders are reptilians, if anti vaxxers use the revolution to try and throw science out the window and kill people, I'm sorry, but I just can't support that and neither can [most likely] any other true skeptic out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think thats the biggest issue, really. The 'mainstream public' would love to go through a revolution for all sorts of valid reasons, but takes issue with the core conspiracy theorist pushing invalidated reasoning and invalidated claims [or untestable claims].
      </p>
      <p>
       Discuss. Please try not to make this discussion about any specific conspiracy thought or theory. This is about the ideological movement in general and how we as skeptics can attempt to find a common ground with the conspiracy theorist movement in order to actually enact change on this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fight the good fight, brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will add that saying things like "wake up sheeple" is offensive to many people, and does not help to further your cause. And one for you skeptics out there, don't call them 9/11 "troofers" to imply they are stupid. It doesn't matter what your opinion about someone is, all that matters is the evidence. Both sides have some bad people within that do these sorts of things. I hereby acknowledge that fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your time, looking forward to a good discussion.
      </p>

       Following 9/11, the NYT took oral reports of 503 first responders.  Of those 503, the vast majority never made it to the towers before they fell.  Of the ones that actually made it into the twin towers, then safely came out alive, there were over 130 first responders (firefighters, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians) claiming there were bombs, explosions or explosives.

       ---I did, and I counted 138 reports of "bombs", "explosions", and "explosives"---rather than throwing out untruths to fit the "official" conspiracy theory of 19 hijackers led by a man on dialysis in a cave.

        anyone who can look at the "collapse" of WTC7, and still honestly believe it was caused by an office fire, is a complete idiot, a danger to himself, and shouldn't be allowed to operate a spoon.

      </p>
      <p>
       I live in the real world, where an office fire has never in the history of mankind caused a steel frame building to collapse. And

        there is no possible way in our universe---the one we live in---that it could naturally fall symmetrically the way it did: all the bolts failing on the 1st floor at the exact same time, then all the bolts failing on the 2nd floor at the exact same time, then all the bolts failing on the 3rd floor at exactly the same time, then all the bolts failing on the 4th floor at exactly the same time, then all the bolts failing on the 5th floor at exactly the same time---all the way thru the 47th floor---and all perfectly within tenths of a second, in order for that building to fall in this manner, in under 7 seconds.

       No one with two working brain cells would think this could happen without some sort of cutter charges.
      </p>

       These aren't the only problems with the "official" conspiracy theory, which only a friggin' brain-dead wacko in a tin-foil hat could possibly believe.

       If the mainstream media has lied to you, there is no reason to ever trust them again. Its likely they are feeding more lies.

       In your post, you said to avoid discussion of any particular conspiracy. This is not really possible, because establishing this pattern of behavior on the part of our rulers is essential in understanding the ideological framework of the historical revisionist (much more accurate than conspiracy theorist, IMO).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories arise, at least in a rational mind, because the official narrative of an event is itself implausible, unsubstantiated or simply later confirmed to be a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider, for example, the invasion of Iraq. Remember Colin Powell holding up that vial of anthrax? Remember that Yellow cake from Nigeria that turned out to be fraudulent? Remember how every media outlet and every government official was repeating the same baseless assertions? That was a conspiracy theory: an assertion based on inaccurate and unsubstantiated facts. And everyone swallowed it. It was even worse than most, because it was crafted to fulfill the agenda of the elite and led to a war costing over a million lives. Now, had Saddam Hussein turned out to have possessed WMDs, I would be the 'conspiracy theorist' for suggesting that the invasion was entirely about the supremacy of the Petrodollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the Gulf of Tonkin? The attack led by North Vietnam on one of our Naval Vessels that was used as the casus belli to enter into a full-fledged war with that nation? The fact is, it never happened. None of the perpetrators of this lie had to pay any price for what they had done. If members of an administration can so easily get the media to parrot a lie, and when that lie is discovered no punishment is doled out, why wouldn't they do it whenever it helps advance their agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where 9/11 comes in. An objective analysis of the evidence (albeit circumstantial) would lead anyone to conclude that the higher echelons of the US administration at least had foreknowledge. In fact, it is exceedingly likely that members of the US intelligence apparatus had a hand in preparing it. The sources for this are too numerous and the story is too long to get into here; however, a few minutes consulting sources outside of the corporate orthodoxy will get the ball rolling for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not essential to believe in every 'conspiracy theory' or, in fact, any in order to possess an analytical and independent mind. It is, however, essential to question that which the media and government tell you, for they only have their interests at heart. That is a fact, a well-documented and thoroughly-established one.

       I pretty much agree with what you have said, but I see one issue in it. Conspiracy theories revolve a lot around speculation, so there always will be that shoddy "evidence" to back some things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it becomes a problem is posts claiming things like "100% proof of x." When in reality, there is no concrete evidence to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to get better as a community at labeling things as "speculation", or "backed up with evidence". Idk, my wording may be off, but hopefully you can understand what i'm getting at.

       Oh yeah totally. I completely get what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Claim X backed by new evidence" for example, totally acceptable. Even if it turns out the evidence is bad, at least it brings up the discussion and the alleged evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       "100% proof bombshell information on Claim X: New Evidence" for example, is bad.

       I think one thing that would get the ball rolling is a certain agreement-of-disagreement as it were, that took place on an open and visible enough level that people wouldn't be talking about 9/11 conspiracy theories during this revolution. Because its such a hotly contested topic, because its actual scientific evidence is bad
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       there is a scientific, global consensus which directly counters the claims of the conspiracy theory itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm trying to say is they can believe it, just don't preach about it to your fellow revolutionists in the crowd. Its only going to cause problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: To expand on this thought, it also carries along with it anti vaccination theories, reptilians, chemtrails... That sort of thing. The more "out there" commonly recognized conspiracy theories would just have to be, well, for lack of a better term, "not talked about" during this revolution.

       That and it makes you seem less credible. It's sad, but traditionally "conspiracy theorists" are seen as "crazies" to the general population. Piling on unfounded claims to that does not help at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to have clear and concise statements, with good organization and legit info to back it up, or no one will ever take us seriously. I'd say that counts for most walks of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, some of the "proof of x" posts have raised some amazing conversations, and I have learned or been exposed to things I never knew about before. Like you said, even with bad science or facts behind it, it evokes discussion, which is always good.

       The truth is, no one knows what the truth is.  There is a lot of "faith" involved in conspiracy theory.  People get caught up in wanting to be right, just as in any other scenario (religion).  Asking the questions is what's truly important here, not the specifics of your belief.

       Whether you believe, for example, that 9/11 went as reported or not, we can all agree that the event has been used to erode our civil liberties and consolidate power within the executive branch of the federal government.  Whether THEY were in on it or not, they benefitted greatly from it.  That's all I got.

        if you really want the support of the masses, you're going to need to let go of a couple of some of the bad and dangerous conspiracy theories. Give you an example of a dangerous conspiracy theory, you say? How about the anti vaccination movement claiming vaccines are bad and cause autisim? Thats causing a resurgence in diseases that should have been wiped out by now.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But yet in the comments below you agree that the MSM is there to sell you product, and it is well known the pharmaceutical industry benefits greatly from this.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was not really so much my point.  My point is more that, it seems after looking at conspiracy theories for some time now, the ones that are ridiculed and shouted down the most are the ones that deserve the most scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vaccine debate is one of these items.  It is a very complex issue.  I tend to take the stance that as we evolve technologically we are distancing ourselves from nature.  With this we are engineering immunities.  These immunities complicate things further: see 'The Superbug' resistant to antibiotics.
      </p>
      <p>
       This extends to food as well.  This is why the GMO debate is so heavy.  If more and more we engineer the food we eat rather than growing naturally, things change.  See:  Inclusion of Corn starch in the average American diet and the resulting obesity epidemic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point here is that we require nature to live.  We need air to breath, water to drink and food to eat.  We
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       create it artificially, but it is 'unnatural' and tends to have consequences in the long term.  When I was a kid, I was purposely infected with chicken pox.  I wasn't given much medication and my immune system was allowed to fight it off naturally.  This is the way the immune system works, we can agree on this I'm sure.  I was not heavily vaccinated as a child.  I got sick my fair share of times growing up, but nothing unusual.  Currently, I rarely get sick.  Maybe on average once every 2 years, and I'm not exactly young anymore.  I don't wash my hands overly often, and certainly don't use hand sanitizer.  And yet, I don't seem to get sick.  I'm also a big believer in occasionally exercising your immune system.  That is, I don't get upset about getting sick.  Again the further away from nature we get, the more complicated our health problems will become.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that no one should be immunized or that everyone should get infections to build up immunity, and if some people die, then that's mother nature helping to correct our overpopulation problem.  I'm not saying that.  What I'm saying is we have become out of balance with nature.  We are now opposed to it, and we create entire environments all unto ourselves in which we can live.  (e.g. geodomes, living experiments for future manned mars missions.
      </p>
      <p>
       We over-vaccinate our kids, too much too soon.  We don't even give their immune system a chance to develop.  To build up some of those natural immunities.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the reason I believe that vaccines should not be left out of the debate.  It hasn't been proven one way or another.  Yes it's been shown that vaccines work, but it's also shown that they can be harmful/ineffective as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a revolution I agree that I hope that Alex Jones will not be at the front with a bullhorn, but I also don't think that subjects should be ignored, yes even the reptilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       My reasoning for this assertion is this.  Obviously I take the stance of the 'Conspiracy Theorist' and you the 'Skeptic'.  For me, the farther I push the boundaries of what I believe possible, the better.  The more ideas, note: ideas, I can fill my head with, and just consider the possibilities and implications the better.  In this way as boundaries are pushed outwards, those things within the boundary of what is possible come closer and closer to reality.  This is why I don't necessarily discount reptilians.  It's not to say I believe and whole heartedly endorse the idea, but I find it interesting, and will occasionally read information in regard to it, and consider it.  Again, you don't have to make your mind up about information immediately.  You can consider it, consider criticism, and still not take a side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do applaud your effort at unification.  Very noble.

       Every day this subreddit grows. Every day r/politics runs more of the stories that we posted months ago. We do not have to make any concessions. Soon the truth will have out and you will be on our side unabashedly. I'm looking forward to the day brother.

I talk about the NSA scandal and people dismiss me for dxactly the same reason you do.

       OK, Dr_House, I have a two part question for you that requires a yes/no answers about 9/11 - a subject you yourself brought up. I want to know exactly where you stand on the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I will make a statement about the "Events of 9/11" in a generalised way that I hope you or indeed anybody (truther or skeptic) could agree with. Let's call the Events of 9/11:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "a series of violent incidents which led to the partial or complete collapse of all 7 buildings in the World Trade Centre complex in NYC, the destruction of part of the Pentagon in Washington DC, and a further incident which led to reports of a "crater" in Shanksville, Pennsylvania."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you agree with this statement? Yes or No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming you answered "yes", this is my main question:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Do you agree that nobody within the US government, or its security agencies, was involved with the planning or execution of the "Events of 9/11", and neither was anybody aware of the plans of those events, before they occurred on 9/11?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes or No?

       Conspiracies happen every day. And they do often make the 'news' with substantial evidence to support the theory that a conspiracy was involved. Occasionally, they don't make the 'news', despite evidence that there was a conspiracy.

       You know, someone might take that as saying only the mainstream media will show us something with evidence, therefore everything in the mainstream media has evidence and is true.

       no, you misunderstood it then. Hence the words (real news) in parentheses. Real news doesn't really exist in my opinion. I was speaking hypothetically.

       Every day this subreddit grows. Every day r/politics runs more of the stories that we posted months ago. We do not have to make any concessions. Soon the truth will have out and you will be on our side unabashedly. I'm looking forward to the day brother. It gets rocky passing through the looking glass, but I'll buy you a beer in the halls of the Archons when this all wraps up.
