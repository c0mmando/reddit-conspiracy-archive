       Rumor has it Michael Hastings was about to blow the lid off Anonymous, in that they have been co-opted by everyone's favorite three letter agencies. Some people are speculating this is what got him killed.

      <p>
       As someone who has been around the block, I can attest to it. Sabu ratted on most of the top players, and the rest of the script kiddies got v&amp;. Anonymous is small time now, and anything you see them doing is at the behest of their masters.

       I really urge you to come to your own conclusions about this, and be open minded as the investigation continues. We really don't know what caused the crash, but there are some strange damn connections.

       Anonymous is more of an idea than an actual group, I wouldn't be surprised if this rumor was stared to bring distrust to everyone's favorite "group". Anyone can do anything in the name of anonymous and take credit for it, sure there is a hacker group that call themselves "anonymous" but they're only part of the bigger picture

       MOST of today's Anonymous does nothing more than hack a website or initiate a DDOS attack. What exactly do you expect anonymous to do, hack the storage center and leak out the info there? Unless it was a large scale attack, you won't see much.

       That's kind of boring.  But it seems that's all they do.  I suppose I don't, didn't or didn't want to know that's all they did.  In  my mind I was kind of hoping they could do some real hacking and cracking.  But from what I've seen all they do is raid websites here and there and cause a minor nuisance.

       As far as I understand it, the structure of Anonymous as an organization is highly decentralized. In fact, it is so decentralized that one could fairly say that it doesn't exist at all as a group. Much like the ALF and other direct action organizations, anyone can commit an act and claim it to be the work of Anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
       This structure allows pretty much anyone with Netsec expertise to commit whatever crime and claim it for the entity as a whole. Of course, this structure is very easy to manipulate as even people who identify as a member can't ever really be certain who else is a member and can never really be certain that an act, even though claimed by Anonymous, was ever actually perpetrated by the organization. Much like Al-Qaeda (which probably does have some true-believers in its ranks), it is infinitely more useful as a tool of the ruling class than as a mechanism for legitimate protest.

       well they do organize themselves under their op missions (Operation Chanology, Operation Payback etc...), the DDoS HOIC app is an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, after the Sony hacks, the government began closing in on its members, or at least the most active users. Some jail sentences were given out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course as a decentralized movement, it means that it is far from dead, yet, faced against the NSA, they'd need some very talented hackers, and not script kiddies, and by design these talents usually work alone or in very small hermatic groups, that never anounce themselves on youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, if COINTELPRO or Gladios are anything to remember, the NSA could easily be behind such Op, if ever initiated, and have it as a sting operation, basically identifying anyone who used 3-party apps like the HOIC as a terrorist or national security threats, paradoxically undermining any attempts to attack the NSA.

       All they do is refresh websites with a batch script in sync. It's not hacking. You might as well say that organizing lots of people to go shopping at the same store is hacking. HINT: Where do you think they got the tag "Anonymous" from? Where on the internet do you see lots of people with that tag?

       Because Anonymous is just a group of semi-familiar hackers who DDOS webpages and dig up emails, not an agency of professional government operators with connections to every Internet, phone, and cable provider plus search engine companies (since most if not all are based in the US and adhere to US laws and regulations).
      </p>

       Hacking only goes so far, not something that can compete with an agency that's built specifically to
       <em>

       from all kinds of threats and use every means available to them to do so.

       I'm not sure I understand this post. Anonymous has launched multiple "operations" against the NSA since this started right? Including releasing the private details of every member of congress that has supported PRISM. As far as Anonymous being NSA, or co-opted by intelligence agencies, I think that claim needs more than "trust me they are" behind it.
