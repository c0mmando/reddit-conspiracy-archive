    <div class="md"><p>As far as I understand it, the structure of Anonymous as an organization is highly decentralized. In fact, it is so decentralized that one could fairly say that it doesn&#39;t exist at all as a group. Much like the ALF and other direct action organizations, anyone can commit an act and claim it to be the work of Anonymous.</p>

<p>This structure allows pretty much anyone with Netsec expertise to commit whatever crime and claim it for the entity as a whole. Of course, this structure is very easy to manipulate as even people who identify as a member can&#39;t ever really be certain who else is a member and can never really be certain that an act, even though claimed by Anonymous, was ever actually perpetrated by the organization. Much like Al-Qaeda (which probably does have some true-believers in its ranks), it is infinitely more useful as a tool of the ruling class than as a mechanism for legitimate protest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well they do organize themselves under their op missions (Operation Chanology, Operation Payback etc...), the DDoS HOIC app is an example.</p>

<p>Anyway, after the Sony hacks, the government began closing in on its members, or at least the most active users. Some jail sentences were given out.</p>

<p>Of course as a decentralized movement, it means that it is far from dead, yet, faced against the NSA, they&#39;d need some very talented hackers, and not script kiddies, and by design these talents usually work alone or in very small hermatic groups, that never anounce themselves on youtube.</p>

<p>And again, if COINTELPRO or Gladios are anything to remember, the NSA could easily be behind such Op, if ever initiated, and have it as a sting operation, basically identifying anyone who used 3-party apps like the HOIC as a terrorist or national security threats, paradoxically undermining any attempts to attack the NSA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I understand this post. Anonymous has launched multiple &quot;operations&quot; against the NSA since this started right?
