       Salon.com interview with Laura Poitras(who made the Snowden vid):

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why do you think he contacted you? Were you the first person he contacted?
       </p>
       <p>
        I can’t speak for him. Glenn and I just touched base about, what was your story, because we connected later in the spring. He, I think, got an email in February. But I didn’t know he’d gotten an email.
       </p>
       <p>
        He told me he’d contacted me because my border harassment meant that I’d been a person who had been selected. To be selected –and he went through a whole litany of things — means that everything you do, every friend you have, every purchase you make, every street you cross means you’re being watched. “You probably don’t like how this system works, I think you can tell the story.” … Of course I was suspicious, I worried that it was entrapment, it’s crazy, all the normal responses you have to someone reaching out making, claims. He said he’d seen a piece that I’d done on Bill Binney in the Times.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can say from conversations I had with him after that, I think he had a suspicion of mainstream media. And particularly what happened with the New York Times and the warrantless wiretapping story, which as we know was shelved for a year. So he expressed that to me but I think also in his choices of who he contacted. I didn’t know he was reaching out to Glenn at that point.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         And you and Glenn were already colleagues, right, you sit on a board together?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         At that point the foundation had just opened. So we knew each other and we were colleagues and friends.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        How did it get to the point where you knew it was going to be a story, and how did you decide where it was going to be published?
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Those are the details I’m not going to go into. What I can say is that once I had a few pieces of correspondence, I said, let me ask a couple of people about this, people who have experience, and I sat down with a couple of people, one of whom was Bart Gellman … and he said, it looks like this person could be legit. And that was probably February.
        </strong>

       Ah, the Foundation for National Progress.  OTHERWISE KNOWN AS, Mother Jones.  A George Soros funded propaganda rag.

       George Soros, being the billionaire who runs the Royal Institute For International Affairs which is basically the Council on Foreign Relations, same organization, different name.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not my original research, I credit Adam Curry, he breaks this stuff down more in depth here:
       <a href="http://youtu.be/PKH9nQi1uN4?t=17m25s">

      <p>
       Here's my "theory" going off of this.  All of these different countries that are being spied on are being antagonized by this information. This is what they WANT.  They want to make the USA look like the big bad wolf(it is).  But this antagonistic information will lead these other countries to demand a "world regulation" on privacy, probably moderated by the UN.  That is step one to world governance.  This will also line up the USA as the antagonist in a coming world war, which is in the process of ramping up as we speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the cards are being lined up to fuck us over, this Snowden thing is a STAGED EVENT.  Just like all of the other obvious staged events, guys, just because this staged event is seemingly HELPFUL to our cause, does not mean that it is a good thing.  It might even be staged by Russia or China as well in order to establish the US as the antagonists.  With the leftist Mother Jones affiliated "journalists" being the breakers of the "story", it becomes obvious that this is a blow for freedom.  The press and the government calling him a "traitor" just gets the people more angry at the press and the government which then leads to people calling for
       <strong>
        someone to DO something
       </strong>
       , meaning the only organization that has the "power" to do something in the eyes of the low-information types, the UN.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many other angles to take this towards, but the signs point towards this being a staged event.  They GAVE this story to us people.  Would the compromised press do that?  Come on.  THINK, fuckers.

       Here is some information about George Soros:

      <p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Soros' book, The New Paradigm for Financial Markets (May 2008), described a "superbubble" that had built up over the past 25 years and was ready to collapse. This was the third in a series of books he has written that have predicted disaster. As he states:
       </p>
       <p>
        I have a record of crying wolf ... I did it first in The Alchemy of Finance (in 1987), then in The Crisis of Global Capitalism (in 1998) and now in this book. So it's three books predicting disaster. (After) the boy cried wolf three times ... the wolf really came.[34]
       </p>
       <p>
        He ascribes his own success to being able to recognize when his predictions are wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong ... I basically have survived by recognizing my mistakes. I very often used to get backaches due to the fact that I was wrong. Whenever you are wrong you have to fight or [take] flight. When [I] make the decision, the backache goes away.[34]
       </p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In an interview with The Washington Post on November 11, 2003, Soros said that removing President George W. Bush from office was the "central focus of my life" and "a matter of life and death". He said he would sacrifice his entire fortune to defeat President Bush "if someone guaranteed it".[53] Soros gave $3 million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5 million to MoveOn.org, and $20 million[54] to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004 he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multi-state tour with a speech: Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush[55] delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, DC. The online transcript to this speech received many hits after Dick Cheney accidentally referred to FactCheck.org as "factcheck.com" in the Vice Presidential debate, causing the owner of that domain to redirect all traffic to Soros' site.[56]

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In October 2011 a Reuters story titled "Soros: not a funder of Wall Street protests" was published after several commentators pointed out errors in an earlier Reuters story headlined "Who's behind the Wall St. protests?" with a lede stating that the Occupy Wall Street movement "may have benefited indirectly from the largesse of one of the world's richest men [Soros]".

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Soros has funded worldwide efforts to promote drug policy reform. In 2008, Soros donated $400,000 to help fund a successful ballot measure in Massachusetts known as the Massachusetts Sensible Marijuana Policy Initiative which decriminalized possession of less than 1 oz (28g) of marijuana in the state. Soros has also funded similar measures in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada and Maine.[74] Among the drug decriminalization groups that have received funding from Soros are the Lindesmith Center and Drug Policy Foundation.[75] Soros donated $1.4 million to publicity efforts to support California's Proposition 5 in 2008, a failed ballot measure that would have expanded drug rehabilitation programs as alternatives to prison for persons convicted of non-violent drug-related offenses.[76]
       </p>
       <p>
        In October 2010, Soros donated $1 million to support California's Proposition 19.[77]
       </p>
       <p>
        According to remarks in an interview in October 2009, it is Soros' opinion that marijuana is less addictive but not appropriate for use by children and students. He himself has not used marijuana for years.[78]

        His philosophical outlook is influenced by Karl Popper, under whom he studied at the London School of Economics (LSE). His Open Society Institute is named after Popper's two volume work, The Open Society and Its Enemies, and Soros' ongoing philosophical commitment to the principle of fallibilism (that anything he believes may in fact be wrong, and is therefore to be questioned and improved) stems from Popper's philosophy.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Despite working as an investor and currency trader, Soros argues that the current system of financial speculation undermines healthy economic development in many underdeveloped countries. He blames many of the world's problems on the failures inherent in what he characterizes as market fundamentalism. His opposition to many aspects of globalization has made him a controversial figure.
       </p>

      <p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At a Jewish forum in New York City, November 5, 2003, Soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of Israel and the United States, and the role of wealthy and influential individuals:
       </p>
       <p>
        "There is a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe. The policies of the Bush administration and the Sharon administration contribute to that. It's not specifically anti-Semitism, but it does manifest itself in anti-Semitism as well. I'm critical of those policies ... If we change that direction, then anti-Semitism also will diminish. I can't see how one could confront it directly ... I'm also very concerned about my own role because the new anti-Semitism holds that the Jews rule the world ... As an unintended consequence of my actions ... I also contribute to that image.[86]"
       </p>
       <p>
        In a subsequent article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized that
       </p>
       <p>
        "I do not subscribe to the myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should be held responsible for anti-Semitism. At the same time, I do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.[87]"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       TLDR: The guy is pro-marijuana, anti drug war, anti globalization, anti global financial system, considered an enemy by Wallstreet, anti George Bush, a "self-hating" Jew who criticizes Israel's policy and says it is reason for rising anti-semitism who is then called anti-semite, pro public health care (not "affordable health care", but "free"), pro-science and promoter of critical thinking.

       Maybe, you know, just maybe, this is one of the billionaires in our side? His foundations, such as Global Witness, has been upsetting the corruption of the status quo for some time already. So it is no surprise he has sided with Laura, Assange and Snowden. He is using the system against itself, so it does not surprise me he is involved in this affair.

       – ie. you can't just make shit up. You dismiss it very easily, but empirical evidence is the basis of Science, Engineering, Medicine, Mathematics, in fact, most advancements in society.

        Soros gave $3 million to the Center for American Progress, $2.5 million to MoveOn.org, and $20 million[54] to America Coming Together. These groups worked to support Democrats in the 2004 election. On September 28, 2004 he dedicated more money to the campaign and kicked off his own multi-state tour with a speech: Why We Must Not Re-elect President Bush

       So he established himself as an authority, wrote 3 books telling people to PULL OUT of stocks and that CAPITALISM is bad.  Even though he made his money from capitalism, as did ALL OF US, so he's a leftist promoting the end of capitalism.  Nice, not.

       You're #3 is pointless.  Doesn't prove he is

       Wall Street, himself being a Wall Street type.
      </p>
      <p>
       His Open Society Foundation(created in 93, after the 92 Rio Earth Summit) is a globalist front, pushing the Agenda 21 initiatives in third world countries.  It funds the NGOs and non-profits that bring in the new social orders into countries that need to be "standardized" into the World Order.  This is BLATANT, if you actually do a little research, i.e. outside of WIKIPEDIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's pro-marijuana because that wins him points with the "liberals" and people who are high all the time aren't going to be violently revolting once they realized(which they
       <em>
        won't realize
       </em>
       ) that they've been had by some sneaky ass politicians.  It creates a "sub-class" of people who identify with getting high.  Those people then form a collective community that is one track minded(like the gays).  It's all about social control, but that goes over your head doesn't it?
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He's actually pro-gloabalization, which is why his foundations are funding the standardization of cities and countries worldwide.  Plus the "free" healthcare is SHIT, you don't WANT "free" healthcare, anyone who thinks that is a good idea is a complete moron.  Free healthcare = unlimited demand/limited supply = not free = higher taxes to people who actually DO SOMETHING and earn their money.

       Didn't you know that any advanced country that has a public health system is head and shoulders above the US in terms of healthcare efficiency? The US spends far more than anyone on healthcare (no 1 by a long shot!) and yet ranks 33rd in terms of life expectancy.
      </p>

       Full proof:

      <p>
       Country / Life expectancy / Health spend as % of GDP  / (Coefficient)
      </p>

       if you think its a good idea to pay nearly twice as much as Japan for a worse product, just because it comes out of your own earnings (and not your taxes!), you have misunderstood the goal of healthcare.

       By any standards, private healthcare is inefficient and is

       If I can show your incoherence just by pointing well-established facts, why should I even take my time to articulate? That is how rationality grounded on reality works. If you can't source your claims, or if you can't articulate better your ideas, you will have a hard time convincing more serious people. I would recommend to you, when defining your conspiracy theory, to pause and analyze your phrases and logic chain, otherwise it is difficult to take what you say seriously. If you kee acting like you do, you will have a really hard time trying to convey that George Soros is a greedy bastard who aims to create a globalist fascist state, when facts still show the contrary.

       You're the one that thinks that the wikipedia of a billionaire is going to be an accurate source of information, that the full picture will be conveyed.  A billionaire, I might add, that funds one of the biggest propaganda shithole sites on the web mediamatters, among others.  You're not showing any "incoherence" on my part, you're just showing your complete lack of rational thinking by copy/pasting a wikipedia article and saying "FACT".  When you have no clue.  You are trusting biased information without taking a step back and thinking, hmm, maybe this isn't the whole story, maybe this page is skewed somehow.  But, you, like all of the rest of the libtards out there, think Moveon.org is a "trustworthy" source of information and that "mediamatters" is obviously unbiased because
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       tell you they are.  riiiiight.  Keep on thinking all of those thoughts buddy, you fit right into the hivemind.

       You presented a theory without backing up facts indicating previous ill intent from Soros' organizations. Up to now, they are untarnished. You think there is foul play just because he is a billionaire. It is no different than thinking there is foul play just because he is Jew.

       You could easily find such things from Rothschilds, Bushs and Rockefellers. With Soros, I have yet to encounter anything meaningful, aside from playing with markets. And I doubt you will find anything meaningful either.

       The Soros foundations all fund Agenda 21 initiatives, which I'm positive goes over your head.  This is well established.  You must not understand fabianism or dialectical processes.  You're also blanking out the fact that Soros FUNDS socialist propaganda sites like MediaMatters, Mother Jones and Think Progress.  All 3 of these sites were essential at creating the propaganda necessary to get Obama elected.  Oh but, that's okay with you, you fucking Obamabot.

       At this point I am reserving judgement.  Like all false flags, as time goes on they begin to unravel.  That said, I do have difficulty believing the US orchestrated or originated this, and clearly they would have been in the best position to.  The US is the designated globalist bull dog, the banker police on a leash if you will, and to drag its name through the mud like this in front of the entire world seems extremely counterproductive in the long run, regardless of a desire for an international framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, the globalists have been inching ever closer to their goal of achieving a coherent global dictatorship (international regulations), so there would appear to be no need for such a dramatic and dangerous ruse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the damage to the US fedgov with their own people is not to be discounted, and certainly would have been factored into this equation.  Snowden literally drew the curtain back and showed his fellow citizens the bald guy behind it yanking down on ropes and pressing buttons.  I fail to see how that would ever have been part of a plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing, scripted events usually show the government as capable and on point, at least, after the event.  We appear anything but that right now.  Remember, an ancillary purpose of staged events is to reinforce the power of the government to handle whatever problem is encountered...if not, the people might loose faith.

       They're creating a dichotomy.  They need to separate the world powers in order to enable a dialectical opposition to emerge, that is how big changes are made.

       of those, more than likely a collusion of all.  The whole "Bolivian plane diverted" story was bogus as well, try and find the audio recordings from the plane communicating with the air traffic controller, the pilot requests a landing because of a "fuel gauge" issue.

       They're not, in this context however they're used as doublespeak.  The "free press" organization is a globalist funded NGO full of MSM people.  The "human rights" organization is an NGO funded by the SAME people.  The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights states in one of the last articles that all of those rights can be voided if you oppose the UN.  Meaning that they have the final say in what "rights" you get.  Here's the link:
       <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a29">
        http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a29
       </a>
       Read Article 29 section 3:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (3) These rights and freedoms may in no case
        <em>
         be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Meaning that you cannot speak out against the UN, or if the UN deems one of their principles is to say, take all of your money(which it is), you have no right to protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn how doublespeak works.  Like how the "Patriot Act" is used to
       <em>
        target
       </em>
       patriots.  Or how the "No child left behind" actually stunts ALL children's educations, etc etc.  The globalists use doublespeak to fool people, it's blatant dude.

       You've grossly misunderstood the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – by focusing on a sentence that you obviously don't understand. BTW, I missed the article in there that says 'we're coming to take your money'. I would go back and do some more reading on this document, (it's long, but worth it!).

       You've also misunderstood Orwell's idea of doublespeak. The fact that a press freedom organization has people who work in the media is not the definition of doublespeak. I would go back and read 1984 if I were you. Whilst you're at it, an essay called 'Politics and The English Language' would help you provide some clarity to your arguments.

       If you show me how free press organizations are working to stifle the press, I would take you seriously – but you can't, and you won't, so I can't take you seriously.

       Your skull is thick.  VERY thick.  The people are working for MAINSTREAM press, the Freedom of the Press Foundation is funded by the leftist propaganda rag Mother Jones, which is George Soros funded. George Soros being one of the biggest advocates of global fascistic government under the UN, he runs the RIIA, which was started by the Fabian Socialists.  Mother Jones is openly left wing and openly globalist, they denounce "9/11 truthers" as nutjobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're still stuck on the fact that they call themselves FREE PRESS anything, that
       <em>
        IS
       </em>
       the doublespeak.  You say you're one thing, but you're the opposite.  They're running disinfo and propaganda, I'd say that's opposite of what the "free press" purports to be.  But see, you're so thick skulled, this won't make it past that shiny veneer around your brain.

       Anti-Semitism?  Now you're just trolling.  You completely ignore the FACT that Soros is head of the Royal Institute for International Affairs, whose goal is to set up a global government under the United Nations, they fucking CREATED the UN.  You're just one of those fucking morons who believes the Guardian and MSNBC because you agree with them all while saying the "free press" foundations associated with them are somehow working to make the press "free".  You don't see the underlying purpose of organizations like this.  You don't understand FABIANISM.  How the deception works.  You've fallen for the shiny veneer without pondering the consequences of what is being pushed.  The whole point of these leftist, Soros funded, organizations, is to legitimize anti-American sentiment.  It's not America that is bad, it's the people in control of America.  The system is good, it has been taken over by a criminal organization and is being used for evil.  The whole point of this is to throw out the constitution and bring about world government under the UN global governance structures, under the guise of "peace".

       If I wanted to prove this to
       <em>
        you

       , I could.  I don't want to expend the time or the effort in doing so.  It's not hard, but I can see you've not even stepped into the realm of critical thinking or skeptical arguments to the "official" story.  If this Snowden thing was
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       for real, it would NOT be on the news.  Read some books on how propaganda works on the techniques of meeting an end using a dialectical method.  Ah, but, I'm "anti-semetic" evidently.  Riiiiight.  Fucking idiot.

       I'm Jewish and I've come to grips with the fact that it is mainly Zionists that are trying to destroy the world--it's not "anti-semitism" unfortunately. OR my imagination. Take a look at Israel today and you'll see where America will be at in ten years--but the "Israelis" will be the leaders and us "99%" will be the Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a sad time for me and LOTS of other Jews in the world when the truth has become anti-semitic. I'm sick of being bunched in with the rest of these assholes hell-bent on ruling the planet--that is NOT what Judiasm is all about.

       In complete agreement with you that Zionism is dangerous, and that Israel's actions frequently do nothing to help the global perception of Jews...

      <p>
       Sorry if I incorrectly lumped you in with anti-semites, but it's important to make the distinction between anti-zionism and anti-semitism – if your arguments aren't precise, they sound a lot like anti-jewish arguments.
      </p>

       Well, there you go.

       I've been saying since it happened that the Snowden thing was staged and just a cover-up for something else. When I read yesterday that there is a man trying to gain Swiss asylum because he exposed a nuclear terror attack in the US I had to wonder--WHY in hell does SNOWDEN get the attention???
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it becomes a bit clearer. I knew that Snowden was a red herring at best.

       "The process is simple. On our website, you can donate to as many as four journalism and transparency organizations at once. We’ll feature a “bundle” of four organizations and provide a bit of background on each. Every two months we will release a new bundle of deserving organizations or individuals. Once you enter the total amount you wish to donate, you can use the sliders to determine the percentage you want each entity to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also donate directly to the Freedom of the Press Foundation to help further our mission. Twice a year, we will distribute a grant to projects our Board of Directors has vetted and selected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freedom of the Press Foundation takes 8% from each donation for operational costs."
      </p>
      <p>
       This means anyone can donate and they probably got hundreds of donors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother Jones is a non profit organization and functions by donations, which George Soros and anyone else is free to donate, I have no doubt that a leftist like Soros would fund a leftist propaganda machines, that doesn't mean these leftist people love being spied on and civil liberties destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have two flimsy connection from non profit organizations which one took some donations from Soros. I mean you can claim easier that unicorns exist and probably you would be able to find more circumstantial "evidence".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how this is staged, and I don't think how exactly from these leaks there will be regulations. I mean they already have all the regulations, they already control the internet, they already have the kill switches.
      </p>
      <p>
       They own the internet already, this exposure can only hurt them.

       Combine this with the deception about Evo Morales's plane being forced down, and is it possible that the Russians and South American leaders are part of this plan? Of course they are. A world government will benefit these powerful leaders and their friends, whether their populations benefit or not.

       And listen to and support the No Agenda podcast, seriously! Adam Curry and John C Dvorak would be helpful to many in r/conspiracy who need a little analysis to help sift through all the junk out there.

       No Agenda is entertaining, sometimes they come up with very well done research, like this, sometimes they're a little off in their analysis.  But it's worth listening to if you have 2 1/2 hours to kill.

       Good insights. Thanks and Fuck this makes perfect sense.

       Last year during the WCIT-12, the
       <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/dec/14/telecoms-treaty-internet-unregulated">
        ITU and the UN, tried to pass a bill on regulating the internet, they failed due to mainly US/UK resistance.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The proposals, coming after two weeks of complex negotiation, would have given individual governments greater powers to control international phone calls and data traffic, but were opposed as the conference had seemed to be drawing to a close late on Thursday.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Russia, China, Iran, Dubai and others were on the table vying for this measure while the US and UK against. Many then claimed that US/UK resistance was since the Americans already had total irrestricted oversight over global internet networks (what would come to be known as PRISM). Iran later (beginning 2013) just initiated its own internet, isolated from the global American controlled network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with Mr. Snoweden's allegations, there might be a shift in public opinion, swaying against US/UK controlled-"open and free"-internet, into one favoring the competing proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR: Snowden's leak were meant to sway public into opinion favoring changes to the internet proposed by Iran, China, Russia that failed during the
