    <div class="md"><p>Democracy, if not properly understood and practiced, causes elections to act as placebo pills at the social level.  What has prevented an &quot;awaking&quot; as you put it, is our two party system.  You pick one of two sides, and whatever is going wrong in our country you just blame on the other side, all the while telling yourself you&#39;re fighting the good fight by voting for your side every election.  </p>

<p>The idea that the two sides are doing anything more than playing &quot;good cop, bad cop&quot; is an illusion, be sure, but it&#39;s a very thorough and pervasive one when you consider the nature of our mainstream news...&quot;And now!...we bring you BOTH sides of the story...&quot;...well I&#39;m sorry, I was unaware there are only two sides.  As it so happens, neither side seems to quite represent my views and opinions on the subject.  </p>

<p>But...sadly, when you have an entire society of people who were born and raised in an environment that didn&#39;t facilitate the kind of critical thinking required to debunk the &quot;two sides only&quot; farce, it is EXTREMELY difficult for those same people to even fathom that a different way could be possible, let alone engage in a process to facilitate that change.  But I think (can&#39;t stress enough that I only THINK this to be the case), that I&#39;m starting to notice small signs that the &quot;awaking&quot; you talk about is starting to occur. It&#39;s so slight and subtle that, sitting in America, I have to keep asking myself, &quot;Who am I kidding?&quot;...so I can see why you felt the need to even ask the question. </p>

<p>I could be wrong about you in particular, but I get the sense that most people outside this country were expecting to see something along the lines of what was seen in Greece and Egypt.  I&#39;ve never really understood that, to be perfectly honest.  I remember when the first Egyptian revolution occurred, and all over Reddit I saw so many people support the protests almost with the attitude, &quot;A protest!?  Awesome! I mean, you HAVE to support the people in a protest...right? If you can&#39;t support a protest then what can you support...and if you don&#39;t support the protest then you&#39;re part of the problem&quot;...well, I&#39;ll just be frank, I&#39;ll support a plan before I support a protest...a plan for what happens after the protest/ revolution to be exact.</p>

<p>I can see it now...We march to D.C., fight through the batons, through the tear gas, climb over the fence, and up the steps at Capitol Hill.  And once we&#39;re there, all proud of ourselves, we just kinda...look around at each other, scratching our heads, and asking ourselves, &quot;Well...now what?&quot;.</p>

<p>Just look at what happened in Egypt.  Undoubtedly the majority of people involved were genuine in their motivations, willing to sacrifice so much for what they saw as the right thing...and yet look at what they got.  There he was, the guy who was all too ready to take charge, and made all the right promises at all the right times to all the right people to make sure everyone was happy with him...at first...and then, finally, it was time to do what he really wanted and here we are again. I really hope that something good comes out of this the second time around, I really do, but I&#39;m not going to hold my breath either.  </p>

<p>My last point is this: My country, America, has been so divided, so deeply, and in so many ways, that I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re ready at the moment to &quot;take back&quot; our government.  I want it to happen, but that would require a kind of unity we haven&#39;t seen in our society for so long that I actually think we&#39;d rather die than unite instead of uniting not to die.  </p>

<p>So I said earlier that I THINK I&#39;m starting to see signs of a changing tide, I don&#39;t know how it will all add up or what it means, but I hope it leads to real and lasting social unity on at least (maybe only) the most basic of things, because I truly believe that without that we&#39;ll never be able to throw off the bonds of a criminal government like what you&#39;re asking about.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s almost like the people have been anesthetized and hypotized by drugs, video games and consumer media (and possibly other, harder to prove, things like something in the water or the air).  A lot of the problem is apathy-- as long as people have a few basic needs and indulgences and outlets for their energies, it&#39;s amazing what else can be taken from them without them being arsed to act.  I suspect that if the supermarket shelves were to run dry, or if it gets to the point where enough people do not have access to food, water and basic sanitation, then the situation may change.</p>

<p>Good read, thanks for responding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is some truth to this-- even as far back as Jefferson there was recognition that the elite wealthy class was threatened by America&#39;s democratic institutions.  However, I think it&#39;s fair to say that the government was more-or-less functioning properly throughout the 19th century, and that it wasn&#39;t until the 20th century with the creation of the federal reserve and the CIA that democracy in America was effectively rendered impotent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes but maybe it had been planned long before the federal reserve and cia happened. Just as letters from Freemasons 200 years old talking about the 3 world wars.

    <div class="md"><p>My heart tells me we can still do something about this and that we can all be patriots and stand up for our country and actually have some fucking balls and try do something about it. I mean, we&#39;re fucking Americans, we&#39;re supposed to be the most free country on the planet. We&#39;re supposed to have a press who reports on what&#39;s really going on. We&#39;re supposed to have constitutional rights that protect us from unfair search and seizure. We&#39;re supposed to have the right to a fair trial and jury. But shit like the NDAA gets signed, the TSA does all their bogus shit, the NSA reads all our emails and records all our calls!! And nobody bats a fucking eye.</p>

<p>My heart thinks we <em>could</em> but my brain tells me otherwise. Do you know how little people are interested in learning about this shit? Nobody wants to hear it, ignorance is bliss. I mean of course they never looked into anything in detail or tried to learn about it, but me and many others who spend hours trying to do something and educate people come off as &#39;crazy&#39;. </p>

<p>We were brainwashed. So much American propaganda being pushed down our throats that we&#39;re the &#39;good guys&#39; and we&#39;ve always come in to save the day or at least try to that most people can&#39;t even look at it from the other side.</p>

<p>The only way is if an &#39;event&#39; happens. Meaning the government reallyyy has to fuck up big time. i mean, I thought the whole NSA and Snowden blowing the lid off it was going to do something. I thought it would start  a movement. Nope. Who cares? I still have my iPhone with Vine and IG and my social media. I&#39;m free. You&#39;re crazy. Nothing is wrong. Obama is good. Bush was the shitty president. Democrats and Republicans ARE different. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will never happen. Wallstreet knows that it cant do certain things that create mass rioting. They give the people just enough to get by and then provide them heaps of propatainment to playcate them. The most important problem though is that the majority of Americans are totally cluses about government/politics. I took a history class at a community college and the professor asked what type of government the US has, I was the ONLY person in a class of 40 that knew the answer. Another example is that no one knew the definition of democracy, they all thought it was the ideology of Democrats. </p>
