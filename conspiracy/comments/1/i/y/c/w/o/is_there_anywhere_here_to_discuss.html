    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of us here who do hold the truths you mentioned to be self evident, and occasionally we break through the hivemind to have discussions about it. Mostly, though, this subreddit sticks to what we have evidence for. I think over at godlikeproductions they are deeply vested into the quasi-religious aspects of the NWO, however that forum is filled with disinfo and shills so be wary.</p>

<p>I believe that the dark powers that have aligned for our enslavement are at the top of the conspiracy pyramid, if you will. It is from the reality in which they exist that all directives are issued, down to the very bottom of the pyramid where we currently are. As our consciousness ascends (naturally and with esoteric thought and practice) we move up the pyramid, willing to confront more and more horrible truths along the way. Whether it be the &quot;Illuminati&quot; or reptile aliens who reside at the apex, it makes little difference to me, because a lot of what we know is purely disinformation fed to us by gatekeepers of knowledge operating on behalf of TPTB. (I&#39;m looking at you, Icke) It is just another form of divide and conquer, to keep some of us zigging while others are zagging; meanwhile, the forces of opposition are working together to further their goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this. I know that bringing up esoteric/occultist themes into discussion tends to polarize participants, but as often stated, it shouldn&#39;t be taken as an admittance of belief by those bringing it up, but rather as acceptance of another piece of data. Yeah, it might all be supertitious smoke and mirrors, just choreography of old rites designed to create a team spirit on participants and have no basis on reality, BUT if those wiielding power believe in all that and USE it to keep the rest of us under their heel we should know about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have read through it a few times, but personally I believe that interview to either be disinformation or someone trolling. </p>

<p>I draw inspiration from my own personal spiritual beliefs (which are constantly changing as my perception of reality changes) and incorporate those thoughts into the great conspiracy pyramid. Esoteric spirituality has existed for longer than my mind is able to fathom, and I find that a majority of it resonates within me as truth. As science is still unable to answer the fundamental philosophical questions regarding our human existence (Who am I, Am I real, Why am I here, What is my purpose, Why am I conscious when 99% of what I know is not conscious) we must be vigilant to never settle for a half-truth such as modern religion. Each and every eternal soul trapped in <em>samsara</em> on this wonderful planet is experiencing a journey of transcendence to the next phase, wherever that leads us. But the beauty of this journey is that you will reach the end no matter what path you take. The end will certainly be a reflection of the beginning - is this not the way of the cosmos? As above, so below. So I choose to take the path less traveled - a path of humility and kindness, in the hopes that I may inspire those around me filled with suffering to simply <em>let go</em> of &quot;the devil within&quot; that hounds humanity at each and every corner, an enemy within our own mind.  This is my true foe - not the Luciferians controlling this reality, nor the dark powers present in other dimensions - but the darkness I contain within my own soul.</p>

I just wanted to see if anyone knew anything about him, I wasn&#39;t looking to start a witch hunt. I just thought there might be some Rosemary&#39;s Baby type connection, especially considering that July 20-26 is a Satanic preparation time for the Grand Climax on the 27th (according to what I&#39;ve found). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say anything and everything having to do with Alex Jones/infowars.com/prisonplanet.com is exactly what you are looking for as Jones believes (or at least says he does) that this is the force behind everything and that is the end game for the powers that be.</p>

<p>George Noory, the host of coasttocoastam radio show and website is pretty much in this camp also as he is an ex-navy, pro-military, jingoistic American, anti-Obama, fervent Christian. If you can picture someone from fox news but they believe in ufos, satanism, and <del>witchcraft</del> psychic powers/numerology that&#39;s him. </p>

<p>David Icke also believes there&#39;s a satanic cult taking over the world but in his case they are psychic shapeshifting lizard-people who take human form and occupy positions of social and political power to control people and feed off of their souls/psychic energy (because they are energy vampires, too). So... satanic psychic shapeshifting energy vampire alien lizard people.</p>

<p>So there are many flavors to choose from, take your pick. As far as on reddit I don&#39;t know, but maybe there&#39;s an Alex Jones or coasttocoastam subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lucifer is not &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. It simply is. The universe does not communicate in a language that we can comprehend, so why do we attempt to categorize its denizens as being in line with our morals?</p>

<p>For me, Lucifer exists within. It is the dark, powerful, chaotic, creative, beautiful and terrifying force that lurks within my consciousness at all times on this planet. And it seeks to bring me into a state of disharmony, upturning the careful and poised balance of &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; that I seek within myself. And I believe there is a force out there that opposes Lucifer - although not in the way that most would suspect. It, like Lucifer, is neither &quot;good&quot; nor &quot;evil&quot;. It simply is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Do what thou will&quot; is most often the creed of those who aim to serve Lucifer, as you said. Inherently, this outlook on life is not &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; - much like Lucifer itself. It is a conscious decision that we as mortal beings must make, whether we use our inherent power for positivity or negativity.</p>

<p>I believe that balance is the key to our spiritual ascension and physical happiness. We cannot exist as a whole without first being comprised of a multitude of parts, and not all of those parts will be exactly the same. </p>

<p>There is no &quot;God&quot; in the heavens above who will absolve us of our mortal sins, just as there is no &quot;Devil&quot; below who will punish us for our transgressions. These two entities exist <em>within</em> our consciousness, and at the end of our journey the only being who will judge us is ourselves.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening. It isn&#39;t often that I find the voice to express my thoughts, and even more rarely is there anyone listening at the other end. :]</p>

<p>Worship the &quot;Devil&quot; ? No. No such thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is required for worship of a devil? The belief, or does a goat have to talk you into a contract? </p>

<p>They have minds that can delude themselves into thinking they worship a non-existent deity. That doesn&#39;t mean that the devil exists (or doesn&#39;t), it just means they (probably) think it does. The knowledge of that psychological crutch could be useful when dealing with people who believe in that form of worship.</p>

<p>For that reason, it is important to understand the context of their actions with that belief system in place, no matter how fantastic or ridiculous it may be. It provides a plausible perspective to &#39;why&#39; such an action would be taken.</p>

<p>Still, it is not necessary to have that backdrop on the situation to understand the dastardly actions of &quot;certain groups.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to believe lucifer got a lot of bad PR due to gods displeasure with him. Do what is best for you, due what makes you happy, is that not what lucifer is about? What happens if what is good and best for you is helping others? Hard to tell how evil he is sometimes... Though I do believe you could use his favor gained for ill. But hey, those are just some thoughts I been kicking around, and not my personal dogma...
Thanks for your response, I enjoyed your out look and opinion. </p>
