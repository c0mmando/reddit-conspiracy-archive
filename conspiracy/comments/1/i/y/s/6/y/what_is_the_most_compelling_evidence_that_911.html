    <div class="md"><p>This is not personally directed against your commentary, but I have a problem with the whole «some guys in a cave» thing. The man was one of the heir of a billionaire family. He had complete financial support from the Saudi religious charities present in Pachtounistan. His brigades received logistical and strategic support as well as training from the Pakistani secret services. In many ways, he had the upper hand over the Afghan government of the time.
There were attempts by the U.S to kill Bin Laden before 2001, including a missile strike. They all failed.
And while the Tora Bora complex was not the underground fortress it was made out to be, it was definitly not your usual cave.</p>

<p>Al-Qaida had already hijacked planes, had already bombed U.S. buildings, and had already attacked the WTC. 2 days before 9/11, it had successfully killed the most efficient leader of the Northern Alliance. It is one thing to poke holes in the official story. But to insinuate that Al-Qaida could not have carried out the 9/11 attack is another thing entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the collapse of WTC 7, there&#39;s not a lot of images showing the damage to the side that got hit by debris from the collapse of the twin towers, but the damage was quite extensive.</p>

<p>As you can see from this video, there is a lot of damage to the area around the towers, and at least a half dozen floors of WTC7 were hit with enough force to throw debris out the other side of the building and catch the entire floors on fire.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukO3hENZ9zA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukO3hENZ9zA</a></p>

<p>(You can skip to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukO3hENZ9zA&amp;amp;t=02m38s">2:38</a> to see the damage to WTC7 from debris.)</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t buy into the idea of the WTC collapse being mysterious, because you can see from this video that there is extensive damage- enough that the firefighters were observing the building start to develop a bulge and decided to evacuate hours before it collapsed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NIST report isn&#39;t perfect, and there are going to be some inaccuracies in it.</p>

<p>However, most of the WTC7 videos that I&#39;ve seen show the building from an angle where the damage (and fires) are not able to be seen. What the videos show is what appears to be a largely undamaged building imploding on itself.</p>

<p>The point of me posting the video I did was to show that A) There was a lot more damage than most WTC7 collapse videos show and B) There were at <em>least</em> six stories of WTC7 that were completely on fire and burned un-checked for hours before the building collapsed. (I believe the firemen were called off at 2 PM, which would be about 3 1/2 hours before the building collapsed.)</p>

<p>Also, if you look at the structure of the building, the majority of the weight was placed on three support columns. If you watch the entire video of the collapse, you can see the east penthouse collapse first (indicating that one of the three support columns failed) and then about eight seconds later the rest of the building collapsed, which would indicate the failure of the last two support columns which couldn&#39;t support the weight on their own.</p>

<p>Was this collapse caused by the initial damage? Probably not, or the building would have fallen a lot sooner. Was it caused by the weakening of the support columns after being subjected to extremely high heat for several hours? Quite plausible.</p>

<p>The question remains, though- which is the more likely explanation: A) Demolitions were set up in the twin towers so that they could be brought down, however, they also planned on having one of the towers collapse in a way that it hit a nearby building that had <em>also</em> been rigged with demolitions so they could blow that up later as well, or B) The NIST explanation, while not perfect, is much closer to what actually happened- plane hits building, building burns and falls down and catches another building on fire which later falls due to weakening of the support structures from prolonged exposure to fire?</p>

<p>Sounds reasonable until you take into account eight stories of free fall, 20 minute fuel loads in any given area, destruction of evidence.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, though, a building is surrounded by structures that must be preserved. In this case, the blasters proceed with a true implosion, demolishing the building so that it collapses straight down into its own footprint (the total area at the base of the building). This feat requires such skill that only a handful of demolition companies in the world will attempt it. &quot;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I am by no means an expert on the subject. (My experience with building infrastructure is limited to the courses I took in Statics and the few architecture students I tutored through their Structures class.)</p>

<p>However, looking into how the building was designed, practically all of the weight beyond the first eight (or so) stories was held up by three support columns. Once the first fell, the other two couldn&#39;t support the weight and it fell.</p>

<p>If you look at the video I linked, you can see the amounts of devastation at ground zero between the time of the twin towers collapse and the collapse of WTC7, as well as the raging fire that was engulfing at least six stories of the building.</p>

<p>Saying that it was brought down by controlled demolitions actually ups the ante for that claim in this case, because not only would the crew that set up the demolitions have to have done this unnoticed, but they would have had to have done it in such a way that the detonation mechanisms would have been able to withstand several hours of intense fires and still be able to fire with clockwork precision.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry- saying that WTC7 was brought down by controlled demolitions is just too much of a stretch for me. When I look at the damage to the building and the devastation on the street, as well as how the building fell (penthouse first, then eight seconds later the rest of the building) the most plausible explanation is that the main support structures were weakened by fire and failed sequentially.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>When the bulk of a 40-someodd story building is supported by three columns that are centrally located, I don&#39;t see how this type of collapse is unexpected in the case of sequential failure of the three main support columns.</p>

<p>Pure speculation.  </p>

<p>Free fall is free fall. No resistance for eight floors. Should this be explained in a satisfactory manner?  </p>

<p>How can it be plausible if fires around the main support structures had to burn out in 20 or 30 minutes? It&#39;s called fuel load. You think you could toss one of the building seven support columns on a hydrocarbon fire, in your backyard, and have it bend or buckle? How about if it was supported by crossbeams and a 5 inch concrete floor? Not likely.   </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call that pure speculation. The fire crew left hours before the collapse and the building was still on fire when it collapsed- this is a matter of record- so if it was controlled demolitions, the setup would have had to have survived those hours of fire and still be able to bring down the building.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Everything over the first eight floors was supported by three main columns. If those collapsed, why wouldn&#39;t there be an eight story free fall? How is the collapse of the support structures by weakening by fire going to look any different than them being blown by explosives? The result is the same- supporting structures gone in an instant and the building collapsed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Videos of the WTC7 collapse clearly show it still on fire <em>hours</em> after the initial impact. This is a little more than a 20-30 minute burnout.</p>

<p>There is a distinct lack of video footage of the damage to WTC7 between the time the twin towers fell and the time WTC7 actually fell. If you look at the video I posted, you can clearly see at least six stories of the building on fire. This lasted for several hours.</p>

<p>The question I have for anyone who claims that it was brought down by controlled demolitions is this: &quot;What explosive is capable of being in a raging fire for several hours and still have enough explosive capability left to adequately perform the function of bringing down a building?&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah but that&#39;s the fires <em>moving around</em> (only horizontal, only for 20 minutes). A bit of research and you&#39;ll find the ratings for the individual components was 2-3 hours, a bit more research and you&#39;ll find the fires in the area NIST claims the buckling happened burnt themselves out before the collapse. Search further and you&#39;ll find NIST didn&#39;t use wtc7 <em>photos</em> as model inputs. Search further and you&#39;ll find NIST didn&#39;t do any physical test for the mechanisms they proposed (five years for the final report to be finished) and used computer simulations exclusively. Further and you&#39;ll find NIST didn&#39;t do the recommended in-depth study on &quot;perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the
investigation.” (NYT) <em>sulfidation</em>  FEMA recommended. The list goes on and on.  </p>

<p>In light of the advancements in weapon technology some type of &quot;hardened&quot; case doesn&#39;t seem that radical. </p>

<p>The explosive charges used to bring down the Landmark Tower weighed only 364 pounds, consisting of 198 pounds of 60-percent nitroglycerine-based gel in 1-1/4 inch sticks, and 166 pounds of RDX (a C-4 derivative).   <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060508085654/http://www.acppubs.com/article/CA6325450.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20060508085654/http://www.acppubs.com/article/CA6325450.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every video I&#39;ve every seen where they interview a demolitions expert, the guy talks about the months of prep-work that need to be done in order to demo a building and the massive number of man-hours and the number of people required to do this kind of job. The video then concludes that... it must have been controlled demolitions somehow?</p>

<p>The collapse of the buildings are going to appear strange to a lot of people- but keep in mind that this is <em>literally</em> the only time in human history that this has occurred. There is no frame of reference as to what skyscrapers should look like when they collapse after being hit by planes and burning for hours. Or in the case of WTC 7, hit by flaming debris from a collapsing skyscraper and then subsequently being on fire for several hours.</p>

<p>Yeah but that&#39;s the fires moving around (only horizontal, only for 20 minutes). A bit of research and you&#39;ll find the ratings for the individual components was 2-3 hours, a bit more research and you&#39;ll find the fires in the area NIST claims the buckling happened burnt themselves out before the collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_qa_082108.cfm">NIST factsheet on WTC 7</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Sept. 11, 2001, WTC 7 endured fires for <em>almost seven hours</em>, from the time of the collapse of the north WTC tower (WTC 1) at 10:28:22 a.m. until 5:20:52 p.m., when WTC 7 collapsed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s longer than the 2-3 hours the components were rated for and a damn sight longer than 20 minutes.</p>

<p>The collapse was largely due to thermal expansion of beams that weakened and then broke important contact points. These supports were designed to withstand gravitational (vertical) forces and not with the intention of withstanding the horizontal forces from the expansion of the beams.</p>

<p>So either the fires burning for several hours caused the building&#39;s supports to fail one by one until it could no longer stand, or some secret agency smuggled in hundreds of pounds of explosives and strapped them to building columns without anybody noticing, and then managed to detonate them without leaving any indications of an explosion of sufficient force to bring down the buildings.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;m going to go with the fire explanation.</p>

<p>Dec. 12 2007 Advisory Meeting  </p>

<p>Q: (Thorton)<br/>
&quot;...fire moved every 20 minutes; essentially it started and stopped every 20 minutes, so if you do not have fuel in WTC7, how could fires burn for as long as they had and taken out this major structure that had good fireproofing?&quot;  </p>

<p>A: (Sunder)   </p>

<p>&quot;The fires moved from location to location, meaning that at any given location the combustibles needed about 20 minutes to be consumed. While the combustibles at a location were being consumed, the fire front would be progressing to adjacent combustibles.&quot;   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think <a href="http://imgur.com/FwxR3nL">this fire protected beam</a> was heated by a 20 minute fire enough to be pushed off it&#39;s seat and buckle.   </p>

<p>“The explosive charges used to bring down the Landmark Tower [380 ft tall, 30 stories] weighed only 364 pounds&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The demolitions permits were acquired in October of 2005 and the building was imploded on March 18, 2006. Even if that entire time wasn&#39;t used to rig explosives, we are looking at a <em>lot</em> of work and planning to bring down a 30 story building. The process also involved gutting a lot of the minor load-bearing beams and installing other temporary wooden structures to ensure that it fell in the right direction. Imploding a building into its own footprint takes a bit more work than just taking out key support columns.</p>

<p>Second- demolitions explosives are very loud. On the same order of magnitude of a jet engine taking off. Nothing remotely this loud is heard on any of the audio from that day. Maybe thermite might have done the job, but that would require around 100 lbs per support beam they were taking out.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Can you provide a source for that? I&#39;ve seen no reputable source that demonstrates that the fire could not move from one floor to another. In fact, all of the reports I&#39;ve read show that once a certain point had been reached, the ceilings would collapse and the heated air would move onto the next portion of the building and ignite that part.</p>

<p>What I see when I look at the available evidence is at least half a dozen floors of the building on fire with no attempts to check the fire and no water available for the fire suppression systems on the burning floors. (The upper floors had tanks of water that were available for fire suppression on those floors, but both the primary and backup fire suppression systems were reliant on a water main that was ruptured by the collapse of the twin towers.) These fires continued unchecked for around seven hours, which is more than sufficient to expand metal and cause major load-bearing points to break. Keep in mind that once the first one goes, it&#39;s that much easier for the next one to go.</p>

<p>There are just too many problems with the controlled demolition hypothesis. How did the charges get rigged without anyone noticing? If the twin towers fell from controlled demolitions as well, then how did they know it was going to catch fire? If they didn&#39;t know this, what was the plan at that point? Were they going to just let it stand and then move the explosives out before anyone would notice? Or did they install incendiary devices to start the fires, further risking people noticing what they were doing? Why take down WTC 7? Wouldn&#39;t taking down the twin towers be sufficient?</p>

<p>Using Occam&#39;s razor, the correct explanation is likely to be that the building caught fire after having a burning building fall on it and then it later collapsed due to those fires.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, if you read the full NIST report it&#39;s not just the fire that caused it to walk off it&#39;s base. </p>

<p>There were a number of support columns, all designed to primarily counteract vertical forces but not intended to counteract horizontal forces (like wind or thermal expansion.) So you have a number of columns with a minimal resistance to horizontal forces that are being subjected to the horizontal force caused by thermal expansion. As each column fails and its resistance to horizontal force is reduced to zero, that force is then spread out to the remaining surviving supports.</p>

<p>So it was a bit more than fire. The firefighters evacuated the building hours before it collapsed because they heard audible creaking in the building and noticed a bulge developing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>points? One column -&gt; Column 79. The evidence suggests that on the 12th floor the fires around the beam had come and gone an hour before the collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above. Again- the supports were not designed to be subjected to excessive horizontal forces. The NIST report indicates a slow process that happened over seven hours of the fire burning uncontrolled. Keep in mind that nobody was able to actually go into the building and see how much damage had already occurred at that point, so we do not know the extent of damage/shifting had already occurred during the thermal expansion phase.</p>

<p>Despite this lack of certainty in the data, this does not mean that it <em>had</em> to be explosives or controlled demolitions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe not? The Thermite found points toward some advanced explosives.</p>

<p>An interesting paper. I&#39;d not read it before, however there are a few red flags. (Note- I&#39;m not dismissing it out of hand, just pointing out a few things that make me pause when reading their conclusions.) Most notably is that they state that this residue they tested does not appear in the remnants of any known building that has been taken down by conventional demolitions. Now while this <em>may</em> mean that unconventional demolitions were used, it does not <em>prove</em> it.</p>

<p>Second, the paper makes no attempts whatsoever to disprove its claims by putting forth alternative hypotheses and testing those. They never investigated any other possible sources of the powder, such as a large amount of iron, aluminum, silicon and carbon being subjected to prolonged heat and then a sudden massive amount of pressure and kinetic energy.</p>

<p>Also their conclusions are rather, how to put this, weak. They found rust and aluminum in the residue of a building that contained massive amounts of steel (which is primarily iron) and aluminum. I don&#39;t see how this is conclusive.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also spent a considerably amount of time in the scientific community, and I&#39;ve read literally thousands of scientific articles and contributed to a few as well. There are certain journals that are more reputable than others and <em>The Open Physics Journal</em> does not have the most sterling reputation for integrity. I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s necessarily wrong, but it doesn&#39;t exactly have the best reputation for being accurate. I know it sounds like I&#39;m attacking the source, but you have to keep in mind that in the scientific community, results have to be repeatable and a journal that develops a reputation for publishing unrepeatable results is not going to be exactly trusted no matter what it publishes.</p>

<p>(On a side note- the editor of that journal resigned in protest after that paper was published.)</p>

<p>But if that paper was submitted to me back in my TA days, in that format, on any subject, with those experimental results: I&#39;d make them re-write the paper. It&#39;s pretty crap.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d agree that general complacency after 9/11 and the &quot;protect us at all costs&quot; herd mentality was bad- what with the Patriot Act passing without any discussion. However, given the evidence at the time (planes hit buildings, buildings fall down damaging a nearby building that later falls down after being on fire for hours) there really wasn&#39;t any reason to suspect that there were controlled demolitions.</p>

<p>The Challenger investigation is rather interesting, but not really related to the WTC 7 collapse. (I&#39;d have loved to have seen what Feynman had to say about WTC 7, but that&#39;s beside the point.) The main thing that they found in the Rogers Commission Report was that the safety of the space shuttle was vastly overrated. The administration stated that the chance of catastrophic failure was about 1 in 100,000 while the actual chance was closer to 1 in 100. Feynman famously showed that the o-rings were way less reliable than claimed by soaking one in a glass of ice water and showing that it completely lost its ability to do what an 0-ring does.</p>

<p>That and the fact that one report showed an o-ring cracked 1/3 of the way through and they wrote it down as having a safety factor of 3, which is completely wrong. (It cracked- it failed. The safety factor in that test condition is zero.)</p>

<p>There are a lot of gaps in the data, which is almost always the case in anything scientific- due to uncertainties and the like. However, this is not evidence that the buildings were taken down by conventional explosives. In addition, there is absolutely no evidence <em>for</em> the use of controlled demolitions, and the logistics of bringing down three buildings in the middle of one of the most populous areas of the world using controlled demolitions without one single person coming forward with actual proof?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think anyone is that competent, let alone our government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m... not sure exactly where you were planning on going with this.</p>

<p>Perhaps some things got lost in the editing, but let me reiterate a few points.</p>

<p>First of all, Bentham Publishing has a less than sterling reputation. In spite of that, the paper that you linked to was not thorough at all in that it started with a single assumption, ignored any evidence to the contrary, and worst of all used the fact that their own data didn&#39;t support their hypothesis to somehow claim their hypothesis was valid. I am referring specifically to the part of their paper where they stated that no residue like the one they tested was found in any building brought down by controlled demolitions and their conclusion was that the building must have been brought down with demolitions that have somehow never been reported ever in the scientific literature. The paper was very poorly written, starting with an assumption and then only showed evidence that it claimed supported that assumption. At no point did it ever attempt to investigate other possible explanations for what was observed, which is shoddy science. The only thing they proved was that a building that had a lot of steel (of which iron is a major component) and aluminum in it collapsed and they found a material that had rust (iron oxide) and aluminum in it that burned when subjected to high heat. This isn&#39;t exactly proof of anything other than that the building had steel and aluminum in it. They also fail to cite any sources that show that this particular compound has been described anywhere in the literature.</p>

<p>I am not trying to find proof that it&#39;s not possible, merely looking at the evidence that is available and asking what is the most likely scenario here.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence that WTC 7 was hit by debris from the collapse of the twin towers. This is indisputable. There are numerous records of the emergency responders on the ground stating that WTC 7 had massive fires in it and they were afraid it would fall over. Numerous reports of creaking in the building. Numerous reports of the building developing a noticeable bulge in it. Hell, they even had devices set up to measure how far it was leaning prior to its collapse that showed it was definitely starting to lean over. The rescue crews were pulled back because of fears that it would collapse.</p>

<p>The facts: The fire crews were concerned that it would fall over. They had no way to combat the flames. The fire crews were pulled back and it fell over.</p>

<p>So what am I to believe? That the fire and damage caused it to fall or that somehow controlled demolitions were snuck in without anybody noticing on both of the twin towers and WTC 7. But just those three buildings. Wouldn&#39;t want to take down any of the other buildings- that would look too suspicious. So they used controlled demolitions to make one of the twin towers collapse into WTC 7 in such a way that it would be on fire for hours before they finally brought it down with controlled demolitions. Because... I don&#39;t know, theater? Make it look good?</p>

<p>The controlled demolition hypothesis introduces way too many variables that make it untenable. Sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting. Because all of the interviews and transcripts and the recorded radio from the rescue crews that were in the area before WTC 7 fell all talk about the massive fire in WTC 7, the damage to some 10-20 stories (depending on which angle the person was looking at the building from) along with hearing creaking and groaning as well as a noticeable bulge.</p>

<p>The crews were ordered out of the area because of the fears of further collapse. Interviews with members of the FDNY constantly mention the extensive damage to all the buildings in the area and the raging fires in WTC 7. They also repeatedly mention the creaking noises in the tower and the noticeable bulge in WTC 7 that developed prior to its collapse.</p>

<p>There is simply no credible evidence for the use of controlled demolitions to bring down either the twin towers or WTC 7.</p>

<p>So you haven&#39;t seen the videos of the FDNY evacuating the area amid large interior explosions in WTC7, then? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I have not. Care to share a link?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the preemptive news reports of it &#39;already having fallen&#39; when it is clearly still up in the background. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s that? The news reported something as fact that later turned out to not be true? Imagine that. I&#39;d be willing to bet that 99% of all people who live outside of New York City couldn&#39;t point to the WTC 7 building in a picture if their life depended on it, prior to 9/11. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s an iconic building in the New York City skyline.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without any precedent, how did the FDNY &#39;know&#39; it was coming down. No steel framed building had ever done that before. Raise your skepticism shields and do more research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, I don&#39;t know. The groaning and creaking, the fact that the building was noticeably leaning, the unchecked fires, the extensive visible damage that could be seen from outside the building. These all might have been clues that they might want to clear out of the area to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend looking into the actual reports. That is, the actual reports, not what various websites <em>say</em> is in the reports, but what is in the actual reports themselves. NIST actually did devote an entire section of their report on WTC 7 to controlled demolitions and lay out the evidence <em>against</em> the use of controlled demolitions.</p>

<p>The arguments I see people making for controlled demolitions are basically of the format &quot;There&#39;s this perceived inconsistency in this report, therefore it must have been controlled demolitions&quot; without presenting any evidence <em>for</em> controlled demolitions or making any attempt to verify the allegations against the NIST report.</p>

<p>Sure. If true, all this proves is that some authorities wanted to keep people out of the area. It is by no means proof of the use of controlled demolitions. There are completely non-sinister explanations for this- such as national security types not wanting the scene they were investigating contaminated or compromised by others traipsing around in it.</p>

<p>If it was indeed true that that area was off limits to all but a select few, it <em>is not proof or even evidence for controlled demolitions.</em></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>In a word: No. I&#39;ve actually spent over a decade of my life doing analytical chemistry for a living and any tests that can be done for explosive residue would have been at best inconclusive. The NIST report evaluated the videos they had of WTC 7 and looked for the evidence that explosives would have left and found absolutely no evidence that explosives were used in WTC 7. There would have been very audible sounds- on the order of a jet taking off- in the recordings if there had been explosives. There would have been very distinctive damage patterns to WTC 7 and surrounding buildings. The videos show none of these patterns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Steel-framed cages don&#39;t collapse. It just doesn&#39;t happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not without reason, no. Read the NIST report. Thermal expansion caused the main supports that held the building upright to lose their ability to resist downward forces and the building collapsed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just like &#39;un-hijackable&#39; airplanes getting hijacked. </p>

<p>Airplanes have been hijacked on several occasions. Read up on some history.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just speaking to the evidence available. There is no evidence whatsoever for controlled demolitions. Period.</p>

<p>Testing for explosive residue would have been pointless. The tests for the residue that explosive compounds would have left would have been washed out by the noise of all of the compounds that a burning and falling building would leave as residue that would look extremely similar to explosive charges. </p>

<p>The evidence <em>isn&#39;t</em> there. That&#39;s the point. If there were explosives, if WTC 7 was in free fall, there would be evidence for it. The fact of the matter is that the evidence overwhelmingly points to <em>no</em> explosives and the evidence overwhelmingly shows that WTC 7 <em>didn&#39;t</em> collapse in free fall.</p>

<p>Scientists don&#39;t look for the &#39;odd.&#39; Scientists look at the <em>facts</em> and draw conclusions based off of the available evidence. They look at alternative explanations and ask themselves what they would see if an alternate hypothesis was correct. In the case of WTC 7 it&#39;s pretty cut and dried. They <em>looked</em> for evidence of the building falling as a result of explosive devices and all of the evidence that you would see if that was the case was completely missing. No explosive sounds in line with what would have been required to bring the building down and no damage to the building itself or the surrounding buildings.</p>

<p>The investigation <em>looked</em> for evidence of explosives and found that there was absolutely no evidence whatsoever of controlled demolitions being present in WTC 7.</p>

<p>Funny that you should say that since this is what <em>you</em> have been doing this entire conversation. You have been disregarding any and all evidence that does not fit into your predetermined conclusion of controlled demolitions. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They never tested for explosive <em>residue</em> which I have explained before why this would not be definitive. Too many potential false positives. Shut off CSI: Miami and open an actual textbook on analytical chemistry. Learn about false positives and MDLs, then come back and I&#39;ll welcome your informed opinion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Even worse for truthers- they <em>looked</em> for evidence that explosives were used to bring down WTC 7 and found <em>nothing</em> to support that hypothesis. </p>

<p>They say &quot;Explosives were never tested for&quot; but the NIST report has an entire section and appendix devoted to exactly that.</p>

<p>They say that the building collapsed at free fall. The NIST report references the exact videos they were looking at and show that the building took significantly longer to collapse than it would if it were in free fall.</p>

<p>Simple, basic facts that can be easily verified are ignored or completely misrepresented. This does not instill confidence in their research skills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the NIST report. There were only three columns that were providing support against vertical forces. Once the first of those went down, it was all over.</p>

<p>The BBC reporting WTC 7 down before it fell? Again- how many people <em>who live in New York City</em> could identify WTC  7 from a photo? A foreign news agency reported something wrong. It&#39;s not like the news ever gets anything wrong, eh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If something falls at 9.8m/s/s, there&#39;s nothing under it. So how did that happen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This simply did not happen. WTC 7 did not collapse in free fall. The NIST report goes into quite a bit of detail of thenumerous videos of it falling show that show that it did not collapse in free fall.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Really? </p>

<p>&quot;In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008; available at <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm</a>), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions. During the public comment period on the draft report, NIST was asked to confirm this time difference and define the reasons for it in greater detail.&quot;</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t sound like it says anything of the sort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quit bringing up whether or not &#39;many people in NYC&#39; couldn&#39;t identify&#39; that building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As soon as you stop bringing up the BBC reporting the collapse of WTC 7 before it happened, I&#39;ll stop pointing out that a news agency based out of the U.K. might not be too familiar with lesser known buildings in the New York skyline.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Analytical chem guy in a lab in Virginia... so you have all the answers... so everything I&#39;ve learned and been trained to analyze, and 30+ years of structural work in concrete, metal and wood is supplanted by your ego, then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re the one with the ego. You&#39;re the one who claims that your experience in whatever is somehow superior to the combined experience of the experts that were on the NIST panel investigating the collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re kind of all over the place, so I&#39;m going to have to infer which video you are referring to. Is it the one where there is a reporter saying something to the effect of &quot;WTC 7 has collapsed&quot; and the building is shown on a screen behind them? That one?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve gone over this before. This wouldn&#39;t be the first time that the news misreported something and I&#39;d wager it won&#39;t be the last.</p>

<p>This is <em>in no way</em> proof of controlled demolitions.</p>

<p>Your argument for controlled demolitions is basically &quot;Look at all of these things that I, personally, don&#39;t understand 100%. It must be controlled demolitions.&quot; You then accuse people of entering with preconceived conclusions and ignoring any evidence to the contrary, <em>all while ignoring the evidence that refutes the claim that controlled demolitions were present in WTC 7.</em></p>

<p>Factor in that you make claims of things that are in the NIST report that are not there (the NIST report <em>never</em> said the building collapsed in free fall- a claim that you made) and you also claim things are not in the NIST report that <em>are</em> in the report. Due to this basic lack of ability to get key facts regarding your argument correct leaves a huge credibility gap.</p>

<p>They investigated the possibility of explosives. They looked at the videos for any evidence of explosives and found absolutely no evidence that was consistent with the use of demolitions.</p>

<p>The NIST report makes claims and provides evidence.</p>

<p>The truther movement says &quot;We don&#39;t like/don&#39;t understand their explanation therefore it must have been controlled demolitions.&quot;</p>

<p>The reason I don&#39;t buy into the truther movement is that every single one I&#39;ve spoken to ignores any evidence that contradicts their claims and rely purely on anecdotes (I have a friend who has a cousin who was on ground zero, etc) to support what is a strongly held preconceived notion that they cling to relentlessly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ridiculous. They take the complete lack of evidence of any type of controlled demolitions as somehow being proof of controlled demolitions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t put myself in the anti-truther camp at all. But due to my background, I am the type of person that looks for proof. </p>

<p>In the absence of proof, what those of us in the scientific fields do is look at the objective evidence- that is, evidence that does not rely on what a person perceives but on what can actually be measured.</p>

<p>In the end though, here&#39;s how I view it:</p>

<p>There are people who are firmly believe it was controlled demolitions that brought down the towers and WTC 7. (Note that a number of other buildings had sufficient damage that resulted in them having to be demolished after the fact)</p>

<p>There are those who believe that the government aided the hijackers, or set up some elaborate plot to make it look like a hijacking. (MIHOP)</p>

<p>There are those that think that the government knew about it and stood down and let it happen. (LIHOP- the most plausible of the alternate hypotheses, IMO)</p>

<p>There are those that believe that the U.S. got caught with their pants down and got spanked hard by someone with millions of dollars in funding and CIA training who happened to get lucky. (IMO- the most likely scenario)</p>

<p>However, in my mind the most important thing isn&#39;t exactly how the events of 9/11 went down, but how that one event gave carte blanche to a bunch of backwards policies that were proposed by a mediocre at best administration that allowed them to usurp so many American freedoms in the name of &quot;protecting&quot; U.S. citizens.</p>

<p>Hell, if I had to bet on any conspiracy theory about 9/11, I&#39;d wager that the administration saw the buildings fall, knew they had nothing to do with it, and then purposefully contaminated the scene so that the NIST report <em>couldn&#39;t</em> be conclusive so that people who would otherwise be banding together against the shady practices of the people in power (like all those Afghanistan contracts that KBR <em>really</em> wanted but needed a reason to push through) and instead spend time arguing over how the towers fell.</p>

<p>Planes hit towers. Multiple buildings fell. Those in power profited while laughing about people arguing over <em>how</em> it happened and completely ignoring what the fact that they <em>did</em> fall allowed them to do.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll stand shoulder to shoulder with you if you start campaigning to repeal the so-called &quot;Patriot Act&quot; or if you want to reign in the NSA and their spying on people.</p>

<p>Pick your battles. Don&#39;t let them divide you.</p>

<p>If someone doesn&#39;t believe that controlled demolitions took down WTC 7 <em>let it be</em> and switch to talking about the legislation that severely limited our freedoms was rammed through without time to even read it. Work to get representatives in Congress that will give us our liberties back.</p>

<p>Instead of devoting energy to arguing that there were demolitions or thermite or whatever in WTC 7, spend your time and focus your energy on showing people how a select small group (look up PNAC- Progress for a New American Century sometime) of people have been in power for a long time and capitalizing on American fears for decades.</p>

<p>The important thing isn&#39;t whether or not they are <em>causing</em> the events- arguing over that will just divide people. The important thing is that they are <em>capitalizing</em> on these events and people need to wake the fuck up and start making some changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, if you&#39;d actually read the NIST report, they never say that the steel in WTC 7 melted. They state that thermal expansion of the beams caused the supports to collapse. They even go so far as to give you the equations for the thermal expansion of those beams so you can plug in your own numbers. It&#39;s all in the report.</p>

<p>Also, the NIST report <em>did</em> investigate the possibility of explosives. An entire section is devoted to the investigation they did on explosives and explains why explosives were ruled out as a cause of the collapse. Any explosive would have been audible (there is no audible sound matching that of a possible explosive in the numerous recordings taken that day) and would have also resulted in massive damage that would have been visible on the recordings- evidence which is strikingly absent.</p>

<p>Yes. I have listened to numerous videos. There are, however, no recordings that show obvious explosions.

    <div class="md"><p>The main thing to keep in mind when looking at the collapse of the twin towers is that this has <em>literally</em> never happened ever in the recorded history of humanity so there really is no framework of reference on this. We can&#39;t look at other examples of this occurring because it has never happened before.</p>

<p>The damage in the video is what was on the ground, and yes, that much flaming debris could easily set fire to all of those vehicles and do that damage. Keep in mind that the twin towers were massive, and that all of that mass falling for hundreds of feet would release <em>massive</em> amounts of energy. So in addition to a flaming building falling onto the surrounding area, that extra kinetic energy would be converted to a <em>lot</em> of thermal energy. (For a simple demonstration, take a nail, lay it flat on some concrete then hit the nail several times with a hammer. Now pick up the nail and notice how it&#39;s hot to the touch- same thing.)</p>

<p>Add in the fact that the towers were still on fire when they fell, and all of this burning debris being scattered around a several block area- yes, the damage shown to the cars is not in the least unexpected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have different words that are similar for a reason. It&#39;s because there are hues to meaning.</p>

<p>In this case, &#39;unaccounted for&#39; means the money is still in the system, but is not directly traceable. No one has &quot;absconded&quot; with it, which is implied (although not absolutely) by the term &#39;missing&#39;. Saying &#39;missing&#39; implies an agenda to simply the money has been stolen, when in actuality it was not. From what I understand the vast majority was subsequently traced and accounted for.</p>

<p>Points like this are inaccurate and do people&#39;s arguments no favours. Once explained, they should stop using them in their arguments and concentrate on other areas. To do otherwise indicates faulty reasoning.</p>

<p>Anyway. I hope that helps.</p>

The amount of people that had to have been involved in a 9/11 conspiracy would have had to number in the hundreds, from planning stage to installing bombs in the WTC.

    <div class="md"><p>I always find this excuse weird.  Since Operation Northwoods was a plan to stage terrorist attacks on people within the US and blow up a remote plane over Cuban waters, yet this plan was approved by everyone up the chain of military command, including all 14 Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Surely all these people, who are top brass in the military were convinced that they could keep such a plan secret.  </p>

<p>This very same plan, which was hatched in 1962 remained secret from the American Public up until the year 2000.   How is it that no one in our government exposed our government&#39;s planning to stage terror attacks on it&#39;s own people for 37 years?</p>

<p>The only one that stopped this plan from going into action was JFK.   JFK was assassinated the following year in 1963.   Then, in 1964 our government faked an attack on our own ships in the Gulf of Tonkin that escalated our involvement in the war in Vietnam.  Nearly 4 million people died in the Vietnam war.  We didn&#39;t find out that the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie until 40 years later.   </p>

<p>Think about that.</p>

<p>Now, why do you think that people in our Government can&#39;t keep a secret? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem that most people are having in this thread, is that they think the type of people that stage attacks think like they do.  That they are normal people who have souls.  They don&#39;t.  They are pure evil.  And it&#39;s just such a bitter tough pill to swallow, and that&#39;s how these criminals can continue to get away with this act.  Because, to most people, it just defies logic to be that evil.</p>

<p>We know for a fact that the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie.  That our involvement in Vietnam was based on a lie.  And yet, the deaths of some 58,000 American Kids, and 4 million Vietnamese civilians wasn&#39;t enough for anyone in the chain of command in our military to expose the lie.   </p>

<p>Because, war is a business.  An insanely profitable business.  And, more often than not, profit kicks morality&#39;s ass every single time.  That&#39;s just a fucking fact.  </p>

<p>So, why do we want to believe the people who stand the most to gain from a lie like the Gulf of Tonkin to kick off of a war where they know millions would die, would let their conscience get in the way of massive profits.   We do we think the people at the top of the very same Military Industrial Complex that got away with it then, would have changed now?</p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely crazy to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I misread your comment the first time.</p>

<p>Look.  The theory that this was a manufactured event from the inside does not need to involve hundreds of people directly.   </p>

<p>I would start with about 15-20 people that know everything.  Cheney, Marvin Bush, George HW Bush, and other criminals in our government, criminals in top military positions and criminals in our Corporate elite, working together. </p>

<p>This is how I imagine how 9/11 went down.</p>

<p>Marvin Bush has control over security of the WTC Complex through a company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratesec">Securocom</a>, he sets up six of his criminal friends with office space in the WTC towers in the late 90s.  They say they are there to upgrade the cable, but their real job is to spend months working inside the building rigging it.  There is a lot of vacancy in the towers, so Marvin can help relocate entire businesses to other locations in the building to minimize suspicion.  If anyone in the building gets suspicious, what are they going to do?  Contact WTC Security?  They are in on it.  </p>

<p>Securocom also had control over the security of the Airlines that were involved on 9/11.   Marvin allows a few of his criminal military friends to convert 2 of these planes into drones that can be flown remotely.  </p>

<p>As Marvin and roughly 10 of his criminal friends get the Towers and Planes ready, Cheney takes control over Norad 3 months before 9/11 to cripple our military response to the plane strikes, by sending the majority of our military chasing after false targets and conducting war games that also involve planes flying into tall buildings, so our pilots don&#39;t know what was real or what was fake.  </p>

<p>4 criminal Navy commanders prepare a cruise missile by painting it to look like an American airlines plane.  </p>

<p>All the while top criminals in the CIA are creating a story of 19 hijackers who drink and visit prostitutes to sell to the media.</p>

<p>9/11 happens.   </p>

<p>Cheney&#39;s attempts to cripple our military response succeeds.</p>

<p>Marvin and his criminal gang of 10 make sure that their planes hit their targets, and they make sure that the explosive demolitions go off as planned.  </p>

<p>The criminal Navy commanders fire the cruise missle and it hits the Pentagon.  </p>

<p>While the nation is in panic and shock mode, the CIA and elite corporate criminals that own the media are selling the official story, already identifying Bin Laden as the perpetrator less than an hour after the planes hit the Towers.  </p>

<p>You could probably pull off 9/11 with less than 20 people.  You definitely don&#39;t need hundreds.   And not everyone involved that is close to the plotters need know that it was an inside job.  Someone working at the CIA selling the official story doesn&#39;t need to know that it was an inside job.  They just have to believe in the official story and sell it with authority.  </p>

<p>And if one of the plotters wanted to tell their friend not to fly on 9/11, what about that makes his friend involved as a fellow plotter?   Willie Brown, mayor of San Francisco was told not to fly on 9/11.  Do you think he&#39;s in on the plot?  Or is that just a coincidence?    </p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t have to be hundreds involved.  You are thinking that every person 6 degrees of separation from the plotters are connected.   The person that built the explosive doesn&#39;t know what that explosive will be used for.   The person that shipped that explosive to the tower doesn&#39;t even know he&#39;s shipping explosives.   That&#39;s compartmentalization.  That&#39;s how all big secrets are kept secret.  Only a handful of people in positions of power know what&#39;s going on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this is one case where history has proven Benjamin Franklin wrong.  There is example after example of secrets being kept from the public.  </p>

<p>Think about the trade secrets almost every business has.  Whether it&#39;s KFC&#39;s secret recipe, or Coco-Cola&#39;s recipe, or what ever it is that makes this business product stand out.</p>

<p>For a darker example, think about the Drug Cartels currently waging war on our borders.  They have many secret ways to get drugs into this country.  We wouldn&#39;t have a multi-billion dollar underground drug trade if more than two people couldn&#39;t keep a secret.    </p>

<p>Think about the mafia during Prohibition.  How did all those speak-easys exist, that were never caught, and were never shut down if more than two people couldn&#39;t keep a secret. </p>

<p>How did Hitler keep the concentration camps hidden from his own people.  There were German citizens who had no idea that concentration camps where thousands were being murdered, was happening right in their backyards.   American soldiers actually had to take German citizens on a tour of these camps to convince them what had happened.  </p>

<p>You probably already know about the Manhatten Project.  When we built the atomic bomb.  How was that kept a secret?</p>

<p>Face it, Benjamin Franklin, yeah he&#39;s a smart guy.  But he got this one wrong.  There is a way to keep a secret even when dozens or even hundreds of people are involved.  It&#39;s called compartmentalization.</p>

<p>Naturally the place resembled a war zone. Those were big ass buildings. And all three fell straight down into their footprint, as controlled demolitions are intended to do. Those buildings were meant to be standing for next to forever.

<p>From the available footage, it looks like more of the latter. If you watch the video I linked, you can see WTC from directly across the street and you can see that at least a half dozen floors are entirely on fire and there is extensive damage to all of the buildings in the area.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean by the pancake theory- I&#39;ve heard it used to describe a few different scenarios. The pancake theory, as I understand it, is that one floor failed and as it fell it flattened the floor beneath it as the whole building collapsed.</p>

<p>What I am referring to is the fact that there are number of important stress-bearing points in any tall building. When one fails, the forces of the building that it was supporting are shifted onto the other points. Once sufficient stress is pushed off onto successive support points, they are incapable of supporting the weight of the building and it collapses.</p>

<p>As a chemist who has actually made their own thermite before, I am <em>quite</em> familiar with what it is and what it does. You would need a <em>lot</em> of thermite to melt through <em>a</em> steel column, let alone the multiple columns required to bring down a building. We&#39;re looking on the order of 100 lbs for <em>each</em> column you want to bring down. 100 lbs would not be enough to bring down a single building, let alone multiple buildings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I have seen all the videos there is to see. And some of them would, at first glance, suggest conclusions that are not supported by proper research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Practically every video I&#39;ve seen that claims controlled demolitions and/or thermite brought down WTC 7 are completely bereft of any scientific merit. But yes, I do go to the sources and the unchecked fires burning for several hours are more than sufficient to cause the building to collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have done quite a bit of research into the structural engineering of those buildings. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it was explosives for a number of reasons, primarily that it would have been next to impossible to rig the buildings without someone noticing or blabbing. However, there is also the fact that if it was explosives there would have been loud explosions that were heard. I&#39;m talking <em>loud</em> explosions, as loud as a gunshot at point blank range or a jet engine taking off levels of loud. No audio of the events recording any such sounds.</p>

<p>That leaves possibly thermite, which as stated would require large amounts. But if that was the case that just leaves more questions. Why would they wait for the building to be on fire for so long before toppling it? How did they know that the building would catch on fire? Did they rig the building with accelerants just in case- also without people noticing?</p>

<p>What were they going to do if the building didn&#39;t catch fire? Were they going to just topple the building and hope nobody noticed? Or were they planning on sneaking in and clandestinely removing all of their demo work hoping nobody would notice?</p>

<p>There are just way too many things that would have to go just perfectly, all while having the attention of the entire world focused on you, in order to bring down WTC 7 with controlled demolitions and leave no trace.</p>

<p>So- I can either believe that our incompetent government that has a horrible track record of keeping things secret for very long somehow managed to surreptitiously rig a building with demolitions and bring it down in full view of the entire world and leave absolutely no evidence...</p>

<p>...or, I can look at the engineering, look at the heat expansion co-efficient of steel, the temperatures of the fires, look up the engineering docs and crunch some numbers on the horizontal stresses that the load-bearing points (which were designed to withstand almost entirely vertical forces) were subjected to and see that under those conditions, they would fail, one by one, and each one that failed would make it easier for the next one to fail. Couple that with the videos that show at least a half dozen floors on fire for several hours and it&#39;s honestly the only reasonable explanation.</p>

<p>But if you want to say it was controlled demolition and then plug your ears and go &quot;la la la&quot; when any evidence that doesn&#39;t fit that view is presented, that&#39;s fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea the engines melted but the passport survived, how the engines vaporised when they hit the pentagon is a little suspicious, considering the melting point and the fact they are designed to burn and contain what melted them, it&#39;s almost like they put all the data of the operation in that segment and hit it with a missile, considering there is no footage of a plane hitting one of the most secure buildings in the world.</p>

<p>My view is it looks fake or staged because we have never seen a jet hit sky scrapers before, it was like when the earthquake hit my hometown, it didn&#39;t feel real, you get a surreal feeling and start questioning it.</p>

<p>But then there are a lot of things that don&#39;t ad up and way to many holes, it&#39;s not like this is something that gets practised everyday and perfected so there would of been things that were over looked.  I could go on about thermite and infra-red images of molten steel days after impact at ground zero... but I wont</p>

<p>I dunno, to me it just doesn&#39;t feel right.</p>

<p>According to FBI agent Dan Coleman, Al Suqami’s passport is handed to a New York City detective who is “down there, trying to talk to people as they were coming out of the buildings.” <strong>By the time the detective looks up again after receiving the passport, the man who handed it to him has run off</strong>, “which doesn’t make sense,” Coleman will say.  </p>

<p>Investigative journalist Nick Davies will later write that he talked to “senior British sources who said they believed that the discovery of a terrorist’s passport in the rubble of the Twin Towers in September 2001 had been ‘a throwdown,’ i.e. it was placed there by somebody official.” [DAVIES, 2009, PP. 248]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a <em>lot</em> of things in physics that are completely counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally not surprised at all that an unburnt passport was found in or near the wreckage of ground zero. If you have a passport, try dousing it in fuel and then lighting it on fire to see how much of it burns. Or if you don&#39;t feel like burning your passport, take some an old checkbook you want to dispose of and burn it. It takes a bit of effort to get things made out of paper to burn to the point where more than just the edges are singed.</p>

<p>As someone who has burned a lot of things in their lifetime, I see nothing unexpected here. (For any NSA people reading this, I used to work at a place that destroyed their out-dated documents by burning rather than shredding. It takes a bit of work to make sure even a file folder of paper documents burns completely.)</p>

<p>That&#39;s a part, but there are, in fact, many smart people in government too. Many of those people--including some I personally know--worked in Pentagon offices, adjacent to the damage zone. These are highly intelligent, observant people who are often on their posts because they are also belligerent assholes who back down from nothing. Any one of these guys were not running the other way on 9/11. They were looking through the hole that just opened in their office wall.

<p>The point of looking, instead of running for the doors alongside the civvies is to know how to respond. These are guys who have heard big booms before and stood their ground while everyone else runs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally it&#39;s the price/pay-off ratio of the operation. The U.S. have never been really serious with their cassus belli. The Gulf of Tonkin incident was sufficient to go into Vietnam, the shitty reports on Weapons of Mass destruction was sufficient to go into Irak, but you need thousands of deaths, an assault on the Pentagon, the demolition of a building near the Twin towers, and an assault on the White House... for Afghanistan? </p>

<p>All of this must have happened in complete collaboration with Al-Qaida. You don&#39;t just need Americans inside the conspiracy: you need the Saudi Private Charities, the ISI, etc. That&#39;s a 10 year plan to have the opportunity to invade a country.</p>

<p>But wait, if they took 10 years to prepare the invasion, why didn&#39;t they just finance the guys inside Afghanistan that they put in charge once they invaded? Why did the U.S. let down the pro-western factions of Afghanistan for ten years? Why let the Taliban take power? There&#39;s so many questions that can be answered so easily once you realize that the American government and the CIA were just criminally incompetent.</p>

<p>My only consolation to this thought is that it was part of the master plan to reshape the American psyche around fear and control, and pave the way for the state to strip away rights and freedoms one by one. This idea is at least reaffirmed by the existence of organizations like DHS and PNAC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont believe it was an inside job..... What i do believe is they didnt take information serious orchad bad intel to begin with and once it happened they had to deal with the result. A government cannot just pull off an attack of that calliber and cover it up...  Maybe i am wrong and i dont want to believe that but i feel like it was an unfortunate mistake that measures werent taken in time and done so fluidly enough to prevent it..</p>

<p>As for everything that came from it, i am sure all of these laws were going to be passed one way or another..  The workd has gotten dangerously more hostile and moreso against the West..  Some of it honestly needed to be done whether some of you believe its for the good of our safety or not. </p>

<p>We cant control it, we just have to accept the fact we arent going to have our cake and eat it too..  Is it shitty that freedom costs a bit of our privacy?  Sure does.. But lets not believe that we had it to begin with? The Government makes the rules, been that way forever..  Eventually it was going to be more intrusive, thats the way of the world.  I believe that people in power are good and bad, some choices and decisions made are unfair but i dont feel like i am going to be thrown into a camp for no reason or we are turning into a police state..  Security will be getting more grand, more people are here nowadays... There are greater threats, more anti government types, and i unfortunately accept the fact to be safe we kind of need it..  </p>

<p>Yeah conspiracies are real.. I get that, theres some fucked up stuff thats happened and happening..  But i dont believe everything bad is a big thanks to our Government.. Theres fucked up people out there who do this on their own and the people making our decisions are human and can be lazy minded or manipulated into thinking one side is right and the other is wrong.  I just become frustrated reading that everything is some grand scheme setup by the Government to fuck the people over..  At the end of the day there are reasons for some of these insane things that are passed to law, we dont have to agree and we can become a bit crazy fantasizing about what is really the idea or motivation behind it.   </p>

<p>I just think some of the conspiracy theorists need to relax.. Some of you will believe anything you read, if something was really teying to be kept a secret for malicious intent i guarantee it wouldnt be thrown in our faces so easily that we can log on to a site and see the proof..   </p>

<p>Then again i could be totally wrong which is why i still read this subreddit, i look at it for entertainment and sometimes with good and hard proof, as news.  Part of me doesnt wanna believe any of it and part of me tries to be rational thinking wise.</p>

<p>The only things that are beyond any shadow of doubt in the official story are the fact that planes slammed into WTC1 and WTC2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heck, not even that.  I don&#39;t know where it&#39;s at now, but there was a video showing decent evidence with regard to the use of not only the strategically placed explosive charges in the building that pretty much everybody knows about, has seen, and doesn&#39;t deny, but also (and more importantly) about the use of holographic technology and the manner that it can be used to effectively simulate the planes that hit the towers.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the point here is that we shouldn&#39;t even assume that &quot;the only things beyond any shadow of doubt&quot; is that planes hit the building.  The ultimate point is that shit is REALLY fucked up where it regards this ff attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always find this excuse weird.  Since Operation Northwoods was a plan to stage terrorist attacks on people within the US and blow up a remote plane over Cuban waters, yet this plan was approved by everyone up the chain of military command, including all 14 Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Surely all these people, who are top brass in the military were convinced that they could keep such a plan secret.  </p>

<p>This very same plan, which was hatched in 1962 remained secret from the American Public up until the year 2000.   How is it that no one in our government exposed our government&#39;s planning to stage terror attacks on it&#39;s own people for 37 years?</p>

<p>The only one that stopped this plan from going into action was JFK.   JFK was assassinated the following year in 1963.   Then, in 1964 our government faked an attack on our own ships in the Gulf of Tonkin that escalated our involvement in the war in Vietnam.  Nearly 4 million people died in the Vietnam war.  We didn&#39;t find out that the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie until 40 years later.   </p>

<p>Think about that.</p>

<p>Now, why do you think that people in our Government can&#39;t keep a secret? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because saying something like &quot;it&#39;s highly unlikely&quot; has no bearing on reality. There is no statistical evidence available to support any claims about the likelihood of whistle blowers or their willingness to come forward. </p>

<p>Furthermore, There have been whistle blowers and many of them have been dealt with silently or publicly shamed. So even if I had smoking gun evidence, which IMO and the opinion of many, is already publicly available. What motivation do I have to risk danger or defamation of character to say something that will likely fall on deaf ears?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this is one case where history has proven Benjamin Franklin wrong.  There is example after example of secrets being kept from the public.  </p>

<p>Think about the trade secrets almost every business has.  Whether it&#39;s KFC&#39;s secret recipe, or Coco-Cola&#39;s recipe, or what ever it is that makes this business product stand out.</p>

<p>For a darker example, think about the Drug Cartels currently waging war on our borders.  They have many secret ways to get drugs into this country.  We wouldn&#39;t have a multi-billion dollar underground drug trade if more than two people couldn&#39;t keep a secret.    </p>

<p>Think about the mafia during Prohibition.  How did all those speak-easys exist, that were never caught, and were never shut down if more than two people couldn&#39;t keep a secret. </p>

<p>How did Hitler keep the concentration camps hidden from his own people.  There were German citizens who had no idea that concentration camps where thousands were being murdered, was happening right in their backyards.   American soldiers actually had to take German citizens on a tour of these camps to convince them what had happened.  </p>

<p>You probably already know about the Manhatten Project.  When we built the atomic bomb.  How was that kept a secret?</p>

<p>Face it, Benjamin Franklin, yeah he&#39;s a smart guy.  But he got this one wrong.  There is a way to keep a secret even when dozens or even hundreds of people are involved.  It&#39;s called compartmentalization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So did they fall straight down into their footprints, or did they fall mostly down and a bit to the side, spraying flaming debris all over the place?</p>

<p>From the available footage, it looks like more of the latter. If you watch the video I linked, you can see WTC from directly across the street and you can see that at least a half dozen floors are entirely on fire and there is extensive damage to all of the buildings in the area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting. Because all of the interviews and transcripts and the recorded radio from the rescue crews that were in the area before WTC 7 fell all talk about the massive fire in WTC 7, the damage to some 10-20 stories (depending on which angle the person was looking at the building from) along with hearing creaking and groaning as well as a noticeable bulge.</p>

<p>The crews were ordered out of the area because of the fears of further collapse. Interviews with members of the FDNY constantly mention the extensive damage to all the buildings in the area and the raging fires in WTC 7. They also repeatedly mention the creaking noises in the tower and the noticeable bulge in WTC 7 that developed prior to its collapse.</p>

<p>There is simply no credible evidence for the use of controlled demolitions to bring down either the twin towers or WTC 7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, if you&#39;d actually read the NIST report, they never say that the steel in WTC 7 melted. They state that thermal expansion of the beams caused the supports to collapse. They even go so far as to give you the equations for the thermal expansion of those beams so you can plug in your own numbers. It&#39;s all in the report.</p>

<p>Also, the NIST report <em>did</em> investigate the possibility of explosives. An entire section is devoted to the investigation they did on explosives and explains why explosives were ruled out as a cause of the collapse. Any explosive would have been audible (there is no audible sound matching that of a possible explosive in the numerous recordings taken that day) and would have also resulted in massive damage that would have been visible on the recordings- evidence which is strikingly absent.</p>

<p>See here&#39;s the main reason I have a hard time taking truthers seriously- they make claims that are <em>easily</em> demonstrated as false. All you have to do is just do the smallest amount of reading.</p>

<p>They say &quot;Explosives were never tested for&quot; but the NIST report has an entire section and appendix devoted to exactly that.</p>

<p>They say that the building collapsed at free fall. The NIST report references the exact videos they were looking at and show that the building took significantly longer to collapse than it would if it were in free fall.</p>

<p>Simple, basic facts that can be easily verified are ignored or completely misrepresented. This does not instill confidence in their research skills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a scientist by training, which means I am a skeptic by nature. You make claims, you must provide evidence that back up those claims.</p>

<p>The NIST report makes claims and provides evidence.</p>

<p>The truther movement says &quot;We don&#39;t like/don&#39;t understand their explanation therefore it must have been controlled demolitions.&quot;</p>

<p>The reason I don&#39;t buy into the truther movement is that every single one I&#39;ve spoken to ignores any evidence that contradicts their claims and rely purely on anecdotes (I have a friend who has a cousin who was on ground zero, etc) to support what is a strongly held preconceived notion that they cling to relentlessly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ridiculous. They take the complete lack of evidence of any type of controlled demolitions as somehow being proof of controlled demolitions.</p>

<p>Their frequent misstating of the facts and completely ignoring evidence that directly refutes their claims leaves a serious credibility gap.</p>
