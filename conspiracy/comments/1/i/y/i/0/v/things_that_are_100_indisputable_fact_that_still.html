    <div class="md"><p>We live in a digital age, where anything can be easily mechanically and commercially replicated.
 The typical media consumer is detached from reality, in the sense that their products and ideas are easily replicable, mass produced, commodified.  Digital effects have made any part of filmable reality able to be reproduced synthetically.
In this age, any thing can be falsified, and so most peeple are at least skeptical of any &quot;non-official content.&quot;</p>

<p>Cognitive Dissonance is completely a big part of it, definitely. </p>

<p>With it is also a general lack of interest for news stories outside of mainstream sources for the general population. 
The general belief is that most elites/professionals/public figures are good people;That most if not all conspiracies would have been outed by now if they were true, since the established institutions and organizations are so noble, you know?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure with more economic downturn, the masses may grow anti-big-government/business regardless of any direct evidence or not of wrong doing. This shows that most people follow the path of least resistance, remaining docile in acceptable material comfort, and begin clambering when domestic conditions become unbearable so as to cost more to REMAIN docile. </p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.wisegeek.org/how-big-is-the-internet.htm">this article</a>, Google has 5 billion gigabytes indexed = 0.00454747351 zettabytes. The datacenter in Utah has 5 zettabytes of storage.  0.00454747351 times 1000 = 4.54 zettabytes. How does that not make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. <a href="http://www.fluoridealert.org/studies/brain01/">Google says the studies go back to the 90s. Here&#39;s a list.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As noted by Dr. Philippe Grandjean, an environmental health scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health:</p>

<p>The average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points for commonly used IQ scores with a standard deviation of 15.*  Some studies suggested that even slightly increased fluoride exposure could be toxic to the brain. Thus, children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas. The children studied were up to 14 years of age, but the investigators speculate that any toxic effect on brain development may have happened earlier, and that the brain may not be fully capable of compensating for the toxicity.</p>

<p>“Fluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain,” Grandjean says. “The effect of each toxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on a population scale can be serious, especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us.”</p>

<p>There&#39;s more.</p>

<ul>
<li>The NRC Review (2006)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2006, the National Research Council (NRC) stated that “it is apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain.” In addition to calling for U.S.-based research on fluoride’s IQ effects, the NRC expressed concern about fluoride’s possible contribution to dementia. According to the NRC:</p>

<p>“Studies of populations exposed to different concentrations of fluoride should be undertaken to evaluate neurochemical changes that may be associated with dementia. Consideration should be given to assessing effects from chronic exposure, effects that might be delayed or occur late-in-life, and individual susceptibility.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>EPA’s Neurotoxicology Division Review (2007)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2007, scientists from the Neurotoxicology Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identified fluoride as having “substantial evidence” of “developmental neurotoxicity.” A developmental neurotoxin is a chemical that can damage the young, developing brain.</p>

<p>The EPA scientists based their conclusion on studies showing that fluoride exposure during pregnancy can damage the brain of the offspring. Consistent with EPA’s assessment, three studies from China have found that the brain of the human fetus can be significantly damaged by the mother’s high fluoride intake. While the safe dose for preventing this effect is not yet known, some adults in western countries have higher urinary fluoride levels of fluoride than the mothers in the Chinese studies (=4.3 ppm). (Mansfield 1999; Yu 1996; Dong 1993).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About MK Ultra - from Wikipedia:</p>

<p>&quot;While at Harvard, Kaczynski was taught by famed logician Willard Van Orman Quine, scoring at the top of Quine&#39;s class with a 98.9% final grade.</p>

<p>He also participated in a CIA run behavioral engineering study, known as MKUltra, conducted by Dr. Henry Murray, an expert on stress interviews. Students in Murray&#39;s study were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student. Instead, they were subjected to a &quot;purposely brutalizing psychological experiment&quot; stress test, which was an extremely stressful, personal, and prolonged psychological attack. During the test, students were taken into a room and connected to electrodes that monitored their physiological reactions, while facing bright lights and a one-way mirror. Each student had previously written an essay detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations: the essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who would enter the room and individually belittle each student based in part on the disclosures they had made. This was filmed, and students&#39; expressions of impotent rage were played back to them several times later in the study. According to author Alston Chase, Kaczynski&#39;s records from that period suggest he was emotionally stable when the study began. Kaczynski&#39;s lawyers attributed some of his emotional instability and dislike of mind control to his participation in this study. Indeed, some have suggested that this experience may have been instrumental in Kaczynski&#39;s future actions.&quot;</p>

<p>The truly mind blowing fact is that this type of thing is only a drop in the bucket of the deep connections between the alphabet agencies and terror. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Constitutional Republic and a Democracy are not mutually exclusive. </p>

<p>-Republic: A republic is a form of government in which affairs of state are a &quot;public matter&quot; (Latin: res publica), not the private concern of the rulers. In a republic, public offices are appointed or elected rather than inherited, and are not de jure the private property of the individuals who hold them. </p>

<p>-Democracy: is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws. It encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination.</p>

<p>-Constitution- A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed.[1] These rules together make up, i.e. constitute, what the entity is.</p>

<p>A republic is democratic in nature, in the sense that the transfer of power  is not a matter left to a few individuals, but rather decided upon all those its outcome affects. </p>

<p>Democracy is the participation of eligible citizens in the LEGISLATIVE PROCESS primarily, which leaves the Legislative Branch under the control of the &quot;peeple.&quot;  While other countries have executive branch leaders with more power, or not elected by the people, America&#39;s is elected in a popular(sort of) election, with checks on their powers.  </p>

<p>We fail to meet the criteria for a true Democracy and a true Republic effectively. </p>

<p>In a Democracy, equality of vote is key, and in America this is not the case, because of the lack of regulation in election funding laws.  There is no effectual equality because a few minority can disproportionately influence the outcome of the elections with vast amounts of money, while the poorer majority can just watch the circus-like spectacle at home on their CNNBCFOX tubes.
And as for our &quot;Republic&quot; for which we stand, it decays with the more control this minority influence financially; from the legislators they &quot;buy&quot;, to the WRITING of ACTUAL LEGISLATION.  </p>

<p>In short, we HAD a democratic, Constitutional Republic,  but which began to falter in the 1940&#39;s, and finally shed its &quot;republic, democracy&quot; for a defacto plutocratic fascist Empire. While still retaining the vestiges of its Constitution intact (on paper), for all effects and purposes lies tattered buried somewhere, where the most secret Corporate/CIA/NSA files are hidden. </p>

<p>No one can tell you that all GMOs are safe, each one needs evaluated individually. Claiming every GMO is safe would require testing every possible permutation of genetics which would obviously produce some dangerous organisms. We know changing one gene makes many changes to the organism. We may have the intent of creating one particular change by changing its associated gene, but there may be thousands of unexpected results form that change.</p>

<p>Despite this obvious logic, dozens of credible scientific bodies make the blanket claim that GMOs are safe, implying all GMOs. That is scary to know that these scientific and regulatory bodies, many of which we rely upon for our food supply&#39;s safety, are asserting this idea that all GMOs are safe, despite basic logic proving it wrong. </p>

<p>You can throw citations and studies at people all day long, but some simple logic makes everything clear and easy to assess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One simple rule could end the insanity of the GMO debate. Labeling. </p>

<p>Businesses have the obligation to tell consumers exactly what a product is, and where it came from. One of the few problems with Laissez-faire capitalism is that businesses, when unrestricted, tend to trick consumers from time to time. Products like &quot;soap with prize inside&quot; and magical cough syrup with secrete ingredients, do not benefit anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll preface by saying that I&#39;m a Libertarian for moral reasons, so I don&#39;t believe the government should force labeling.  Sure, let companies label their products as GMO-free if they are.  Allow independant bodies to decide what that means and certify foods (similar to the way Kosher and organic foods are handled now.)  But using force (all government is force) to make people pay for companies to do something is fascism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every advance made by Monsanto, Syngenta and others is simply for profit(and hopefully not for other nefarious means).  It&#39;s to keep their own profit cycle going, allowing their toxic pesticides to be sold exclusively, and used on THEIR crops.  Also, farmers now cannot legally keep the seed from season to season,(if seeds even survive, thanks to &quot;terminator&quot; genes).  Food that&#39;s made to kill itself should not be on my fucking table.  The government has been taken over by thugs, criminals and murderers.  On top of all this, Monsanto suing innocent farmers for wind-blown pollen is hilariously pitiful.  These fuckers need to be jailed for life.</p>

<p>The reality is closer to &quot;I just had a shitty day at my lifeless soul sucking 80 hour two point five jobs and I need to take my mind off my screaming kids, ridiculous personal debt, and house that needs to be cleaned by watching something mind numbingly simple but outrageous enough that I need to post something on FB about it&quot; and this Good Sir, is the person we need on-board to do something about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>prescott bush was part of the wallstreet elite who tried to overthrow the US goverment during WW2. A US general was asked by the elites to turn on the government but instead told FDR of the plans.At the time during WW2, FDR thought this information would harm capitalism so FDR kept it secret and the traitors went unpunished. Prescott Bush was the father of the 41st president and the grandfather of the 43rd. This information was declassified several years ago and the history channel covered it, but they left out Prescott Bush</p>
