       Meanwhile, Ron Wyden keeps going.  Udall hasn't spoken on the subject (or at least no news covering the topic has been noted).

       Why don't we just start putting together a list of those silenced based on coercion, international pursuit, jailing, and intimidation? We can start with:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Michael Hastings (Killed, 6/18/13)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bradley Manning (Jailed, 5/27/10)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Mark Udall (Brother: Randy Udall, coincidentally died, found 7/3/13)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Edward Snowden (Running since 5/20/13)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Barrett Brown (Jailed, 9/12/12)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There are many more.  Please add to it.  There is a number of people doing the right things that don't deserve to just disappear.

       I know it's an Inforwars site but feel free to check for other sources.  This guy was writing a third book about 9/11 as a commercial airline pilot with 20 years experience, including written testimony of flying with and for Barry Seal, a known cocaine smuggler.
      </p>
      <p>
       He allegedly shot his two teenage children (his son and his daughter), then the dog (or vice versa) then himself.  For no reason.  Then the crime scene was cleaned up almost immediately, but two black SUV's.

       Shady as shit.  Not many people know about him though.

       So Snowden and Manning did not violate the rights of others in any way? And didn't break any laws in the process? Just because it wasn't a physical theft like Coca Cola....

       No, I don't believe that Snowden and Manning violated the rights of others, and in fact they upheld their oath to abide by and protect the constitution which they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't deny that they broke laws, but they did so to protect the American public at large, which is the general function of the military and alphabet agencies anyways.  Again the supremacy of the Constitution and Bill of Rights supersedes any laws they may have broken.

       That's a really slippery slope. Where were people like you when police and SWAT were illegally searching Boston homes? Everybody was in an outrage.
      </p>
      <p>
       So SWAT broke laws, but that's ok because they did it to protect the American public at large. Where do you draw the line on what laws they can break?

       You're right, it is a slippery slope, it's the same reason the USA is quickly becoming a full blown police state.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the SWAT argument while relevant, is not a good one.  Snowden and Manning broke the law because they felt they had a moral obligation to do so, the SWAT teams were just following orders, in order for them to be equivalent the SWAT teams would have had to refuse searching people's homes.  But yes, it's a slippery slope, just as how I'm sure in the future we will see police invading homes more often now that it has been 'normalized' on TV.

      <p>
       As far as where I was when the Boston Bombing went down.... well I don't live in the states, but I care a lot about what goes on there because it affects me here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll tell you, if the SWAT had come to my house, I would have made a big deal about it, but I realistically probably would have complied so my shit didn't get wrecked.

       I'm glad both of them blew the whistle/leaked certain info, but I still believe they committed crimes and could have gone about it in different ways. Snowden basically admitted to joining his job so he could gain access to classified info, and Manning was not selective or pragmatic at all in his leaks, in which he did violate the rights of others (names and locations of undercover agents, details of military ops, etc).

       I will agree with you here, but also rico_of_borg's comment.  They did commit crimes, they could have gone about it a different way, which may or may not have been successful.  Manning could have 'proof read' his work before release, and supposedly (I have not seen much of it) the information he did release was not overly damning other than the Apache video.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, the argument really comes down to whether they endangered the lives of other service people.  I honestly don't know enough about the active programs vs. the information released to make a judgement call on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind however, he may have blown some covert programs, or possibly outed an agent or two, but the government would simply re-assign, or close down a program and open a new one or otherwise cover itself after the leak.  In this way I'm fairly certain that no one was put in any
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       danger, but again I speak from ignorance so I cannot say for certain.

       people always say "could have gone about it differently".  i don't understand how this is true.  we have a spectrum of people who went about it differently than the leaker before them and all of them suffer the exact same fate. labeled as a traitor, jailed, or coincidentally died.  there seems to be no real way to bring knowledge to the masses without a witchhunt.

       I was referring the way in which Manning released all of the info without regard to all that it contained. Snowden was more tactful and selected what to release.

       The brother was supposedly out in the woods on a research expedition (he's an environmentalist of sorts).  No, correlation does not equal causation, but the timing was very odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few are whistleblowers (who have been targeted by the Obama administration, but yes, whistleblowers break laws), and a couple reporters (B.Brown/Hastings), and Joe Nacchio was convicted on insider trading in a situation that could only be called entrapment (he was convicted of trading on insider information that was top secret classified).  No matter what Nacchio did, he was leaving himself open to prosecution.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is conspiracy.  We put together theories of what's going on, and focus on putting together something coherent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have something to contribute positively to the discussion, or do you simply believe the conversation shouldn't happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       In this situation, Occam's Razor leans towards the simplest of solutions to the problem.  The NSA/CIA is harboring the most powerful tool for blackmail and surveillance in the world.  It is a tool that all, but the staunchest of believers in the institution would have a problem with because it concentrates the ability to leverage any situation in their favor.  These people have gone to great lengths to expose this, and the associated powers behind it have great incentive to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In another supposition, this is all about stopping terrorists.  That's why we need the infrastructure.  However, we support Al Qaeda in Syria.  The same people who were the justification for going to war in the Middle East in the first place.  Maybe the claimed purposes and the actual purposes differ.

       Whistleblowers in jail shouldn't be on the list. They break the law, they get punished. Period. That's not a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown threatened a federal officer and spread hacked data around.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has still been insufficient evidence to conclude that Hastings was murdered, let alone who murdered him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to invoke Occam's razor, then surely you realize that these things happening are not out of the ordinary and not the result of some big evil plan that requires hundreds and thousands of people to keep their mouths shut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of all the people speaking out about the NSA/CIA/etc, how many siblings and family members do you think they have? What is the chance that one family member died during these few months of heated discussion about the NSA? Why is it that conspiracy is the first thing that is uttered when someone dies? What happened to gathering evidence and info, not just claiming everybody is being disappeared or silenced?
      </p>

       I don't believe that this conversation shouldn't happen, but rather it shouldn't be inundated with garbage and wild, baseless speculation. Stick to the facts.

       Whistleblowers get to the list because they have just cause for being there.  Constitutional interpretation becomes the foundation for the argument.  As was discussed above, the constitutionality of these laws are in question, and they are putting out information that is in conflict with the laws.  If you want to go back to the fact that the Supreme Court has allowed this, there are two arguments: (1) No, the Supreme Court isn't allowed to know what's going on with the FISA courts, and (2) there are 'national security' exceptions.  What we effectively have is an executive unchecked by the courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a big evil plan, it's business. Just about everyone inside seemingly benefits (or at least believes so).  It's just data as far as most are concerned, and people are just doing things, and it only takes a few bad apples to make the whole bunch turn up rotten.  Or it takes a few using those (potential) tools for leverage in non-terrorist related activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       You call what I say is garbage and wild, baseless speculation.  The foundation of our situation has been made relatively clear.  A living former president (Jimmy Carter) has come out and said we don't have a functioning democracy.  Udall and Wyden (acting Senators) have come out staunchly against the programs.  Go forth and say we can stick to just the facts - the problem is we aren't allowed to know them (is this argued at this point?); the defense being that it destroys our security to bring them out into the public.  That's not freedom, or democracy, or liberty; these are marks of authoritarian rule.  The government isn't supposed to hide behind the country.  They aren't the same thing.

       Udall's brother was Randy Udall, an expert on petroleum and alternatives. He wrote in From Cleopatra to Columbia.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We Americans are as dependent on oil as the Sioux were on bison. But whereas they celebrated the beast in dance, story, and ritual, we pull into the 7-Eleven, buy 20 gallons and whine about the cost. We ought to have a holiday dedicated to petroleum, or at least bow to Mecca when we buy it. And the fact that we don’t says something troubling about us."
