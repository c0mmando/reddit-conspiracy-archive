       I just watched
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IqvLA-PeM4">
        this video
       </a>
       of a guy talking about the idea that all pixar movies take place in one universe. I don't know about all that, but it pointed something out that I didn't catch before - That the
       <strong>
        Global government
       </strong>
       /corporation from Wall-E (Buy-N-Large) makes the batteries that are inside of Buzz Lightyear.
      </p>
      <p>
       At about 3:51 in the video;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...what corporation is guilty for polluting the earth and wiping out life in the distant future because of technology overreach? Buy N Large, a corporation that runs just about everything by the time we get to Wall-E.
        <strong>
         In the 'History of Buy N Large' commercial from the movie, we're told that Buy N Large has even taken over the world's governments.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Did you catch this that one corporation achieve global dominance?
Interestingly this is the same organization alluded to in Toy Story 3, as seen in this picture with the year batteries...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's no doubt the movie at least incorporates the idea of a police state. Once they're
       <strong>
        incarcerated
       </strong>
       at the day care, another toy is describing to Woody how there's almost no way out, that they're all under camera surveillance, and then woody goes on to try to 'wake up' the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bad guy, "Lotso," describes how he's constructed the society around him with himself at the top of the pyramid, and eventually the barbie character says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and then Ken (who works for Lotso) changes sides and sticks up for barbie and the others, and goes on to say
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Everyone listen! Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair.
It's Lotso, he's made us into a pyramid! And he put himself on top."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So it's just undeniable that the writers are alluding to a police state and even 'illuminati' symbolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've tried pointing it out before and people act like it's insane...
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder what the symbolism of Buzz's BNL batteries is. In the movie he gets his programming changed and takes on the role as prison guard, and treats his friends like prisoners, despite their pleas.  You can see it in this video -
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwnMO9V4QKI">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwnMO9V4QKI
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I forget if they take his batteries out in the movie, but I know they have to reset him at some point to de-prisonguard him, and the RESET button is right by the batteries. Seems pretty clear what's being hinted at to me...

       YES! I believe that is true. You gain MORE power over your victim if they are aware of what is going to happen to them. If if it is only "metaphorically".

       Snowden's leaks reek of bringing about the panopticon.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The concept of the design is to allow a watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution

         without their being able to tell whether they are being watched or not.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Most if not all of Snowden's information was already leaked by many others like William Binney or Russ Tice.  Snowden's leaks brought the information into the MSM which allowed for many now to** not know if they are being watched (targeted) or not.**

       Yes, exactly this.  And our imaginations always conjure up an exquisitely custom-made terror built on our own fears (of which we may or may not be consciously aware) which foments more psychological impact than a tangible threat.

       Part 2
      </p>
      <p>
       The work of Wilhem Reich was taken from him and his books burned (book burnings in America by the FBI!) The work of John Keeley was systematically disproved and his good name dragged through the mud (ie. inventions taken away by the CIA or some such organization that actually has the resources to further his work in secrecy after "exposing him as a fraud" in public). Viktor Schauberger had ALL of his research stolen from him from some unknown Americans and he died in despair with nothing. All three of these men were on to something and not one glimpse of their wisdom has been visible in any of our modern technological devices. No cloud-busters exist, No Keeley etheric engines, and certainly no vortex "implosion" motors or UFO engines (Schauberger was pressed into service by the Nazis and had reportedly successfully tested a UFO type engine using his vortex theories).
      </p>
      <p>
       The final piece of the puzzle lies within what this post originally was questioning and that is relating to the nature of "ideas and thoughts". Upon reading Steiner I discovered that our "thinking" is not always strictly "brain-bound" or in other words our thoughts are not localized to the physical organ of the brain. Thoughts are part of a larger spiritual process or system and are not always our own (perhaps never!). The brain, when properly developed, is more of a tuning mechanism than a thinking machine, and when developed correctly, has massive potential, far more than we give it credit for today. We participate in the higher worlds when we think beyond our brain bound capacity...when we use our imagination and our inspiration to think we are accessing a higher source of wisdom. So we participate with the higher worlds and with the beings who dwell there when we are engaged in higher thinking (ie. thoughts of a highly complex nature).
      </p>
      <p>
       But this also means that our thoughts can be influenced by these beings of the higher worlds and if we are not sufficiently developed (ie. have NO knowledge or control over our lower urges and desires or no control over our ASTRAL body, which is the part of the human being that is responsible for passions and desires) we are then accessible to the darker forces and demonic malevolent beings in these higher worlds. We have guardian angels that protect us from these beings but as we live in an environment where both knowledge and faith in these beings is waning, and being actively campaigned against, they are not cooperating with us as much as they used to. And in turn the dark forces are more and more taking root in man's being and influencing him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I have discovered from my research that these beings CANNOT directly affect us and they need us to be complicit with the suggested action. They need our WILL forces to achieve the goals they desire as they cannot simply POSSESS us and make us do things. (think of all the psychotropic drugs out there that are prescribed to the "mentally ill"...all of them weaken man's spiritual being, making it incapable of healing itself without OTHER factors at play and taking down the natural barriers that man has in place to protect himself from these evil beings).
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore my theory is that these secret government agencies are completely aware of this information and  they have been aware of it for over 50 years and they have succeeded in their own psychic experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They" have been actively campaigning to eliminate a spiritual perspective of the world amongst the masses (all three ZEITGEIST movies...total and absolute counterintelligence projects to be spread out amongst the skeptical who may or may not have a belief in the spirit world). I am referring mostly to the Acharya S portion of the first Zeitgeist movie, but also to the TECHNOCRACY propaganda that follows in the other two films...which is totally AHRIMANIC and if enacted would give supreme power over the masses,  both body and soul/spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They must destroy all belief in and knowledge of the Christ being (ZEITGEIST specifically, ATHEISM in general) and minimize the importance of, if not completely destroy, the belief in the significance of the Mystery of Golgotha (otherwise known as the Crucifixion).
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to create a one wold religion that has no ties to historical spirituality and contain NO spiritual truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to cloud our ability to perceive the truth and promote the dualistic nature of good and evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to keep us all separate and apart and fighting with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now my hypothesis begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I use my imagination and extrapolate all that information (plus more that I have failed to include here) I can safely conclude that these secret organizations have worked their black magic and achieved fantastic results. Al Beliek talked about time travel and portals to the planet Mars and I believe he said he was involved in the Philadelphia experiment. Bill Cooper's tales range from UFOs and a number of different alien species co-operating with this "shadow government agency" all the way to the existence of underground facilities of massive size and power..all connected through thousands of miles of underground tunnels. Dr. Bill Deagle confirms this. Phil Schneider also had a lot to say about underground bases and the people who inhabit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the above information was pursued with an unlimited budget and under a tight military hierarchy with little or no regard for human life or suffering I conclude that they would definitely be involved in some type of clairvoyant black magic to manipulate the astral world. They know that to control this world they need to have some sort of influence in the higher worlds. My imagination brings me to suppose that they have genetically manipulated human beings to be super soldiers and/or clairvoyant. Their capacity for evil is limitless and therefore, to gain powerful and effective control over the masses, I see a group of 12 biotech human slave clairvoyants, wired up to a "cerebro" type of psychic amplifier, inside a magic circle or pentagram, creating all kinds of havoc in the astral realm, which in turn creates all kinds of havoc here.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF the Sandy Hoax actually occurred I think that it is an excellent example of this type of black magic being used on the mentally unwell individual who was drugged up and susceptible to the suggestions of these demonic beings in the higher worlds and the 12 biotech clairvoyant magician/slaves. Aurora and Norway killings possibly too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that this sounds absolutely insane and I am sure that I am mistaken somewhere along the line but my goal here is not to PROVE this but to suggest possible tactics by the dark powers and that to affect positive change in this world we need to develop ourselves so that we can make changes in the higher worlds and battle evil on the astral plane.

       Thanks so much. I was only expecting a couple of references but thanks for stringing it all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself have experienced out of body experiences with some practice and completely it made me question my previous materialistic atheistic beliefs. I have halted my OBE practice because I have experienced some truly frightening moments. One including a very frightening dark entity not allowing me to continue my OBE and holding me in place. So for now, I put OBEs on the backburner since I believe there is much more for me to learn before continuing the practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       More recently I have stumbled upon a couple of things that makes me believe (and agree with you) that there is definitely more to the universe than what we have been led to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is a book titled, "The Trickster and the Paranormal" by George P. Hansen, which describes the trickster archetype and how that character trait is so prevalent in the field of paranormal study. At the time I was still iffy about the whole paranormal field but that book is so damn informative about the history of the study of the paranormal that it had me questioning so much. The reason I mention this book is because it details how organizations such as the Stanford Research Institute and the U.S government have studied the field for so long. It showed to me that there was a lot of interest in this field from people who had money as well as interest from intelligence agencies. It also detailed how many studies had actual positive findings contrary to popular belief. Even the Sony corporation had a study that verified that humans had at least some latent psychic ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that has rocked my belief system is Gnosticism. Much of what you say sounds similar to Gnostic teachings, but I have barely even scratched the surface when it comes to Gnosticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also do agree that the Zeitgeist "films" are a deliberate tactic to mislead people. The entire Zeitgeist goal sounds like something straight out of dystopian scifi novel. Zeitgeist is definitely not only thing that is seemingly leading people to the extremely materialistic only beliefs. Almost everyone I talk to that is not interested in this field of study reacts with a knee jerk dismissal or even fear when I even broach the idea that the "nuts and bolts" are not all there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only really comment on your theory as so far as that is definitely possible. Occult societies and black magick are heavily entwined with elites, even prior to the more recent scientific studies in to the paranormal and parapsychology. Who is to say they haven't been perfecting their craft?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were to come up with my own theory, it would be that the elites are using everything within their grasp to control the human mind. Tactics ranging from some sort of psychic control, pharmaceuticals, psychiatry, ritual abuse, destroying the human diet, as well as electromagnetic devices. At this point, I believe we are seeing one of the largest wars against almost the entire human population save for a very, very miniscule percentage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again thanks for the lengthy response. I definitely have much to learn and read. I have only heard of Schauberger on a handful of occasions. I have never even heard of Steiner (there is so much to read on rsarchive.org) nor have I ever heard of Keeley. Though I have done a bit of study about Reich. That man had to be on to something. The way the US government reacted to Reich's work is the one of the most suspicious reactions I have ever heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I may contact you again in the future for further discussion, if you don't mind.

       Good decision for stopping the OBE's. It can be very dangerous to those who are unprepared. 2 steps forward in moral and ethical life for 1 step forward in occult knowledge/experience. This rule is unbreakable. You CAN move forward in occult knowledge without improving the morals and ethics but you will be in grave danger! And astral beings are real so that is probably what you saw...you may have also saw your double?! More on that later...
      </p>
      <p>
       I had an OBE once and I ended up whipping around and around my room above my bed where I was sleeping and then got slammed back into my body where I immediately woke up. I was then wide awake for hours after that and I always wondered...was I incapable of rising out of my body and staying out of body or was I being protected from accessing the astral realm?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Robert Monroe and his entire hemi-snyc movement is dangerous...not only for the souls involved but also for the misconceptions spread from his adherents' descriptions of the other side. ENTIRE worlds can be created to fool us into thinking lies. Just because you hear voices doesn't mean the voices are telling the truth. But again, if Robert Monroe is performing hemi-snyc manipulation with people in a public environment...don't you think the military/elite have been doing it for years and are probably far advanced in their progress?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for recommending the book. I will look into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have reminded me of another couple of important areas in the study of evil. There are a few more evil forces that we have to deal with outside of Lucifer and Ahriman. I am not EXACTLY sure where to find this information amongst Steiner''s lectures but the search engine on rsarchive is pretty darn good and I will look into it in the the future but here is what I know right now...
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides Ahriman and Lucifer there are a number of other evil entities that demand consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asuras. The Beast. 666. The Doppleganger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ASURAS are apparently very powerful and under their own control...I need to know more about these beings so I will refrain from commenting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The BEAST. Also known as the ALIEN. According to this book (
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Spirits-And-What-They/dp/086315462X">
        http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Spirits-And-What-They/dp/086315462X
       </a>
       ) the BEAST lives on a moon around Pluto and is on it's way to earth. A spiritual being for sure but again I need to do more research to be able to further elucidate. I highly recommend that book as it is the only book I know that has a genuine and believable recollection of contact with the ELEMENTALS (nature spirits). And they speak of things that were eye opening to me (the origin of Indigo children for example).
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I have no clue. Has to do with TIME and epoch changes. I need more research again!
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The DOPPLEGANGER. I know a little bit about this evil entity.  It is our evil double. Our evil twin. This being enters into our physical body shortly before birth and flees a few days before death. It is in us right now and it is the "devil that made us do it!" (not an excuse for evil activity violating your free will, but the being that "goads" you into performing evil!) Apparently the doppleganger is afraid of death and flees before it's "host" is dies. A lot of people on their death bed tend to get better for a few days before they die. Doctors and caregivers will notice that the person perks up and is in good spirits and actually seems to be getting better. Within three days that person is dead. That is because the doppleganger cannot live through death and it flees in terror. If you know anyone who works in a hospice or a place where people are dying they will confirm this fact. It may not be exactly three days but it will leave before the body dies and the patient gets lighter and feels less aggravated, even downright cheerful. Of course morphine and pain killers will dull this experience and most people exit this world full of these drugs so it may be hard to tell from direct physical observation. The Mystery of the Double is an extremely important topic so please do further research on this one. I know that scientists can measure and confirm the electrical current in our nervous system...this is the doppleganger. We are light beings not electrical beings. The doppleganger IS the electrical current in our nervous system. The scientists think that the electrical current is the "spark of life". They couldn't be more wrong! WE are LIGHT beings!
      </p>

       Steiner's work has been called the NEW Gnosticism but he would probably reject that name. Ancient Gnosticism is part of INITIATE science of the past that Steiner had tried to bring into our consciousness today in a new and fresh way so that souls of today can understand it. The problem with any ancient spiritual perception is that it is too old for the modern person to use today...we can learn from it but we need NEW ways of practicing spiritual science. The old ways are ineffective (and perhaps dangerous) in today's spiritual atmosphere. Hence Steiner's 5 main books...and that contains everything we need to develop ourselves into the spiritual warriors that we need to become!

       Part 1
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a person who has been interested in the paranormal and the occult since I was young I recently had a minor epiphany about these phenomena and their application in the world today. From my small collection of books on the subject I noticed that there had been a lot of government and academic interest in the paranormal right up until the 80's.  Major universities around the world all studied, and I mean seriously studied, clairvoyance, telekinesis, astral projection, mind reading, prophecy, ufos, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And guess what...?
      </p>
      <p>
       They did not find them ALL to be frauds and hoaxes! Using contemporary science, they had either reached the conclusion that the phenomena requires way more study or that there is no scientific explanation for it! There have been hoaxes and frauds yes, and the academics did disprove them, and made sure that you knew about it, but the some of the more serious studies practically legitimized the various questionable events and powers that they were studying.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last ten years or so I started to become familiar with Anthroposophy and the work of Rudolf Steiner. In one of his central books (Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and its Attainment), in the very first paragraph, he states that every human being has the potential for clairvoyance and if man were to apply himself he could unlock this potential. The book then goes on to describe HOW to do that and what to expect. It was nothing like what I had read before and certainly not what I expected! I read as much as I could by Rudolf Steiner, fascinated with this man's life, work, and what he had to say about the higher worlds and the beings that live there. After some serious study this question started to nag me...
      </p>
      <p>
       "What if a government military agency took the work of Steiner (and others) seriously and then applied it in a manner whose goal was NOT the lifting up of man's soul and spirit to the cosmos and there seek congress with the beings of higher worlds but to gain access to powers and knowledge forbidden to them? "
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time I dismissed the question because I thought that no one would ever seriously take up what Steiner proposed in a military/secret service type of way and even if they did they would probably fail so many times that they would stop looking into it and move on to more satisfying areas of materialistic research that would provide them with what they are looking for...things which I imagined, like high-tech machines that could help them spy on, kill, or disable the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I saw MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS and read on the internet about Colonel Stubblepine (whose work the movie was based on) and that he is a counter-intelligence agent!  I then realized that the secret services (all of them!) ARE actively promoting the idea in the minds of the masses that psychic powers and ESP are completely false, don't work, and all recorded public experiences of the paranormal and unexplained are the work of fraudsters and hoaxers. Sure Stubblepine's so called "research" does legitimize some ESP activity but in the final analysis it only assures us that this government sponsored program is over and that the agents involved are a bunch of bumbling fools who are unable to use any of their "powers" to actually achieve anything. The movie itself is a huge counterintelligence psyop that recruited Clooney to help sell their message to a mainstream audience. (Hollywood does not need to be complicit with this plan because they are only making movies...and their main interest is in profit.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So being someone who can think I extrapolated my own investigations and their results from a military/intelligence gathering perspective and wondered what would have happened if ALL of this psychic business was taken seriously by an organization with endless funds and a penchant for secrecy and absolute control. Think about it...there was a tremendous government and academic interest in this stuff around the world and now there is none?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think not!

       This is going to sound really far out but please open your mind and allow this idea to work upon you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hollywood writers are "incepted".
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean by this is that their so called "artistic choices" that they make as they write a screenplay or as they outline a plot or storyboard, are actually being influenced from the spirit world. And as artists they are highly influenceable because they probably have very little control over their "astral body" (which is the part of us that feels pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, the "sensual" body of man).
      </p>
      <p>
       How many of writers/artists do you know that enjoy wine, women, song, heroin, coke, dope, porn, infidelity, open relationships, etc.? (and probably to an extreme degree). As an "artist" myself I will admit to my attraction to these things and I will admit that these qualities give me at the very least the facade of being a creative interesting person, but for the majority of these creative types they ultimately identify themselves through these indulgences and give zero fucks about their moral and ethical life, over their "creative and passionate" one. To put it simply...they embrace these unethical and immoral lifestyle pursuits and are greedy and selfish and self-obsessed and have very little self control when it comes to their "passions". Don't get me wrong here, this can occur in your Aaron Sorkin (high minded, humanistic, intellectual writer) all the way down to your low-paid coke fueled Saturday Night Live writer (base, clever, derogatory hipster humor)... and it does not have to take the form of base physical desires but can also (probably more frequently) occur through the ideas, concepts, and philosophies and in the overt pride that one has in being an "man of intelligence".
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that have little control over their astral body are easily influenced from many many angles, and one of these angles is from the spirit world through dreams and other unconscious states (hence the term "incepted" that I choose to use).
      </p>
      <p>
       So because these Hollywood writers are so powerful in terms of introducing ideas into the world's collective unconscious, (Hollywood is not simply AMERICAN propaganda it is GLOBAL propaganda) through these globally released movies, it is imperative that the dark powers control these ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       To do this they employ/enslave a team of clairvoyants, psychics, black magicians to make contact with the individual writer's astral body while sleeping and implant the seed of the idea that they want spread. The writer wakes up, completely unaware that he has been "incepted", and claims to have come up with a fantastic story for a screenplay, which in turn gets produced and distributed to MILLIONS of people around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why go to such lengths to simply control the content in the screenplays? Why not simply put in place agents that can disseminate the "content" that the dark powers decide?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well they tried that with L Ron Hubbard and he could only influence a small amount of people...not to mention that the general public is wise to this overt approach. Battlefield Earth is touted as one of the worst films ever and Will Smith's new film is developing the same reputation...you can't engage in successful mind control when the mark is not invested in your con.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to gain legitimacy (and ultimately the most efficient method), the seed of the screenplay/story/plot-line, is implanted in these SUPERSTAR writers, which they claim are THEIR ideas, and the content or theme that the dark powers want to communicate to the world is spread through the so called IMAGINATION of the writer of the story/screenplay/plot-line.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can also occur in the entire GROUP process of writing a multi-million dollar animated feature but the same idea applies only with a number of people instead of just one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at how Hollywood has developed over the years...the time of the individual DIRECTOR/WRITER is over and these individuals no longer have control over what ideas or themes are presented to a mass audience. The Sam Fullers and Sam Peckinpah's have been shut down. Screenplays are vetted and bought and researched and changed to suit the whims of the Executive Producer (who is more than just "incepted" but probably a key player in promoting certain films over others...Arnon Milchan being an excellent example of a former Israeli intelligence officer now producing Hollywood films). So there is absolutely NO INTEREST in promoting any ideas that are not their own! ZERO interest. They control the ideas that are sent out into the world. Once in awhile someone slips through the cracks (Terence Malick's film's are definitely not NWO inspired) but the overwhelming control they have over the TV and Film industry drowns out the visionaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is NOT simply a conspiracy of the Hollywood elite to promote NWO concepts through its films, it goes way way deeper to levels that is completely unbelievable to your average thinker.

       I found some themes and scenes in that film (the Guantanamo-style detention and threat of torture, the terryfying near-death experience by the end) disturbingly 'adult' for a kid's movie. Remember exchanging glances with the relative we were watching it with, alongside her kids.'whattefuck?'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conditioning for young viewers to accept those type of events as 'normal', just like music videos of current plastic pop stars are filled with riot/police state imagery? The writers and artist trying to sneak in topical themes to keep the adults awake and entertained and as a sly social critique?

       The idea that these scenes are overly "adult" is a little silly. We've actually sanitized children's entertainment a whole hell of a lot. Just check out

       Probably because this is a sequel to a kid's movie from 10 years ago, and they wanted all us young-adults who were kids to remain interested. There's something there for everyone. I'm certainly glad they stayed true to their original audience.

       The video itself is a huge stretch. Its interesting mental masturbation but lets not kid ourselves that something important is being shown to us. Its only obvious that the artists and writers are affected by the same culture as you are. They incorporate allot of the ideas into their cartoons but so what?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the apocalypse there are far more interesting things going on then this. We need to keep grounded and not go into fantasy land. Its not gonna help us one bit. But that's just my opinion.

       the only reason I posted the video was for the clip showing Buzz's BNL batteries. Notice the second sentence of my post, where I said
       <em>
        "I don't know about all that"
       </em>
       about the video...

       I think it's more about Fascism and Religion, based on what I know of Rowling.

       Obviously critiques of Fascism carry over pretty well to new world order shit though.

       The movies spell out the fascism parts fairly well, but the books go into depth about the ideals of what Voldemort wanted to create. The 7th book goes into great detail about how Dumbledore and Grindewald in their youth wanted to create a new world order, where magical people would rule benevolently above the non-magic people. Grindewald went on to try and do so by becoming the power behind Hitler while Dumbeldore stopped him and realized his idea was not such a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voldemort essentially wanted to create the same system, him at the top of the pyramid, the pure blood magical people as his elites and the non-magical (profane) people at the bottom to serve them. He is clearly a transhumanist who is obsessed with living forever.

       Assuming gov't intelligence influences the themes in such big-budget eye candy, they would appear to be promoting anti-totalitarianism and goading people into attempting resistance. Good way to find out who is and isn't drinking the kool-aid.
      </p>

       Those who do will enjoy the movies and go about their lives, the rest might be tempted to do something about it.

       mind = blown. I use the term "wally world" all the time and never thought of that, even though I did think they were parodying walmart.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movie came out the same year that walmart announced it's partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (for the rollout of 'if you see something say something,' etc) too. Do a search for "walmart partners dhs"
