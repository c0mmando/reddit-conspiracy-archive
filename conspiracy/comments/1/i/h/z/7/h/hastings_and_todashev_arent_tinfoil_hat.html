       The death of Michael Hastings and slaying of Todashev may be at the top of the conspiracy sub, but they lack exposure where they are absolutely needed; they should be at the top of
       <em>
        everyone's
       </em>
       news listings.
       <br/>
       Reddit offers a distinct advantage to those of us brave enough to consider what's actually happening to the world around us. While corporate mainstream media is subject to the claws of the US Stasi apparatus, social media is subject to crowd appeal. I propose a simple method of injecting these stories into the mainstream subs that all users have default access to.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a story is posted to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , put an x-post to
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       into the comments, if we can all start the ball rolling on exposing some of these travesties to the mass public, than the stories have a real chance of inspiring real public outcry.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you guys have some ideas as to how we can accomplish this task, injecting these stories into mainstream media, than please discuss. I for one would be willing to participate in any means necessary.

       Thanks to Alex Jones, the word, "conspiracy" tends to mean bullshit nowadays. I wish we could just call them, "untruths", but that would seem contrived, wouldn't it?

       That was not thanks to Alex Jones, that was thanks to the CIA after and since JFK's assassination.   The term first appeared to discredit those who posed alternate explanations to the events surrounding that coup d'Ã©tat.  Now it is used to smear anyone who doesn't believe what the government tells them.

       Actually, I had an idea for a sub today. It's a known fact that there are users on this site promoting a social agenda.
       <a href="/r/SocialAgenda">
        /r/SocialAgenda
       </a>
       or something to that effect - could be a sub devoted to listing users suspected of pursuing a paid agenda. We could compile lists for various agendas and the users associated with them. The users listed could potentially defend themselves from accusation, and it would be left up to the readership to pass judgement.

       This seems like a fairly good idea, vote rigging is an issue. even if the language is hazy, thats a double edged sword and even worse, it could be bent to either extreme.

       There's a long list of bull shit, we're all aware of it on this sub. I'm asking you guys how we're going to get this bullshit into the mainstream media. I feel like the legitimacy of these stories is lost when posted next to, "corporate ass-licking patsy for big business with a profoundly anti-democratic contempt for due process and international law." True as it may be. We need to inject these stories in a more palatable form to the mainstream news feeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the top posts in this sub - over 2k of upvotes. We have the people power to get those posts to the top of default subs where the entirety of reddit will be forced to consider what they seem so willing to brush off.

       This is an uphill fight. The current lack of exposure on mainstream subreddits does not result only from indifference of ordinary redditors. People who want to suppress this type of story have gained positions as moderators. They aggressively police the new page. They have their own subreddits from which they can summon downvote brigades. And the administrators implicitly support their actions.

       Woah there. I looked into the TOS about vote rigging, truthfully I gave it a skim, and it seems that what we're talking about here is defined pretty hazily. I don't think it would constitute a violation of the TOS to x-post from our threads in this sub to the default subs in an effort to drive the content into a more public domain. Then again, the TOS language regarding such activity seems to be intentionally left subject to interpretation. In effect, we'll never know if we don't successfully try, and fail.

       This is what TOSs are. Its a big legal "whatever". That said, if people dont complain it will be harder to justify.

       I have been trying. I spent all morning arguing with
       <a href="/r/TrueReddit">
        /r/TrueReddit
       </a>
       . A couple people said that this story was not great or insightful. I tried to explain that this is real god damn life. This is not some crazy conspiracy. This is an ongoing investigation.

       I think this is a great idea, if we all get together and focus on up-voting a select few stories each day in selected subs we may be able to start educating some people.
We should probably find a different place for us all to organize as I feel this subreddit is filled with watchful eyes.

       That was not thanks to Alex Jones, that was thanks to the CIA after and since JFK's assassination.   The term first appeared to discredit those who posed alternate explanations to the events surrounding that coup d'Ã©tat.  Now it is used to smear anyone who doesn't believe what the government tells them.
