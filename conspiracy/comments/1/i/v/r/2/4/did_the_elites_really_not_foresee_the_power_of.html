        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We all know the internet allowed people, especially awakened people like us, to connect like never before, exposing the their heinous crimes an uncensored way . If these elite/Rothschild Zionist/scumbags control the media and pretty much everything else, did they not foresee the Internet&#39;s affect on their schemes? They see the internet as a threat to their organization, but was the internet really something they did not plan? Or could it be part of their agenda?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Thanks for the comments. I have gotten a variety of answers, but from what I think that makes sense is that they want to see those who will oppose them. Pretty much what Weedtastic commented really hits it on the nose. But everyone had great insight into this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember the internet was developed by them.</p>

<p>They have for everything a reason and multiple plans.</p>

<p>I guess they never expected <em>how</em> the internet would be used by the general public.</p>

<p>After seeing these devolpments in recent years, they probably focused on data mining and getting from everybody there information.</p>

<p>What the NSA is doing today would be the Stasi&#39;s wet dream.</p>

<p>Maybe this was plan for the internet all along.</p>

<p>You are on the verge of a open dictatorship and want before going complete public all the information about those who would speak out.</p>

<p>However, it goes both ways.</p>

<p>The plan ahead and aren&#39;t stupid like most assume here on<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, they are arrogant but not stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is no real need to be scared.</p>

<p>overall they are behind with their plans and we have the power to change things.</p>

<p>Look at some of the recent events.</p>

<p>Edward Snowden &quot;leak&quot; did allow it to become public that they are spying.</p>

<p>they want you to be scared.</p>

<p>only if you are scared, they have control over you.</p>

<p>Michael Hasting was killed for his attempt to leak real information.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know what exactly what but if you follwing conspiracies and look what he said on tv before being killed, he was calling for the mainstream media to speak out and breaking real news.</p>

<p>They could have him easly killed in better way and not making it that obvious.</p>

<p>This was message to the Mainstream Media, keeping there mouths shut and at the same time looking what they can get away with.</p>

<p><strong>only if you are scared, they have control over you.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember that the elites are just people like us. They have a lot more money and political clout, but not more brains. They aren&#39;t any smarter then us. They are just more greedy. This is why we have seen calls for censorship, directly or indirectly, as of late. The Elites are starting to get the picture. They actually don&#39;t care about the Internet...as long as it stays out of the way. When it gets in the way of their plans, <em>then</em> they care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do have more brains than us. I mean, porbably both figuratively and literally. Think about it - we didn&#39;t do anything smart. Hey GAVE us the internet (literally), and if it was never given to us? Well we&#39;d be just as stupid but without the internet. I think they KNOW, it doesn&#39;t matter <em>what</em> we view, read, hear, etc., noone will ever do anything. They know action is king in this world - and there js no action left in the people.</p>

<p>Think about it like this: they could literally do a Fast and Furious here and just GIVE guns to radicals here in America. And you know what? People would go to the range with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I don&#39;t think the elite are That much smarter than average people. They probably knew about the technology and could predict with some accuracy where it would lead.  Bt all of that was publicly available.  They chose to mitigate by turning it into a palantir, so that whenever you look at anything, they can look at you with great scrutiny.  So now it&#39;s game on.  Fight for the hearts and minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine the internet like the next revolution in TV.  Except maybe they were surprised by the scope of what became possible.  Suddenly everyone had the power to make their own TV shows and broadcast them to anyone with a TV.  It slipped out of even their control...<em>temporarily</em>.</p>

<p>We are seeing them retake control.  It will eventually be like TV is now.  Specifically targeted programming that we can&#39;t modify.  Look at the iPhone.  We&#39;re already there.  People would rather have &quot;an app for that&quot; than even use the internet browser that comes with the phone.</p>

<p>Eventually...we won&#39;t have browsers on the phone.  It&#39;ll just be apps.  But first they&#39;ll make the internet a scary place where hackers can steal our credit card information (since we now do all our banking on our phones), or where they can break into our house (since home security is monitored remotely), etc...It won&#39;t be safe on the wild tubes outside our prepackaged apps.  We&#39;ll thank them for removing the danger...for removing temptation. </p>

<p>imo this is EXTREMELEY UNLIKELY, I think the web is here to stay because of the network effect.</p>

<p>Ultimatly it&#39;s true that the majority of the people neither understand or care about technology. But there are still more than enough hackers around that you&#39;d have heard something if it were suddenly to become impossible to do general purpose computing. You may want to google the name Cory Doctorow if you&#39;re feeling paranoid about these kinds of scenarios.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone gave some good insight on this. The internet was used by them to spread their filth i.e. the disgusting, unGodly messages, making people obsessed with materialism, degradation of morals etc., all over the world. And possibly and unforeseen downside were some people using it to communicate in an uncensored way. that is way they are vehemently trying to monitor and censor everything on the internet.</p>

i think they dont care if we do look up info, because the really important stuff is easy to hide anyway and they do want us to open our eyes a bit... if only to realize how much in control they are.
remember the internet was a military toy, its been under their control since its inception. the internet has pros and cons for them, but being able to spot dissidents seems worth it since no one goes out and does anything anyway</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly. it all seems impossible because we&#39;re stuck behind a computer. haha</p>

<p>but seriously, i think we are officially past that point. i honestly believe the next revolution wont be within this system, as it is like a bullet train going full speed ahead, which will introduce a sinister, global conspiracy. </p>

<p>what needs to be done by all our people is to create a parallel way of living, completely disconnected from whatever global system is being shoved down our throats. that means living off the official &quot;grid&quot;. a terrifying idea to some, but thats what they want. imagine whole communities with organic food, talented and smart people working together with knowledge of medicine, carpentry, etc.  hopefully there is a way of keeping a version of the internet up too (or something to circumvent the communications kill switch) so all these communities can keep in touch. hard? yes. doable? definitely. unfortunately i dont see this happening until total economic collapse and a few bloody noses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order to ferment rebellion and make the people riot there was a need to disseminate the conspiracy to a greater audience. Ergo the internet was given to us to create communities of information sharing among like minded people to rile them up into throwing off the shackles of the NWO cabal. Thus allowing them to bring in the answer they had already wanted to bring into the world in a much faster pace. Hegelian dialectic. Read up on Albert Pike&#39;s letter to Mazzini. Now someone needs to save us from the NWO after the rebellion against them is in full swing... The internet is just another part of the &quot;awakening.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying that attacking is futile. Develop your plans with intensity and vigor for their own sake. Not as an attack on the other. If you see a means to make the world more like YOU want it to be, take it. Thats what the elite we are discussing do. They don&#39;t bother themselves with the legalities or morality of the actions they intend, they take action. They don&#39;t concern themselves with whther the masses will stand behind them. They act and figure out how to bring the masses behind them, be it through propaganda techniques or violent coercion. You can do the same, and if you feel the moral position is important for your plans, then you can maintain them in your actions. But your actions should be devoted to making the world that you want to live in, not wasted on scuttling the world they want to live in.</p>

<p>We hear it on this board over and over again &quot;Its time to take action!&quot; But the people making the cry aren&#39;t taking action. They aren&#39;t saying, &quot;This is what I&#39;m doing, hop on board if you want.&quot; They aren&#39;t laying out their vision of the world. They are trying to find cannon fodder because they are too afraid of the perceived consequences of their non-actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t take action. You take action. What do you think will work? Do it. That is really all there is to it. There is no we, there is you and there is me. I have a plan that I think will work that is enabled by network technologies. When it is advanced enough, I&#39;ll put it up and if y&#39;all jive with it, you can jump on board while it suits your purposes and jump off when it doesn&#39;t. But for the time being, you (you polarpack, and you any other reader, not an abstract &#39;you&#39; that gets translated to everybody else (we)) need to make your plan and take what steps you can today to implement your plan. When you do that, the universe will put you in the position wherein your plan will succeed.</p>

<p>There is no we. We is how the community is prevented from acting. The &quot;elite&quot; didn&#39;t give any consideration to &quot;we&quot;. They each individually gave consideration only to &quot;me&quot;. And by all accounts its worked wonders for the implementation of their schemes.</p>
