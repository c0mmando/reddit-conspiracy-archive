    <div class="md"><p>Nah there are a large amount of users who don&#39;t read articles and only upvote based on the title, so having one that is attention grabbing and informative will help with that. Likewise posting it around 9am on the East Coast is one of the prime times where there are more users on and it will get out of the /new/ queue faster. The early momentum means the algorithm will put it higher on peoples front pages and it will get more upvotes throughout the day.</p>

<p>I sincerely doubt you&#39;d be here discussing this further if you were just some punk who rigged some votes, so I&#39;m on your side on this situation.</p>

<p>Did you contact this admin privately at all afterwards, or have any other form of further discussion on the matter with administrative staff?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been seeing this shadowban bullshit stepping up a bit recently and I&#39;m curious as to whether or not it&#39;s simply a matter of advertisement and shilling or if it goes any further than that.</p>

<p>That is not true, Erik. I was shaodwbanned for discussing the chris brown censorship fiasco in wtf with the ratpack-<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/18wg4p/reddit_has_its_own_bilderberg_group_consisting_of/c8ivmgv?context=3">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/18wg4p/reddit_has_its_own_bilderberg_group_consisting_of/c8ivmgv?context=3</a></p>

<p>I understand some tact is necessary for discussion, but I will not stand for outright lies.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I gave you hard evidence that one of your fucking administrators is engaging in manipulation for profit by using the circlecabals as a shill group for the Darden profile (Hmm, are some <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323777204578189663641495572.html">Boston Consulting Group execs friends with Yishan</a>?) and you say nothing, but yet you come in here acting as if we never came to terms?</p>

<p>Not to mention your blatant double stanard with regard to vote manipulation and briagdes, I have thousands of IRC logs proving SA has been vote gaming ever since <a href="/u/therealbarackobama">/u/therealbarackobama</a> took over SRS but you&#39;d never even give that a second glance because they helped you get ride of some legal content that was causing you headaches. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t pretend your lot has never censored or shadowbanned over opinions, because hundreds of people will come out of the wood work to show you the exact opposite is true. </p>

<p>Frankly I am a bit disappointed with you diplomatic acumen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically what stops reddit from being overrun by advertisers and shills is good moderation in the new queue (for big subs). When you have an inroad and can get beyond that initial moderation reddit is literally your plaything. Further still, if you owned the damn site you could stealthily (you have to manipulate content in a veiled manner or you&#39;ll be kicked out. Check out the stories of Ian Chong (solincvictous) or saydrah or cinsere from the annals of reddit lore) manipulate content while appearing to be a bastion of free flow of information.</p>

<p>When you start looking at which PR firms have vested interest with regards to manipulation on reddit things get fucking ugly. God I hate what my life has become, chasing these fucks day in and day out trying to use the cogency of the public forum to dispel their cowardly malfeasance. God help me.</p>

<p>I do agree. Their actions drive me to stop them from destroying the best mechanism of keeping the public forum cogent since the telephone.</p>

<p>And I appreciate your kind words, I do have a tendency towards the dramatic in my writing and I, for the most part, take on the charge I have fallen into with honor and gracious acceptance. Everyone gets a bad day though, ha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea; definitely look at the websites that are already being submitted and promoted to popularity on a particular subreddit.
