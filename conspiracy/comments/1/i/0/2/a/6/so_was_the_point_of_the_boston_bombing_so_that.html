    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let&#39;s just look at facts then. How about that. </p>

<p>Citizens United made it possible for corporations to give unlimited funds to politicians. </p>

<p>NDAA made possible the indefinite detention of American citizens without giving said citizen due process.  </p>

<p>The NSA has been spying on us and collecting data about American citizens. </p>

<p>Edward Snowden the man that gave the information to the public has been labeled a traitor to the American people. </p>

<p>Police are being militarized at an alarming rate, being given the power to shut down entire communities because of their investigations/man hunts.</p>

<p>Now, those are not speculation. They are facts. </p>

<p>Now given all that information, you&#39;re still going to claim that it&#39;s a far cry to say that the government has been manufacturing terrorists threats in order to take away more of our freedoms and better serve its corporate masters?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In particular I&#39;m referring to the &quot;theory&quot; that the event was completely staged and all those people were actors. Which is ridiculous.</p>

<p>In general, I don&#39;t think there is a conspiracy. On the scales of probability, I think it is far more likely that two guys became radicalized and built a couple of bombs, then a mass government conspiracy. All of that evidence is circumstantial, and IMO, an exaggeration. Give me hard evidence.</p>

<p>As for your question, OP, it depends on which conspiracy you give credence to. Whether it was to make martial law SOP for apprehending &quot;terrorists&quot;, a psyop to remove more of our civil liberties, or a satanic Illuminati ritual corresponding with astrological bodies, it does not deny the fact that there is something <em>wrong</em> and obviously misleading with the information TPTB have given us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THE ENTIRE FUCKING CITY WAS ON LOCKDOWN...and even if it was only where they they had legitimate reports of sightings...what the fuck is a report of a sighting, first...second, THE ENTIRE FUCKING CITY WAS ON LOCKDOWN, and third...that&#39;s where they found them? Excuse me, but they &quot;found&quot; them in two different locations.  By the way, the bombing itself was clearly a theatrical production in the first place. You&#39;re going to ask me to prove it, but I&#39;m not going to waste my time scouring the internet for every little piece of evidence I took the time to research, when your lazy ass can do that yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>20 blocks around Watertown were on lockdown. All of Boston, Waltham, Watertown, and IIRC Lexington were &quot;strongly encouraged&quot; to do so; in practice, this meant everything was closed and we were all stuck inside doing nothing for 2 days.</p>

<p>Yes, those of us in surrounding areas weren&#39;t &quot;technically&quot; on lockdown. But in practice, we were, and it was a huge unnecessary inconvenience that cost the Boston area untold millions in economic losses. </p>

<p>People that smoke weed daily don&#39;t become activists unless it&#39;s to make weed legal. They sit at home and they smoke weed and watch videos of people getting hit in the nuts. </p>

<p>Making weed legal is to keep people dumbed down. </p>
