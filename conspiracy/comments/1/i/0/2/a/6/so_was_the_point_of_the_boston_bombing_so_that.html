       I've read that LAPD shut down the city looking for someone that shot 2 cops, now they've shut down a neighborhood to look for a guy that loaded a weapon on camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this just what they do now? Cop thugs can just lock down a city or a portion of it whenever they want?

       It seems pretty wrong to force a innocent citizen (let alone entire city) to stay inside their home for ANY reason to me. I'm not from Boston, would anyone have gotten in trouble if they decided to walk to the grocery store or something while the city was on lockdown?

       Don't get me wrong, LAPD is scum, I heard they used drones to try to find dorner, (Besides shooting at random citizens, and trying to brush it off like it was nothing)

       People that smoke weed daily don't become activists unless it's to make weed legal. They sit at home and they smoke weed and watch videos of people getting hit in the nuts.

       It killed 3 people, but badly maimed many others. It's not different from the results of suicide bombings seen in Iraq and Afghanistan.

       Ok, let's just look at facts then. How about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Citizens United made it possible for corporations to give unlimited funds to politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       NDAA made possible the indefinite detention of American citizens without giving said citizen due process.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA has been spying on us and collecting data about American citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edward Snowden the man that gave the information to the public has been labeled a traitor to the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police are being militarized at an alarming rate, being given the power to shut down entire communities because of their investigations/man hunts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, those are not speculation. They are facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now given all that information, you're still going to claim that it's a far cry to say that the government has been manufacturing terrorists threats in order to take away more of our freedoms and better serve its corporate masters?

       In particular I'm referring to the "theory" that the event was completely staged and all those people were actors. Which is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, I don't think there is a conspiracy. On the scales of probability, I think it is far more likely that two guys became radicalized and built a couple of bombs, then a mass government conspiracy. All of that evidence is circumstantial, and IMO, an exaggeration. Give me hard evidence.

       I'm not saying it was staged at all. I'm saying just like the government flew planes into buildings on 9/11 and blamed a man they had put into power in the 80's they planted bombs and blew them up so that they could take away more or our freedoms in the name of "security"

       That staged and actors thing is a load of shit. They don't care who they hurt or kill. They care about implementing a feudalistic system where the "elites" control everything, and they're doing a damn good job of it.

       They were relatively small explosives, no huge engulfing fireball. They caused a lot of injuries.

       As for your question, OP, it depends on which conspiracy you give credence to. Whether it was to make martial law SOP for apprehending "terrorists", a psyop to remove more of our civil liberties, or a satanic Illuminati ritual corresponding with astrological bodies, it does not deny the fact that there is something
       <em>
        wrong

       and obviously misleading with the information TPTB have given us.

       THE ENTIRE FUCKING CITY WAS ON LOCKDOWN...and even if it was only where they they had legitimate reports of sightings...what the fuck is a report of a sighting, first...second, THE ENTIRE FUCKING CITY WAS ON LOCKDOWN, and third...that's where they found them? Excuse me, but they "found" them in two different locations.  By the way, the bombing itself was clearly a theatrical production in the first place. You're going to ask me to prove it, but I'm not going to waste my time scouring the internet for every little piece of evidence I took the time to research, when your lazy ass can do that yourself.

       20 blocks around Watertown were on lockdown. All of Boston, Waltham, Watertown, and IIRC Lexington were "strongly encouraged" to do so; in practice, this meant everything was closed and we were all stuck inside doing nothing for 2 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, those of us in surrounding areas weren't "technically" on lockdown. But in practice, we were, and it was a huge unnecessary inconvenience that cost the Boston area untold millions in economic losses.

       People that smoke weed daily don't become activists unless it's to make weed legal. They sit at home and they smoke weed and watch videos of people getting hit in the nuts.

       Making weed legal is to keep people dumbed down.
