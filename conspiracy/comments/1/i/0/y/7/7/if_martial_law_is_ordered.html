       Does anyone have any idea what they would do if tomorrow the order was given to implement nationwide martial law.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a plan?  Going Lone Wolf will get you killed but communication would be shut down nationwide to keep the citizens from banding together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know about storing ammo and supplies.
I know about storing food and medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't know is what the tactical plan is.  Any ideas?

       Aren't we already under martial law?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh sure, they came at it from the other side -- militarizing police rather than deputizing the military.  But the way I see it, we've been under martial law for a while now.

       By comparison to any historical example, martial law has already been declared in the US. Typical hallmarks of martial law include military jurisdiction on domestic soil (posse commitatus was overruled and domestic military jurisdiction was established in the 2011 NDAA), the suspension of civil liberties like rights from unreasonable search and seizure and rights to due process and legal representation (accomplished by Executive Order 13603, the AUMF, and the 2011 NDAA), government control of commerce and media (Executive Order 13603), suspension of rights of protest and peaceable assembly (these rights have been incrementally attacked through several SCOTUS rulings, illegallizing protests near secret service, protests in public parks, protests in front of the Supreme Court, and the use of speakers or microphones during protests), and mass incarceration (the US houses 25% of the world's prison population, and there are hundreds of documented, photographed internment camps set up all over the country to handle overflow from the prison complex).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only aspects of traditional martial law ennactments which are currently missing in the US are curfews and the ability of law enforcement personel to deputize citizenry (which of course you wouldn't want to do when the citizens are the enemy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Martial law is here. The laws have simply been amended so that a state of emergency doesn't need to be declared and Congressional approval didn't need to be obtained to ennact most of what martial law entails. It is simply the way of American life now.

       First there will be a big push against the government, and they will push back, and hard. And while the government is busy with political criminals , no one will be doing anything about the crime between citizens, and it's not that they wont be able to, they will see it as we're we're thinning ourselves out and letting crime run rampant will give people something else to focus on, keeping themselves and their families alive and safe from looters and the people that will want blow your head off just because they can get away with it. Once people are focused on fighting among themselves they can push their agenda forward and crack down even harder. and it's the american mentality, there are thousands sitting in their houses on the edge of their seat watching the news with hard ons waiting for this to finally happen. Everyone wants the zombie apocalypse right? this will be close enough, the chance everyone is waiting for to get up and start fighting each other, and it's no accident, we've been conditioned to do so by the countless post apocalyptic video games and movies that make us crave it by idealizing the idea of living day to day, roaming destroyed and abandonded cities, and their always set in urban areas. So to answer your question, I'll do what I have to in order to survive once it happens, and i'll be far far away from the city streets

       To have a tactical plan we need to be a team. We that do believe this will happen in the foreseeable future are labeled as crazies so its pretty much gonna be a free for all. Technology will probably be shut down so there would be no way for any of us to communicate unless we all make several safepoints to which are on record here or email and that's not possible to do secretly with NSA and all so all in all, we are screwed. Thats their point anyway. To screw the American People. Best tactical plan is to expose the government more and more until they're 100% incredible and useless. Which most likely won't happen because 90% of Americans are blind and refuse to see OUR governments atrocities. Good luck to us all.

       Your question is a good one, but sadly not one that should be answered on a public forum.  I think the answer is highly dependent on circumstances because it is a life-or-death decision.  The real question is would you sacrifice your life on principle, one that Snowden has already answered with a "Yes", assuming of course his leak wasn't part of a psyop designed to scare us from talking about things like this.  Fun, huh? (sarcasm)

       If internment and resettlement camps were an unavoidable part of the picture, then I would probably have to blow my brains out ahead of time. It's a grim reality for sure, but it would be the only sensible thing to do in my situation.

       The game plan for everyone else should be to make fast friends with people in high places because government workers, medical professionals, tech specialists, million-dollar men, and other "valuable" people will not be rounded up in cattle cars with the rest of us plebeians.

       And they won't be told what their objective is. They are on a need-to-know basis. They'll just be pressing a button or operating a drone. They won't be told that their target is american civilians, and if their realization can't be avoided, then the targets will simply be labled "radicalized extremists" or "terrorirsts" and the soldiers will pull the trigger anyway to honor the bloated, steroidal sense of patriotism with which they are regularly infused in military life.

       I have no such trust in our military. They will do as they are told so long as they keep getting a paycheck. Most of them.

       The fact that you think police aren't shooting citizens is telling. Many are decent people but many are also power tripping and would violate the constitution if it meant not being "back talked".

       And dogs are no safer than citizens apparently.
