       It's like going to the zoo and asking if one goat is better than another. - they're both freaking goats in captivity.

       They both get fed by the same hands and perform basically the same acts.

       On a certain level I agree that they are too similar, but part of the reason that the antiwar movement died down is that Obama hasn't started any new wars. Certainly his conduct of the current wars has been, IMO, appalling and possibly illegal. He didn't really mean change. However, Bush's administration lead us to invade a sovereign nation that was not resisting our requests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps Obama would have done the same in a similar situation, but with just the facts on the ground, I think Bush will stand out in history as an especially bad administration.

       He's been very adept at neutering "progressive" opposition. He screws progressives on the big issues, while pretending his hands are tied, then throws them little bones. He does stuff like advocating open data and allowing the submission of online petitions, then throws whisteblowers into the meat grinder.

       Pretty much this. Bush created all these fucked up programs in response to 9/11 because he was an idiot and the people screamed for it. Than Obama comes along, promises change, peace, hope and all this other bullshit; mystifies people by being black, and putting up a good front.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he fucks up by not only
       <em>
        continuing

       Bush's shit-tier programs, but goes ape-shit crazy with Executive Orders, creates more shit-tier programs, and has continued to hide things from the People making everything come across like he is conspiring to eliminate us.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least Bush owned up to being an idiot that only cared about oil. I really have no idea what Obama's agendas are expect reforming the country into something that is against our Constitution.

       Obama is a continuation of what was intensified during the Bush administration: the rapid consolidation of federal power on behalf of the money trust. The mid-term goal is to build a robust domestic counter-insurgence apparatus which they wouldn't need to do unless they plan on really screwing the population.

       Along with that, he created a disinformation / propaganda system that the Republicans could only dream of.  Bush had the Limbaugh / Hannity crowd, but they were sort of isolated and fervent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama has created shill teams (
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ) to create false perception across the mainstream media, social media, and so forth.  And the next Dem-Republican we elect is going to inherit all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, many people are still patting themselves on the back very publicly for electing Obama.  Nobody boasted about voting for Bush in public.

       Yup. It blows my mind. I'm pretty sure he has the full fucking backing of African-Americans, Hispanics, and anyone under the poverty line. All they can think about is "ooooah free benefits" while remaining uneducated about all the shit he has pulled in the past 5 years. If not him, his administration. I'm not racist or ignorant, but I swear the fact that he is of a different skin color is what caused such a stir and helped him get elected. People think it overrides everything bad he has done and that it helps unify America because he comes from a background and has a different skin color.

       I am placing bets our next president will be the one who dismantles all this shit and restores parts of the Constitution back into our country.

       Here's the thing--I think that they are about equally as terrible and evil; at least Bush came out and said "OK, we're gonna do this evil shit, and if you're not with
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       you're with the
       <em>
        terrorists!
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama just says "oh, don't worry, no evil shit here!" and goes ahead and does it anyhow--then blames the fact that he did it on a Republican congress (which DOES have some base in actual fact--but that's another story). It HAS gotten to the point though that if you say this to an Obama supporter their usual rejonder is "...think of what would have happened if RMoney was running the country!"--which is just more support of the false left-right paradigm.

       All I know is that, between the two of them, America has been utterly stripped of the things that once made her the greatest country in the world.

       RMoney would have had least helped dig us out of this financial shit hole. My brain tells me that because he has his own palace and a pretty large fortune. The guy knows how to make money, and not blow it on bullshit programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Bush did - I can semi-understand. The people screamed for heads. He was put into a really shitty position. I remember being 14 and running on a treadmill as news struck that we declared war. I remember feeling happy, that America was about to reign down with the smite of a thousand gods and send these fuckwads to play with 77 virgins. Over 10 years later...I'm pretty sure the threat is gone now...You can stop spying me and data mining my porn preferences and listening to my phone calls.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if the threat is gone...shouldn't they be focusing on finding the training camps and big heads of terrorist organizations instead of looking for a nonexistent needle in a haystack?

       Same.  Both impotent slaves to corporate interests.  The biggest difference is Obama's deceptive nature.  With Bush, you knew what you were getting.  There were no delusions of "hope" or "change".  Obama is an out-and-out liar.

       Yes. Bush at least had a spine and seemed sincere in his conviction. And he created programs like No Child Left Behind and did a lot of good in Africa that goes unsung. The WMD fiasco was exonerated by Wikileaks - look it up. And I say this as someone who deeply opposes the "Patriot" Act. Obama and his administration has consistently lied to the people, dwarfed the Patriot Act, and has exhibited extreme naiveté towards (or is sympathetic towards) radical islamists. So, yeah.

       Bush installed a bunch of bad bureaucrats and congress has stalled all of Obama's appointments.  Bush is the worst president after Hoover.

       Obama is basically a charismatic Cheney that has created a damn near cult like vibe from his followers. At least that's my perception of him.

Cheney is Obama and Biden is Bush.

       Definitely!  No matter what Bush did, he could still make you laugh of his dyslectic clumsiness and lack of intellect. He looked like the definition of an ideal puppet. I have a tiny bit of sympathy for him, because he seems extremely easy to influence.
      </p>

       For Obama I have nothing but pure disgust. He's certainly sharp enough to know 110% the reach and damage of every one of his moves.

       With this I can agree, you could always call Bush out for his goofyness, while blaming Cheney as the devil and mastermind behind the construction of CMIC 2.0.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Obama, with his pompous qualifications, there is no fucking excuse of his unawareness of Constitutional rape, under his term. Personally I believe the present "Gay Civil Rights" movement is simply a facade to what the public is finally waking up to.
