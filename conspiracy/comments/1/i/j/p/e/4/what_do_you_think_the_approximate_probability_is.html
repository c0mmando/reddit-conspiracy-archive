    <div class="md"><p>I know youre not a shill but: why is it that to &#39;skeptics&#39; the only way anything could be a conspiracy is for the government to actually come out and admit it? Im sure if i told you that the Gulf of Tonkin never happened youd say i was a crazy conspiracy theorist, except that its been admitted so you really cant claim much. If i told you the CIA is manipulating the news you say i was crazy except for the fact that Mockingbird has been exposed. If i told you Martin Luther King was killed by the US government you say the same until you became aware that it has been found the case in a court of law.  Same goes for operation Gladio, Mockingbird, Manhattan Project, Iran-Contra, MK ULTRA, Stellar Wind, PRISM, and the dozens of other programs that made people here &#39;crazy conspiracy theorists&#39; for considering or believing until it came to a point where these things were admitted and thus youve got no ground at all to stand on. </p>

<p>So Why is it that youre a crazy person who cant think if you even look at the evidence of a case and deem it suspicious? If all the evidence pointed to him <em>not</em> being murdered, and people then said &quot;he <em>obviously</em> wasnt murdered&quot;, i guarantee you would not be criticizing them for their conclusion because thats the conclusion theyre &#39;supposed&#39; to come to. Its only when you use deductive reasoning and evidence compilation to come to the wrong conclusion that youre a &#39;stupid conspiracy theorist&#39;. </p>

<p>If the engine stayed in the car, there were skid marks, the car didnt explode until it hit the tree, he was a drunk, had a history of DUIs or reckless driving, and the fbi wasnt investigating him, and he wasnt investigating the CIA, etc etc the logical conclusion would be to say that he got drunk and crashed into a tree. If i even <em>suggested</em> otherwise youd probably call me a crazy conspiracy theorist (and at least youd have decent grounds to say so seeing as i was basing my conclusion off nothing at all)</p>

<p>But if the engine flew out of the car, the car was said to have been on fire before the crash, there were no skid marks, he hit the tree at something like 100 miles an hour, no history of reckless driving, hadnt taken a drink in 5 years (so they say anyway), he WAS being investigated by the FBI, is VERY anti establishment, was supposedly working on a piece on the CIA--said it was his biggest story EVER, already caused a lot of trouble getting when his piece got a US general fired, all the evidence of the crash consistent with a &quot;hacked&quot; car, his body was cremated (which would avoid any second autopsy), and the fact that there is nothing the CIA and the FBI love more than assassinating people, and you come to the conclusion that he was assassinated, youre an unthinking idiot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that it was obvious that Hastings <em>wasn&#39;t</em> murdered. I was only criticizing benjamidees saying that Hastings was &quot;obviously murdered&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe he was murdered and maybe he wasn&#39;t, but it&#39;s not obvious. Certain &quot;facts&quot; are being enshrined in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which are probably wrong. For example, the two in this post&#39;s title that (1) his car &quot;blew up mysteriously&quot; and (2) he was &quot;cremated without familial request&quot;.  I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that the car &quot;blew up&quot; at all, much less mysteriously. It caught fire in a violent collision, but that&#39;s not the same as an explosion. And the story that Hastings was cremated is from one reporter quoting one source and that source has denied telling her that.</p>

<p>The crash itself is unusual, and combined with the other circumstances, it is suspicious, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it was obviously murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize then. I agree that saying irrefutably he was murdered is not substantiated but it definitely is not ridiculous to find it likely, and IMO the evidence is teetering on the brink of &quot;definitely murdered&quot;. However the cremation thing and the engine flying thing are only 2 of the oddities spoken about in recent days. Even if neither of those things were true, there is still substantial evidence for an assassination.  If you are unaware of the other things which support the idea of a conspiracy the following video should catch you up to speed along with sourcing everything which is discussed. </p>

I said it was weird being at a funeral and the body is missing. You know. Not there. Because it was in LA</p>

<p>SSG Joe Biggs @Rambobiggs 16 Jul<br/>
and that the remains were cremated. I also said I wasn&#39;t sure if that&#39;s what Michael wanted or the family.</p>

Yes - Not good. This should all be left - so u and family Friends  can grieve in private. ♥</p>

<p>3 - Body too badly burned, only safe way is cremation.</p>

<p>4 - Coverup.</p>

<p>Each of these can be a reason, but since you should always use logic and reasoning as well as past evidence, a cover up is probably not what happened - most likely someone in the family gave consent and just hasn&#39;t talked to the media.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#39;d be willing to bet none of what you&#39;ve posted were actually head on collisions.</p>

<p>A head on collision with a tree, in the case of Hastings Mercedes, would have pushed the engine back into the passenger compartment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why people don&#39;t see this. The story is, Hastings took a header into the tree, and as a result, the car burst into flames. The engine can&#39;t fly through the tree. The engine only could have come out <strong>before</strong> the car came to rest against the tree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no doubt the engine came out the front of that car. There&#39;s no doubt in what you&#39;re saying that a high speed offset collision could eject the engine.</p>

<p>That forces us to ignore the resting position of the car. Anyone who&#39;s played pool knows how deflection works. Heres an offset crash of a 2012 Mercedes. I don&#39;t know how similar it is to Hastings car but the physics still apply. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG9h4XMJv6Y&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG9h4XMJv6Y&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a>
If, as you say, Hastings car hit the tree hard enough to eject the engine in a front/offset collision, it would have taken the exact same path as the Mercedes in the video. Hastings car would have ended up in the middle of the street, and not stayed resting against the tree it supposedly hit. </p>

<p>That hard of an impact certainly would have deflected hastings car, just as in the video. That&#39;s why I say, there&#39;s something wrong with the story.</p>

<p>Edit: Look at any of the impacts on YouTube that are offset like that. They <em>all</em> have one thing in common, the car deflects. Hastings car, travelling twice or three times the speed would have deflected much much further than the 6&quot; his car can to rest away from that tree as well as the final position of the car. These are inherent crash dynamics you just can&#39;t ignore. They&#39;re all going to do it regardless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>No!!</strong> You are wrong! Every photo you just showed me is a collision at the center point of the car where the vehicle wraps around the object it hit. Notice how none of their engines are gone? Notice that when I said above &quot;the engine would be pushed back toward the engine compartment&quot; the pictures you show here prove my point precisely!</p>

<p>So which way was it? Did he hit front and center, forcing the car to stay wrapped around the tree it hit which would have pushed the engine rearward, rather than ejecting it 100+ feet</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>Hastings car hit the tree at a high enough rate of speed to eject the engine from the car while simultaneously defying physics and keeping the car near the object it collided with while at the same time making enough room to eject the engine clean from the car.</p>

<p>Cause you can&#39;t have it both ways yet the pictures you presented as evidence of hastings car and its location at the tree and the impact damage of the drivers front show both things happened. The car is still next to the tree <em>and</em> its engine is missing.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re ignoring the forces involved. Look at the video I posted again. See how far that car moves from its impact site? See how far hastings car is from the tree it hit? Yet the speeds were double or TRIPLE and were supposed to believe that a faster moving car would move LESS than the slower moving car? Bullshit!</p>

<p>Know what else I think? You&#39;re a shill trying to tire me and frustrate me into giving up the fight. Not gonna happen. <em>**Michael Hastings was MURDERED!!</em>*</p>

<p>Its not convincing when the physics doesn&#39;t add up. Its not convincing when Hastings clearly went out of his way to send an email speaking of government investigation into himself. We&#39;re just supposed to believe all this is one big coincide? And its all just coincidental <strong>AND</strong> we have to ignore physics when I&#39;ve shown you video proof of what happens in that sort of collision? You&#39;re out of your mind!</p>

<p>Rotating counter clockwise 15° and 6&quot; from the tree. Right. At speeds fast enough to eject the engine, right? Yet the video I showed you was less than 60mph. So, a slower car moves from during a crash than a faster moving car--this is what you&#39;re saying?</p>

<p>Some stats (over 4 years)-  </p>

<ul>
<li>0.13% fatality rate from vehicle fires. </li>
<li>mechanical and electrical malfunctions responsible for 2/3 of the fires (could play into that whole &quot;hacking the car&quot; theory). </li>
<li>Collisions accounted for only 4% of the automobile fires.</li>
</ul>

<p>So with those numbers.  I&#39;d say the odds are pretty slim without some foul play.  The cremation thing adds a lot to the suspicion.  Although realistically, his body could have been burned so bad that cremation was the only option left.  And since the fire is what killed him, an autopsy would have provided little/no confirmation of foul play.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all reality it doesn&#39;t really come into play. If he was murdered it was probably done by forcing him to lose control of the car in one of two ways.
1) drugs. In this case an autopsy would be good because they could point to some drug problem to discount his claims.
2) hacking the car which would mean that an autopsy would show... he died in a car crash.</p>

<p>His body was probably so badly burned that they assumed cremation was the only option when the coroner released the body.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think this adds anything. If he was killed, the crash was probably real-as in it happened, not that it was an accident. It would be better to focus on figuring exactly what he was doing that would make somebody want him dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What frustrates me is that some people ::ahem:: r/news, think this is conspiracy. It is too obvious to be anything else! What would make this conspiracy is if we learn that Hastings is alive and had faked his own death. Aggh!! Why can&#39;t people connect the dots? It&#39;s as if nothing can be proven until Fox News has covered it. You would think that after this NSA crap people would start to get it...but they don&#39;t. They still don&#39;t. ::sigh::</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that also boggles my mind about this is why aren&#39;t people flipping their shit over a brand new Mercedes blowing the fuck up upon impact? I mean, if I owned a Mercedes and heard about this story, I&#39;d be a little fucking concerned that my new $50K car could potentially explode upon impact. </p>

<p>When the whole Toyota gas pedal issue happened, people had a shit storm about it and Toyota recalled their vehicles to investigate and fix the issue, yet no one is saying anything about Mercedes&#39; potential luxury bomb on wheels? Either people know for a fact that this incident is complete bullshit and was a setup, or people are really fucking stupid. </p>

<p>Hastings&#39; friend and confidant SSgt. Joe Biggs disclosed a macabre twist in the award-winning journalist&#39;s death in a suspicious single-car accident. According to SSgt. Biggs, &quot;Michael Hastings&#39; body was returned to Vermont in an urn.&quot;</p>

<p>He further alleged, &quot;Family members did not want Michael&#39;s body cremated.&quot;</p>
