       there is plenty people who are smart, but just ignorant to the world around them, to tell you the truth I could do without the idiots that are only attracted by meme's. There is nothing wrong with infographics, more facts and less jokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meme's could hurt more then help, for starters the MSM can use it against us to call any movement immature (I.E. Anonymous/guy fawkes mask) and also promoting strength through education would make more sense through infographics, then some shit joke meme

       Not fliers, MEME's. Fliers usually hold more info(Infographics have less words then fliers most of the time) and aren't omunious with 3-4 words and a picture you have to had been a 80's-90's nerd to recognize most the references.

       I agree with you. For many people, reading an infograph is too much work so a 1-2 sentence meme would be great. Easy to read, simple, and it can get the point across.

       I think we should take something back. You know like something that was used to make fun of people like us, put the old 23 skidoo on it and give it the old "WHO"S LAUGHING NOW BITCHES". This perfectly illustrates it, like grabbing their hands and making them hit themselves in the face like my older brother used to me. "why are you hitting yourself?" check it! We are now at PAULCON 1 ITS

       You are probably right, however if we were dealing with the douchewagons in r/conspiratard, it would have to be something that puts their beliefs at odds with most other intellectuals. They cannot think for themselves and only accept things that are considered normal. They have to be made to think that what they believe is for what ever reason dumb for them to change. The script needs to be flipped, on them. They cannot mentally deal with standing out in a crowd. This is not you average person though. Some will need to be shamed into it. The Skeptic may be a lost cause though and you are right. We would be stooping to their level. Which has little chance of working even on them but would also push away anyone actually willing to agree that these things are plausible.

       that was kind of my point. the place looked ridiculous in an environment that is largely sympathetic to atheism (reddit), largely due to the usage of image macros and the like. I don't see how that isn't a good piece of evidence that the image macro tactic would have trouble helping a minority opinion make a successful introduction to a less sympathetic audience

       The yellow dots can be used to trace back to the place that sold the printer that printed the document. From here the government can requisition your personal transaction information, or just use old security footage.

       Bullshit. It identifies the MODEL of printer used. It's
       <em>
        highly
       </em>
       implausible that printer manufacturers would program each printer based on which retail store it will be distributed to in order to identify where they were purchased, much less encode onto the page your personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's mainly laser printers that use the yellow dots. Your home inkjet printer is unlikely to have this "feature", as they're less likely to be used for forgery.

       The model's serial number is included in the dot, which is unique per printer. The store won't likely know which serial number went to which customer, unless you bought an extended warranty, but knowing which store had which serial number greatly reduces the search space.

       But how do we know that these yellow dots don't also include information (such as IP address) from the computer that the printed document came from? I don't know much about how things like this work, so this just be my tinfoil hat showing.

       You mean I have been wasting all my precious time picking those strips out with my finger nails, and all you have to do is microwave them? Fuck balls. I think cash has become worse than a debit card. Pretty soon they will be asking us to turn in our neighbors if they have more than 100 dollars in cash on them. The most egregious thing is, this type of shit doesn't ever stop until it's put to an end, usually by some sort of force. I just let my buddy know who came to crash at my house last night, that I filed a complaint with the Better business bureau. It stated, I'm filing this complaint against the corporation of the United States of America, for violating mine and my fellow citizens constitutional rights, and there is an affidavit proving our president is illegal, and we are under duress. He said, I will open the door when they knock on it, I said they won't knock dude. We laughed. I'm just trying everything I can think of to put pressure on TPTB, by any means. My goal is to make Obama's kill list. That would be, in my opinion, a very honorable death. "My only regret is I have but one life to give, for my country" back then country meant people not government. Hale said that to the British after being caught spying.

       This terrifies me, not just for the reason of civil liberties, but on how fucking stupid law enforcement must be that with all this technology, they can't put my drug dealer in jail even with him being so very obvious, plus all these abilities to catch him red handed. Unless he is an interquel part of the CIA's sales force. Unwittingly supplying countless stacks of currency, to fund more black-psy-ops. Which has to be the case or they are just plain dumb, but like a special kind of dumb. Too sad to make fun of dumb. If I wasn't a cop I would be folding cardboard boxes kind of dumb.

       yes herd you like a prize winning australian shepherd. I don't think they are using this spying apparatus for anything but stealing corporate e-mails and staying at the front of the bread line if you know what I mean. Stealing good ideas from other countries getting an economic advantage. This is and was conveniently left out of the narrative from the start. Its in the interest of national security to gain an economic advantage, is it not?

       I think this is precisely the problem. I used to walk through a square in Islington all the time on my way to and from Uni in London..I can't remember the name...great pub...offices for the LSO are over there...anyway, it was known as a "people's square" filled with terrible unreadable over filled circlejerky propaganda.

       I am incredibly on board with this cause but we cannot let "the perfect" keep us from putting out SOMETHING!

       They win because they don't care about the sandard upon which they print the message. Just getting the message to drown out the truth.
      </p>

       I say, we put out as much of as many kinds of materials as possible, and we share what's working. Everyone put whatever you believe is best out there.

       Propaganda is a very strong tool. It has been used for decades even in times of peace into molding our modern society. Propaganda is more than words or pictures, but sheer manipulation of public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately most people, just like Plato's Cave or The Matrix, just prefer living in their comfort zone. The sun (truth) scares them, and anyone who poses a threat to their worldview is a threat to their existanve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's hopeless, just that most people just refuse reality and prefer to simply accept the official version, they are scared to knpw that the government has no control, that institutions which they rely on are useless taken as a whole.

       Well I appreciate your understanding.

       Tips? Hm.. Well I guess sometimes to beat the game you have to play it against the game's creator.

       Your target for an audience is also very crucial.

       I am not going to waste my time trying to convert an Obama supporter for the past 5 years to understand my philosophy. For the most part, that person is already so diluted that you stand no chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people flock to whatever is trending. It's what gives mainstream media such influence to how they act or think.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why waste time trying to penetrate an enigma that is brainwashed when you can send a message to hundreds if not thousands of people who are practically fully ignorant of the tyranny taking place around the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the innocent minds that are most understanding and with those minds we can grow our numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can eventually coincide with those pesky 5 yr Obama supporters because they are finding themselves to be out numbered, which sadly enough may be the only feasible way of having them spark an original thought or two, thus bringing them closer to an enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it in more simpler words, "Lions don't concern their opinions with sheep." Seek out a greater purpose of reaching out to those who don't know what to think. An impeccable message, one that can be a sentence in length, one that can let seedlings grow into plants.

       Let's over

       It seems to me like the majority of the American public has no idea what their government is really up to. I find that too many people are oblivious to the real reasons for the NSA spying, the Egypt protests, the Syrian conflict, and other issues. The ugly side of the American government is now revealing its true nature, and we're living during a crucial time where we must let others know about the level of corruption that is present in our political and economical systems.
People need to wake up from their lives of distraction and begin thinking about their future from a greater perspective. Our future is not what we think it will be. Our technologies have been shaping our culture and will continue to do so in an accelerated rate. It won't be a future for the individual. It will be a future for the collective. Most, if not all problems, can be fixed if we all act on it. But each of us has to put our hearts and minds to it. We're living in a society that is more connected than ever, and we have more power than we can comprehend. I don't know about you, but I really don't want corrupted, selfish, power-hungry, out-dated individuals to decide the future of our planet. I feel it's time for some real change. And this change will only begin by spreading awareness.

       What if at outdoor festivals with building around there was a way to dump a bunch of papers with different urls on them. People will wonder what they are. Just urls nothing explaining it. Just to create mystery so people will be eager to find out. Just an idea.

       more of this defeatist attitude.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       What gives? this is r/conspiracy. we should be foaming at the mouth right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another user had a pretty sweet idea. We (the community) make a short video file, explaining the basics of how we are being deceived and lied to. Nothing too deep, and no assumptions. No claims should be made, only questions should be asked and the only thing presented should be hard facts, no assumptions or leaps (this is where many CTs start to disagree)
      </p>
      <p>
       This video is then put onto CDs, wrapped in a piece of paper, with a cryptic message about the contents of the CD and instructions to return the paper and CD if youre not interested or to copy and spread the CD, much like it was found.
      </p>
      <p>
       These CDs can go everywhere. you an buy several thousand for a few bucks, and leave them at the park, in an elevator, waiting room. Hand it out to someone anything. Worst case scenario, somoene throws it away, but so what?

       You bet your ass we are, large. Do as you must. And good luck. But I know how the general mood of the public is. Scared. And somewhat Apathetic. This is not good, I grant you. But I think shock will be the only real thing that will their attention, sadly.

        How is the CD supposed to fit into my phone?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well theres your problem, CDs go into computers not cell phones. Try using a laptop or desktop.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       You completely missed the point, and on multiple levels.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is to distribute information locally, to strangers. something you cant do with "networking". especially in this day in age were peoples minds are bombarded with dings and blips that require their attention. A physical written note and CD will catch a persons attention more than a text or topic on some blog will.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         CDs, are cheap, common, easily accessible and easily readable. simply putting in the CD and taking it out takes more time than the burning process.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The data isnt in the cloud, its in your hand. therefore, more secure. more control
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Theres a clear difference between having something shoved down your throat and stumbling upon something. humans reject anything forced on them, its human nature. by allowing it to be found by the person on their own, their is already more interest, curiosity, and personal connection with said stranger than anything you can do over multimedia.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       exactly. Sad to say, most of society wants to lead interesting lives and wish live in a Hollywood-esque style movie, or as close to it. Finding a cryptic message with an unmarked CD will definitely reinforce the "drama" people crave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol definitely no reptilians mearly show people somethings going on behind the curtain. Simply asking a question like
       <em>
        "Will your government go as far as to kill American civilians and soldiers to leverage public (your) opinion for their own gains?"
       </em>
       and then showing something like Operation Northwoods documentation. It doesnt matter where you stand on any political issue, things like that would definitely shake some bolts loose.

       there is plenty people who are smart, but just ignorant to the world around them, to tell you the truth I could do without the idiots that are only attracted by meme's. There is nothing wrong with infographics, more facts and less jokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meme's could hurt more then help, for starters the MSM can use it against us to call any movement immature (I.E. Anonymous/guy fawkes mask) and also promoting strength through education would make more sense through infographics, then some shit joke meme

       yes herd you like a prize winning australian shepherd. I don't think they are using this spying apparatus for anything but stealing corporate e-mails and staying at the front of the bread line if you know what I mean. Stealing good ideas from other countries getting an economic advantage. This is and was conveniently left out of the narrative from the start. Its in the interest of national security to gain an economic advantage, is it not?

       Well I appreciate your understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tips? Hm.. Well I guess sometimes to beat the game you have to play it against the game's creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your target for an audience is also very crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not going to waste my time trying to convert an Obama supporter for the past 5 years to understand my philosophy. For the most part, that person is already so diluted that you stand no chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people flock to whatever is trending. It's what gives mainstream media such influence to how they act or think.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why waste time trying to penetrate an enigma that is brainwashed when you can send a message to hundreds if not thousands of people who are practically fully ignorant of the tyranny taking place around the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the innocent minds that are most understanding and with those minds we can grow our numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can eventually coincide with those pesky 5 yr Obama supporters because they are finding themselves to be out numbered, which sadly enough may be the only feasible way of having them spark an original thought or two, thus bringing them closer to an enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it in more simpler words, "Lions don't concern their opinions with sheep." Seek out a greater purpose of reaching out to those who don't know what to think. An impeccable message, one that can be a sentence in length, one that can let seedlings grow into plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's over
       <em>
        grow
       </em>
       the government. The weeds will be overlooked soon enough.
