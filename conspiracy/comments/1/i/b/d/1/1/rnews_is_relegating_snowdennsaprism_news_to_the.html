<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/">http://www.reddit.com/r/news/</a></p>

<p>Their first submit button is called &#39;submit nsa/prism/snowden article&#39; and links to the submit form for <a href="/r/inthenews">/r/inthenews</a>  </p>

<p>The sidebar says the stated purpose of r/inthenews is for or opinion, analysis, and discussion of recent events but now the mods just direct whatever content they want removed from r/news over there???</p>

<p>previously r/news had a banner which mocked the interest in NSA related stories as documented here:<br/>

<p>On the website of the monumental failure of a &quot;protest rally&quot; <a href="http://www.restorethefourth.net/faq/">restorethefourth.net</a> they very bizarrely attribute <em>everything</em> about the still developing spying revelations story to the <em>Washington Post</em> while not even mentioning <em>The Guardian</em>. When in fact the <em>Washington Post</em> reporter went immediately to the CIA/FBI/NSA/etc. after being contacted by Snowden. Upon them telling Snowden that they did this he replied “I regret that we weren’t able to keep this project unilateral.”, and from then on he worked exclusively with <em>The Guardian</em> and Glenn Greenwald.</p>

<p>It&#39;s controlled opposition and <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> is infected as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment and thread is the #1 most blatant proof that restore the 4th is controlled opposition.</p>

<p>This depresses the ever living hell out of me. I don&#39;t even care about the world anymore. That the people behind this can blatantly say and tout things suh as <strong>actually restoring the constitution</strong> all the while meaning the exact opposite is proof that these people do not care and never have cared about law and order, liberty, freedom, an open society, individuality, individual rights, or anything else that is conceptually separate from the rule of dictatorships. These people are subhuman. They don&#39;t deserve rehabilitation - as they are incapable of returning to any former state that they never had. They are cells in the cancer that is the human race.</p>

<p>Fuck this life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commiserate with you on this but by dehumanizing them you&#39;re stooping down to their level. They&#39;re just closed-minded <a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/%7Ealtemey/">authoritarians</a> doing what they do best, lying and deceiving for their own personal gain and amusement.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s fallacious equivocation that probably has its roots in Christianity. I&#39;m not &quot;stooping&quot; and I&#39;m certainly not stooping to <em>their</em> level. Sometimes you have to come to grips with the fact that some people are operationally incapable of being a team player (in this case, team = the human race). Thinking like that (to be fair, in conjunction with our shit system) is why we let repeat offenders out constantly.</p>

<p>Life sucks and this is a violent unfair world - and that includes that the world is better off with certain people not existing.</p>

<p>And for what it&#39;s worth - think that that kind of thinking has amounted to utter inaction.</p>
