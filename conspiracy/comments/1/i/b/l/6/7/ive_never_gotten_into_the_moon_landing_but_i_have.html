        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These questions are purely speculative, I&#39;m just curious. Nevertheless I know I&#39;ll be receiving downvotes on our own board just because it&#39;s this topic. I don&#39;t have any opinions, just some questions.</p>

<p>(1) The Apollo 11 mission roundtrip was over 400,000 miles in 1969. In the following 44 years, the farthest a human has been into space is 400 miles. What. You know, usually with experience and technology, you increase your capabilities, not stay static or go backward for half a century. What&#39;s the reason we are not only so far from pushing the boundaries of humans in space 50 years later (and for the foreseeable decades), but not even a fraction of the way to repeating it?</p>

<p>(2) Where are the 700 boxes, the 3,500 reels of Apollo 11 telemetry data? They aren&#39;t in a vault, in a museum, in a shrine for being the greatest achievement of the planet&#39;s history.....but they are just unabashedly lost. How.</p>

<p>(3) The Apollo 11 mission cost $355 million in 1969 ($2.25 billion today). NASA said in 2005 a new moon mission would cost $104 billion. Logically, if you produce a product safely and effectively one time, shouldn&#39;t the cost become streamlined or cheaper? With 44 years&#39; better technology, why is the budget 5,000% more to repeat the same thing? I can understand some safer technology...but not a 50:1 cost discrepancy. (b) why is NASA spending $800 million to develop a new spacesuit - if they used them in 1969 to perfect safety, why are they starting from scratch? Usually in business you build on your groundwork, not redo everything for 5,000% the original cost</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware there are a thousand other salient points, but I&#39;ve had these circumstantial questions for a year and haven&#39;t been able to get an answer as to the why&#39;s here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My grandfather designed the navigational control panel for the Apollo capsule.  I&#39;ve held the blueprints in my hands.  He worked for a private engineering firm that was contracted out by NASA to do the capsule design.  I&#39;m not sure what the company was called, however. </p>

<p>He also invented the machine that puts those little metal clips on the ends of frozen sausages.  </p>

<p>The answer to your questions is simple, they&#39;ve delegated work to private contractors who have upped their prices because they can.  If its government money, the sky is the limit when it comes to the honey pot.   Same reason why college is more expensive, why any private contracting done by private firms for the government is more expensive now than then.  Back in the 60s this whole scheme was not as prevalent.  Now that everyone has figured it out the prices are upped.  It&#39;s all a scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this tells you...what?</p>

<p>You really think, that if the landings were fake, that NASA wouldn&#39;t go through the motions? That panel WAS used--just not the exact one he designed, and not for those missions.</p>

<p>We were in the middle of one of the costliest wars to date then--not to mention the Cold War. The &quot;Moonshots&quot; were all about two things--funneling &quot;black&quot; money budgeted to NASA to the military, and the militarization of space (rather, the beginnings of it). Of course, remember also that Russia was nearly 2 years ahead of us in EVERY WAY regarding space--it says a LOT that they could never overcome the technical/physical hurdles to put a man on the moon. You&#39;d think they&#39;d at least send a dog, right? But no--the Russians mantain that there was NO WAY to put men on the Moon and still do to this day--even though, even at present, their space tech FAR exceeds the US&#39;. They mantain that sending a MAN to the Moon would have required a ship made from lead or concrete--hardly good materials for aviation uses.</p>

<p>Remember that a fake Moon landing is a LOT cheaper than a real one--even if all the parts were made. My neighbor worked on the software for the guidance computer (at MIT) and NASA had NO specs--they just let the engineers &quot;wing it.&quot; Now keep in mind that several companies existed at this time that MADE guidance systems. Why let MIT do it--and with NO SPECS to boot? Its pretty easy to see that the reason Charles Draper had free-reign in the software design was because <em>NASA never intended on using it</em>--at least not on those missions.</p>

<p>NOBODY can tell me how they got past the Van Allen belts. Those ships had NO sheilding--only walls as thick as two pieces of tinfoil. The suits had no shielding. So...how did they get through a large belt of intense radiation that Man cannot live through? And pass through the micrometeorites? How does one cool a space capsule like this?? Excuse me if I&#39;m stating the obvious but doesn&#39;t &quot;air conditioning&quot; need copius qualities of, you know, <em>air</em> to work??</p>

<p>Your grandfather doubtlessly designed <em>something</em> that was useful to NASA--but it most assuredly did NOT fly to the Moon. And BTW, if he&#39;s still alive, tell him that those &quot;sausage clips&quot; were pure brilliance--no shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Van Allen Belt doesn&#39;t encircle the globe, it&#39;s just really thick in some areas, this I know, they knew full well about that in the 60s and it was a factor in the trajectories.  </p>

<p>I have no doubts they went to the moon.  Yes I&#39;ve heard all of the theories and some are compelling but I&#39;ve met people who know for sure.  </p>

<p>It was just a massive project that in the end was pretty much pointless because at the time the technology really wasn&#39;t there to do much on the moon, they could get there but that&#39;s about all they could afford.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Precisely. It&#39;s 264,000 miles one-way to the Moon and the route is fraught with micrometeorites, intense radiation, and NO AIR. Also keep in mind that we &quot;got there&quot; on less than .0012% of the fuel Von Braun said would be necessary. A &quot;slingshot&quot; would work <em>coming back</em> from the Moon--NOT going there. GPS satellites are 12,000 miles up and NOT ONE has gone out of orbit and went crashing into the moon thanks to GRAVITY. The point at which the Moon&#39;s gravitational pull exceeds Earth&#39;s does not occur until very close to the Moon.</p>

<p>2) Keep in mind it&#39;s not JUST the tapes that are lost--it&#39;s also 93% of the &quot;moonrocks&quot; (many of the ones given out were fakes like the Dutch &quot;moonrock&quot;--the most overinsured piece of petrified wood in history), ALL of the video, ALL of the film, ALL of the stills (minus some in NASA archives), ALL of the blueprints, ALL of the medical data, and ALL of the ship&#39;s telemetry data...not just for one mission--we are talking about <em>the entire Apollo and Gemini programs</em>!</p>

<p>Maybe somebody needed them to tape the Superbowl--or some raunchy home porn.</p>

<p>3) The &quot;new&quot; suit from Oceaneering is most likely going to be cancelled quietly according to NASA. We&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>Your questions are all very good ones. I&#39;d suggest heading over to Dave McGowan&#39;s site and reading &quot;Wagging the Moondoggie&quot; for some pretty damn irrefutable evidence that we did not, and still CANNOT, get to the Moon.</p>

<p>I used to laugh at people that said we never got there--now read the evidence and see how wrong I was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So after NASA woo&#39;d the world (Including Russia, who would&#39;ve loved to prove the Yanks wrong) with the fake Apollo 11 launch, they decided it would be a good idea to fake not one more, not two, but six more moon landings (Including the failed Apollo 13 attempt). </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing much of interest between LEO and the moon for humans to do. If there&#39;s a specific need, well that&#39;s what satellites are for.</p>

<p>Money. NASA doesn&#39;t have the funding and private spaceflight companies aren&#39;t nearly up to that level yet. <em>Why</em> does NASA not have the money? Heck if I know. I guess Congress is more interested in pouring money into defense than exploring the Universe.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not going to pretend to understand the economics of it all, but the reason they can&#39;t just build a new Saturn V for example is because the manufacturing infrastructure just isn&#39;t there anymore. After over 40 years, a lot of the contractors that made the parts either don&#39;t exist or no longer have the capability to do everything they used to do. There&#39;s no sense rebuilding that in order to remake a fifty year old rocket when you can design a better one now. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re going to start <em>everything</em> from scratch either. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s technologies that they still can use that we don&#39;t think about. It&#39;s not like they have to reinvent the concept of liquid fuel or anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All good questions and I have no answers, but here&#39;s a couple more points:</p>

<p>1) To escape Earth&#39;s gravitational pull, it requires gigantic amounts of fuel. These fall off during the launch. The moon has approximately 1/6 the gravity of earth. Theoretically this should require 1/6 the amount of fuel used to escape earth&#39;s gravitational pull. The amount of fuel remaining on the ship is nowhere near a 1/6 of what&#39;s used initially.</p>

<p>2) Guess who was president during the moon landing? Not Kennedy, but Nixon (protip: leading with this question is a good way to elicit doubt about the moon landing in your friend&#39;s minds). He needed a distraction from the Vietnam war. Something to allow Americans to say &quot;look we beat those damned commies, we&#39;re winning!&quot;</p>

<p>3) The behavior of astronauts has always been fishy. When Buzz Aldrin was confronted with a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; who claimed he never went to the moon, Buzz punched him in the face. This is the behavior of someone who was just caught in a lie with no other recourse, or a crazy person. Another protip: if your friends don&#39;t believe in aliens, inform them that there are many astronauts who claim to have seen them.</p>

<p>4) If there was &quot;nothing on the moon&quot; why are we trying to go back now? If America claimed to the world that they went there, why would Russia just give up on the space race? Why would enemies believe each other in the first place? It&#39;s suspicious that no one else even attempted to try to make it there during the Cold War.</p>

<p>5) The moon landing would be extremely easy to fake. Rocket launches in a dramatic fashion. It orbits the planet for a few days. No one on earth has the means to tell if it&#39;s on the moon or among satellites. At the same time, different actors in space suits (so you can&#39;t see their faces) film a video to &quot;prove&quot; they were on the moon. The capsule lands safely in the ocean. Astronauts punch/ridicule anyone who doubts their story. Loose ends are either killed (they killed JFK, they would def kill actors) or the process is so compartmentalized, no one involved even suspects any foul play.</p>

<p>Your 1/6 assumption would be a closer to being correct if they were launching the Saturn V off of the moon. </p>

<p>But they didn&#39;t, the space module was launched from the moon - The space module weighs a smidge of what Saturn V weighs, so it requires a smidge of what the Saturn V required. </p>

<p>What&#39;s a smidge? Far less than 1/6. </p>

<p>And America&#39;s enemies would&#39;ve loved to show that the Saturn V never went to the moon. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The behavior of astronauts has always been fishy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the video of Buzz socking the guy in the face. </p>

<p>If you did something you were proud of - Win a competition, ace a test, come first in a race, build a successful company or land on the moon... And a group of people (The moon landing conspiracy community) repeatedly accused you of cheating or lying for decades, what would your reaction be? </p>

<p>I doubt it would be a smile and a warm handshake. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there was &quot;nothing on the moon&quot; why are we trying to go back now?</p>

<p>The moon could be a good launching pad for future missions. But there&#39;s a few hurdles to get over first, so no rush. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would enemies believe each other in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is a great argument against those who believe NASA didn&#39;t land on the moon. If NASA faked it, Russia would&#39;ve loved to prove the USA wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s suspicious that no one else even attempted to try to make it there during the Cold War.</p>

<p>Eh? The term &#39;space RACE&#39; was coined for a reason. The USA wasn&#39;t the only one in the race.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon landing would be extremely easy to fake. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all, America&#39;s enemies were monitoring the shuttle as it left earth. If it merely orbited for a few days, every opposing nation would&#39;ve noticed immediately. </p>

<p>You mean like with Apollo 12, 13 (failed), 14, 15, 16 &amp; 17? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The logical explanation goes with the fact that our oh so beloved current presidential administration has actually shut down moon missions and pretty much NASA in general at least as far as space exploration goes. My theory? They found something out there that they don&#39;t want us to know about. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if all moon records for the Apollo missions (and maybe more we don&#39;t know about) are kept at a top secret facility similar to Area 51</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this tells you...what?</p>

<p>You really think, that if the landings were fake, that NASA wouldn&#39;t go through the motions? That panel WAS used--just not the exact one he designed, and not for those missions.</p>

<p>We were in the middle of one of the costliest wars to date then--not to mention the Cold War. The &quot;Moonshots&quot; were all about two things--funneling &quot;black&quot; money budgeted to NASA to the military, and the militarization of space (rather, the beginnings of it). Of course, remember also that Russia was nearly 2 years ahead of us in EVERY WAY regarding space--it says a LOT that they could never overcome the technical/physical hurdles to put a man on the moon. You&#39;d think they&#39;d at least send a dog, right? But no--the Russians mantain that there was NO WAY to put men on the Moon and still do to this day--even though, even at present, their space tech FAR exceeds the US&#39;. They mantain that sending a MAN to the Moon would have required a ship made from lead or concrete--hardly good materials for aviation uses.</p>

<p>Remember that a fake Moon landing is a LOT cheaper than a real one--even if all the parts were made. My neighbor worked on the software for the guidance computer (at MIT) and NASA had NO specs--they just let the engineers &quot;wing it.&quot; Now keep in mind that several companies existed at this time that MADE guidance systems. Why let MIT do it--and with NO SPECS to boot? Its pretty easy to see that the reason Charles Draper had free-reign in the software design was because <em>NASA never intended on using it</em>--at least not on those missions.</p>

<p>NOBODY can tell me how they got past the Van Allen belts. Those ships had NO sheilding--only walls as thick as two pieces of tinfoil. The suits had no shielding. So...how did they get through a large belt of intense radiation that Man cannot live through? And pass through the micrometeorites? How does one cool a space capsule like this?? Excuse me if I&#39;m stating the obvious but doesn&#39;t &quot;air conditioning&quot; need copius qualities of, you know, <em>air</em> to work??</p>

<p>Your grandfather doubtlessly designed <em>something</em> that was useful to NASA--but it most assuredly did NOT fly to the Moon. And BTW, if he&#39;s still alive, tell him that those &quot;sausage clips&quot; were pure brilliance--no shit.</p>
