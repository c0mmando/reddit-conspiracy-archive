        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was doing my random internet travels tonight keeping my brain busy and I finally stumbled into this video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuqfH8QstKI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuqfH8QstKI</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m always the skeptic to start until I get as much information as I can before making any decisions.  At first I figured I would cry foul when the video cut off the news report that was about to site evidence as to why the phenomenon could be explained.  But as you&#39;ll see below, my thoughts changed on that because it really didn&#39;t matter.  Why?  Because at about 4:00 mins on that video you get to witness exactly what is being heard for a good duration of time.  And this seems like something far beyond simple explanation (more on that too).  *The sounds in that video are loud, frightening, and never recorded before.</p>

<p>I decided to do some digging.  I searched &quot;the hum&quot;.  Everything pointed to it being aurora related.  So, I did a simple google search by typing in &quot;aurora borealis sounds&quot; and pulled up tons of reports going on 8+ pages with various sites discussing the instance.  This being the first time I have heard of strange sounds ever coming from the Auroras I thought &quot;oh wow, why did I never hear about this in textbooks and such?&quot;.  Well, I think I know why.  It&#39;s because the theory that they created sounds didn&#39;t really exist up until the &quot;hum event&quot; even took place.  Sure, over time there are some other sources that claim of natives and old folklore speaking of sounds related to the Aurora, but none are even close to this scale as witnessed in the first video.  Each and every web page in that search all emanate seemingly from one source a Prof. Carolin Crawford that just so happened to conveniently be piggy backing off of this recent phenomena in 2012.  She never published anything on the subject beforehand, news sources site this strange event and now she has all the answers?  Here&#39;s where things really stop jiving and adding up though...</p>

<p>If you look before 2012, you&#39;ll see that a large number of discussions only describe the sounds from the Aurora&#39;s as a faint crackling or wizzing sound.  As sited here <a href="http://lemonhound.blogspot.com/2010/10/on-audibility-of-aurora-borealis.html">http://lemonhound.blogspot.com/2010/10/on-audibility-of-aurora-borealis.html</a></p>

<p>But, dig a little further and you&#39;ll notice that almost ALL sources can all agree that a very VERY small percentage of the population would be able to hear these sounds if at all.  </p>

<p>As a side observation I also discovered that another group of budding fact trainers decided to describe the source of the sounds but completely failed to replicate that which can be witnessed in the first video and can be heard here <a href="http://www.whitewolfpack.com/2012/07/scientists-discover-source-of-aurora.html">http://www.whitewolfpack.com/2012/07/scientists-discover-source-of-aurora.html</a></p>

<p>However, all this comes to a head when probably the most distinct of them all comes from a source that sites the Aurora sounds as being not even audible to the human ear and goes so far as to capture it&#39;s sound in radio wave frequencies.  Here <a href="http://roseveleth.com/blog/44/">http://roseveleth.com/blog/44/</a></p>

<p>So, what about all this?  That first video wasn&#39;t just awesome, it was borderline terrifying and yet...all of the evidence of the early debunkers and fact trainers doesn&#39;t even add up to the decades of scientific research and recording.  My conclusion?  Something isn&#39;t right and it&#39;s way too damn convenient that all the most profound explanations and sources claiming it (aurora) makes sounds just so happen to be neatly placed right AFTER the events in the video took place.  </p>

<p>So guys, what are your thoughts?  Am I way off base or is this genuinely fishy and in need of some further investigation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is also a &quot;hum&quot; that is a constant background noise with no apparent source. I live in a very rural area of Maine surrounded by miles of woods and my closest neighbor is about 200 yards away. At night it is very quiet. 95% of the time there is only the sounds of nature.</p>

<p>I became aware of a constant drone, one night, about 12 years ago. It sounded like a car idling in my driveway. I went out to look, there was nothing. I could hear it but saw nothing. The strange thing is it sounds like it&#39;s only a couple hundred feet away no matter where I went and coming from no particular direction.</p>

<p>I went back inside and shut off the main switch for the electricity to the house. The house went dark and super quiet but I could still hear that drone. I went back outside and it was the same deal. I walked out to the road about 75 yards from my house, no street lights, no traffic still the noise was always there close by from no particular direction.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know....I hear it dozens of times a year. I can only try to ignore it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo, there is a lot of underground drilling going on in the U.S. right now to construct passageways for rapid maglev transport and perhaps more than that. Chances are, the hum you&#39;re hearing could be the constant drone of deep drilling. Just speculation though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have actually experienced something like the Hum, it did not sound exactly like the video, but it gave me the same nauseated feel. It was about a year ago, I think I wrote a comment or post about it. I never understood &quot;it set my teeth on edge&quot; until that night, my SO was in bed with me. I tried to ignore it at first until she brought my attention to it. Definitely eerie</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear it all the time.  I live out in the suburbs in Cincy and it was really bad last night.  It&#39;s a droning hum that perpetually goes on from sun down until sun up that kind of idles between two low pitches.  If I put my earbuds in I can&#39;t hear it.  If I&#39;m in my basement (where our office and livingroom are) I cannot hear it... but outside and near windows it is loud.  I&#39;ve driven around town at night on bad nights trying to find it out of curiosity and haven&#39;t found anything yet.  So far, after asking around, I&#39;m the only one who can hear it.  It is most certainly worse on cold and clear nights and was crazy last night during the solar flares, though.  I have no idea what it is, but it does keep me up at night.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Aw man...Well <em>that</em> sucks balls.  I just clicked on the OP I posted up then, and when I went to the links, they&#39;re all gone/dead!  WTF?  I don&#39;t even remember the specific links I used either.  Damn.  :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO there are different hums caused by many earth normality. I lived in Texas, toured many countries and never heard any hum. It wasn&#39;t until I settled East side Big Island Hawaii that I began hearing a very loud bass like sound humming up and down in volume. The closer I got to Pahoa where there are tons of lava tubes and magma flows. The louder it got even with normal background noise I could hear it. The farther Away I got to the older Northwest side of Kohala it is very faint as far less lava tubes and older earth. However I do hear it get louder when just before large earthquakes occur also like the one off Puako (6.8 mag) a few years back. These bass ones I attribute to stress of the rocks causing harmonics to occur. Lava tubes which you call caves in the West USA are due to such in my opinion. The whole US West sits on a huge magma pool along with many fault lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should have said those other videos are most likely fake. When those videos were new I remember reading about things debunking them. The one (i believe in sweden?) with the horn that sounds like war of the worlds is actually the exact one from war of the worlds. Most importantly is just thinking about it logically. The first &quot;trumpets in the sky&quot; video came out followed by a slew of others. But those blasting foghorn sounds are not what the scientists recorded and reported. If there was a loud foghorn blasting through entire towns in florida and europe, there would be a lot more news about it. I tried to find news reports or social media about the sounds from the war of the worlds sounding videos and i couldn&#39;t find any. I have no reason to believe those ones are real other than an easily faked video on youtube. You gotta look at these like you would UFO videos. Most of them are fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I understand that but in the news clips prior to the long series of sounds in Sweden, Germany, and Russia were two brief clips recorded by Canadians in Quebec with the exact same sounds and were aired on their local news.  Those appeared to be user submitted and followed the closely related news reports from people not only witnessing but also calling in to local radio as well.  It&#39;s not just a brief occurrence on Youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went digging around after I saw the video from europe and florida (if i remember right) with the foghorn blasting sound. There wasn&#39;t anything to out right disprove that it&#39;s real, but there were no news or social media mentions of it. If it really happened, twitter and facebook would have been bombarded with people in those towns mentioning it. It would be easier to fake those videos than to fake UFO videos. I view everyone of those UFO videos as if it were fake until there is evidence like news stories or multiple witnesses to back it up. The reports of quick, clapping sounds are real i think. There was lots of people who heard it and even the news picked up on it. </p>
