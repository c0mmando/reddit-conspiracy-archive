       last week according to the comex records, if you do math, J.P. Morgan had 80 percent more IOUs then tangible gold in their vault. They will be telling the muppets that fire destroyed the gold, much like they told us, jet fuel vaporizes steel columns of WTC in 2001. and Now, they will settle all their IOUs in Worthless American dollars. If you are stupid enough to have your gold in JPM vault, you deserved this. JPM "pressure on us, means the Muppets will be slaughtered". Welcome, to the land of corruption, can't play the game- they will wipe you out!
      </p>
      <p>
       How many us were waiting to hear how JPM was going to explain to their clients why they don't have their gold to deliver? "fire"? that's creative !! give that guy who thought of that idea an award. the world of Gold is getting nasty, now let the fools panic "what do you mean you will give me my gold's worth in cash? but I don't want cash...but I was paying storage fees,? What does that mean? why can't JPM buy gold and give that to me, there is little physical gold? but I thought you guys said gold was in supply that is why the price is low, right? supply /demand? what's going on?" ....LOL
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome to the beginning of the gold slaughter .....it's fucking hilarious

       That's one of many ways.  Additionally, there are ways of being that are advanced and developed enough to not need any "paying" in the first place - bartering or otherwise.  Just as the monetary system is absolutely
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       but what the population has literally AGREED on doing, the people can simply agree with just as ardent a foundation of rules to exchange goods and services WITHOUT the use of the monetary system.  There is no law of physics making or imploring us to spend money.  It's literally something we as a population have simply agreed to do with one another, and just as easily, we can agree NOT to do it and support the population just as readily.  Granted our systems of education would have to reflect this way of being - and they currently do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       - but if they did, it would be more than possible to live this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The catch in all of this, of course, is that we would have to raise our level of honor and comportment and cooperation with one another so that we DON'T have to rely on a system of fiat currency so easily manipulated as it stands.  This is actually very possible, however, when one realizes just how much of our world is a manipulated lie and when we realize the extent to which we as a people have been lied to about our true nature and what we are capable of.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a society - in a world - that has indoctrinated us into believing that we cannot function unless the monetary system exists.  Nothing could be further from the truth.

       For certain things there is nothing quite like gold.  Lets say that I want to liquidate everything and go off to live in a monastary studying ancient secrets for ten years.  How would you propose that I safely preserve my wealth without using gold?

       Your wanting to "preserve your wealth" goes against what I'm talking about in the first place.  What you're calling "wealth" is not something that's even necessary if things were done right.  Monetary acquisition is unnecessary, for "when the last tree is cut down, the last fish is eaten, and the last stream is poisoned, you will realize that you cannot eat money."

       Dude you're right. How fuckin' retarded do they think we are? One gold has a pretty fuckin' high melting point. (this is just a possibility) If fire did somehow melt the gold they could have waited for it to cool then remelt into vats underneath the floor which will pour into a machine that cuts it back into bars. Or if that doesn't probable enough wait for the gold to cool then cut it up again with a powerful laser. All hypothetical theories.

       that's right....The average house fire burns at a temperature of about 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit, Pure gold has a melting point of 1945 degrees Fahrenheit. but then other miracles have happened to Financial buildings with known gold stored inside them. They vaporize into nothing along with 2000 years of human knowledge and consensus on how metals behave under fire. Poof.

       The slaughter will happen in August, no doubt. August is when delivery in the comex are settled. But was the fire real? I thought is was market joke about the JPM situation with the  IOUS and the lack of physical gold to meet deliveries.

       The US is broke. Any gold held by citizens will be taken, one way or the other. Unless you have your gold hidden where only you know the location then and only then will you keep your gold.

       You are wrong about the JPM vault, the fire was actually a few blocks down. Zero hedge wrote an article about it actually, I'm just on my phone, a Google search should bring it up. I do agree with you however that we are at a tipping point in the paper gold game. JPM and the Comex have been rapidly declining inventories and are currently at record lows. Gold forwards are currently in backwardation (Google "gold gofo backwardation" for explanations). I think that we can see a force majure event soon, but this was not it.

       Oh stop. There was no fire in their vault, and the idea that they are going to "burn the gold" is beyond fucking retarded. Is this place just full of trolls?

       It has to be put into a crucible and put into a furnace to be melted down, there's no way a fire would destroy gold.
