    <div class="md"><p>9/11 2.0 ? You can count on it. It&#39;s just a matter of time. The government can&#39;t wait to declare martial law, but they need an excuse. Perl Harbor was the excuse to get into World War II. The RMS Lusitania was the excuse for World War I (the American part in it, I mean). 9/11 was the excuse to start wars in the Middle East <em>and</em> to turn the US into a Police State. The last piece of the puzzle will be, as you put it, 9/11 2.0. Wait for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first they would have an excuse not hindered by silly laws to confiscate all the guns. Then shortly after that they would confiscate all the citizens gold...to give to the Banks. But they have to get the guns first. Why do all this ? Because the US and the Banks are flat broke. They are flat broke because of the way the banking system is built. The economy is about ready, very soon, to come apart at the seams. When (not if, but when) that happens the people are going to get really mad, as you would expect. Declaring martial law would then need to called to keep the people from taking down the Government, literally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. There was a document called &quot;The project for the New American Century&quot;, written in the late 1990s by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and company which detailed the plan of the &quot;neocons&quot; to invade at least 5 Countries (Iraq, Libya, Syria, Iran and I think Egypt) . This was long before 9/11. But like wars in the past, they needed an excuse. Hence 9/11. </p>

<p>Larry Silverstien had an insurance policy (including a clause for Jet Planes hitting the buildings) that made him very rich. Also the towers had Asbestos that needed to be removed. That would have been costly. 9/11 solved that too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its in the best interest of the companies that make all the spying equipment for it to continue. Obama had many contributors to his campaign, and as a result has promises to fulfill to those donators- and likely that&#39;s in a way that benefits the MIC and the other oppressive factions and branches. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point we may only have a few possible/likely outcomes as I see it.
A new manufactured tragedy like 9/11 to scare the public into accepting a full police state.
Public rises up to dismantle and rebuild the government... (least likely IMHO)
Lastly, as a country we lose confidence in government and we are taken, indefinitely under control of the UN.</p>

<p>Remember that the UN has provisions to act as an official governing body &quot;until a new one is established&quot; and that the UN capitol is in NYC.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if that was really the goal in bankrupting all the major countries around the world. If too many collapse at the same time (see how they are managing the EU crisis) that would be a huge step towards the ultimate goal of the NWO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m seeing is that in place of another terror attack which  would  be less likely to be accepted, or produce a good result for them,  they are just coming out into the open and showing their truer face as a criminal oligarchy backed by a puppet government.</p>

<p>This would produce more power and corrupt control,  quicker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say 9/11 2.0 happens, where will it be? What exactly will happen? And the aftermath? Imo, I think nuclear weapons could be used on a major city (maybe NYC, LA, or DC) and the aftermath will be absolute power over the citizens. Helicopters flying around, police constantly breaking into houses making arrests for comments made on social media websites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I&#39;d like to comment on 9/11 2.0 (yay, I get to sound smart for once).  I&#39;m sorry for lack of links but I remember how they said 9/11 was going to be the &quot;new pearl harbor&quot; and it was going to be the set for all next &quot;terrorist&quot; attacks in the future.  I don&#39;t think there will be another &quot;9/11&quot; just for the sake of keeping things shaken up.</p>
