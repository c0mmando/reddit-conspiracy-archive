       Hey guys,
First off, I don't believe in the Ancient Aliens theory. I think it's quite ludicrous.
Secondly, I'd like to have a rational look at the possibility that the pyramid is 70,000 years old. It is a subject that has always intrigued me. Especially since the Giza pyramid does not have the same type of funerary type chambers, adorning walls of hieroglyphs, etc. as the other pyramids. Here is a quote from the Manly P. Hall book "The Secret Teachings of All Ages"
      </p>
      <p>
       "W. W. Harmon, by a series of extremely complicated yet exact mathematical calculations; determines that the first ceremonial of the Pyramid was performed 68,890 years ago on the occasion when the star Vega for the first time sent its ray down the descending passage into the pit. The actual building of the Pyramid was accomplished in the period of from ten to fifteen years immediately preceding this date."
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you guys think?

       Thats the sad things about past civilizations, they could have advanced for millions of years, building cutting edge technology, expecting to make their place in the universe. But were suddenly wiped out

       It's been said natural disasters can wipe out a civilization even if it is very much advanced.  Also, if the civilization's level of technological advancement grew faster than it's level of spiritual, emotional, and psychological advancement - as certainly seems to be the case with this current civilization that we live in now - then the civilization in question can possibly wipe itself out because it doesn't know how to responsibly handle the technology it got a hold of (likely through ET sources).  This is a great reason why it's been said that ET civilizations are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       enamored with the idea of giving much of any technology to developing people's.  The primitives (i.e.
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       ) almost always don't know how to responsibly handle the technology and more often than not kill each other, themselves, and the environment around them if they're given too much too soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such seems
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       to be the case in point with this current iteration of humanity.

       Maybe advancement removes you from this physical plane. We keep thinking that the technology of the far future is going to be based on the technology we have at this moment. It could be the case that more advanced technology uses principles that transcend physicality and make changes to the conscious apprehension of the being, and ultimately, removes that being from physical reality to place the being in transcendent reality.

       Thanks! one of mine too. If i ever get into a topic of book reading anywhere i always suggest this book no matter what we are talking about. Though when i'm drunk i really get into it and usually they won't even have to go read it by the time i'm done yabbing off lol.

       Regardless, It really is a must read and not just if you're interested in just the Egyptian side of things. Gets the ole noggin thinking

       The fact that computer analysis has shown that the stone carvings of Ramses are perfectly symmetrical is pretty much enough to tell you that highly advanced technology was used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it was a visiting alien species, or a long lost human civilization from so long ago that nothing but their carvings and pyramids survived, who knows.  But it has to be one of those.  Egyptians didn't build those, they might have drawn hieroglyphs on them, but there's no way they could have achieved such perfection in that era.

       I read the link and, frankly, there's really nothing there to discuss beyond what you posted above. It sounds like assumptions built on assumptions, like assuming that the pyramid was situated to allow the star Vega to shine its light down a tunnel. Know one knows. 
I'm open to alternate views of history but only if there is evidence.

       One of the biggest indicators that the pyramids and the sphinx are much older than conventionally thought, is the water damage on the body of the sphinx, suggesting that it once existed in a more temperate climate.

       While the referenced book does in fact discuss numerology, the calculation is based on the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession_of_the_equinoxes">
        precession of the equinoxes
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Of similar interest is the geological evidence that demonstrates the very ancient age of the Sphinx. Specifically, that the Sphinx has to be at least 5000 years old, could be within 10,000 years old, and if you listen to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Anthony_West">
        John Anthony West
       </a>
       , is even older than the Great Pyramid of Giza at ~50K years old ( a different source than Manly P. Hall, hence the disparity..)

       I'm not denying that there are valid mathematical models for the natural world. What I'm saying is that that's different from numerology, and this
       <em>
        sounds
       </em>
       more like numerology. Hard to tell though without seeing what the calculations are.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this instance, "extremely complicated yet exact mathematical calculations" don't matter at all. What matters is evidence, and it is severely lacking.

       Your comment also got me briefly interested in occurrences of the golden ratio in nature, and I came across
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio#Disputed_observations">
        this

       , which is interesting regardless of which side you take on it.

       23.6 Questioner: I see. Then at this time you did not contact them. Can you tell me the same— answer the same questions I just asked with respect to your next attempt to contact the Egyptians?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. The next attempt was prolonged. It occurred over a period of time. The nexus, or center, of our efforts was a decision upon our parts that there was a sufficient calling to attempt to walk among your peoples as brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
       We laid this plan before the Council of Saturn, offering ourselves as service-oriented Wanderers of the type which land directly upon the inner planes without incarnative processes. Thus we emerged, or materialized, in physical-chemical complexes representing as closely as possible our natures, this effort being to appear as brothers and spend a limited amount of time as teachers of the Law of One, for there was an ever-stronger interest in the sun body, and this vibrates in concordance with our particular distortions.
      </p>
      <p>
       We discovered that for each word we could utter, there were thirty impressions we gave by our very being, which confused those entities we had come to serve. After a short period we removed ourselves from these entities and spent much time attempting to understand how best to serve those to whom we had offered ourselves in love/light.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ones who were in contact with that geographical entity, which you know of as Atlantis, had conceived of the potentials for healing by use of the pyramid-shape entities. In considering this and making adjustments for the differences in the distortion complexes of the two geographical cultures, as you would call them, we went before the Council again, offering this plan to the Council as an aid to the healing and the longevity of those in the area you know of as Egypt. In this way we hoped to facilitate the learning process as well as offering philosophy articulating the Law of One. Again the Council approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Approximately eleven thousand [11,000] of your years ago we entered, by thought-form, your— we correct this instrument. We sometimes have difficulty due to low vitality. Approximately eight five zero zero [8,500] years ago, having considered these concepts carefully, we returned, never having left in thought, to the thought-form areas of your vibrational planetary complex and considered for some of your years, as you measure time, how to appropriately build these structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The first, the Great Pyramid, was formed approximately six thousand [6,000] of your years ago.
       </strong>
       Then, in sequence, after this performing by thought of the building or architecture of the Great Pyramid using the more, shall we say, local or earthly material rather than thought-form material to build other pyramidical structures. This continued for approximately fifteen hundred [1,500] of your years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the information concerning initiation and healing by crystal was being given. The one known as “Akhenaten” was able to perceive this information without significant distortion and for a time, moved, shall we say, heaven and earth in order to invoke the Law of One and to order the priesthood of these structures in accordance with the distortions of initiation and true compassionate healing. This was not to be long-lasting.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this entity’s physical dissolution from your third-density physical plane, as we have said before, our teachings became quickly perverted, our structures returning once again to the use of the so-called “royal” or those with distortions towards power.

       I am not sure about the pyramid but there is evidence that the Sphinx in Giza was built much earlier than when most egyptologists claim it was built.

       Well considering that based on the organic matter (grains) in the pottery and the DNA extracted from Mummies would counter these claims.

      <p>
       However Egyptian Pharaohs in the past have been known to have all written history reworked by their previous predecessor and put their own interpretation on the monuments. Some glyphs can not be explained either. No matter what speculation Egyptologists try to fit.

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding other objects such as the Sphinx it could be 12000 years old. Gobekli Tepe has proven such temples and monuments were built at that time.

      <p>
       Also ancient tools such as Clovis do not date nearly that far back. 70k years I cannot accept. Need better evidence.

       Ot was intended for Khufu. However the other tombs show similar construction employed and the other Pharaohs and their families were buried for such. Also you cannot discount raiders of tombs.

       There is no evidence for the claim that it was intended for khufu. Typically, the name of whoever built a tomb is enscribed all over the place. Not once was there an enscrypttion for khufu on the great pyramid. Except for the one forged by that archeaologist in red paint a couple of decades ago, which most people still believe was legit despite the evidence against him.

       Actually the Abydos glyph is pretty easily explained. It is from two layers of heiroglyphs being laid over each other.

       Well, the Sphinx looks like it's way older than previously thought.  It was due to the water, instead of wind, erosion that led to this hypothesis.  But I don't think all of the "Egyptologists" will succumb quietly, since they'd be rendered irrelevant.  Or, at least, would have to start from scratch.

       Historians 20 years ago would have said that the city of Thonis/Heracleoin was a myth. 60 years ago the city of Troy was a myth. 100 years ago, the city of Ur was a myth. And yet, each of these cities has been found by archeologists. More telling, each of these cities were found near populated areas with long histories themselves.

       Imagine how much is still undiscovered today. The atlantic ocean is a big place, and the placement of Atlantis therein is a relatively modern interpretation (relative to the presumed 50k + years that Atlantis has been submerged). It could be the case that Atlantis lies at the bottom of the Indian ocean, or even the Pacific ocean if we consider the strange architectural and artistic similarities between South east asian cultures and central american cultures.

       Modern scientists are of the opinion cancer is a mystery, so that doesn't mean much there. And before you ask, cancer is not a mystery, it is due to over inflammation of the body, in particular too low of a pH. It can be cured, and it has been known since the 30s how cancer works.

       Oh like the tools from 4-5,000 years ago were a big improvement. Mainstream archaeology is just scared of progress.

       You want to know something very interesting? The name Atlantic Ocean comes from Atlantis, which comes from accounts by Plato. Once Europeans mapped the oceans they gave it that name in reference to Atlantis. Now, in prehispanic America there lived a civilization knows a the Aztecs they didn't called themselves that, they called themselves Meshikas, which is where Mexico comes from. They spoke a language that is still spoken in some parts of Mexico called Nahuatl. In this language the word for water is Atl, just like Atlantis. Coincidence?

       Thats the sad things about past civilizations, they could have advanced for millions of years, building cutting edge technology, expecting to make their place in the universe. But were suddenly wiped out
      </p>
      <p>
       But by what?

       It's been said natural disasters can wipe out a civilization even if it is very much advanced.  Also, if the civilization's level of technological advancement grew faster than it's level of spiritual, emotional, and psychological advancement - as certainly seems to be the case with this current civilization that we live in now - then the civilization in question can possibly wipe itself out because it doesn't know how to responsibly handle the technology it got a hold of (likely through ET sources).  This is a great reason why it's been said that ET civilizations are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       enamored with the idea of giving much of any technology to developing people's.  The primitives (i.e.
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       ) almost always don't know how to responsibly handle the technology and more often than not kill each other, themselves, and the environment around them if they're given too much too soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such seems
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       to be the case in point with this current iteration of humanity.

       Maybe advancement removes you from this physical plane. We keep thinking that the technology of the far future is going to be based on the technology we have at this moment. It could be the case that more advanced technology uses principles that transcend physicality and make changes to the conscious apprehension of the being, and ultimately, removes that being from physical reality to place the being in transcendent reality.
