       The FED and Ben Bernanke have essentially embarked on a suicide economics strategy for the US economy. Giving trillions of dollars to banks and investors, and the entire Markets to pretend like the country is not in depression. When according to employment records,food stamps and mass defaulting of major US cities, we are deep into depression. The Markets, banks, investors know they are standing on a dead Eagle, but They are being paid trillions to pretend like everything is good, and that the "eagle is merely sleeping". The Moment Bernanke and the FED decide to stop QE(Quantitative easing, giving money to banks,and only Markets), the US economy will be devastated in milliseconds of trading. The dying Eagle will be declared dead.Much to the surprise of 350 million Americans who had no idea the Eagle was on life support and already dying. By then the Banks will have earned trillion and trillions, and the rich investors will go home to better currencies, gold, and to offshore havens they have been holding. They will have traded against Americans, because they knew all along that the  Eagle was dying in years of depression created by the FED, Economic Poison delivered by Ben Bernanke, and Greenspan too. Americans,so oblivious to this conspiracy against them, will look at their president and say with their last breath, "Et tu, Obama?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The question that's been bothering me, and possibly every competent Economist, Why would the FED embark on a 4 year economic strategy that leads America to the fastest road to economic devastation? The logical answer to this question, is that, it is deliberately being done to achieve this outcome.This would explain why people like Krugman have abandoned common sense, and are spewing Economic madness on the airways. The mass compliance by academics in economics and the mass propaganda undertaken to hide this depression from the people is evidence to this possible reason why the FED is destroying America.

       You are right, but it's not just the Fed, and it's not just the US economic system that is being destroyed. It is a multi-pronged attack to destroy the United States:
      </p>
      <p>
       The President is an appointed puppet and all his egregiously unconstitutional executive orders and legislative sign-offs are technically void.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US Congress is entirely bought and paid for by the military-industrial complex, and all elections are rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Independent Judiciary" is a sad joke, and senior judges are appointed (like Obama was) with blackmail-ready skeletons in their closet that mean they have to dance to the tune they are told.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, the Fed is a privately controlled entitity that has been financially raping US citizens for a century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to this a legally untouchable paramilitary security set-up (FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, police, national guard etc) to ensure that nobody can do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, a tame media who don't tell the truth and brainwash the majority of citizens into thinking everything's fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: Yes, the US is totally and irremediably fucked.

       The reason is crystal-clear.  Pouring money into banks at low interest rates, who then proceed to reloan the money and use their loans as fractional reserves, is tremendously profitable to those banks.    It perpetually generates profits for them, at public expense, in exchange for no real service.  They are simply sitting on top of a free money machine that's embedded into the very fabric of our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the central mechanism.  The economy is in a state of complete capture.   We're due for a total revolution at this point.

       The last act of treasonous Ruler is to loot the public purse. This was said of the Roman Empire and is equally true today. The rich want to be sure that they are well off, while everyone else fights for scraps. Economists are much like weatherman. They know considerably less then they let on. One possible exception to this is Gerald Celente.

       Break the economy, put everyone on food stamps and when enough people get tired of being broke and hungry, they can introduce their solution.... the North American Union.... a constitution-less entity that competes with the EU and the new Eurasian Union. Eventually the four Unions will be combined into the One...World Union.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a really simple plan. It takes a while to implement but world domination is a prize worth waiting for.

       When I was 12 years old, years ago, I discovered the truth about the greatest American Mindfuck known as "Apollo 11,and other missions". It crushed my spirit as a boy. But at least I knew, careers such as Astronauts and space were a farse. When you get through this one, they all melt together as  what they are, lies, and conspiracies to control. Now, in my adulthood, NASA has dissolved into a bureaucratic  office and the  space program is dead. Sometimes the truth reveals itself.quietly and slowly.

       LOL.....

       a famous dead Astronaut once said just be before he burned alive: 
"how are we gonna get to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?"....these are words that can be applied to the great American disconnect from its/ our own current reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the grand question that has always been is, how can informed  Americans stand up to the machine, if they can't talk or agree on the simple facts of what is happening? the Answer to this question, and to Grissom's above question, is that, we can't.

       I will leave you with that and no more.

       Word.  I assumed it was to mislead/confuse... but some super duper weird things happened after I came across all that... which, to be honest, the things I was getting into... I really didn't want to know.  And, of course, could have all been (and probably was] fake.  I didn't know if it set off some kind of red alert that I was "snooping too hard" ...not that there are any hardcore truths actually on the internet that I'm not "supposed" to be aware of...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you could do me, a newbie, a small favor, and skim through that document... at least up until the part where they talk about the Fed causing the 2008 collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not surprised, I'm just a little taken aback by the blatancy of it... especially on the bis.org website ... which, a few weeks ago I was sure it was fake, but after many sleepless nights, have come to accept that yes, it is legitimate.  And

        yes

       no, they don't give a fuck.

       The dollar is the defacto currency around the world, nice try to fear monger with your 2 paragragh hit piece, but every economist and politician around the world knows that the FED will do anything to keep the dollar the reserve currency for the world.  So the manipulation of the dollar against other currencies is all that you will see happen.  The FED doesnt want to destroy the country that helps fight its wars.  If you would have bought in after the crash of 2008 your portfolio would be up 150%-300%.  Its a pretty simple game really, buy low sell high.  If you are scared your profits are going to take hit with QE ending, then cash out your stock and short the market.  There are winners in losers in every market.

       Gave you an upvote, thanks for the  funny put down.

       Just curious of your thoughts on the Dollar being the reserve currency for the world though...  Do you think OPs argument would still hold water if the entire world did not trade in dollars? Is it a benefit or detriment to this country the the entire world bases their currencies on the dollar?  How relevant would americas economy be if the dollar was just another currency? What effect would a none defacto currency have on american commodities, stocks, and bonds? How about Oil? If Oil was traded in Euros, or Yen or Pounds would this even be an debate we would be having on the American economy right now? Just curious on your thoughts.

       And when do you predict this is going to happen? (2 Years, 5 Years, this Year) America will never let that happen, in fact what country would!!!!??? The Dollar is almighty around the world, there is no country even remotely close to touching the US in terms of Currency Dominance (and you cant say china, that would just be a joke), zero, none, nada.  It will probably be 100 years before any country/currency comes close to touching the power of the Dollar.
