       We don't need architects, engineers, physicsts or experts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        We literally only need one fact, free fall.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A chunk of building 7 'floated' to the ground. This cannot happen with progressive collapse, as it requires 0 structural resistance.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Zero structural resistance means that
       <em>
        hundreds
       </em>
       of core columns were cut at precisely the same time, or within a few hundreths of a second of each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST originally lied about the speed of the fall by 40%. When they got called out for their glaring error that was proven by the video of free fall, they admitted that BLDG 7 free fell for 2.25 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, these physicists, engineers, and architects are somebody's dad. They are fallible, they are human, and they can be propagandized.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would NIST lie? Free fall
       <strong>
        is a smoking gun
       </strong>
       ; however, the implications of accepting it are so world changing, so paradigm shifting, that people do not look at the evidence objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is physically impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I know I'm preaching to the choir, but let me continue.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This little fact is so impossibly hard to accept, due to the fact that it completely re-programs a world view. This one fact implicates an entire paradigm shift, and that shit is hard to swallow.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If we showed anyone BLDG 7 falling into dust at the speed of gravity, without giving you context, they would scream controlled demolition. It floated to the ground for 2.25 seconds. It would be
        <em>
         insane
        </em>
        to say that it was a collapse due to fires. Literally insane. But, once we take into account that this is part of 9/11, somehow people's brain switches off. And this terrifies me. HOW can somebody look at that and ignore it? This is severe emotional/psychological trauma, hivemind to the max. This is what scares me the most.

       Fantastic post. Freefall is absolutely a smoking gun. It is so rare to see a 9/11 post with more than a dozen upvotes these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my compilation of anomlies of building 7 so far
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded in their report on Building 7: "While debris impact from the collapse of WTC 1 initiated fires in WTC 7, the resulting structural damage had little effect in causing the collapse of WTC 7."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NIST admits that Building 7 is the first time a building over 15 stories tall has EVER collapsed due to fires.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NIST admits to a free fall acceleration over 2.25 seconds.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The official 9/11 Commission Report does not discuss Building 7
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fell neatly into its own footprint
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NIST refuses to release data inputs for their computational collapse model, saying it "...might jeopardize public safety."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The model was built without physical evidence. "In the month that lapsed between the terrorist attacks and the deployment of the [FEMA] BPAT team, a significant amount of steel debris—including most of the steel from the upper floors—was removed from the rubble pile, cut into smaller sections, and either melted at the recycling plant or shipped out of the U.S." -Joseph Crowley, U.S. Congressman, Committee on Science, 2002.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         $200 million was spent "...cutting out floors, adding elevators, reinforcing steel girders, upgrading power supplies and making other improvements in its million square feet of space," in 1990.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Collapse is symmetrical.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cracking middle folds downwards precisely as in a controlled demolition.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NIST declined to test for chemical explosives used in demolition.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         BBC reported the collapse hours before it happened, twice.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Experts agree it is a textbook case of controlled demolition, before being told the building collapsed on 9/11.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Barry Jennings, the Deputy Director of the Emergency Services Department for the New York City Housing Authority, was trapped inside Building 7 when the first plane hit. He has repeatedly told his story of hearing explosions on the 20th and 22nd floor while trapped inside. He did mysteriously in 2008, days before the release of the final NIST report. The cause of death has not been made public.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         With rare exceptions, the media does not discuss building 7.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Larry Silverstein, owner of the WTC complex, famously made the command to 'pull it', in reference to building 7.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Multiple reports made by professionals of molten steel beneath the rubble that lasted for weeks.
        </p>

       I'm completely not on board with the official story. But, I've watched
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFJa9WUy5QI">
        this
       </a>
       and I have to wonder what the evidence against it being true is. It's the first time I'd seen it, and, while seemingly plausible, I don't really buy it. Wouldn't there have been evidence of the floors collapsing visible on the outside during the fires?

       This video is being deceptive, because the outer shell of the building, is the steel frame of the building itself.  And NIST could never demonstrate that the Steel Frame 'shell' of the building could collapse at free fall, or totally collapse at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to NIST's own
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNEKtvB80usf">
        computer model
       </a>
       of the WTC7 collapse, with NISTs calculations they couldn't demonstrate how the steel frame of the building fell at free fall speeds, nor could they demonstrate that single column failure due to fire could lead to total collapse of the entire structure.  NIST stops the computer simulation as the steel frame began folding on itself, which also wasn't observed in the actual event.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the narrator of the video argues that there hasn't been a fire that's burned uncontrollably for more than 7 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been fires in skyscrapers that have burned longer than 7 hours and have not collapsed.  The
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Meridian_Plaza">
        One Meridian Plaza
       </a>
       fire burned for 18 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other fires have been much more intense.  Such as this Beijing Mandarin Hotel Fire that engulfed the majority of the building.
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B1OnhSucP8">
        www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B1OnhSucP8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A fire has never collapsed a steel framed highrise before.   Single and local column failure has happened in fires before, as per the examples he shares of the highway overpass, and a steel column in a bbq pit.  But it's never been demonstrated, by NIST nor anyone else that a single column failure could lead to global collapse of the whole structure that shares the distinctive characteristics (free fall) of controlled demolition.

       Great post the only thing I always have a problem with is the Silverstein "pull it". He would not have gone on TV and said that in that way. He was referring to pulling out the fireman from the building. If we want to make a strong case we cannot use evidence that is solely opinion. I know some people will argue this with me and that's why we should ignore it. We can go back and forth on the "pull it" all day. We should only use facts because that's all that is needed.

       To play devils' advocate, have you seen the full video of the collapse? The penthouse falls a couple seconds before the rest of building. Most videos omit where the penthouse falls in.

       The building is said to have collapsed in 6-6.5 seconds, though that is only the shell. If you start from the penthouse, it takes about 14-15 seconds.
       <a href="http://youtu.be/JnLcUxV1dPo?t=1m46s">
        The penthouse collapses about 8 seconds before the rest of the building.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The penthouse caving in is consistent with the NIST model where the inner structure progressively collapses, after which the unsupported outer shell comes down.

      <p>
       Building 7 is the only steel frame skyscraper to collapse, and it was also the only one where the fire was not put out, it was burning for over seven hours.

       How does a fire, of any magnitude, break every perimeter column at the exact same second, on multiple floors, allowing it to fall at free-fall speed straight down without any resistance from buckling floors? It doesn't.

       You're right, it doesn't. Look at how the penthouse falls down 8 seconds before the total collapse. This is consistent with the NIST model where, due to heat, the steel beams pop out of their joints which leads to a progressive collapse of the internal framing. After the internal framing is gone, the outer shell drops like a curtain. The total duration is about 14-15 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most controlled demolitions don't have that long of a collapse. If Building 7 was a controlled demo job, they could just as easily made it fall in a wacky way instead of they way it did.

       If they make it fall in a wacky way it might not completely fall down, part of the bottom structure would remain. Or it could fall sideways and cause collateral damage. They wanted it to fall straight down completely so that it would not cause any damage, or any deaths, or do anything that would make it news worthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way it did fall, perfectly mimicking a controlled demolition, raises as few eyebrows as possible. Most importantly, it did not leave behind any evidence of the controlled demolition devices, of the terrorism control center where the entire event was directed, or of the SEC headquarters where last minute selling of airlines stocks would be discovered. There were plenty of reasons to have it fall straight down, and none to have it fall down wacky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if you have the interior columns collapse first, no explosions will be visible from outside, which is important. The total time is not important, it is a two-tier collapse. First, the interior falls, taking 8 seconds to complete, then the perimeter falls, taking another 7-8 seconds. If it is as you say, steel beams popping out of joints, causing a progressive collapse, where is the progression? The entire perimeter falls at the same exact instant through out the entire building, that's over 40 columns breaking away from steel beams on multiple floors on each column instantaneously!

       It makes it more newsworthy if it looks like a controlled demo. You'd expect a building collapsing to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       look so perfectly like a controlled demo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The progressive collapse is on the inside. As I said, the NIST model predicts that the interior structure collapses, after which the outside falls like a curtain, with nothing resisting its fall, which is what you see on the video.

       Except NIST couldn't prove that the 'outside', that is the steel frame of WTC7 itself, could fall like a curtain.  They couldn't get it to totally collapse at all.  Only deform, not shatter into a thousand pieces small enough to be easily hauled away on trucks like all the

       I'd imagine the reason the pieces were small enough to truck away is that they were small enough to truck to the building site in the first place. How else are you going to get them there?

       The steel was welded and bolted together.  The simple act of a single column failing in the structure, as NIST presumes, isn't going to cause all the welding and bolting in the entire structure to fail.   NIST's own computer model can't demonstrate how the steel in the structure becomes shredded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about any steel structure you can imagine.  Your car, or your truck is made up of multiple steel components, welded or bolted together.  If you get into an accident, your truck isn't going to shred itself into small pieces of steel.  It's going to deform and crumple.  This is what NIST's computer model shows, deforming and crumpling.  This behavior is what would be more in line with the expected results, if explosives were not used and presuming NIST's assumption that the fires in the building were intense enough to case a critical column failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you walked onto a crime scene, and you noticed that the steel frame of a car or truck was shredded, then that would be consistent with the use of explosives, similarly how the evidence of the shredded steel of both the Two Towers and WTC7 is consistent with the use of explosives.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The use of the term 'shell' is deceptive.  The 'shell' is the actual steel frame of the building itself.  That steel frame is the support structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST's own
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNEKtvB80us">
        computer model
       </a>
       does not demonstrate that the steel frame of the building could collapse at free fall speeds, nor could they demonstrate that a single column failure could lead to total global collapse.  They stop the computer simulation right when the steel frame of the building began folding on itself, which was not observed in the actual event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, even if you allow for NIST's assumption that WTC7 experienced a total internal collapse that somehow left the steel frame standing.  You would still have to explain how that steel frame could fall through itself for 2.5 seconds at the same speed that an object falls through air.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, there is nothing about the penthouse collapsing prior to the total collapse of the structure that disproves controlled demolition.  Many explanations can be given for the collapse of the Penthouse first.  Perhaps it was a test explosion.  Perhaps it was an explosive that went off too early. ect. ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       What needs to be explained is not only how the steel frame fell at free fall speeds, but also how it
       <a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/dirt/pics/Jenkins4.jpg">
        shattered into relatively small pieces
       </a>
       of a convenient size that could easily be loaded onto trucks and shipped away.   That is evidence that is consistent with controlled demolition, and not a fire initiated, gravity driven collapse.  NIST's computer model does not explain how the WTC7 steel frame shattered, NIST can only demonstrate the WTC7 steel frame deforming.   It should be obvious that it requires a lot more energy to get a steel structure to shatter into small pieces, than it does to get that steel frame to deform and crumple.  NIST doesn't explain where this energy source could have come from to explain this physical evidence.  The best they can do is this computer model that shows that WTC7, even when assuming the fires were intense enough to cause column failure, could only cause deformation of the steel structure, but not total collapse, and definitely not a debris pile of shattered steel.

       For the writers maybe, yeah they can throw in their critiques of the establishment. Not for the public watching. The public has very little to no input into propietary entertainment. The public is usually only permitted to sit back and watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't realize that things like sports, theaters, and religion were used by elites throughout history as forms of control and/or to divert the attention of the public, then you have not been paying attention to history.

       If you see what I have written I never once mentioned the internet. The internet has proven to be a thorn in the establishment's side. Look at how slow the media industry took to adapt to the internet. HBO is still dragging their feet forcing people to pay for a television subscription for HBO Go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think there is so much effort to control the internet? Just today the UK is forcing ISPs to block porn unless the customer specifically requests.

       There is no turning back once someone accepts 9/11 for what it was. Down the rabbit hole you fall, closer and closer to becoming a

       Its the equivalent of trying to rid a bad trait from your personality in a single day, you can quite easily figure out why said trait is bad for you but its so ingrained in you and you've lived with it for so long that you to do so would mean to commit to a completely different path in reality.

       So much of this is so hard to accept without understanding the way the whole system works. That's always my problem in getting people to believe me. One isolated incidence is easy to brush aside as false/innacurate because of everything else you'd need to accept...keep searching and it becomes hard to see how you ignored them for so long.

       One of the aspects of 9/11 that is so sinister and diabolical is that it was the shock that was needed to brainwash a nation. The media showed the planes hitting the towers and the explosions that followed over and over. They showed the collapse of the Towers over and over along with the horrified people bloodied and covered in dust. They showed the people falling to their deaths.....
      </p>
      <p>
       A very old brainwash technique is to violently psychologically shock the victim...the mind goes into a kind of reset and during this time it is very vulnerable to suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official story was being given to us that day how the jet fuel caused the collapse of the WTC...and the people took it. The official story became religion and anyone who questioned it was a blasphemer.  To claim the towers came down from controlled demolition meant that you were insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple months after 9/11, William Kristol went on national TV to say that anyone who thinks the towers came down from controlled demolition should be institutionalized. He was serious. I myself have been screamed at and called "sick" to my face. The brainwash is deeply imbedded with most people to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to 9/11, the Truth scares the living shit out of people. When I realized the Towers were Controlled Demolitioned, I went into a depression for weeks...the realization that people could be so evil. I took the red pill and the world became a different place.

       Their brains turn off because they know what the implications of a controlled demolition are. It means that the people currently in power are murderous thugs and have a level of control over their lives that they did not think was possible. It can be a tough pill to swallow for a weak-minded individual. It is much easier to go about living their lives with the same thought patterns and worldview that they had before, as incorrect and baseless as they may be.

       I agree with everything you said minus the weak-minded part. I believe it's more of a weak-willed thing. I think most of us, in the most general sense, are cut from the same cloth. It's a matter of effort.

       9/11 has in a way "ruined" my life by waking me up. I had no desire to be apart of the system and working for a corporation. I feel like im living in the matrix, among robot zombies, who judge me for going against the grain and not falling into a bullshit career and getting married. Currently I am travelling the world and enjoying what little beauty is left in this world. I have awoken many people, people who judged me a few years ago. Try to stay positive and keep fighting the good fight. Is this real or a dream? I dont know.

       The sound of the explosions in a controlled demolition carry for 3-4 miles yet on 9/11 there were no audible explosions prior to the collapse of all three buildings.  This fact alone dismisses the idea of controlled demolition.

       You seem to neglecting a few things. First, civilian demolitions use different explosives then were used on WTC7. Second, sound proves nothing. Sound can be very easily edited, I am not saying it was or not, just that it can be. Also, sound is different depending on where you are. For example, sound will echo in a canyon where it will not in a big city.

       I don't remember who it was right off hand, but I watched a presentation of a professional structural engineer whose presentation dealt with this very subject. He went piece by piece through the whole thing. He covered the actual construction of the building, and gave many details that together proved conclusively that the destruction of the building was, indeed, a controlled demolition.

       You make it sound as though you are steadfastly clinging to the official story since you can't bear the thought that the Government could have actually been that evil. The prove is there for all to see, that is, unless they
       <em>
        refuse
       </em>
       to see. The Government can be , and
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       , that evil.

       None of what you wrote explains why there were no audible explosions prior to the collapse as is what you would expect in a controlled demolition.

       You make it sound as though you've never looked at anything that disputes the notion of 'government conspiracy'.  There is simply no empirical evidence in favour of the 'truthers', none what-so-ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are however plenty of examples of the 'truth movement' engaging in deceit including editing out certain parts of videos and misquoting first responders.  This raises the question of why does the 'truth' need to rely on deceit?

       I have been following the "official" story since the very day it happened. And, yes, I have been through the whole gambit of theories, official and unofficial. I rely on
       <em>
        facts
       </em>
       alone. To borrow from the late Arthur Conan Doyle (creator of Sherlock Holmes) "If you eliminate the impossible, then whatever remains, how ever improbable, must be the truth". The official story simply has too many disconnected facts and omissions. It is not that I dismiss the official story, it is just that it doesn't make as much sense as the Government would like it to. I don't belong to any "movement" of any kind. I stand alone. Engaging in deceit does happen from all parties for the purpose of political gain, true. I step back from political non sense like this and use facts and logic to work through the process to find what actually happened. Allowing one self to be blinded by politics is a sure way of getting thoroughly confused. Not everyone in the Government are evil. Just a selected few. Unfortunately, these selected few have found a way to gain influence, by various means, to subvert the whole process to their gain. It is these few that must be sought after and exposed, for the good of every one.

People always tell me the government isn't efficient enough to keep a secret. It's about the cover-up, control of dialogue, and misinformation, not about secrecy per se.

       I want to speculate here about how people might be caused to react in the manner you describe. this is weak without corroboration but I think it is available.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the night of September 10th some 11 hours before the events, HAARP was said to have fired up at full power for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember I was driving to work at the time and that I told my brother who was riding with me that I suddenly had the strange, unusual urge to just stop the car and cry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day I remember many others reporting similar feelings at about the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is speculation but HAARP sends high frequencies into the Ionosphere and it also sends VLF (very low frequencies) into the ground in order to 'communicate with submarines'
      </p>
      <p>
       VLF signals in the range of 7.8 Hz. and the concomitant harmonics of that frequency are capable of interacting with the human body since we are attuned to what's known as the Schumann Resonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Schumann resonance is the resonance frequency of the atmosphere that we've' lived in for the past few million years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our being subjected to signals in that range are said to produce feelings of several different kinds.a few of those are nervousness,paranoia, apprehension. There are others .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure I've turned off most readers by this point so I'll end just saying that I think that this  kind of manipulation is possible enough to warrant others with better skills looking into it, especially since there has been such a visceral rejection of the clear facts about 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government  surely has tools that we know nothing about.

       Hmmm, holy shit! I was working nights during Sept 2001, but had an appt that morning, so I woke to the radio. Instead of the usual banter, I heard Dan Rather talking. I had no idea what or where he was talking about but he had said bombing. I cried and turned it off. Finished dressing then walked upstairs to see my step mom crying on the couch, watching that 2nd plane over and over again.
      </p>

       I feel like I'm a pretty empathic person, but I generally don't cry from radio reports.

       Here is what I don't understand about the controlled demolition theory; How does it make sense from a cost/benefit perspective? It's not that I don't think our government is ethically or logistically capable of pulling something like that off, and I get that they were itching for a new Pearl Harbor to get into the middle east and usher in a lot of totalitarian shit. But why would it be necessary to demolish the buildings? Simultaneous suicide attacks on the WTC, pentagon, and wherever the other plane was going would have been enough to achieve their aims. Why risk a second elaborate scheme with hundreds of moving parts and points of failure for so little additional gain? Why rig the buildings to fall in a way that is so suspiciously similar to a controlled demolition? Wouldn't it have been much more convincing(not to mention effective from a public fear perspective) to have the buildings fall in a messier manner? And for the love of god, why would they also take down Building 7? Zero gain there, only massive glaring downsides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so maybe someone decided that to have the desired effect on the populace, the buildings had to fall. In that case, what is to be gained by fucking around with the whole hijacking thing? Just plant the bombs or thermite or whatever in the manner that is alleged, and then blame it on some convenient brown people. It's much simpler that way, the cover story is far less divergent than the reality. Every liar knows that the best lies contain as much truth as possible.

       You need to do more research, there are multiple benefits to bringing down the towers, they were old, losing money, riddled with asbestos and (very recently) insured to the hilt against terrorist attacks. Silverstein made billions out of 9/11 and was, until last week, trying to sue the airlines for even more money, he's probably still trying.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Building 7, look into where the records on Wall St. insider trading, and the $2.3 Trillion that Rumsfeld announced the military could not account for the day before 9/11.

       Just for the sake of argument, does the answer to your cost/benefit analysis question change much if it happened as according to the official story? Meaning, why go through all the effort to hijack planes when you might get caught at any point and the whole plan could fall apart at airport security or with the military shooting the planes down when you could just sneak a bunch of thermite into the lower levels of these buildings and blow out the ground floors?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either method works if the goal is to trump up fake reasons for going into Iraq. Only one way justifies introducing a police state starting at the airports. Get people to submit to groin pat-downs in front of their fellow citizens and raising their arms for naked body scans like they are prisoners, and you can get them to submit to pretty much anything. Besides that, the airplanes full of passengers flying into buildings and the buildings falling down while everyone watched was a huge mindfuck with maximum psy-ops horror.  Huge benefit for small cost in my mind.

       You have to look into the freemasonic symbology of the towers as Joachim and Boaz in this mass trauma-based mind control exercise. You also have to look into what was inside WTC7. Hint: the plot of Die Hard 3 wasn't just a movie. Bottom line though, it was the image of planes crashing into buildings that shocked everyone in complacency. Without it, the whole thing fails.

       From a practical standpoint, psyops aside,  Lucky Larry would have had to demolish the buildings (WTC 1, 2) anyways after the planes hit.  There would have been no way to repair the building.  The building was filled with asbestos that was going to take millions of dollars to clean out.  Both of these facts would have cost untold amounts of money to fix and clean up properly.  Therefore in spectacular Hollywood fashion, the towers were brought down.  Larry doesn't have to pay for repairs or asbestos removal, gets the site cleaned up with help from the government and gets paid (likely) twice the amount of insurance to boot.
      </p>
      <p>
       They brought them down, straight down to minimize damage to other parts of the city.  Could you imagine if WTC1 had broken at the base and fell like a tree?

       Well it's possible (IMO likely) that the plane which crashed into Pennsylvania was intended to hit WTC7. Also, a simple plane crash which only killed a few dozen people was in no way going to get people to support an invasion of the middle east and absolving of the constitution. It's all about the effect on the minds of the people. Third, they know the people are
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       brainwashed. If they say something happened which phsyicsally couldn't happen (that these towers collapsed the way they did via fires) happened, and repeat it enough, people will believe it. And the people will vehemently defend it. It's honestly very similar to a religion. Anyone who wasn't raised religious or is keen on research and logic, thinks "how the heck do people believe this?" ex stuff like that God let humans exist for over 200,000 years before he decided they needed saving (even though he made this and is supposedly omniscient), or that if god is omniscient how is prayer effective, etc etc. people are born into their religions and don't base their beliefs on evidence, they belief it because they have forced themselves to, and thus are unoopen to evidence which contradicts their beliefs. The people are brainwashed to believe that the media wouldn't lie to them and that their government wouldn't lie to them and that's really the only way they are able to get away with this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, also using the analogy of a religion—just because you can't figure out why someone would invent or manipulate a religion doesn't mean that it's logical to say "well I don't see any reason why someone would make up something that wasn't true, therefore it is probably true". The same goes for 9/11. We don't have all the facts. We don't know exactly what the plan is, however after a decade of independent research we've been able to come fairly close. Just because we don't know every fact doesn't mean we can ignore the ones that we have, and the ones that we have almost explicitly point against the official story. There is literally
       <em>
        hundreds
       </em>
       of hours of reading material out there on 9/11, and to say that it was or wasn't as the official story purports based on a few minutes of thinking about it, is ridiculous to say the least.

      <p>
       Not a lot of people know there was a 3rd building.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Find a good crisp clear video of the tower collapsing.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Ask people if it looks like a demolition, they will say yes and then you...

      <p>
       3) tell them that this was the 3 Ed building that fell during 9/11

       You're describing cognitive dissonance. This phenomenon as it pertains to 9/11 both fascinates and disturbs me. I am trying to understand why some of us see it so clearly while others will vehemently defend the lie in the face of what appears to be blatantly obvious facts and evidence. To be honest it has also shaped my perception of humanity and my decision to even bring kids into this world. The majority dictate the prevailing paradigm yet the majority have their thoughts and ideas implanted by external forces. They are incapable of independent thought.

       We're all "just human" though, imperfect. And we have been lied to.
       <strong>
        We
       </strong>
       didn't plot something so heinous. I think most people who are in denial are in denial because they can't believe there can be such evil. That's not a bad thing. It just means they assume the best in others. And then some people are in denial because of some degree in fear in either facing the truth or in avoiding action. Or there's the fear of being labeled crazy and being outcast. And then most people are just trying to survive. They might be working two jobs and struggling to make ends meet and keep a family together. They're already worn out. There's a lot worse things to be than being incapable of independent thought. The people that planned it
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       capable of very independent and creative thought. But they're not good people. This was a huge psyops operation against the people of the world. We are the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, this
       <strong>
        would
       </strong>
       be a very challenging time to have kids, for a number of reasons.

       Once the undamaged top portion of the building gets up to speed, it's kinetic energy is over 100 times greater than the energy that can be absorbed by the steel below. That is less than 1% resistance. Considering how the rate of descent was calculated, that is well within the inherent error. This is also why it doesn't begin to fall at free fall immediately.

       I like how he makes the point that scientists and engineers are fallible as if that's the reason no one takes this seriously. When really this is pretty basic physics that debunks this "smoking gun". Maybe you guys could do with a lesson in physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone responds to me, please answer this. If these columns were all cut precisely at the same time, then why doesn't free fall occur immediately? And why does free fall stop coincidentally after the damaged portion of the building hits the ground?

       report was done for WTC1 and 2, similarly designed steel structures. The energy released by the top portion of the building falling one story is equivalent to 8.4x the energy that can be absorbed by the steel below. And this is considering the absolute best case scenario that could never happen, in reality that number is much higher. If we relate this back to building 7, there is a proportionally much greater weight above the point of failure, so we are again looking at a number much larger than the 8.4x.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that after falling only a couple stories, the resistance of the steel below if very small.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the NIST report they say that the resistance of the building is negligible. As to why they didn't go into more detail, I don't know, but it doesn't seem suspicious to me, because the argument you guys make holds no water, and anyone with a background in mechanics can see that.

       The report that you are citing is junk science.  And you know it.   The report that Beneneb is linking to ignores all the visual evidence of 9/11 and instead relies on recordings of controlled demolitions for their data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Page 308 (1st page) Introduction they describe their methods of data collection.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A simplified one-dimensional analyti-
cal solution of the collapse front propagation will be presented. It
will be shown how this solution can be used to determine the
energy absorption capability of individual stories if the motion
history is precisely recorded. Because of the shroud of dust and
smoke, these histories can be identified from the videos of the
collapsing WTC towers only for the first few seconds of collapse,
and so little can be learned in this regard from that collapse.
        <strong>
         However, monitoring of tall building demolitions, which repre-
sent one kind of progressive collapse, could provide such
histories.
        </strong>
        Development of a simple theory amenable to inverse
analysis of these histories is the key.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then they limit the focus of their study to proving that the upper 20 floors structure can crush a single story, NOT the whole building.
      </p>
      <p>
       On page 309. Review of Causes of the WTC Collapse 4.(7)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        7 local plastic buckling of heated column webs—ﬁnally led to buckling of columns Fig. 1b. As a result, the upper part of the tower fell, with little resistance,
        <strong>
         through at least one ﬂoor height
        </strong>
        , impacting the lower part of the tower. This triggered progressive collapse because the kinetic energy of the falling upper part exceeded by an order of magnitude the energy that could be absorbed by limited plastic deformations and fracturing in the lower part of the tower.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then they tell you that, because they feel confident they can prove that the upper floor structure above the planes impact point could fall and crush a single story, (based on data collected from Controlled Demolitions and not the actual evidence, mind you.) they don't have to calculate the behavior of the rest of the structure.  Further down on page 309.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It was also observed that this (single story drop) conclusion made any calculations of the dynamics of progressive collapse after the ﬁrst single-story drop of upper part super- ﬂuous.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When it comes time to prove that the upper 20 floors of the building can continue to completely pulverize the rest of the structure, This is the conclusion given.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         If
        </strong>
        the total internal energy loss during the crushing of one story representing the energy dissipated by the complete crushing and compaction of one story, minus the loss of gravity potential during the crushing of that story exceeds the kinetic energy impacted to that story, collapse will continue to the next story. This is the criterion of progressive collapse trigger Eq. 5.
        <strong>
         If
        </strong>
        it is satisﬁed, there is no way to deny the inevitability of progressive collapse driven by gravity alone regardless of by how much the combined strength of columns of one ﬂoor may exceed the weight of the part of the tower above that ﬂoor. What matters is energy, not the strength, nor stiffness.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These IF statements are assumptions based off of false premises.
      </p>
      <p>
       They only proved the upper 20 floor block of the structure could fall through and crush a single story of the 90 floor structure beneath it, and then they made 89 assumptions that it could continue to crush the rest of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what does
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">
        Occam's Razor
       </a>
       say?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It states that among competing hypotheses, the hypothesis with the
        <strong>
         fewest assumptions
        </strong>
        should be selected. In other words, the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I submit that there is a better explanation for how the Towers collapsed that doesn't have to avoid all the evidence and doesn't have to make these enormous assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Beneneb, please explain why ignoring evidence in a scientific study is a good idea?  Why do you think ignoring doing any forensic research on the crime scene of the crime of the century, is a good idea?   Do you support these methods in any other scientific studies?  You should know as a professional, you can convince yourself to believe anything if you allow yourself to make assumptions based on false premises.
      </p>
      <p>
       This report was written by Bazant in 2007,

       Can you please cite where you get your 100x comparison? I'm not necessarily doubting it, but since your argument rests entirely on that, I would like verification. The reason I wonder about this is that the "energy that can be absorbed by the steel below" is not a static value. I just can't even imagine how such a complex set of changing factors could be distilled into this "100 times" you mention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the answer to your question:
It's the same situation whether the building failure happened from a controlled demolition or not. The NIST report broke the descent into three distinct time blocks, with the first section being the one where acceleration was distinctly less than 9.8m/s/s. The explanation was that during this time, the outer columns were still buckling. 
So, the answer would be the same as for a controlled demolition. The manner of demolition did not allow for an immediate and total failure of the supporting members. There would be about 1.75 seconds during which the columns were providing just enough support to offer some small resistance. Why 1.75 seconds? Well, that would depend on the manner of the demolition, assuming that's what it was. There is nothing that says controlled demolitions must result in an immediate (less than 1.75 s) and total failure. Your question assumes this to be true, for some reason. 
This answer should suffice, not as
       <strong>
        proof
       </strong>
       of controlled demolition, but as a rebuttal to your implied argument that  a controlled demolition explanation is somehow inconsistent with a 1.75 second building up to free fall acceleration.

       The building is accelerating at a rate near free fall through out the majority of it's demolition.  The building was actually at free fall speeds during 2.5 seconds of it's demolition.

       Now you answer mine. The impossibility of admitted 'free-fall' speed cannot happen from core columns buckling. You are somehow viewing this building as a structure made of a glass frame. It's not. Even if a million pound rock fell on the top of the building, it would STILL SLOW DOWN FROM 9.8m/s/s. There would be no free-fall.

       I can tell right now that even if it was demolished it wouldn't fall at that exact speed because of air resistance. It would have fallen within a few percent of free fall, but we just say free fall because it is so close. The structure would have given negligible resistance after a certain point because of the kinetic energy released from a falling mass that great.

       This is really a silly argument. Obviously true free fall only happens in the absence of air resistance or other resisting forces. What we're talking about is whether the rate of acceleration is close to what one would expect if air resistance is the
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       resisting force. For practical purposes, this is called "free fall" in nontechnical discussions assuming that air resistance has not increased to the point where acceleration is significantly less than 9.8ms2. Even the NIST  acknowledges that acceleration was at "free fall" from 1.75 seconds to 4.0 seconds. If they don't need to qualify this by saying, "Well it's not actually free fall because of air resistance" then we don't need to either.

      <p>
       The resistance offered, at any given moment by the lower structure, has no relationship to the kinetic energy of the falling structure above. Obviously, the more energy is absorbed, this energy does work on the structure, and that work is the continued destruction/weakening of the structure. But, the resistance is not just "diminished" because the structure above is moving fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, you're discussion is rather confused because you are contrasting energy (KE of falling body) with force (the resistance of the structure below). May I offer a hint for you in further discussions to just compare force with force, or energy with energy.

       My point is that you can relate energy and velocity. If the steel absorbs only a very small portion of the kinetic energy than it has little effect on the velocity.

       'Falling mass' implies that it had nothing holding it up underneath. If there was any structure left, it would not be 'falling.' One column (from the NIST report) cannot cause any part of the building to 'fall.'

       Are you implying buildings can't collapse?
      </p>
      <p>
       As the structure starts to give out, the building starts falling (not at free fall initially) but the rate of descent increases until it reaches free fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       It then slows down after a certain point because the upper portion is undamaged and as it impacts with the ground there is less mass above, which means less force. And this is not what you see with a controlled demo.

       Free fall drop means not doing any work (including destroying the structure below) just falling and accelerating. It's hard to understand how this happened especially looking at this NISt collapse

       May I suggest a physics book for you, sir? "Conceptual Physics" by Paul Hewwitt is a great textbook that explains the basic ideas without confusing you with too much mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not slow down because "there is less mass above". In a given gravitational field, and assuming no resisting forces, acceleration is constant and is (effectively) independent of mass. (9.8 m/s/s on Earth close to sea level.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I see perhaps where your mistake lies.  F=ma expresses the proportional relationship between mass and force. You say, "less mass, which means less force." True. The force (of the weight of the object--gravity, really) is reduced if it has less mass. But, that also means that that reduced force is working on an object with less inertia. So, it will
       <strong>
        still
       </strong>
       accelerate at 9.8 m/s/s.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual reason it slows down when it begins to hit the structure below and the ground is that the Earth itself offers a resisting force to the object. The object pushes on the Earth, and the Earth pushes back on the object!  :-)

       A demolition does not preclude the upper structure being left untouched by explosions.

       But then you suggest that they only demolished the first half of the building? is that correct? Well at least we can agree that the upper 30 something floors were relatively structurally intact then.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the initial part of the collapse with less than free fall rate of descent? The official story nicely explains this as it coincided with the perimeter columns beginning to buckle after the core collapsed within the building.

       Most people dont know about building 7, but it was rightin the midst of a clusterfuck, they were able to smudge this lie through, but barely.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the moment we look at the pentagon and flight 93, the entire theory begins to crumble. Because you see, all we need is 1 obvious fabrication of the story. Just 1 thread and then we need to yank it, and the cloth that is this lie will unravel. the only thing that becomes evident is that the government lied about "the biggest attack on american soil". The government lied about the incident that resulted in the patriot act and rapid deterioration of our liberty's; and that, is enough

       Pentagon:
       <br/>
       1) initial hole, too small for a plane.
       <br/>
       2)for a hollow aluminum tube to break through several walls of reinforced blast concrete (totaling 9 feet of concrete over the distance 230 ft) is a child's imagination. Here is a jet hitting a slab of concrete: [Vaporized](

       </a>
       ) and going twice the speed. No hole.
       <br/>
       3) they say the plane leveled out last second and hit the first floor of the building completely parallel to the ground. And yet the lawn looks like you can play some Pro Golf on it.

      <p>
       Flight 93:
       <br/>
       No wonder this one slipped out of public eye. This one is easy. Look at the debri from flight 93s crash site. Then, find another picture of a REAL plane crash.

       I don't have a problem believing people are that evil. I have a problem with everyone thinking their government is smart enough to pull it off and be able to keep a secret. Especially in today's day and age in which the pentagon has more leaks than a rotten pirate ship.

       Well, from the research I've done, the overwhelming majority of leaks fall under a "sacrifice a pawn to save your king" (chess) kind of thing. And when you spend enough time around here, you start to get the sense that for every 1 thing 'leaked' there are hundreds, if not thousands, which aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's important to note that, from research done in regards to 9/11 and every other potential false flag/'conspiracy'/etc, the evidence suggests that never are these things done by presidents or below (congress, House, etc), exempting usually VPs who tend to actually know much more than the pres. Often they (presidents) know, but only as much as is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       For who most likely committed 9/11 and how, I can't recommend

        this article

       enough. If you're still unsure of whether the building were brought down in a controlled demolition I recommend

       Almost puked. These were propably the strongest buildings ever constructed in the last century. The steel of the frame was twice as thick as that of a WW2 tank. So it is impossible for it to be crushed by ALUMINIUM "planes". This "cracked" article is just the same propaganda bullshit as you find it everywhere.

       I remember watching it happen as a fourth grader, I was sitting there in my living room thinking "this is horrible, those buildings are huge and strong, the damage is all at the top they'll be able to put out the fire" just then the tower fell, it never looked right to me, and no one listened to me when I said it fell from the bottom.

       I agree those were controlled demo's. one thing I've never worked out though is the prep. To wire an empty stripped out building, prep it to free fall into its own footprint etc etc, takes weeks. How did they rig the building full of people and fittings with no one noticing., these buildings were massive. Most likely occupied 7 days a week.

       someone mentioned it is ODD to see a 9/11 post getting MANY UP-VOTES and I agree -- it is probably because "they" are too busy plugging other leaks in the ship as the rate of decent increases.  The ship is going down and they are no longer focused on damage control -- they are in retreat in survival mode.

       large-scale brainwashing going on, and it has been doing so for several hundred years.  People are in their infancy of discovering that life, as they "know" it, is completely constructed for them from birth to death.  Even their

       Later that day when the official position was that the towers collapsed by themselves due to the impact, I immediately called bullshit and from that day on, I'm too wearing one of those shirts.

       In the book, Report from Ground Zero, which tells first hand accounts from Firefighters and Police who were there that day, there are multiple stories of looking up at 7 and saying that the entire building was on fire. Regardless, I don't trust that fire made that building fall.

       It would sure be nice to get conclusive proof so that we can take off our hats.  The funny thing is that if you believe the "official" statements that means that something happened, that defies rules of physics.  This happened not once... but three times (bldg 1, bldg 2 then bldg 3) on the same day.  Ignoring this is-- I don't know-- probably someone who is thinking that ignorance is bliss.

       Once again, this just proves that George W. Bush himself planted the bombs on all the buildings that did this.  All without being seen.  Not too bad for someone his age.  Of course, all the evidence in Roswell and Kennedy was in that building and they couldn't let the truth out about who killed Kennedy, even though we all know it was a relative of George Bush.  Plus, they couldn't let the evidence out about Roswell either, because that's where the Bush family came from.

       So much of this is so hard to accept without understanding the way the whole system works. That's always my problem in getting people to believe me. One isolated incidence is easy to brush aside as false/innacurate because of everything else you'd need to accept...keep searching and it becomes hard to see how you ignored them for so long.

       It makes it more newsworthy if it looks like a controlled demo. You'd expect a building collapsing to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       look so perfectly like a controlled demo.

       The progressive collapse is on the inside. As I said, the NIST model predicts that the interior structure collapses, after which the outside falls like a curtain, with nothing resisting its fall, which is what you see on the video.
