       Nothing in this world is ever going to get fixed. The rich will not share with the poor. The Politicians see only their own gain, which the rich exploit. The people either don't know or don't care. The US/Israel are only interested in killing anyone who doesn't do as they are told.

       In the past 14 years or so, what has improved for the lives of the common people ? Nothing. The MSM is noise. The Government makes noise. Politicians make noise. Nothing of any
       <em>
        value
       </em>
       gets said. Taxes increase. Police, for the most part, act like people are criminals that need to prove their innocence, rather than the other way around. Wars all over the place, with many more on deck. Unemployment at an all time high. Our global environment, despite all the bickering back and forth, isn't doing all that well.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is being done to fix any or all of that ? Nothing. Noise.

       Rape has far reaching consequences because it cases psychosis.  When those kids grow up, you can count on that society having lots of revolutionary and militaristic type thinking.  Basically, it causes the society to be more prone to rigid simplistic type structures and ideals.

       Yeah I'm not saying it isn't awful or damaging, I'm not even trying to weigh poverty in comparison to rape. They are both absolutely terrible.

       I guess I just mean the West spends too much time focused on criticizing middle eastern sex issues (tbc rape is not sex, I mean the more broad term dealing with sex relations) while millions die to provide markets...even as like 1/5 women in the US are sexually assaulted in their lifetime

       This is an important point. It is always easier to focus on the faults of others rather than to focus on the faults of yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not meant to imply that they do not have faults. They do. And, in some cases, their faults may be worse than ours. However, it is also important to look at the effects of the wars by the Western powers on the people of the ME. War makes people savage, violent, stressed out and causes them to seek salvation in fundamental religion. So, it is important to not forget this side of the problem also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, there is the use of the media to propagate this image of savages to gain support for the various wars against ME/NA states. This is the motivation for many of these "news" articles.

       But, your basic point, as I understand it, that the anger of the people is caused by the situation at home, but directed at the "other" overseas, is a valid point, I think.

       This is the dumbest argument I have ever seen. That is just a page for sexual slavery, which is present in every country. Just because this culture also has a name for it (like every-fucking-one else) it does not make the entire culture pedophiles or rapists.IGNORANT FUCK.
