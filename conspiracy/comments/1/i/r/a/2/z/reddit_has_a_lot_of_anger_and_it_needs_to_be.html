<p>Well, who says that all we can do is make &quot;noise?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past 14 years or so, what has improved for the lives of the common people ? Nothing. The MSM is noise. The Government makes noise. Politicians make noise. Nothing of any <em>value</em> gets said. Taxes increase. Police, for the most part, act like people are criminals that need to prove their innocence, rather than the other way around. Wars all over the place, with many more on deck. Unemployment at an all time high. Our global environment, despite all the bickering back and forth, isn&#39;t doing all that well. </p>

<p>What is being done to fix any or all of that ? Nothing. Noise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t awful or damaging, I&#39;m not even trying to weigh poverty in comparison to rape. They are both absolutely terrible. </p>

<p>I guess I just mean the West spends too much time focused on criticizing middle eastern sex issues (tbc rape is not sex, I mean the more broad term dealing with sex relations) while millions die to provide markets...even as like 1/5 women in the US are sexually assaulted in their lifetime</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an important point. It is always easier to focus on the faults of others rather than to focus on the faults of yourself. </p>

<p>This is not meant to imply that they do not have faults. They do. And, in some cases, their faults may be worse than ours. However, it is also important to look at the effects of the wars by the Western powers on the people of the ME. War makes people savage, violent, stressed out and causes them to seek salvation in fundamental religion. So, it is important to not forget this side of the problem also.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the use of the media to propagate this image of savages to gain support for the various wars against ME/NA states. This is the motivation for many of these &quot;news&quot; articles.</p>
