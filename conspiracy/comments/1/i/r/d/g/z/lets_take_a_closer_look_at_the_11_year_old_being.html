        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J7_TKgw1To">The video in question of the 11 Year old forced to Marry</a> is playing on your emotional and snap judgement decision making skills and it appears to be working very well (as of now 4500 upvotes and counting!!!). But lets look a little further into the people behind this video to get a clearer picture or the agenda behind this video before you fall head over heals in love with this story.</p>

<p>The video is produced by an outlet called MEMRI. It&#39;s famous for selecting and sometimes misinterpreting what they are translating in order to broadcast the worst possible from the Arab countries and Iran (also notice that within the first 5 highest rated comment threads, the people are already asking for confirmation on an accurate translation of the video, very important to pre-emptive squash and dispel any second guessing of MEMRI reporting).</p>

<p>Its founder is an ex-official from the Israeli army, and their agenda is pretty much self-evident. FYI it&#39;s the same media outlet that made Ahmadinejad say that Israel should be erased when he never meant that.</p>

<p>MEMRI, is ran by Israelis and also funded by Private Donors. Propaganda at it&#39;s finest. Reddit is chewing this up like a dumb dog before doing a little background research on who, or what is behind this <a href="http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4637246_700b.jpg">Evil Racoon</a></p>

<p>Taken from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Critics charge that it aims to portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light, through the production and dissemination of inaccurate translations and through selectivity in choosing extreme views to publicize.</p>

<p>MEMRI was founded in 1998. MEMRI was fonded by Yigal Carmon and Meyrav Wurmser. Wurmser, who later left MEMRI, is an Israeli-born, American scholar of the Arab world. She is also a Senior Fellow at the US think tank, the Hudson Institute who participated in a study that led to the report, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, a paper prepared for Likud party leader and then incoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funding</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MEMRI is registered in the US with the IRS as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.[18] They have a policy of not accepting money from governments, relying instead on around 250 private donors, including other organizations and foundations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bias:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brian Whitaker, the Middle East editor for The Guardian newspaper wrote in a public email debate with Carmon, that his problem with MEMRI was that it &quot;poses as a research institute when it&#39;s basically a propaganda operation.&quot;</p>

<p>Whitaker had charged that MEMRI&#39;s role was to &quot;further the political agenda of Israel.&quot; and that MEMRI&#39;s website does not mention Carmon&#39;s employment for Israeli intelligence, or Meyrav Wurmser&#39;s political stance, which he described as an &quot;extreme brand of Zionism.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Quote from James Woolsey:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;MEMRI is the single most important source for understanding what is happening in the Greater Middle East and what we must know to fight effectively the war on terrorism both at home and abroad.&quot; – James Woolsey, Former CIA Director and MEMRI Board Member</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before you make a quick snap judgement just remember there is a war on for your mind, this game is playing on your emotions and it seems to be working.  What is the purpose behind stirring up the hive mind, we shall see, just know the back story before you get too emotionally caught up in this story.</p>

<p>Get ready for the bombs and bloodshed, if it can save one little girl with impeccably worded speech, it&#39;s all worth it, even if it takes killing 100,000 other boys and girls. Support the troops. /s</p>

<p>Also wonder if it has anything to do with this &quot;threat&quot; to the western monetary scheme of unbacked currency:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This year’s budget envisions a deficit of $3.2 billion, which will be financed in part by foreign aid, Bin Hammam said. “If such financing does not materialize then the government would take necessary actions to limit the budget deficit to levels that could be financed from domestic non-inflationary resources.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t forget Libya and the lies perpetrated there. We might be looking at something similar.</p>

<p>edit: Here&#39;s the dissent in the thread, towards the bottom. Glad it at least has 250ish &quot;you&#39;re right&quot; points.</p>

<p>Do you think US has a right to bomb them then?</p>

<p>Worse things happen (BY FAR) all over Africa, even in Southeast Asia. Where&#39;s the outcry?</p>

<p>Hell, we don&#39;t even give a shit about the Drug War right to the south of us, it&#39;s claimed the lives of ~30,000 in the past year and a half, plus numerous tortures, rapes, and other evils.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you wonder why the concerns of one particular country in the middle east are being highlighted so extensively all of a sudden? Didn&#39;t you see how that happened in Libya and Syria, and then the US funded armies (al-Qaeda) to interfere?</p>

<p>We have no right to meddle. We can&#39;t keep pretending to be the policemen of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it is pretty easy to make people hate these countries. They do enough verified bad stuff. For instance. There&#39;s a book called &quot;Sold&quot; about two girls born and raised in the UK, with a British mother and a Yemeni father. They were sent to Yemen to visit, they thought, their father&#39;s side of the family. Instead they were sold into marriage, raped and impregnated. The boys didn&#39;t even want it but their parents forced it. </p>

<p>When it became known and the British demanded the girls, Yemen allowed them to leave but refused to allow them to take their children. So one sister went home and one stayed with her children. </p>

<p>The hijab/burka is not required except where western backed regimes rule.  Syria?  No.   Under attack by Obama.  Libya?  No.  Attacked by Obama.  Iran?  Technically, but women wear transparent ones and the US overthrew the secular regime they had.  Iraq?  No, but we overthrew the secular Saddam for trading oil in euros instead of dollars and the terrorists we finance to keep the occupation going require it locally.  List goes on.  Pakistan?  Only in the tribal areas where Brzezinski (Obama&#39;s national security adviser) created al-Qaeda and went on to write a book bragging about it. There is no extraordinary problem in the Islamic community other than the western intelligence operatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was born free, first baptized Episcopalian and ended my relationship with religion as a Catholic. A person can&#39;t wander the halls of the asylum without coming across the theory that TPTB want to get rid of all religion and instill a new, world wide &quot;religion&quot;. I&#39;ve sometimes wondered, mostly aloud and to myself, are we seeing the start of a push to do just that? At this rate it would take a couple to several generations to accomplish. </p>

<p>There is no denying. </p>

<p>Although, like most appalling cultural practices this often happens in very rural, poor areas where people are basically illiterate and uneducated.    This world is far from perfect.  Unfortunately not everyone has &#39;gotten the memo&#39; about being civilized. Nor should they be expected to have a eureka moment overnight and change thousands of years of culture.  It took time for us to be the way we are and it will take them time too catch up.  People need to chill out and think of ways to help rather than hate people who have fallen behind.</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, i was not trying to sway people to think one way or the other, was merely supplying background information (that is not readily available) so others can form their own opinion first before diving head first in and getting emotionally pissed off or hatred for something without knowing all the facts first.</p>

I would hope that this subreddit would find conspiracies that arent in the public eye, but instead this subreddit finds whatever is trending and turns it into a conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that all he really did was prove that one aspect of the video was unreliable. And even then that aspect really has a small role in what happened. The title had nothing to do with it, I saw immediately that he chose ONE thing wrong with the video, and cherry picked information to support his otherwise unsubstantiated conspiracy. Even if his claim was correct, what reason would they have to show this &quot;propaganda?&quot; In the post OP claims that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Propaganda at it&#39;s finest. Reddit is chewing this up like a dumb dog before doing a little background research on who, or what is behind this Evil Racoon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A) If its propaganda, what is the agenda?</p>

<p>B) How involved in the video was MEMRI? </p>

<p>C) He didnt take a closer look at the video, he took a closer look at organization whos involvement can be debated</p>

<p>D) Half his &quot;proof&quot; holds no meaning with any rational individual.</p>

<p>Really what this boils down to is anti-semitism on a video that really has nothing to do with Jewish people. Simply put, you&#39;re a joke.</p>

We have &quot;sexy&quot; people. Or we have people that choose to dress provocative and people who don&#39;t. It&#39;s a choice, influenced by culture? Yes. But a choice nonetheless. I&#39;m sure a child does not have the capacity to choose a marriage, let alone attempt to defy her family to continue playing with toys. I don&#39;t care who thinks there right, there comes a point where it&#39;s so black and white there is no gray area to stand on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, the origin of the video is ISreali-funded.. so of course it&#39;s going to find the most egregious case they can find.  </p>

<p>Second of all, I never said I agreed or disagreed, but why sexual ethics are different.  </p>

<p>Third of all, this IS the conspiracy board.  The idea that a story of pre-arranged marriage is the most popular story on reddit today speaks volumes about our own ideals and desires.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you proud of being retarded?  This stuff happens every day in America too.  It has nothing to do with Islam.</p>

<p>The hijab/burka is not required except where western backed regimes rule.  Syria?  No.   Under attack by Obama.  Libya?  No.  Attacked by Obama.  Iran?  Technically, but women wear transparent ones and the US overthrew the secular regime they had.  Iraq?  No, but we overthrew the secular Saddam for trading oil in euros instead of dollars and the terrorists we finance to keep the occupation going require it locally.  List goes on.  Pakistan?  Only in the tribal areas where Brzezinski (Obama&#39;s national security adviser) created al-Qaeda and went on to write a book bragging about it. There is no extraordinary problem in the Islamic community other than the western intelligence operatives.</p>
