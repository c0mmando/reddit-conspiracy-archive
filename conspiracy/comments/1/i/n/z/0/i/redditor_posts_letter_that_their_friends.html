        <strong>
         Original Post
        </strong>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I submitted this little review to
       <a href="/r/KarmaConspiracy">
        /r/KarmaConspiracy
       </a>
       earlier, but then after some thought I realized it wasn't really a conspiracy to earn karma, so I hope this is the right place.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What's the conspiracy?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Militant atheist raising eyebrows on religious groups that are anti-gay.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of people living in the area commented on the thread, all lost in confusion how anyone could be that hateful. It's not unknown or hard to believe that Kingston, Ontario is actually a gay-friendly location, as we all know there aren't really any mean Canadians.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Okay... but why atheist wtf?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's two groups who regularly display Christianity as a very extreme, hateful, violent religion. They are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Westboro Baptist Church (minus the violence)
       </li>
       <li>
        Militant atheists (an atheist who argues that the world is much better without religion)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's arguable that a WBC member would travel to Canada to ignorantly spread their hate even further. I think it's agreeable, however, that it's much more likely to be someone who wanted that letter to be seen. By many people. So we could all see how horrible Christians are, even to this day! They added violence, and that's how I knew it was a fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Who the fuck posted that?
        <del>
         possibly the writer?
        </del>
       </strong>
       Note: poster is not affiliated. there is verified proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a good fucking question. Redditor for 0 days, and this guy has LOST HIS FAITH IN HUMANITY! It would have been far too obvious with a more fitting title like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Fuck religion
       </li>
       <li>
        Why does God hate people so much
       </li>
       <li>
        Christians at it again
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Would also like to mention that, when doubted, the OP said there's all sorts of news on it. Okay, so the letter is real and someone sent it around. Someone. You. fukr.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I scrolled down for the TL DR
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       SUMMARY: Some angry kid wrote a letter to a lesbian couple, in an attempt to make everyone freak out over how hateful religious groups can be, at least here in north america. christianity to be specific. Some people hate religion so much that they want everyone to get rid of it. Sounds awful similar to those who hate in the name of religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What should I take out of this?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck the person who posted that, the redditor for 0 days who will most likely become inactive after the post rolls off front page.

       A group doesn't have to be widely known to exist... I'm sure there are still KKK sympathisers around, even if the Klan has dwindled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, there's still plenty of racists/sexists/homophobes and other idiots that don't even think of the KKK.

       Homophobes still exist, even in Canada.

       Don't worry. Here on Reddit, a lot of new accounts get made for "shill" purposes. You will just have to gain some time, as far as your Reddit account is concerned, and then you will be taken more seriously. This is not your fault. It is just the fault of things you have no control over. Relax. Time heals all, even on Reddit. :)

       Just wanted to post that I did see the thread(s) that you're referring to, and I don't think that the original poster made this up or is doing it for attention. It's a news story on the
       <a href="http://kingstonherald.com/news/threatening-letters-kingston-2010311764">
        Kingston Herald

        /u/nighthawk1961
       </a>
       I think that there are many situations where the media spins things into larger proportions) and the Kingston Police facebook page (can't link it due to rules) also made a statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Regarding the hate-based and homophobic letters people are showing concern about online, we are confirming a report has been filed with Kingston Police and detectives from the Major Crime Unit are actively investigating this serious and disturbing incident. We absolutely and unequivocally are not involved or connected to this individual or group as is stated in one of the letters, and do not appreciate the association.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, of greater priority is solving this case, caring for the safety and well-being of the complainants, determining who would write such hateful and threatening content, and for what purpose.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyone with first-hand information, or if you've received the same or similar letters, is asked to contact Detective Chris Gobeil at
        <a href="mailto:cgobeil@kpf.ca">
         cgobeil@kpf.ca
        </a>
        or at 613-549-4660 ext 6186.

       Well  It seems not everyone in Kingston likes gays. But from what I can see, it is very few. Yes, there are a few who appear to be "over the top" on this subject, but they are the minority.

       My impression has always been (having lived with a Canadian for many years before) that most Canadians are largely tolerant and open-minded. From the thread itself, it seems that Kingston fits that mold. I won't slap-label an entire community based on this one incident.

       Why would they want their message to be seen by many many people? If anything, they'd like to remain ANONYMOUS and not train their kids to shoot homo's with BB's.

       Everyone's focused on this person's/"group's" alleged hatred for homosexuality, but it makes very little sense. Read through 100% of my OP.

       I can understand where you're coming from. However, it's unfortunate but in this situation I assume it's just a small group/maybe even just an individual who's perpetrating this animosity. Then, once the situation was uncovered, all it took was one person to post it to a social media site like Facebook, Reddit, or Twitter for it to snowball and become an avalanche of attention/media-whoring.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.thewhig.com/2013/07/19/hate-letters-threaten-gay-couple">
        Here's another article
       </a>
       with the actual targeted couple named as well as their public statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “We appreciate the deluge of support and outrage and offers of assistance we have received from friends, family, acquaintances and strangers from all over,” it read. “Clearly this kind of hate has no place in our community and will not be tolerated.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Edit: Read through your OP again, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the point you're trying to make is that the original author of the letter itself is likely an individual trying to pose as a religious group, in an attempt to make everyone angry about Christianity being intolerant, rather than an actual Christian group/individual? If that's the case, I can definitely stand behind that assertion.

       Your edit is spot-on. It clicks with all the events that went into play.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a moment and consider what the author of the letter was thinking. They mentioned having cops on their side etc etc. They begged the person who received that letter to spread it. All in all, that was the author's purpose: the letter has to be seen by as many people as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way than to accuse the police of being in on some religious anti-gay attitude that encourages violence, hatred, and literally forcing homosexuals to move somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there are people who think like that out there, even in Canada. But they would NOT threaten someone and convince them to go to the police to get some investigation going. This was all under a spotlight, utter bullshit.

       Gotcha. However, some things that I got from the posted pictures-the letter said
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to go to police because they would find out and escalate to violence; I also didn't see anywhere where they encouraged the spread of the letter, only to "persuade another couple like yourselves to move":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you do not, and take this letter to police, as we expect, we will know about this, since we have contacts in Kingston Police. Our efforts to relocate you will escalate. We wish to avoid this scenario.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also this (no news or confirmation that I could find):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Kingston's local HARS (HIV/AIDS Regional Services) has been has bb's shot through their windows recently.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The two things above would lead me to believe that perhaps the individual/group (regardless of religious or not) did have some malicious intent. All in all still an unfortunate situation, and I think that the Kingston Police is doing a good job of handling it (they have issued a statement saying they are in no way related to whoever wrote the letter).
      </p>
      <p>
       They said that their "head office" was in the "Deep South", which I found interesting.

       Since the second claim is unverified, I'm going to focus on your first point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to summarize what I believe is your POV and reply accordingly, let me know if this isn't accurate: You believe that since the letter specifically asked them
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to go to the police that they sincerely did not want the police involved. In this case, it's likely that it was actually an angered religious folk.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       What type of person says "Don't go to the police"? Someone who is ready to kill you or someone you know. Someone who is ready to commit a horrible crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOT someone who warned you that you need to move before it's too late because of your sexuality. The extent of their threats revolved around children shooting BB guns. Also note that they claimed to have corrupted pigs in
       <strong>
        Kingston
       </strong>
       , no where else. Any rational person would simply turn to any form of police/government/news and
       <strong>
        get the word out regarding their corrupt police force
       </strong>
       . Nobody would keep this secret, do you know why? Because they would NOT take those threats seriously, and if they did, they would get the fuck out of there and STILL talk. No matter what, word is getting out regarding that letter and it's outrageous claims. I want to emphasize that so I'll type it again: NO MATTER WHAT, WORD WAS GONNA GET OUT REGARDING THAT LETTER. And the author
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings me to the center of my conspiracy theory. The author of that letter said things that would guarantee that whoever received it would show it to people. Lots of people. And of those large amounts of people, I can guarantee you some would look at this and feel disgust for religion and Christianity. And that, my friend, is exactly the author's intention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a question popped into my head while writing this reply:
       <strong>
        If this is a gay-friendly location and everyone is confused/outraged at this letter, why would this be a new thing? Wouldn't Kingston residents be used to the same old intolerant extremists who send angry letters to non-heterosexual neighbors?
       </strong>

       I definitely agree that whoever wrote the letter knew it was going to get out. Your points about this are well-supported by the fact that despite them (the author) saying that they have succeeded in getting people to move in the past (likely using similarly heavy-handed tactics/letters), this is only coming to light now. It would a misguided assumption to presume that those who "moved" before did so without saying a single thing.

       It was fun to follow along with the story. Until evidence arises regarding who actually wrote the letter, I'm sticking to my theory. I strongly believe that this was a person who does not like any form of religion.

       And there's nothing I appreciate more than someone who can disagree without being condescending. Kudos

       You and I both know that
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       folks in any religion are "fanatics". It just so happened that this "fanatic" just happened to target Kingston, Ontario using Homosexuality as a "cause du jour". I happen to know for a fact that the gay community here, where I live, has no worries about this "nut". The Police  in Kingston are actually quite professional and will deal with this "nut" in due coarse.

       I saw that. I actually live in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. This is nothing but bullshit media whoring. By that I mean that someone just wants to get attention. Kingston is a relatively gay friendly city. I know many gay people who are not the least bit worried. This is just the MSM stirring up shit, as usual. Yes, there are those in Kingston who don't like gays. it is like that in any city. But in Kingston, as long as you don't go around grabbing other people crotches, then you will be just fine. There is no "conspiracy" here. Just the Kingston MSM being sensationalistic.

       Don't worry. Here on Reddit, a lot of new accounts get made for "shill" purposes. You will just have to gain some time, as far as your Reddit account is concerned, and then you will be taken more seriously. This is not your fault. It is just the fault of things you have no control over. Relax. Time heals all, even on Reddit. :)
