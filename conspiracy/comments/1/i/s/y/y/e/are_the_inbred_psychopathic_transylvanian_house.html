        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some of you may not know that today is a rare and epic planetary alignment.  Today isn&#39;t just a super moon there are also <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5BJH480.jpg">two &#39;grand trines&#39;</a>, otherwise known as a hexagram a star tetrahedron or the Seal of Solomon / star of David.  </p>

<p>Now setting aside the religious connotations of the symbol; the star tetrahedron is essentially an energetic vortex that draws energy into itself.  With the planetary grand trine and our local cluster aligning as well the next 7 days, an insane amount of energy is going to be directly drawn to this planet.  This energy can be used for good or for evil as you can see by the activities on dates of this type of alignment in the above graph</p>

<p>What are the statistical chances that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/palace-prince-williams-wife-kate-labor-19731068">Prince Williams wifey would possibly have their little royal whelp today</a>.</p>

<p>Some circumstantial validation is this astrologers work <a href="http://www.aloha.net/%7Ejohnboy/christpi.htg/christpi.htm">showing the estimated birth and particularly the resurrection date of Jesus Christ.</a> having the same alignment.  I&#39;m not saying any of this is conclusive proof of anything but it&#39;s something interesting none the less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all very interesting. It is not, however, indicative of anything concrete. First, as much as I like to read about astrology, there is no conclusive proof that astrology is anything but pseudo-science. Second, the notion of an &quot;Anti Christ&quot; is religious non sense. So is the &quot;Devil&quot;. Whatever does, or does not, happen will be the result of actions taken by human beings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read more about Aleister Crowley, Jack Parsons, and L Ron Hubbard. They were all using occult magic to summon the great beast and if I remember correctly Jack Parsons believed himself to be the antichrist. Even if it is the work of human beings, magic and rituals are used to help bring these concepts into physical form. And I hope that by now you are aware that the core families seeking to dominate the world are deeply involved in such practices. Having children at specific astrological alignments is a very old practice. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they were aiming for such a unique birthdate. Jack Parsons tried to create a &quot;moon child&quot; under far stranger circumstances... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that maybe so. But my main point is that there is no &quot;Anti-Christ&quot;, there never was. Those who place their belief in such things rely on faith to explain the mysteries of our world. That&#39;s fine. However, I prefer a somewhat more proof based (scientific ?) way to explain things, where ever practical. I still read such things, for they make great reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try and limit my reality to only things I know as fact so I don&#39;t very often integrate faith or belief into my world view if at all possible but I do understand the power of archetypes and metaphor and their impact on the subconscious mind.

    <div class="md"><p>Not just those, a quick check shows that pretty much all of those dates are wrong. Many are way off. </p>

<ul>
<li>The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the start of the gulf war is several days off</li>
<li> The fall of the Berlin wall and reunification of east and west Germany is off by a few months, as is the Yugoslavian breakup. </li>
<li>It suggests Yitzhak Rabin was killed well over a month before he actually was. </li>
<li>Claims Dolly the sheep was born 2 months earlier than it was.</li>
<li> Neither mother Teresa nor Diana died anywhere near October 1st. </li>
<li>The introduction of the Euro is an easy one to mess with, since the currency was introduced in stages, but even then it&#39;s way off. If we assume the &quot;introduction&quot; they mean is the introduction of the new coins and notes then it is off by about 4 years. </li>
</ul>

<p>I can&#39;t be bothered to dig through any more of the list, but I&#39;ve no doubt it&#39;s all as inaccurate. These aren&#39;t even a difference of a few days in most cases. Most of these are errors on the scale of months. Even with the silly numerological basis and the fact that they&#39;ve clearly skewed the shapes to fit their wishes they can&#39;t even get the dates they&#39;re claiming right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a traditional view of physics, yes I would agree.  However to advance science in any meaningful way in the future, they are going to have to be reconsidered.</p>

<p>For example, Tesla&#39;s idea of the aether breaks the laws by using an open system as opposed to a closed one.</p>

<p>Also if you have the time,  please read <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/78621296/Paul-LaViolette-Secrets-of-Anti-Gravity-Propulsion-Tesla-UFOs-And-Classified-Aerospace-Technology-FULL-BOOK-515p">Paul A. LaViolette Ph.D.  - Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion - Tesla, UFOs and Classified Aerospace Technology.</a></p>

<p>The point is this:  Traditional science has had it&#39;s blinders on for many years now, disregarding observed anomolies and writing them off with fanciful and made up explanations that defy logic.  It&#39;s becoming more and more clear that there is something fundamental about our current physics which is inhibiting our growth.</p>

<p>Top scientists working on secret projects at places such as JPL or Los Alamos are instructed through demonstration to &#39;take the blinders off&#39;.  This allows for a different method of problem solving, and a whole new systems approach.</p>

<p>The ideas of this new physics have not penetrated the general public&#39;s mind in part at least, due to the near religious like fervor that science&#39;s &#39;laws&#39; through which science is done.</p>

<p>You would do well to look into the &#39;Electric Universe Theory&#39; as well.  It compliments this quite nicely.</p>

<p>All we have to do to achieve unlimited clean energy, travel near or at the speed of light and abundance for everyone on this planet is simply change how we think about a subject.</p>

<p>LaViolette&#39;s theory is called sub-quantum kinetics.  A summary of some of it&#39;s proven predictions validating the theory are <a href="http://lofi.forum.physorg.com/Sub-Quantum-Kinetics%26%2339%3B-impressive-verifications_14187.html">here.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The triangle pointing up is positive and the triangle pointing down is negative. The two together could potentially create a vortex. I can&#39;t really validate these claims but I can say that to create a vortex it would require two interfering waveforms which the star of David kind of implies. But he&#39;s not saying that a vortex will form by the alignment, just that, that alignment holds a unique type of energy.</p>
