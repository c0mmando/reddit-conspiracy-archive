       What do you mean,

       ?? It's already here! Yesterday I got "corrected" for using the word ""illegal" as opposed to "undocumented". We get newspeak every day! where've you been? Do you own a television, or have you been to public school (where newspeak and where you are told what to say and think is the rule)?? Try bringing up creationism in school, or the holohoax (not that they're inclusive) or say "homosexual" or "sodomite" instead of "gay". We're pretty much told what to think, how to think, and what to say daily.

       Maybe

       you in the Ruling parties way of political thought.

       It sounds like you are starting to understand what an issue this is. Stand firm. Be nice where you can. But stand your ground. Don't be told what to think.

       (one of untold religious creation stories), but not the Holocaust when there is zero evidence to support Creationism and abundant evidence to support the Holocaust which took place in the living memory of people here today.

       Israel has been adopted by the "political tribe" and is being used by them as control over the middle east.  They have steadily been exerting influence over the middle east through them until it is time for the political tribe to capture the resources of whatever country they are going to plunder next.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see the political tribe in the US (currently the most powerful tribe in the world) use this strategy over and over for themselves.  Get a hold on a tribe near the resource they want, cause conflict (when we go to war, they lie to us to get all of the tribes to rally together against a common (most often fake) enemy).  The other tribes are simply "useful idiots" to the political tribe.  They generate all the value in the world and the political tribe takes all of the resources.  In return, they allow us to survive.  We have a primitive understanding that this is how things work even though we can't exactly put it into words.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're still brutal dumb apes, we just can recognize patterns well enough to fool ourselves into believing that we are "intelligent".  If we can recognize the larger and sub-tribes and identify them and their interactions, then we can begin to see more clearly the motives behind everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       (this is why criticism is met harshly with calls of anti-semitism.  It is dishonest, as we all know, but in an effort to protect your resources and those of your tribe, why do you care about the truth?  It is why there was a spectacle about Helen Thomas at all!  We all understand at a primitive level why it was so interesting... a powerful person within the media tribe (that supports the political tribe) publicly betrayed them and we wanted to watch her get "banished".  We all intuitively know these things, but have a hard time putting them into words.)

       I have deep interest in linguistics and animals.  This means that I am more tuned to recognize patterns of behavior in animals (think Temple Granden).
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that if we can see people for what they really are "tribalistic pattern processing apes who only want more stuff to ensure their survival", then we can start to unravel the motivations behind everything.  This means a better understanding of why we have conflicts and how to resolve them at societal levels.  That understanding hurts because it is brutal, but if you repeat what I said above in quotes, you intuitively "feel" like it is right and may be a valuable way of seeing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're smart, so we know that if we can all unite under one "tribe" then things would be better because we have an instinctive nature to not harm our tribe-mates.  This is the struggle that everyone is having.  How do we unite everyone under one tribe, with a shared purpose for survival of everyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       What all of our problems are all of the mini-conflicts of struggles of the sub-tribes that we as animals have naturally divided ourselves into for security of resources for our own survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       (my interest in linguistics for example.  I know what feeling I can give you with words because I experience the same feelings.  Therefore I can walk you through your intuitive feelings with language so that you see the same patterns that I see.  This is the basic principle of how we learn from each other.. we express patterns to each other through language)

       I believe that the human condition of using cognitive bias to defend your tribe and its resources is the greatest obstacle for people to overcome.  I'm not always sure that people are ready to understand themselves as just a more evolved ape.  It makes explaining the world very psychologically uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, try explaining to your wife or girlfriend that the only reason you feel love is because it is your primitive instinct to protect something that brings value to you.  There is no deeper emotional meaning beyond that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That conversation will not go well and bring about a lot of conflicts.  The stupid people will use it as an excuse to admit that we will always be in tribal wars and turn violent to other tribes.  I think my way of thinking can be very dangerous.

       Yes, it can. It speaks to peoples baser instincts. It peels away the facade of our society and that is a scary notion to most people. This, I think, is why people react with such anger.

       Yeah.  I got buried by a post that will literally do nothing.  It is more of the same "get out and vote!" stuff.

       The political tribe controls the candidates and the voting... I don't see why people can't understand that, for that reason, voting will literally do nothing.

       By the way.  There is a reason I'm posting this on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  I believe that conspiracy theorists are simply people who are better able to see patterns.  There is a reason why we break off from others.. it's because we are trying to relate to people with similar abilities to make out the patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       If other people are biologically and physically incapable, it becomes much easier to mischaracterize people than to acknowledge that they may see some pattern that you can not.  Arrogance is a very real human problem and people do not want to feel inferior to anyone, so why would they ever acknowledge that anyone else could be "smarter" than them by way of seeing more nuanced patterns objectively.  Conspiracy theorists are cast out because we primitively "smell" others who may be stronger in some area (mentally strong or physically strong) and are threatened.

       Because AIPAC is one hell of a lobby.  And they successfully infiltrated all of the positions of power that sends $$ to Israel.  Its really as simple as that, a covert coup performed by Israel since the 1970s.

Most zionists before 1900 were more interested in founding Israel in Europe, hence the prohibition of Jewish people from holding land, and why they went into the service, entertainment and financial services (no anti-usury laws).

       Its completely unsourced and doesn't make any sense since its well known she's pro-Palestinian (not saying there's anything wrong with that) and successfully criticised Israel's influence in the past, she didn't always get away with it though, particularly when she chose her words rather poorly.

       I put it in quotes because they claim as their 'trade' (stacking bricks) that which the Babylonians of old tried a few thousand years ago. All those bricks tumbling down on their heads seem to have deprived them of any meaningful skills, so now they stack babble in an attempt to get everyone else to stack their tower while they sit on top... but call themselves masons.

       Hmmm.  I didn't see it that way at all.  Not saying you are stupid for seeing it that way yourself.  I'm not.  However, I didn't see it that way or think that for even a moment.  Seems to me it's common knowledge that she was simply old and died of natural causes AND she was also (rightfully) critical of Israel.  Putting these two things together should, therefore,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       under this context necessarily lead one to think that OP was implying that one lead to the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again though, that's just the way I was/am seeing it is all.

       Well, if he wasn't trying to imply that he shouldn't have put her "timeline" on there.  I vaguely recall someone putting up a Hastings quote and putting his years afterwards. It seemed to be a similar idea.

      <p>
       I think the reason for the timeline involves just how very recently it was that she passed away and is simply paying tribute to it more than attempting to imply a
       <em>
        reason
       </em>
       for the passing.

      <p>
       And this, again, is the very thing I'm actually talking about.  When someone recently passes away, it is common practice to post a memorable quote or something next to their names along w/the d.o.b. and d.o.d.  To my knowledge, this common practice assumes that the quote is simply something being associated with the person - i.e. only what they said - and doesn't necessarily present any type of causative relationship between the quote and the d.o.d. or the reason for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can also be a benefit of the doubt giving type of person, but this is how the OP seems to me.

       Well wait a minute then.  Shouldn't you have just said that from the very beginning then?
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was meant in jest, everyone."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, however, even though you might have meant it in jest - and that's fair enough regardless of whether the jest was well-calculated or not - the fact of the matter is that what you were jesting about is a person in H. Thomas who put their neck out on the line against an organization in Zionism that has proven to be very, very oppressive on this planet and to the population in general.  That is a bravery that many unfortunately don't have and that is greatly appreciated by most.  Although some in this subreddit might be a bit overzealous in their zeal
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       Zionism (myself at times included), the fact is that Zionism is indeed so very caustic and venomous to the nation of the U.S. that many here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       don't take very lightly to anyone even
       <em>
        attempting
       </em>
       to make light of how evil they continue showing themselves to be.  It dissipates the weight that Zionism needs to be given in order for it to be eradicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think perhaps your statement made "in jest" was jesting about a matter that is serious enough (and "too soon" enough) to simply not sit very well with most.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love you too.

       Well, I did say that I had made the comment in a sarcastic manner, which is a form of jest.  I'll refer you to several comments up the chain here where I said:

      <p>
       What's sad about this, is that no one brought her up until she died.  Actually her death pales in significance to her achievements, yet we focus on her only after she dies.  If someone is upset with me because I was more or less making a satirical comment towards OPs title, they should be upset with themselves that they weren't posting about this woman on a daily, nay hourly, basis.  I am willing to bet that most of the people who downvoted me didn't even know who this woman was prior to her death.  I was well aware of her and honestly her dying really doesn't surprise or sadden me one bit, not that I am glad she is dead, but it is just an inconsequential event in my life.

       Okay, but it seems to me that comments should be expected to stand alone and one shouldn't necessarily be required to read the other, separate comments that were made elsewhere in the thread in order to understand it.  If one were previously privy to the other comments you made, then perhaps it would be better contextualized, but redditors don't often read through posts in that manner (nor should one necessarily expect them to).

       I wouldn't go that far.  I've seen her brought up here and there sporadically.  I mean that's how I even knew about her at all actually.  She might not have been a super hot topic, but I'd say she existed somewhere in the pantheon of this subreddits figures.

       I think this is a fair statement regardless of what I said above.  I guess such seems to be the case with the passing of many people.

       Again, I wouldn't go this far.  I don't think that someone not commenting about Thomas' life and times should be necessarily looked upon as a hugely egregious slight against the woman.

       Again, I wouldn't go that far either.  Perhaps I'm just projecting, but, although I certainly wouldn't call myself a Helen Thomas scholar, I certainly knew who she was prior to the comment you made.
