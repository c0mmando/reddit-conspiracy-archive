       had started to get it. More posts in there looked like previous months in here. Now it's not a default sub, with the explanation that 'it hadn't grown with the rest of reddit'. Hmm.

       The shill mods were enforcing Obama-admin disinformation policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama is nearing the end of his second term.  We're reaching that stage where the administration rats start to jump ship and climb into other politicians' coattails.  Nobody wants to be left holding the bag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the next few years, you'll see more cracks in the administration propaganda, just like happened to Bush and Clinton in their last two years.  Administrations start to lose control over the press as their terms and influence wind down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anybody was "waking up" on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .  There have always been intelligent posters, and they were always driven away by the shill mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely, I think the
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       shills stopped paying their protection money, or decided to move on to something else, and reddit admins did not want to give them any free play or be stuck holding the bag of rat droppings.

       Actually since the Snowden story came out I have seen a lot of Redditors just sickened by the Obama administration for continuing and heightening the past administrations practices. And not just non-thinking right wingers- I'm talking Obama voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       What smart people are figuring out is that it matters little who or what political group is in office- they are solidly under control by others.

       The minute a 'conspiracy' forum poster starts on this or that political party I am immediately suspect.

       This news gets a giant HM from me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been submitting to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       for a long time and I can tell you that as of late I've seen a
       <em>
        striking
       </em>
       change in how certain "controversial" posts fare. Even just a few months ago if your post had a "conspiratorial" slant it would be immediately downvoted...recently the opposite has been occurring. The broader internet base has been given conspiracy theories more credence lately, for many obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, posts to washingtonsblog.com used to be universally downvoted at
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , but lately they've been thriving, as well as sites like globalresearch.ca and wsws.org which are far from "mainstream".
      </p>
      <p>
       As a further example of this, yesterday
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1iey5s/why_doesnt_the_government_use_its_mass/">
        I submitted a washingtonsblog post
       </a>
       and not only did it hit #1 in politics, but it actually reached #3 on the front page of reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it: a conspiratorial libertarian website with an article with the words "government surveillance" and "banskters" in the title hits #3 on the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       what the people that own this website want to see?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I really felt it was on the way to #1 overall, but unfortunately the site's servers crashed, the link began dropping immediately, and the total upvotes immediately plateaued at 2600 even though it was on track to get
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, after all of that happened I had this feeling that accessing the front page like that with "conspiracies" was too good to be true...at least there's still
       <a href="/r/til">

That or the atheists there were turning people to religion lol, because as someone who is always questioning reality, I have come to believe that atheism is its own religion and a fanatical one at that.

       I totally agree with that statement, in my opinion, when it comes to a topic such as "god" and our "origin", saying you are 100% on either end of the spectrum, is equally ignorant. I dislike and refuse to acknowledge religion as a way of life, but that doesn't mean that I'm arrogant enough to KNOW there isn't a spiritual entity at play in our existence. It's called keeping an open mind, willing to learn and adapt, which is the only way to grow as an individual. Do I think there is a dude in a robe sitting on a crowd judging and granting wishes, unlikely. Sorry I'm rambling, either way, I saw a post earlier saying we should all conspire to get "alternative" news on the front page of other subs, to spread the word, I don't think planning that in this sub would work, there are too many watchful eyes, but we should maybe form an outside community and really try to educate others.

       No, this subreddit does not question. 9/11 truthers, anyone? Sandy hook "false flag"? Aurora shooting "false flag"?

       It's established that this subreddit only questions the government, but not conspiracy theorists or conspiracy theories themselves. Any kind of skepticism or criticism of conspiracy theories will get you downvoted to oblivion no matter how many sources you provide that the conspiracy theory in question is idiotic.

       (#115),
       <a href="/r/funny">

      <p>
       So the "not growing..." explanation definitely holds up under scrutiny. Keep in mind also that that was not the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       reason for removing it as default, so the "well why didn't they remove
       <a href="/r/pics">
        /r/pics
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/funny">
        /r/funny
       </a>
       ?" argument doesn't work. Those two are in the top five subreddits by all other measures (subscribers: #2 &amp; #1, users online: #3 &amp; #2, "activity": #1 &amp; #2, total submissions: #3 &amp; #1, and submissions per day: #5 &amp; #2), so of course they stayed.
       <a href="/r/announcements">
        /r/announcements
       </a>
       was kept because it's the official platform for site-wide announcements from the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might also argue something about "why was
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       removed if it's growing so fast (#82)?". Again, I will point out that the "growth" factor was not the only reason for the decision. To quote the blog post directly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We know many of you will wonder what happened to
        <a href="/r/politics">
         /r/politics
        </a>
        and
        <a href="/r/atheism">
         /r/atheism
        </a>
        and why they were removed from the default set. We could give you a canned corporate answer or a diplomatic answer that is carefully crafted for the situation. But since this is reddit, we’re going to try things a bit differently and give you the real answer:
        <strong>
         they just weren't up to snuff.
        </strong>
        Now, don't get us wrong, there still ARE good parts about them. Overall,
        <strong>
         they just haven't continued to grow
        </strong>
        <strong>
         <em>
          and evolve
         </em>
        </strong>
        <strong>

       Yes. It's like claiming a rich country should have the same growth rate as a poor country.

       have been making decent posts for as long as I can remember, and have been more 'awake' than politics for a long time. The fact that they are default subs still leads me to consider that there is no 'conspiracy' here. Also while yes reddit is owned by big news and is shilled up the wazoo (far less than many here seem to believe though), I find it unlikely that those directly in charge, with the power to change defaults and such, have any desire to subvert free speech and/or support the establishment.

       Goodnight kids, sleep well and dream, dreams.

       I, for one, can well imagine a brilliant mind, which I do not entertain but know full well how to celebrate!

       One of the co-creators of reddit  hung himself, in the midst of a 'witch-hunt' all politically motivated for 'information' that we have a right to read, hear and see. This young man, IMHO, was assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know his name?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another, sitting in a sterile, military setting "witnessed" war crimes and has been subjected to deprivation above and beyond.

       Do you know his name?

       This Mercedes car became a fireball. The corpse behind the wheel of that car took down a United States General.

       Gunned down. Assassinated!

       John F. Kennedy awake, late to the 'game' and gunned down. Assassinated.

       Malcolm 'X' changed his tune and assassinated.

       There's not one second of his shadow in any jail that Obama could ever redeem. That photo Op sickened me and Obama knows this.
