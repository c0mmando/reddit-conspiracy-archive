        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The judge in the Zimmerman trial used rather imprecise but perhaps intentional words in her instructions to the Zimmerman Jury:</p>

<p><em>If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.</em></p>

<p>The phrase: <em>he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground</em>, is rather odd because that doesn&#39;t describe the event which actually occurred, no arguments were presented to suggest that Zimmerman could have &quot;retreated&quot; instead of shooting Martin who was on top of him at the time.</p>

<p>The George Zimmerman trial had nothing to do with Stand Your Ground, first the incident did not occur on Zimmerman&#39;s property and second, retreating was never a point for consideration because it wasn&#39;t an option. Zimmerman defense was self-defense, pure and simple.</p>

<p>Now we have <a href="http://billmoyers.com/2013/07/17/outrage-is-rising-in-florida-and-nationally-against-stand-your-ground/">public outrage</a> unfolding around the country, presumably as fallout from the trial.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Stand your ground&quot; governs U.S. federal case law in which right of self-defense is asserted against a charge of criminal homicide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The laws were considered necessary to add further legal protections for people who used force to defend their property. Before SYG laws, arguments would be made that since the person wasn&#39;t in danger they could have just &quot;ran away or retreated&quot; instead of using force that injured or killed the trespasser.</p>

<p>Stand Your Ground helps reinforce the concept that one is not required or obligated to retreat when protecting one&#39;s property or life. Now we have a situation which conflates the right of self-defense with supposedly flawed Stand Your Ground laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are, or course, correct. But. We all have a limit to what we will put up with, which has nothing to do with the &quot;law&quot;. If my life is being truly attacked for real, then all bets are <em>off</em>. I will deal with whatever comes after the fact. Maybe not the wisest approach, that is true. But what we say we will do in the calm light of day, and what we will <em>really</em> do in the dead of might when the adrenal gland is at mother natures best, is two different things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason stand your ground laws come in to play here has nothing to do with where this took place.  Before stand your ground laws were implemented, in order to use deadly force you had to retreat as far as possible and warn the attacker that you were going to shoot.  Stand your ground allows for the use of force within the above guidelines without retreat or warning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, i&#39;m going to go with the Cornell University of Law legal definition over some random website that can&#39;t even fix it&#39;s spelling mistakes. </p>

<p>Everything I have found has said that trespass pertains to personal property, not a person themselves. You have to have ownership rights for something to be trespassed upon. Therefore a person can not be trespassed upon, only their property can be. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/trespass">Link</a></p>

<p>And no, the charge of trespassing does not rule whether consent was given. The person who consent is about, is the only person who can give consent. Not the prosecutor filing the charges. If that was the case, every single rape case would also have trespassing charges along with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this does not mean I justify rape. One would think the fact of me arguing against you on this point, is evidence itself that I do not justify rape. </p>

<p>Really you can think what you want, doesn&#39;t matter tome either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By legal definition, one&#39;s body is not considered &quot;property&quot; -would that it were, it would make more philosophical sense.</p>

<p>Self-defense already covers the &quot;body&quot; portion of the scenario, as I indicated SYG laws only became necessary to add further legal protections for people who used force to defend their property. Sometimes they were denied being able to claim self-defense in situations where they could have chosen to retreat. </p>

<p>SYG laws closed that avenue and helped reinforce the right of self-defense where it was being restricted. There were cases where a man would shoot someone coming through a window in his house in the middle of the night, and that man would be charged with attempted murder because claiming self-defense would be denied. </p>

<p>SYG&#39;s initial intent (not speaking of the law&#39;s variations) ensured that the man defending his home was not expected nor required to &quot;retreat&quot; and could practice self-defense. The break-in was threat enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah, whatever you think. But no, I did not. I stated that Trayvon Martin was not trespassing. </p>

<p>Thanks for the laugh though.</p>

<p>I&#39;d really like to hear your explanation for that though, please elaborate.</p>
