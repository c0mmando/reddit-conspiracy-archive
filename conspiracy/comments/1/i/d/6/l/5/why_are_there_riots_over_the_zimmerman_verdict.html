       There have been riots in

       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/oakland-hit-by-riots-after-zimmerman-verdict/">
        and Oakland
       </a>
       following the acquittal of George Zimmerman. Fire being set, dumpsters flipped, police cars vandalized, and more over a single trial. And yet, through out all of the NSA scandal, not a single group of people has done anything even remotely similar to these riots. I'm not saying that we all need to go spray paint police cars, threaten to kill leaders, and burn stuff in the streets. I'm just astounded at how big of a deal people are making.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 women who know far more about the trial than the citizens rioting found him not guilty, but the public is still outraged. The government hasn't denied that they've been spying on us for the past decade, that they've been using our hard-earned money to store our personal information, and that laws have been secretly passed to allow this gathering of information of which we're not allowed to know of. The vast majority of the public doesn't give a fuck when our rights are violated and our money is used against us, but they throw a fit when 6 people spend several hours to make an informed decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our nation needs to open their eyes. They need to forget about the petty things and focus on the serious issues. A nation that won't stand together is just a nation that will fall much faster. If we don't stand up against what is unjust, then our nation will continue digging itself into a pit of despair.

       How do the images prove your point? A riot is violent civil disorder, which is exactly what was going down in those cities.

       You've shown some very minor incidents that could have been (and probably were) carried out by a handful of people. Far from the
       <em>
        violent civil disorder
       </em>
       you're claiming. For all the thousands of people protesting, calling these riots is quite ridiculous. This stuff is far tamer than the average sports riot.

       Because the general populace has below average intelligence and is brainwashed by the media. Notice how they said riots were to be expected, no they weren't, no one was going to protest but then they said that it was likely to happen so something moron was like hmm that's a good idea i should join in on it.
