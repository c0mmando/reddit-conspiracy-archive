        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There have been riots in <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2013/07/george-zimmerman-race-riots-around-the-country-2710860.html">Washington, Chicago, Seattle,</a> <a href="http://www.infowars.com/oakland-hit-by-riots-after-zimmerman-verdict/">and Oakland</a> following the acquittal of George Zimmerman. Fire being set, dumpsters flipped, police cars vandalized, and more over a single trial. And yet, through out all of the NSA scandal, not a single group of people has done anything even remotely similar to these riots. I&#39;m not saying that we all need to go spray paint police cars, threaten to kill leaders, and burn stuff in the streets. I&#39;m just astounded at how big of a deal people are making. </p>

<p>6 women who know far more about the trial than the citizens rioting found him not guilty, but the public is still outraged. The government hasn&#39;t denied that they&#39;ve been spying on us for the past decade, that they&#39;ve been using our hard-earned money to store our personal information, and that laws have been secretly passed to allow this gathering of information of which we&#39;re not allowed to know of. The vast majority of the public doesn&#39;t give a fuck when our rights are violated and our money is used against us, but they throw a fit when 6 people spend several hours to make an informed decision. </p>

<p>Our nation needs to open their eyes. They need to forget about the petty things and focus on the serious issues. A nation that won&#39;t stand together is just a nation that will fall much faster. If we don&#39;t stand up against what is unjust, then our nation will continue digging itself into a pit of despair. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve shown some very minor incidents that could have been (and probably were) carried out by a handful of people. Far from the <em>violent civil disorder</em> you&#39;re claiming. For all the thousands of people protesting, calling these riots is quite ridiculous. This stuff is far tamer than the average sports riot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the general populace has below average intelligence and is brainwashed by the media. Notice how they said riots were to be expected, no they weren&#39;t, no one was going to protest but then they said that it was likely to happen so something moron was like hmm that&#39;s a good idea i should join in on it.</p>
