    <div class="md"><p>Well I noticed today that he kept saying how the MSM was distracting from real issues by covering the Zimmerman trial non stop, and how he didn&#39;t want to spend a lot of time on it...Lo and behold the entire show pertained to the Zimmerman case. I just think it more than mere coincidence that he, in his own way, was also parroting official stories. If that makes any sense. Basically he&#39;s using mainstream talking points but putting his &#39;Alternative&#39; spin on them and that to me is a red flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it when you said he takes MSM talking points and puts his alternative spin on it. I think he does that to keep the show mainstream to gain new listeners as some of more hardcore stuff will turn people away. He has good guests on his show like David Icke and such. Infowars is a good show for someone who just starting to wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying that he seems to be in someone&#39;s pocket...Every so often infowars engages in damage control or other MSM tactics which to me is a clear indicator that they are part of the disinfo squad. Not everyone there, just some. It is, however, the most easily accessible show of this nature and the one most aligned with my political beliefs, so it&#39;s better than nothing I guess. Just be wary of the information you accept as fact. He tends to fall into the old trap of making stories fit into his narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree he tends to get easily distracted and will dedicate an entire show to something he said he wasn&#39;t going to talk about. I feel he does need to mention the Manning trial more and get back to real issues, but to be fair this Zimmerman thing is getting out of control. Even this sub has been consumed in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if this is true or not but I have heard that he never discusses ISRAELI/JEWISH bankers? or the &quot;edomite&quot; bloodline? and that he shuts down people when they start talking about them. And he is way too loud and offers a ton of stuff for sale on his website...9probably of questionable quality)...which means he benefits from the fear he is spreading. I can&#39;t say that he is 100% wrong but I can say that if he is a counter intelligence agent he is misleading people in a way that takes the power away from them and they end up mad, helpless or confused...probably part of the CIA&#39;s purposeful cognitive dissonance in the media (reddit included). Here&#39;s what Bill Cooper has to say about AJ...a far more reliable &quot;nutcase&quot; to listen to than AJ. <a href="http://youtu.be/wHXdz4ApxOQ">http://youtu.be/wHXdz4ApxOQ</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That probably comes down to his spiritual beliefs, a lot of Christians believe that Israel belongs to the Jews, so that shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone.

    <div class="md"><p>Eh I don&#39;t like him because he makes people who don&#39;t buy the narrative look nuts. Look at his appearance on CNN over gun rights.... Good lord that was embarrassing.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>There are also several videos out there where he destroys political rallies he supports and was asked to participate in but never gave a response and showed up unannounced then bull horned.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Look up his interview with the zeitgeist creator... There is another reason not to take him very far on his word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that interview makes either of them look good or bad they just have two different spiritual views, and Jones is very passionate about what he believes in. It&#39;s just a classic example of the Christian v. Atheistic way of explaining the same thing. Jones is just Jones you can either accept him for who he is or not, but I don&#39;t think he is intentionally trying to mislead anyone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you are getting that from.</p>

<p>To your point; you can be passionate and still be intelligent and coherent and listen to your opponent.  Jones didn&#39;t let Joseph talk half the time or he ended up just ignoring what he said to try to get to his next point to try to discredit him.</p>

<p>I am not complaining about Jones or his program without reason.  There is purpose behind it.  Look at the OP&#39;s original question:</p>

<p>so why when ever he is mentioned in this sub do people denounce him and talk shit??</p>

<p>I am answering his question.  I do have my other &quot;news&quot; sources I go to.  Perhaps others &quot;denounce him and talk shit&quot; because of similar reasons that I gave above.  I can only speak for myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps I should clarify my use of the word &quot;cited&quot;.  If they mention a &quot;study&quot; I have yet to see the study linked in their &quot;sources&quot;.  They will link other website, that mention that study, but those sites also do not show the study.  So if you want to read the study yourself and make up your own mind... you can&#39;t (or have to do a lot of searching to find it)</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>If you look for anything about Vaccines on their site when they say &quot;new law allows government to force vaccines on your children&quot; there isn&#39;t even a link to the law, or the subsection that they are referring to that makes them say that.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Granted before today I have not visited their site since the Gun stuff, but I just did a search on their site for &quot;study&quot; and looked through a few articles and have confirmed my above statements still have some truth to them.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Granted a few searches doesn&#39;t mean that &quot;all stories&quot; are not cited, but enough for me to continue getting my information from another source that doesn&#39;t require me to search for a study or a law to check what they are telling me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was thinking. I live in Southern California and I tend to listen to kfi. Bill Handel in the morning and John and ken in the afternoon. John and ken tend to cover local things that no one else will, (i.e. Antonio villarigosa) but when it comes to the Boston bombing or sandy hook etc, they believe the official story. And if you don&#39;t then you&#39;re a fucking idiot and John has to run his stupid ass mouth about how conspiracy theorists are nuts, so I had to stop listening to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>MSM attacks him for a reason. I don&#39;t think he lies about his number of listeners. He doesn&#39;t screen his callers and he talks about real issues, and he stays away from extreme theories like aliens and reptillians, it just takes a while to get used to his personality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post does a great job of explaining the dislike for Alex Jones.  His ideas are too complicated.  The idea that the CIA runs Al Qaeda and that under Obama we are working with Al Qaeda in Syria are not contradictory.  The idea that mass manufactured packaging could cause an increase in cancer is something people don&#39;t want to accept as a possibility.  Alex isn&#39;t as stringent with what sources he&#39;ll use is another issue.</p>
