       It's funny.  People are in the streets right now protesting a trial by jury ruling.  Meanwhile in the world that matters; the price of goods continues to increase, as do taxes and the national debt.  Wages remain stagnant and unemployment as at a real world high.  The federal government has seized control of nearly every aspect of modern society.  But Trayvon Martin, right?

       Not too mention the use of drone strikes resulting in outrages amounts of civilian casualties in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen. Its fucked that one case of tragic circumstances in the US, can out weigh the extraordinary cases of war crimes committed by the US government around the world. But that's how the media works in US, just distractive bullshit that is irrelevant to what's happening in the world

       That's what gets me the most.  Black kids are murdered EVERY DAY.  But this one case is the end of everything.  Where's the protests over gang violence in Chicago?  Nope, they're protesting IN CHICAGO over this case.  We're in an illegal war against EVERYONE (without Congressional okay as is the law) but this is the issue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why doesn't the black community see that they're being used by TPTB right now to further racial division in this country?  Oh, and Zimmerman is half Latino (or hispanic).

       Nothing like racial balkanization to keep a poor populace heterogenous and divided. Sure, poor whites and blacks realize the structure favors the rich at their expense. But as this case illustrates, we are all stupid and the MSM plays on our immature emotions.

       Both don't matter to close minded people who have made up their minds. All I hear is "benefit of doubt" and "I don't have anything to hide". So we are supposed to just behave and hope nobody spy's on us or shoots us because of their paranoid agenda?

       The kid from Glee just died, so that'll be on the news when this clears up.  After that it will be back to Syria and how Assad used chemical weapons against the people.  Then who knows?  Maybe we'll go into syria and for 10 years have nothing but "the syrian government are terrorists."  Meanwhile, the rebels are cutting citizens heads off with swords in the streets like it's a sport.

       Idk about organized per say.  Since the Zimmerman trial was set to happen long before Snowden came out.  But the media is definitely using it to benefit TPTB now.  All I see on msm is race relations and the broken justice system, which the trial had actually nothing to do with (profiling maybe, but you're gonna try to tell me that the government doesn't profile everyone?).  You want to talk about broken justice system?  How about the guy who is now being hunted with every asset the government has because he blew the whistle on some serious fuckery that violates the constitution.  We should be praising Snowden and putting the people behind PRISM on trial, not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's a lot easier to get the stupids with "the justice system is only just for whites" than it is to have a serious discussion about the principles behind it (reasonable doubt, evidence).

       I think we can actually use this, and I think it is actually very important (not the case but how it is being used by the media).
      </p>
      <p>
       For once, even in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , and
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       , everyone is seeing this quite clearly and level headedly. Just by reading through the top 2 thread's comments, having heard nothing previously about the case other than the name "zimmerman" I pretty much got everything I could possibly need to know about the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mainstream are freaking the fuck out, especially the liberals. They think it's a hate crime and that GZ is a cold blooded killer and Martin was an innocent victim. You know what I think? I think they are going to use this, if they aren't already, to push the gun control agenda. It portrays CCW holders as crazed lunatics and REALLY reinforces the back ground checks. Pages like The Other 98% and others are getting people out in the streets protesting. No protesting for the NSA but they'll protest over this? Be on the look out for BIG news that isn't being talked about and gun control agenda stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       good to show people how ridiculously full of shit the mainstream media is (a LOT of people  in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       seems pretty convinced after this case). If you learn the specifics the case, and rationally and calmly explain it to the people freaking out, it could very well be a very effective paradigm shatterer—the 3 people I talked to about it were immediately like "oh fuck I had no idea" when i commented on their post about "OMG HOW COULD THEY LET ZIMMERMAN GO?" explaining the facts of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my take, however, of course don't let this take up all your time. There is a lot of other stuff that needs to be discussed (like the Manning case and the NSA stuff), and I think a big doozy might get dropped tomorrow while everyone is distracted by the Zimmerman case.

       I just want to say you're totally right, I'm in complete agreement -- but I don't think, even so, that the vast majority feels that way.  THAT is the point, and I don't believe we can do a thing about that, unfortunately.  I hope I'm wrong, of course, but in the bottom of my gut I just don't feel it.

       I would not mind people looking into the T.P.P If people remember the S.P.P  it's baaAaack... in an interesting way.
