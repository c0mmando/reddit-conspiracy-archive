    <div class="md"><p>Hot tip. Reach doesn&#39;t matter in a fight when someone has a gun.
Zimmerman&#39;s WEIGHT, counts for more than Martins reach. Do you know anything about physical altercations? </p>

<p>What about Trayvon&#39;s side that he doesn&#39;t get to tell, because a piece of shit FOLLOWED HIM DOWN THE STREET WITH A GUN AND SHOT HIM.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy for Zimmerman to say Trayvon was the aggressor, there is noone alive to counter his argument. The fact you believe a murderer&#39;s statement is ridiculous. WHAT INCENTIVE COULD HE HAVE TO LIE?</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is Zimmerman was told not to pursue, by trained professionals who he had called to HELP HIM. Even if he DID get into an altercation where it required self defense, HE STILL PUT HIMSELF IN HARMS WAY BY STALKING SOMEONE DOWN THE STREET. There are also several testimonies that say ZIMMERMAN WAS THE AGGRESSOR. I guess we will go ahead and ignore those. What was he doing out with a gun following around teenagers with skittles again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. TPTB seem to want the dreaded martial law for some perverse reason. Lets hope that doesn&#39;t happen. The Boston bombing episode was, in fact, a test to see how the public would respond to martial law. And the public, at least in Boston, cowered just as the powers had hoped. But. TPTB might find that to be a false test, to there shock.</p>
