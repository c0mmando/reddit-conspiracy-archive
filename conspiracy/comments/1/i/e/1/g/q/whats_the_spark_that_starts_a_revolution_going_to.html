    <div class="md"><p>I would be careful of talking about a revolution at all. Any talk of a revolution puts you on DHS/FBI/NSA watchlist, and when they crackdown with martial law (which they willl), you will be on a list as a &quot;known dissenter/radical etc.&quot; and most likely summarily executed. Nothing more than a few comments on the internet is needed for this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They will eventually start a nuclear war when they have no options left which is soon.</p>

<p>Either:</p>

<p>A. We peacefully transit into a 1984 style world government.</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>B. Enough people wakeup/economic collapse happens and the bankers need a war/domestic terrorist event in order to keep the population in line.</p>

<p>Either way they are the ones with the cards to play. If enough people wakeup in this country and their control even starts to slip they will play the &quot;terrorism card&quot; and detonate a nuke on an american city and blame it on Iran/Nk/China/Russia etc. They want a world war because it gives them an excuse to institute martial law. Any major war or economic collapse will serve their purposes. They would like to maintain power as easily as possible and without force because they like the current economic paradigm it serves their needs. Although they would refer not to use major force to annihilate much of what gives them power in the first place, they will do so if their power is threatened. At least that is my opinion.</p>

The powers that be know this as well and use our free will against us. Its the vampire needing the invite to enter your home. Its the rritualistic nature of thier Prometheus Reach. They take resonsibilty off themselves when the reveal what they plan to do. Its like not blaming the dog for biting you when it was growling.... Its a manipulation of universal law..and right now we have given them our consent. I know most of the readers of this sub know about the symbolism they use, the double speaking sorcery,  the chemicals in food, water..etc all to use against us. The divide and conquer keeps being played and until our collective consciousness has had enough of this. If not we will get another &quot;peoples champion&quot; that proves even more tyrannical than the previous. Its not the revolution that matters anyway..its the results that do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the 70&#39;s, the country found out about MKUltra. Very few things could be considered more illegal and immoral, yet this was done by the highest levels of our government. Then we found out about operation Northwoods. Then we found out about the NSA spying. Then we found out the NSA spying was being conducted prior to 9/11. These are only a few examples of the millions of cases of gross negligence and misconduct. Nobody started a revolution. </p>

<p>When did the free stuff arise? Around the time the government started ramping up their illegal and immoral activities. Welfare, foodstamps, unemployment, social security, Government jobs or government funded jobs, etc. As long as the government gives away free stuff they confiscate from workers, they nullify resistance. The worst thing that will happen is Obama gets impeached. This will change nothing. Nothing will change until this country literally mirrors what happened in Rome and Russia. No revolutions will happen as long as free stuff pacifies the profane. Unless someone with enough money/motivation can fund a revolution, a revolution will not occur. There will only be minor &quot;movements&quot; with no substance and the machine keeps on rolling. Either move to another country or wait until the inevitable collapse. And I have my doubts that a collapse will change anything, Technology is too far advanced for any hope of overthrowing the government. It would be a long shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is everyone thinks laws and legal definitions determine the course of American (or other) progress. This is not the case. The direction that American politics takes has little to do with law. Laws are simply words written on paper. You can perform a number of acts forbidden by law, and so can government officials, without punishment. Even worse, consider the secret law and secret courts now in place in American politics. Few people are aware of this. Humans, on average, are easily influenced and pushed in certain directions. It is difficult to find major differences between average humans and animals. They are easily led. I would consider your opinion if we existed centuries earlier, but marketing and propaganda are so far advanced that a small percentage of &quot;awake&quot; individuals won&#39;t make a difference. I see our problems as a tidal wave, and you are hoping that a sand bag (small percentage of awake individuals) will deter the consequences of the tidal wave. Forget fighting, figure out how you will survive the wave. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve already lost! And by we, I don&#39;t mean any nation in particular, I mean humanity. Despite being capable of many great things, we&#39;re just too flawed. Men will always desire power and be willing to abuse the easily fooled to get it. They will use fear to keep us divided and controlled media to keep us blind.</p>

<p>The technology we have only makes this worse. The easily entertained have the world at their finger tips and celebrities on their screens, the world has never looked better to them.  Those who desire change will need to communicate through this technology to rally support, and with words like &quot;terrorism&quot; going about, taking out revolutionary leaders will be seen as simply protecting the nations interests.<br/>
Granted there are secure ways of communicating undetected, but you can&#39;t get to the masses this way. And you&#39;ll certainly need the masses to overthrow something so strong and corrupt.</p>

<p>Peaceful protest will get you nowhere, and the moment you start blowing shit up you&#39;ll be a freedom hating terrorist.        </p>

<p>The fact you remain optimistic gives me mixed emotions. I&#39;m happy that there&#39;s still some fire inside you, hope can be a mighty crutch, but at the same time It saddens me, for we will all let you down. You should accept that humanity will forever be locked in a vicious cycle of corrupt leaders and sadistic assholes.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That comment gave me mixed feelings too. I don&#39;t know whether to accept what you said and fall into a pit of dispair and self loathing or to smile at the challenge. Man is made to fall. It&#39;s obvious we&#39;re imperfect animals. Maybe natural selection and evolution made a mistake by creating humans, and we&#39;ve ended up destroying our kind. I&#39;m sure that happens in life with other life forms. But what I&#39;ve come to realize is that humans are different. I don&#39;t know what it is, be it consciousness or something else; however, when we fall, we tend to get back up. We&#39;ve fucked up. It&#39;s gonna be shitty for a while, then there&#39;s gonna be a group of people who pick up the pieces and continues the human story. Maybe it&#39;s gonna happen now or ten generations from now, but I will not accept defeat without a fight and I will teach my kids about what to fight for.</p>

<p>You people who have given up may be right. Or you&#39;re wrong and adding to the problem. You intelligent people who have thought all this through could be the ones who end it.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say we are equal to those responsible, and I don&#39;t exactly consider myself in a pit of despair. I&#39;ve gotten to a point where I honestly cannot see a peaceful world, in which people aren&#39;t exploited, ever occurring. After a period of I guess, mourning, in order to carry on, I had to rid myself of certain ideals and expectations.    </p>

<p>I&#39;m never gonna be the hopeful hero that saves the city, but I&#39;m certainly not the guy destroying it. The argument that a decision of inaction enables the leaders to act as they do, does holds some truth though. However in this current system, I see no way for me to contribute to their dethroning in a significant way. I will do my best to live a simple life and have some fun. If this uprising takes place in my life time and shit gets physical, I just might strap on a ski mask and join you. If only to experience the joy of it all.</p>
