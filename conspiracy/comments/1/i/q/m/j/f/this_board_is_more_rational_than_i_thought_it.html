       I used to dismiss this conspiracy shit... In fact i literally joined this sub to sarcastically talk about reptilians...
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out a lot of the "conspiracy theory" shit on the internet i used to find on google is probably misinformation from the government thrown in with the truth.
Most of the shit on here, not all, but a scary amount of the shit on here is truth..
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck.

      <p>
       Now I start seeing posts on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and i think that they are supposed to be on here. Its kind of freaky.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thanks a lot for letting me know that the NWO is alive and well... FUCK

       Oh, yeah, I should have been more specific. I guess that's why people were voting me down. I know what the acronym stands for, but "New World Order" is a bit vague.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what do you mean by that? That phrase has been used lots of different ways over the decades. There were books called "The New World Order" as long ago as 1919, for example.

       And now for the horrible truth you've woken up to: It doesn't go away. Now that you are aware of it, it is impossible to go back to sleep. Like many good things, being aware is both a blessing and a curse. 
I hate using movies as examples, but The Matrix portrayed it perfectly. Neo was mostly happy and blissfully unaware when he was in the Matrix...but once awoken from it, he found the truth and reality to be pretty fucking bad and depressing, even though he was better for knowing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to never see TV the same way again? Do this experiment:
       <a href="http://adam.shand.net/library/zen_tv_experiement/">
        http://adam.shand.net/library/zen_tv_experiement/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I would encourage everyone to do that experiment (in addition to limiting your tv watching time as much as possible). It's very useful for raising awareness.

       these guys all do great work in making science fun and appealing to a large audience, but the repetition of the; "the world is a lot simpler than your making it", Hanlon's razor, conspiracies don't happen because people are stupid- meme is just unscientific bullshit.

       I don't want to try to sway you away from conspiracies, but note that seeing conspiracies in r/news should not be a confirmation of the conspiracy. Everyone who posts here can post there. Everyone who upvotes here can upvote there. The posts are often quite truthful, but the xposting is in no way a confirmation. Make sure to do your own research on EVERYTHING.

       But they didn't find that the Warren Commission was a cover-up. The main piece of evidence that they used to support the conspiracy theory was the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictabelt_evidence_relating_to_the_assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy">
        Dictabelt recording
       </a>
       , which, they concluded, indicated four shots being fired.  They upheld almost all of the Warren Commission's findings, including the fact that both of the shots that hit JFK came from the Texas State Book Depository.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        1. Lee Harvey Oswald fired three shots at Kennedy. The second and third shots Oswald fired struck the President. The third shot he fired successfully killed the President.
       </p>
       <p>
        2. Scientific acoustical evidence establishes a high probability that at least two gunmen fired at the President. Other scientific evidence does not preclude the possibility of two gunmen firing at the President. Scientific evidence negates some specific conspiracy allegations.
       </p>
       <p>
        3. The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Soviet Government was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Cuban Government was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that anti-Castro Cuban groups, as groups, were not involved in the assassination of Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the national syndicate of organized crime, as a group, was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy, but that the available evidence does not preclude the possibility that individual members may have been involved.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The committee believes, on the basis of the evidence available to it, that the Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Central Intelligence Agency were not involved in the assassination of Kennedy.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        4. Agencies and departments of the U.S. Government performed with varying degrees of competency in the fulfilment of their duties. President Kennedy did not receive adequate protection. A thorough and reliable investigation into the responsibility of Lee Harvey Oswald for the assassination was conducted. The investigation into the possibility of conspiracy in the assassination was inadequate. The conclusions of the investigations were arrived at in good faith, but presented in a fashion that was too definitive.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Later analysis of the Dictabelt recording has not been favorable to their conclusions. Very few scientists have accepted it.

       The veracity of their conclusions, vis-a-vis the Dictabelt recording, is immaterial. When one comes to the conclusion that a government commission has an inherent flaw, regardless of whether it was a deliberate cover-up or not (in this case the circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that there was), one must assume the possibility of other commissions being inherently flawed.

      <p>
       If you were to examine the totality of the evidence, impartially, you would have to arrive at the conclusion there was a conspiracy involving the highest echelons of government. This includes, but is not limited to, the 50 some-odd witnesses saying that they heard a shot from the grassy knoll, the changing of Kennedy's coffin (as attested to by two, independent witnesses), the change in Kennedy's wounds (as attested to by the Dallas physicians), and Arlen Spector's incessant badgering of witnesses. Oh yeah, there was also the media's complicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, the USSR was right:

       At the time of the Assassination Committee, lots of government officials were convicted of crimes, and many served jail time, so I don't think that it's out of the question, at all. The Church Committee certainly exposed a lot of skulduggery by the CIA.

       Over the years, I've looked at much of the evidence that is supposed to indicate a conspiracy, and I've always found it lacking. Just recently I looked at the supposed 50  or 51 witnesses saying that they heard a shot from the grassy knoll. For the
       <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/earwitnesses.htm">
        witnesses who are in dispute
       </a>
       , I have found that Macadams is right, and so the percent who say
       <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/shots.htm">
        they heard shots from the Grassy Knoll
       </a>
       is much smaller, even if you are very liberal in interpreting what they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has generally been the case when I've looked into what seemed like good evidence of a conspiracy. You have to overlook more (and usually better) evidence that points the other way.

       I know, you could easily frame this as a 'moving the goal post' type of argument technique. But I could equally claim your argument is a type of Strawman, as you have neglected to address the questions regarding Kennedy's corpse/coffin.

       I've watched the first 20 minutes of it and I'm not impressed. It
presents only a very biased selection of evidence and ignores everything
else.
      </p>
      <p>
       It starts with the whole "back and to the left" theory. It leaves out
the research of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez, who found
that Kennedy's head could move in the direction opposite to the bullet
and his experiments where melons he shot frequently did exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more importantly, it leaves out the study of the autopsy X-rays
that the House Select Committee did. They ruled out the possibility that
Kennedy was hit from the front--and they made extensive checks to make
sure that the X-rays were from Kennedy and had not been altered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video claims that "virtually all witnesses near the grassy knoll say
they heard a shot from that direction". As I mentioned before, I looked
into this a little while ago and found it to be false.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also says that dozens of people chased after the gunman who fired at
Kennedy from the grassy knoll. I'm not familiar with that claim, but
       <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/organ3.htm">
        this page
       </a>
       gives another version
of it. If the video's claim were true, why wasn't the gunman caught?
Dealey Plaza is not large. If they actually saw him, how could he
escape?
      </p>
      <p>
       The video mentions the acoustic evidence from the HSCA hearings, but it
does not mention the more extensive analyses that have been done since
then that throw great doubt on their conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video presents the certainly impossible, snake-like path of the
"magic bullet", but it does not mention the precise 3-D computer models
that have been made of Dealey Plaza and JFK and Connally's actual
positions in the car. These
       <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/sbt-faa.jpg">
        present a much straighter
path
       </a>
       than the hand-drawn
diagrams based on inaccurate assumptions of where the governor sat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "pristine" nature of the bullet found at the hospital has always
seemed very strange to me (although it is
       <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ce399.gif">
        not quite as
pristine
       </a>
       as is usually implied).
While strange, I think it presents as many problems for a conspiracy
theory, if you assume it's planted, as it does for the official Warren
Commission  theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video then gets strange by assuming that every separate wound is
caused by a separate bullet and gets carried away with a wildly
implausible count of bullets. There are problems with this.
       <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/shots.htm">
        Witnesses overwhelmingly (81%) said they heard 3
shots.
       </a>
       Only 5% of
witnesses heard more. Analysis of the Zapruder films shakiness
also indicate
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16ChphyKaE0">
        there were only three
shots
       </a>
       .  (Note: this is also
a problem with the Dictabelt recording.)
      </p>
      <p>
       And if there were so many shots hitting everywhere, why weren't more
bullets found?
      </p>
      <p>
       So far I don't find it convincing. Does it get better after the first 20
minutes?

       Naturally, any analysis with an agenda will only choose to present evidence supporting its conclusions (eg Warren Commission, HSCA).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I too have seen this (Blood-jet theory, I believe)? You are right, it is dubious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the X-rays, I think you may be giving them too much credit:
       <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/essays/jfkmed/ADemonstrableImpossibility/ADemonstrableImpossibility.htm">
        A Demonstrable Impossibility
       </a>
       . It seems as though they may have fudged their results.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "virtually all witnesses near the grassy knoll say they heard a shot &gt;from that direction"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, that is probably untrue. It is, however, merely an exaggeration. Given the badgering of witnesses during the time their initial testimonies were taken, it's really not that easy to know how many people precisely heard the Grassy Knoll shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding people chasing after the GK assassins, I too have never heard this claim. It seems improbable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your diagram of the magic bullet seems to be omitting the vertical rise that took place during its transit through JFK, followed by a descent into Connally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your picture shows a bullet less pristine than the one presented in the video; however, it is infinitely better off than a bullet alleged to have hit multiple, major bones. If you assume it's planted, that's pretty solid evidence for a conspiracy... I don't see how that could cause any problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it is a wildly implausible number of bullets, but that's not really important. When one rejects that single-bullet theory, you have to come to the conclusion that more shots were fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should really consider watching the rest of it. Even if you argue with some of the material evidence that is offered, the overall theory is very compelling and backed up with decent evidence, albeit circumstantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what about secret service protection or the changing of the convoy route or LHO's intelligence connections or JFK's missing brain or the theft of his body, changing of coffins and altering of wounds or any number of inexplicable elements that further compound this mystery? Cherry-picked evidence goes both ways.

       So. This is where it gets crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy for you to look back and say JFK was killed by the government, but for you to say it the day after it happened would be so sacrosanct, so against the hivemind, that you would never dream of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to take a step back on your view of 9/11.

      <p>
       All that you posted is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it complex? Of course. Was it hard? Yep. Was it impossible? Fuck No.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need architects, engineers, physicsts or experts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        We literally only need one fact, free fall.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A chunk of building 7 'floated' to the ground. This cannot happen with progressive collapse, as it requires 0 structural resistance.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Zero structural resistance means that
       <em>
        hundreds
       </em>
       of core columns were cut at precisely the same time, or within a few hundreths of a second of each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST originally lied about the speed of the fall by 40%. When they got called out for their glaring error that was proven by the video of free fall, they admitted that BLDG 7 free fell for 2.25 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is physically impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, these physicists, engineers, and architects are somebody's dad. They are fallible, they are human, and they can be propagandized.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would NIST lie? Free fall
       <strong>
        is a smoking gun
       </strong>
       ; however, the implications of accepting it are so world changing, so paradigm shifting, that people do not look at the evidence objectively.

      <p>
       This little fact is so impossibly hard to accept, due to the fact that it completely re-programs a world view. This one fact implicates an entire paradigm shift, and that shit is hard to swallow. So it's easy to go meh, it would've been to hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really would like to continue this conversation, so let me know what you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The scariest thing for me is this building seven denial. If I showed you BLDG 7 falling into dust at the speed of gravity, without giving you context, you would scream controlled demolition. It floated to the ground for 2.25 seconds. It would be
        <em>
         insane
        </em>
        to say that it was a collapse due to fires. Literally insane. But, once we take into account that this is part of 9/11, somehow people's brain switches off. And this terrifies me. HOW can somebody look at that and ignore it? This is severe emotional/psychological trauma, hivemind to the max.

       There were pictures of the Israeli "students" who were camping out in the buildings - with pics of them in all these interstitial spaces with boxes and boxes of stuff. Ill need to find a link, it's been years since I have seen them.

       Do you really think that 9/11 was done by muslim extremists with boxcutters fooling the biggest air security system in the world, being lead by a guy in cave on dialysis?

       The buildings were closed for a number of days a few weeks prior to 9/11, so it is presumed that explosives were planted while the buildings were empty. I'm pretty sure the workers in the buildings were told it was closed for security issues (or an "upgrade," I can't quite remember).

       There is also a theory that thermite explosives were mixed into the paint (which was being applied liberally during "renovations" around the time) and was thus indistinguishable to the casual observer.

       I don't know what happened on 9/11 exactly. All i do know is that no planes hit WTC 7, and that there were air-force drills happening the same day as well, which is why dispatchers were confused. I don't claim it to be an inside job, but that they knew the attack was coming but did nothing to stop it.

       The video recording from Dallas that day that really seals it for me is the one where the Secret Service agents who were designated to stand on the platform on the rear of JFK's vehicle were ordered to get off of that platform.  Once this happened then JFK was a clear target.

       the motive is that they would want to pretend he was still alive for as long as possible in order to continue the flow of money to the military budget.  they did report his death a couple times before, and didn't release even marginal evidence supporting their claims on the last one - not even a photo of him in the compound.

       by all appearances, the whole "Al Qaeda" narrative is fake.  we know as a matter of public record they were funded by the U.S. government in the 1980's, masquerading as the "mujahideen".  it's not a jump to think they were paid to take a  fall for a false flag attack (or even cowed into doing so), considering the huge body of evidence supporting that theory - the total failure of forensic analysis on 9/11 (including the demolitions of the WTC buildings), the belligerent wars with only lies connecting their victims to the attacks (Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia), the Bush family's connections to the Stratesec/Securacom company managing WTC complex security...you get the picture.

       The guy denied that he had anything to do with 9/11.  Now, if he was behind it, why on earth would he deny it?  Whoever did 9/11 did not admit to it and never will - of that much we can be quite certain.  From there we can ask - now who would benefit from 9/11 but would not want it known that they were responsible for it?

       A huge part of me knows that it makes sense that such a body of control as organized religion is ovviously "in on it". It's stupid to think they wouldn't be. The Vatican has called for war before it's hilarious.

       My bias that the government cannot control the weather comes from studying control theory and working with others who have devoted their life to it. Global weather is far too chaotic of a system to control. Large scale weather control is a silly conspiracy put forward by people with no understanding of dynamical systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm assuming this is the theory you refer to. If there are others, I haven't heard about them and clearly can't comment.

       Yes since the weather cannot be modified at the atmospheric level, the UN must also be conspiracy theorists to have a treated created to block such actions.  I also included the always silly US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report on the subject.  Cheers

       This is in no way relevant to the current conversation.  I haven't even said whether I believe in the weather modification theories personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was commenting on the ambiguity of another person's comment, musing on how it could be taken either way based on the person's established bias.  I'm not sure why you felt the need to provide evidence for or against the theory at this point in the discussion.

       My intention was to add to one side of the bias you spoke about, for funzies to see the "educated opinions" barrage in.  I always find it interesting to see someone cite a fact or an article, and then watch it be refuted by allegedly intelligent people based on their education and what they believe, like the person you commented on.  I thought I bumped his comment and not yours, so my mistake.  Beliefs are for religion, and scientifically, the world used to be flat.  Education does not allow one to smite the significance or relevance of a person's study, rather it should prop up with fact(not pedigree) the reason for infallibility, or it should endeavor to prove it wrong.  Anything outside of that is silly

       Nothing should be taken as gospel. Everyone has an agenda of some kind. View every bit of information you receive through the lens of scepticism and form your own opinions. This is the only advice I can give you when dealing with any kind of media.

       This is so true. I think there are a lot of intelligent people out there that have a decent grasp of reality, but that reality seems to be filtered through various self-interests before being given to the world. In a sense, every persons gospel is slightly to majorly altered depending on how it serves them personally. Not to make fun of the gold bugs, but just as an example, you've got smart economists like Peter Schiff pushing gold because that's what he's invested in. Someone invested in bonds will tell the world that bonds are all the rage.... and so on.

       No, it really isn't. This is by far the most shill-infested subreddit on the whole site, from the typical "anti-semite!" slanderers to the corporate sympathizers. It's absolutely pathetic some of the bullshit I've seen on here and because of it I hardly ever even view this sub anymore.

       It's unfortunate the connotation that the word "conspiracy" has come to embody in mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short a "conspiracy" is:  An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act.
      </p>
      <p>
       This literally
       <strong>
        happens all of the fucking time
       </strong>
       . I don't see why it's so hard to believe that small and large groups of people do illicit things behind closed doors to serve their own best interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the motivations of conspirators are practically outlined by the fundamental tenants of capitalism.

       If everyone is such a big fucking winner than how can there be a conspiracy or anything really wrong.  That first part of the statement is the axiom.  Everything is a winner!!!  Yay!  So therefore you and everyone here is full of shit and crazy.

       Well, I like living in other places besides the US because outside of here the people seem to be able to comprehend that really bad things can happen to people and sometimes to entire unfortunate societies.  It is also not so abstract in that they also believe that it could happen to their society and to themselves.  So in one huge particular way the people are not so dillusional.  It makes for better experiences in my opinion.

       Well you missed my point.  I suppose though that it is very worthwhile for you to care what people think of your moniker killtheshill as this could easily negatively affect your life.  I commend your clever technique of combining an ad hominem attack with a good old cut and run.
      </p>
      <p>
       I propose that the very idea that conspiracies are possible implies that certain people are capable of gaming the system.  I believe that people hate the idea of this to such a severe degree that they will turn their heads away from just about everything beyond the simplistic idea that the wealthy are only trying to make more money.

       Ah! Now the fallacy of your logic occurs! Your assumption that everyone who exists in the system will inevitably try to "game it" by illicit means is certainly a slippery slope of unfounded thought. Also, the notion that the game is fair and everyone has an equal chance is just simply false.

       At this point every other person here is now a disinformation expert trained in the school of hard knocks.  Who here in the early days didn't send a disinfo link out to friends or family only to be thought of as crazy?  Perhaps half of the points would be solid and enough to warrant investigations but there would be a crazy conclusion.  Done - credability lost.  Today I send links to people that I know can handle ideas.  They know that I'm not married to every bit of information that I transmit.  Sometimes I will prefix a link by saying "what do you think about this?".  I won't associate with people that I think can't handle some stray bits here and there.

       I'm responding back up here before you started calling each other names and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's a meat to this argument that is very important, especially for minds only recently opened to listening to unofficial opinion and researching the facts behind events.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are layers of logic that apply to truth discernment in conspiratorial matters that aren't as simple as basic argumentative logic. When you uncover facts, rather than just finding something that jives with a belief, it is often far more elaborate than just "A not C, therefore D."
      </p>
      <p>
       Motive is a key evidence in many conspiracies, especially when related to money and political powers. This is increasingly true when the branches of a conspiracy are so compartmentalized that the incentivized action seems harmless or even victimless.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's human nature to respond to incentive; motivation is defined by this nature. Since humans are central to conspiracy activity, motivation is often critical to uncovering otherwise hidden facts. This is getting into psychology, rather than simple logic or tangible evidence. Yet, it's rational, logical and reasonable. Keeping in mind, motivation is only one aspect and even it is often a clusterfuck to get through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that criminals are condemned by a jury rather than a clear, logical, science-based argument. Such evidences are merely presented to the jury. This the case whether it is true that the defendant is guilty or false. When the facts aren't immediately forthright, it is up to the investigation which then comes down to the credibility of information, etc... Truth is black and white, but often, if you zoom out, it can look like a grey blur.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in lungbutter's case, perhaps his determination of motivation or bias is more intuitive. Whereas, I_do_not_consent's "proof" comes down to making every step through critical evaluation. If the same conclusion is drawn, is one less of a fact than the other?
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as we're discovering/sharing facts which aren't otherwise elucidated and keeping each other in close check, we're making positive progress. I think it's best that we leave the arguments to the issues (unless your criticism is purely constructive) and clearly indicate when we're presenting facts vs. beliefs.

       Thats just it.  If you need that 'empirical evidence' to read through the bullshit every single time a cover story is regurgitated, you are hopeless.    The scientific method doesn't always work in these investigations..because there is no access to the evidence to do so, or it will forever remain locked away. (Or the limo has been washed down before anything can be combed through).

       Just question everything you're told. It's as simple as that. Most Americans (including me) were "educated" by the state and they've watched TV since birth. They've been programmed to not question authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it weren't for my father I would probably still be sound asleep, dreaming the American dream. He encouraged me to do one simple thing -- think. Don't just blindly accept what the man or woman in the $1000 suit is telling me.

       My father encouraged me to do that and then I learned that he didn't really mean it.  What he meant is that I should think like a Atheist Progressive Democrat and more or less all that goes along with that.  I find his thinking to be overall much more expansive than average but I've outgrown his mode.  This frustrates him and it causes huge social friction.

       Welcome to the horrified public.  where we know what goes on, but not what to do about it, because we know what goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       some of what i find more problematic is the things that aren't technical intentional conspiracies.  I find the incidental behavior modifications  of the masses to be the real horror.  Soon you'll see (And this is where i start to sound loony) where media production companies program the masses with nationalist propaganda and subtle cues to the dominance and inherent 'rightness' of the American governments' actions; where the retail and advertising agencies program us to consume mindlessly in an effort to ignore the trauma of being cognizant; where cops protect cops who do bad things; where those who question the status quo get bogged down in years and years of legal muck while the fight they were challenging goes uncontested.  None of this is an intentional conspiracy (except cops protecting cops), but they are subtle ways the system is set up to automatically produce results conducive to the goals of the powers that be.
      </p>

       That's what I got for ya man.  Thanks for joining, and welcome to the struggle.

       Kind of the same way I “woke up”. Reading through the comments here I see your views on 9/11 and that’s cool, but that is the theory that got me. Was sick on the couch one day browsing Netflix’s documentary section when I saw “Loose Change” and thought “Yeaahhhh right.” (Also watched one that day on how the real Paul McCartney died in a car crash and the current is an imposter. Surprised I haven’t seen that on this thread) My curiosity was piqued, began doing research on my own and was eventually hit with the same “shit…” thought. I guess what I am trying to say in a roundabout way is “Welcome to the club brother”.

       You used to dismiss this conspiracy shit because you were irrational, ignorant, and a BELIEVER in a set of views and an overall worldview that has been indoctrinated in you based on whatever society you were born into since birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most irrational/ignorant faith/belief-minded people are the ones who try to mock "the conspiracy theorists", they are the ones who are only ever trying to make themselves feel smug and superior for "knowing the truth while all those dumb questioning and critically minded people question the status quo but we all know that our officially-sanctioned culture is there for the good of all and is only trying to help us even if sometimes they go off track", while projecting that out onto the people who otherwise would make them do something they dread so much that they need to mock it: think critically, think for themselves, use their own mind to critically examine the world that they were born into or question things they've been conditioned to believe from early childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average American is stupid, warmongering, petty, easily fooled, and all in all, completely wrapped up in a flag that has been used to blind them for decades. Go talk to them at the water cooler or at school, the majority of people are retarded unless you're trying to talk to them about their favorite football player or beer, or their favorite celebrity/drama on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       "thanks for letting you know that the NWO is alive and well"? Wouldn't the fact that world leaders have been talking about the new world order and bringing it about internationally for decades on television and in publications have been a tip off? Wouldn't the fact that a
       <em>
        new order
       </em>
       being pushed by a military empire in the "
       <em>
        new world
       </em>
       "(North America) who have been the most aggressive, invasive, and internationalist society completely restructuring the world with their buddies in London, using both financial/legal coercion and the lives of your friends and brothers in wars based on nonstop lies in any country who won't bow to them willingly have been a tip off?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, seriously, how fucking stupid and irrational do you have to be? The majority of anti-conspiracy theorists are teenagers or recently-enrolled college students who haven't realized that there isn't anyone who can tell them everything yet, and who haven't realized that the structure of societies and the world did not invert and completely change after the invention of the fucking lightbulb(relatively small cabals usually comprised of the financial elite running everything and lying to the little people while getting them to go off and conquer the other guys while taking more and more for themselves at home). They are dumb, irrational, immature, simpleminded, and you can see it in their impenetrable shield of faux-intellectual superiority and inability to address anything that a "conspiracy theorist" says without trying to mock them personally or reverting to their faith-based "hahaha sures".
      </p>
      <p>
       There have always been, and will probably always be, people who just go along with whatever established authority or group structure they find in front of them when they are born into human life. Anyone who doesn't, to these people, is mental. They do this unquestioningly and try to make their way in whatever system they were born into, never for one second questioning it's foundations, trying to understand it, or wondering about it's overall validity as it relates to their own lives. These people CANNOT BE TALKED TO, they are like the faithful of the Westborough Baptist Church, they are BELIEVERS, and up until recently you were one of them because it just all seemed "so normal" to you. Some of these people will be believers for life, and they will all invariably want you to be a believer too, because otherwise "you're weird" and you might make them think about things that just aren't very proper or comfortable for them to think about. Nope, they've got their little niche in this system - even if it is working 9-5 at a construction job and being able to buy their beer to get blackout drunk every other night while playing video games - and they will fight to support it, and be behind any war that comes down from the mystical land of "on high" that they vaguely remember being told they could "vote on", but aren't very sure how to go about doing that - but they know one thing, they're free to get drunk every night so long as they pay their taxes and maybe provide a few brats to join the military later on. The same has always been true, in every single society or culture, no matter how sick/perverted/backwards/corrupt it is, including ones that try to exterminate entire populations or commit heinous crimes against humanity on a regular basis. These people cannot be talked to, they are goners. Congratulations on not being one of them.

       this is a perfect example of what I mean, life isn't a gameshow or your favorite faux-news/entertainment program, good luck paying 20-50% of all the income you ever receive to armed groups who will come and kidnap/kill you if you don't, and breeding up some soldiers for them later on in life.

       Naturally, any analysis with an agenda will only choose to present evidence supporting its conclusions (eg Warren Commission, HSCA).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I too have seen this (Blood-jet theory, I believe)? You are right, it is dubious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the X-rays, I think you may be giving them too much credit:
       <a href="http://www.history-matters.com/essays/jfkmed/ADemonstrableImpossibility/ADemonstrableImpossibility.htm">
        A Demonstrable Impossibility
       </a>
       . It seems as though they may have fudged their results.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "virtually all witnesses near the grassy knoll say they heard a shot &gt;from that direction"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, that is probably untrue. It is, however, merely an exaggeration. Given the badgering of witnesses during the time their initial testimonies were taken, it's really not that easy to know how many people precisely heard the Grassy Knoll shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding people chasing after the GK assassins, I too have never heard this claim. It seems improbable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your diagram of the magic bullet seems to be omitting the vertical rise that took place during its transit through JFK, followed by a descent into Connally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your picture shows a bullet less pristine than the one presented in the video; however, it is infinitely better off than a bullet alleged to have hit multiple, major bones. If you assume it's planted, that's pretty solid evidence for a conspiracy... I don't see how that could cause any problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it is a wildly implausible number of bullets, but that's not really important. When one rejects that single-bullet theory, you have to come to the conclusion that more shots were fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should really consider watching the rest of it. Even if you argue with some of the material evidence that is offered, the overall theory is very compelling and backed up with decent evidence, albeit circumstantial.
