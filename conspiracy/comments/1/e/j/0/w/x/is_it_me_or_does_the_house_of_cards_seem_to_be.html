       It seems like an increased number of people are waking up to the bullshit happening now.  Just a few examples-
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The increase in recent Marijuana studies explaining the benefits (cancer, Parkinson's, Crohn's, the front page one today about social isolation).
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        The AP investigation by the DOJ
       </li>
       <li>
        The Benghazi scandal
       </li>
       <li>
        The government working with Monsanto worldwide, not to mention the Monsanto Protection Act
       </li>
       <li>
        The recent martial law situation in Boston that even mainstream media can't deny
       </li>
       <li>
        The Pentagon saying they want to fight "terrorism" for 20 more years
       </li>
       <li>
        No budget deals, or foreseeable deals.
       </li>
       <li>
        The DHS and their army
       </li>
       <li>
        Massive gun control legislation across the nation
       </li>
       <li>
        The FBI openly admitting they spy on everyone
       </li>
       <li>
        A federal judge saying that people's cell phones can be used to track locations and movements without a warrant
       </li>
       <li>
        Legislation granting the military the ability to police streets without local or state consent
       </li>
       <li>
        The INSANE amount of fear- arresting kids for having poptarts shaped like guns in school
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I feel like things are approaching a tipping point.  Like one of these days a story is going to break that makes everyone stop and get mad, cause to me things just keep getting more and more outrageous in terms of what the government thinks it can get away with.

       Very valid point!  I can't remember the exact number, but prior to the outbreak of the Revolution, only something like 5~8% of the colonists supported an armed revolt against King George.

       The AP scandal might be an important aspect of the 'tipping point' in this regard because if the media feels like they are not in on things or if they feel like the government is stepping on their toes, they may turn on the government and start actually reporting on all the corruption.

       Shouldn't they do that because of their own compatriot moral compass, ethical guidelines, 1st Amendment, and paychecks?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why don't they? And since there is a consensus that they aren't, doesn't that implicate them all? Why can this be both obvious to everyone but also OK with everyone for so long?

       I think it is probably because there are a lot of news sources but they all come from a very few news companies, so their appears to be a wide consensus even though it all comes from just a handful of people. The general public doesn't think too deeply into it so if they hear the same thing a few times from the same or different sources, they assume it to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The news outlets are mostly only concerned with the bottom line, and spouting the corporatist propaganda is good for business, or at least it has been up until this point.

       The biggest obstacle we all face is assuming a physical revolution will be the best option. People have said it before, this is a war on consciousness itself, the elites would love it if we all had computers strapped to our heads 24/7 via google glass.

       It's quite entertaining to ponder on these issues however the solutions to these problems are so simple for the human race to solve it is embarrassing to say the least. It's almost like a self denial reflex everyone has when you bring up the fact we have let the most depraved minds in our society rule over our infrastructures just because they have more money.

       You are correct in many ways but there is one thing we can do to stop them. The government is just a big business and what do all big businesses sell a product. If we stop using the govt. and all the huge monopolies that control the they can not survive. If we all stop buying there products and stop using there services then they can not generate a profit and the govt. and big businesses will crumble. It will take a long time but one day they will have no choice but to do what the people say..

       Well put. If there is going to be a revolution then we are first going to have to change the paradigm of how a revolution is done. I think the general consensus among us conspiracy theorists is that there has to be a way of revolting without killing people and without rioting through the streets like crazed madmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, we really only have one choice. We have to wait things out and just keep spreading the word until a formidable consensus has been established. Fortunately for us, the power structure has backed itself into a corner. They cannot do another 9/11 style event because, while most average individuals still believe the official story, you can bet that most governments around the world do not. It just wouldn't have the same effect because of this. So they now have to do these little events like Sandy Hook and Boston which is equally dangerous for them because every time they do a new false flag more and more people are realizing the bullshit that is going on around them. They are slowly being forced to expose themselves.

       one thing we must not do -- is use definitives where there isn't really substantial proof, just circumstantial evidence. i understand the idea of Cui bono but saying that sandy hook and boston is a false flag straight up is almost as misleading as the official 9/11 story

       Very cynical. That attitude guarantees our lives and those we love will be destroyed. This while "I'm only one man" attitude has ruined the lives of untold numbers throughout history and allowed evil to plague the world. What would have happened if Einstein, Tesla, the Wright brothers, what if George Washington said "when was the last time this worked?" Those other times people try to do things truly have an enormous bearing on what we are doing only if we let them. This thought IMO comes from people who deep down are too afraid or cowardly to do the right thing when the rubber hits the road.

       you are cynical.  every one of your words sounds out like a bullet in an empty theater.  the internet puts one human's thoughts on display to billions, regardless of what the people in power want.   anyone who's still in brainwashed mode can read your comment and understand the very real logic behind it, and the insanity of the system that produces people who have to have those thoughts.

       attempting media discreditation of protests means fuck-all.  no matter how hard they try at that, it's all defense, and anyone can
       <em>
        recognize
       </em>
       that.   these wars and martial law crackdowns aren't just appearing from thin air, and dishonest defenses of them prove conscious manipulation of the entire system.

       This is is all IMO but, the shadow government started around the 40's or 50's.  They had it a pretty good setup in terms of controlling the media, controlling elections, swaying the opinions of the masses, distracting the public.  They even found ways to fund the overthrowing of countries "off the books" (Iran / Contra, etc...). But they are now all old guys.  Old guys don't know shit about technology.  My dad is a 40 year telecom guy, couldn't work a Playstation to save his life.  The Internet has really come into it's own in the last 10 years.  It has basically caught everyone with their pants down...  Actually, it's more like someone flipped on the kitchen light and cockroaches started scurrying.
       <em>
        They
       </em>
       are still running the same game, over and over, expecting the same results.  Not quite understanding what the public knows and why.  "Why should we worry about the public opinion?  We own USA today, and put the lockdown on AOL years ago, the Internet is a fad anyway".
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr
      </p>
      <p>
       Shadow government is now old guys who don't understand what the Internet is, or how it is relevant in today's world.

       Is there any evidence that google is a huge government shell? (I know super tin-foil hat).  But is it remotely possible that it's been a government thing from the beginning, or that it's been taken over partially (in terms of tracking)?

       Perhaps equally troubling are the "coincidences" that can arise out of nowhere, distracting out attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Example:
       </strong>
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-325985.html">
        On Sept. 10, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld admitted that $2.7 trillion could not be accounted for by the Pentagon
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       QUOTE:
      </p>
      <p>
       *"According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions," Rumsfeld admitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       "$2.3 trillion — that's $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America. To understand how the Pentagon can lose track of trillions, consider the case of one military accountant who tried to find out what happened to a mere $300 million."*

       No. The entire Department of Defense budget for the year 2000 was only

       Yes, but the Department of Defense as a whole did publish its financial statements, which included the Army's spending. The team working on reconciling the past statements continued working and had reduced the unknown amount to $700 billion by early 2002:

        DoD financial experts, Zakheim said, are making good progress reconciling the department's "lost" expenditures, trimming them from a prior estimated total of $2.3 trillion to $700 billion. And, he added, the amount continues to drop.

       I did not know that, that is a nice context to put that in. But that still doesn't discount the possibility of making a big deal of it on the 10th so that it is literally forgotten forever the next day. No one in my family remembered that at all until I told them, and it wasn't until years later I remembered I'd seen that walking by the TV the day before when my parents were watching the news. I was pretty young back then.

       Here's my rationale, and you should spread this as far as you can. So they HEAR it. They are pathetic. They are so stupid in such an infantile way that a bunch of nerds and geeks, USING THEIR PROPAGANDA (pretty much 99% of the information we have), figured out every move of their game. People who haven't been to college, people who haven't been raised by a silver spoon to be born into that world. They are pathetic. From their point of view, uneducated and ignorant peasant children are calling them on every move they make. We understand their entire game. We understand their motives. We understand them. Can you imagine how small and insignificant that makes them feel? Nothing makes them special or powerful except what they know. That information is now everywhere.

       Yea, that "national security" garbage is something they use quite a bit.  Like spying on AP.  Apparently reporting things is a "threat to national security," but giving automatic weapons to mexican cartels isn't... I could definitely see them spinning hacks into a national security issue to gain control of the information online.  If not because of military or government secrets falling into "enemy hands," because corporate secrets get out and that is a threat to our "recovering" economy.  Because since I've started following alternative sources online, I know WAY more about what is actually happening in the world than what Fox, CNN, ABC, NBC, and HLN spoon feed the populace.

       I was driving yesterday and I decided to listen to talk radio.  I was surprised that they were actually talking about the IRS and AP stories.  Then I realized that there message was dilluted to the point of irrelevance by all of the commercials and context switching.  I'm not sure how many people would really be able to follow and hold onto that thought if they didn't already know it was important.

       "hostile ET's" would be the ultimate distraction. I don't think they'd play that card unless collapse of the government or revolution was imminent, as it would give the masses a potentially even bigger enemy to fear than communism, and more recently "terrorism".

       I have been seeing this type of corruption come to light for all my life and it has not come to a tipping point yet. If the American people don't care that our men and women in uniform are being murdered for corporate profit in Iraq and Afganhistan and elsewhere around the world, I don't think anything will wake them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single reason for going to Iraq was a lie, that is general knowledge now, and not one single person has been tried for treason, not even the mention of it. And you won't see a mention of it, because once you open that door, it won't close until the vast majority of congress is convicted of high treason.

       my theory: the elites are planning for this, they want the downfall of america. the us is the largest economy and when it completely crashes the rest of the economic and social world will too. an uproar from the masses will cause ultimate civil war (e.g. DHS stocking up on over 1 billion bullets and 2,700 Armour vehicles) in such chaos an organized army by the world elite will take to the streets, air, and water in an effort to rule the world

       I wish I could agree, but I cant. For each bullet point you list I dont see it as the house of cards tipping but rather, the need to hide in the shadows or in secret is eroding away for them. When it comes to things like long term plans for the never ending multiple front war or spying on Americans in plain sight: I see the government attempting to normalize those practices to where in another decade, it'll just be acceptable.

       I can see that.  I'm young (early 20s) so I haven't really been able to see the normalization that happens in the long term.  The biggest change I've seen is from the PATRIOT Act, but even before it I was too young to really remember what it was like.  But the older redditors on here seem to have the same opinion you do, and given history I can definitely see that scenario as well.

       My biggest thing comes mostly from the internet.  30 years ago people wouldn't have heard about Boston until the next day in the papers, unless a relative called them.  Now, I heard about it within minutes.  The ability to transmit information instantly anywhere in the world is a serious threat to the old system of corruption imho, something TPTB are seriously scared of.

       i think that it is going to take something far more drastic than any of that to really cause a sea change.  just keep in mind that a recent poll showed that something like 45 percent of americans don't even know there is a thing called "obamacare"...  most people do not even know about any of that stuff you listed, so they aren't really affected.  Something on the scale of 9/11 (not in terms of violence, but in terms of its significance) is the level of insanity that has to happen in order to wake pepole up... but even then, they might burrow themselves even deeper in the hole of government tyranny.  people beg to be violated and molested these days.

       I am skeptical that things are falling apart. It's possible that things are getting out which shouldn't be, despite best efforts, but it's also possible that these things are intentionally allowed to make it to the MSM. Fear is the best means of control. If people are scared of their government and of the world, they're not only far more likely to submit, but if they refuse to submit they are far more likely to commit irrational behaviors. If, for example, a right wing group tries to "overthrow the government", that is perfect justification for
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of these freedom strippings— "SEE WE TOLD YOU! DOMESTIC TERRORISTS! WE ARE USING SURVEILLANCE AND TAKING AWAY YOUR RIGHTS TO PROTECT YOU!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it
       <em>
        Always
       </em>
       seems like shit comes out in the second term. I wouldn't be surprised if it is allowed to happen because they want everyone to be infuriated with Obama and push really hard and get really excited for the next guy, whom they will follow blindly for the first term and then start questioning when the MSM tells them they can question things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way America will realize things is if either A) the corporate controlled media with the
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       goals the the government somehow change their agenda or B) They start thinking for themselves. I am highly skeptical there is a serious number of American's thinking for themselves and thus I think the most probable explanations are either that this is all part of the plan or the plan is much bigger than this information and it's exposing is irrelevant.

       Very likely.  I've thought often that "they" want "us" to know these are false flags and contrived lies, with government sponsorship.  For the sheep, they are controlled.  For any one else with eyes to see, they are oppressed and fearful, knowing that [we] are impotent to halt or change the controlling evil treachery that is so obvious and so powerful.  MANIPULATION on a grand scale.  No one is exempt.

       Never thought about the second term thing you mention.  But that makes a lot of sense to me.  Looking back, I can see how that was potentially the case in '08 with Obama.  All the demonizing of Bush, and here is this new guy with all these great plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the disinfo or "intentional leaks" (I guess you could call it) by the MSM is a good idea as well.  Make it seem like shit is coming out, to distract people from even bigger things.

       No the house of cards isn't falling apart. Every single president that has taken office has been fallible - and we know for a fact that every single president since at least Kennedy (and perhaps Carter) have been nothing more than paid, corporate employees. Every single one of them has experienced some degree of scandal, some worse than others. They never suffer for these scandals. For example Clinton was responsible for selling Nuclear secrets to China and his administration was responsible for the economic crises we face today (repeal of Glass-Steagall), he was impeached for getting a blowjob. He went on to make stupid amounts of money at speaking events and book sales across the world. None of these people ever do time for their crimes. My point being that these presidents and administrations are throw away - disposable. When the next election cycle rolls around, let's see how tuned in people are to this house of cards when they continue buying in to the same left right paradigm bullshit they always had. Britain almost got away with it, voting in both conservatives and liberal democrats to share governance but the conservatives have now basically muscled out the lib dems. It's the same shit every time, no matter what country you are dealing with. These little scandals... it's just pageantry, whatever bullshit is necessary to get things done.

       haha.  When the pope gets in on it you know something is up.  I left the church a while ago because of the shenanigans with protecting child molesters and the anit-gay marriage bullshit.  But this pope seems to know what is up.  I guess when you come from a favela instead of an Italian mansion you get a sense of the actual world we live in.

       I think of it like this - yes, it might be a tipping point, but this tipping point is going to last a while, and it might go either way. I think the house is teetering and starting to crack, but they're working their damned hardest to keep it standing, and it might work for them, it might not. I don't think a collapse was part of their plan, but I think they were planning for it. However, there's only so much you can do, and I think they're struggling to keep a hold of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those talking about civil war, martial law etc: civil war is a stupid idea. If it gets to that stage, the government is on it's way down anyway, and it'd be much more sensible to let it fail on its own. There aren't enough troops to enact nationwide martial law, so they will be interested in controlling key areas such as ports, power stations, major cities, etc etc.
      </p>

       If you want a good indicator, you need to look at the energy sector. That's what this whole thing runs on. This is the issue: we've already hit peak oil, we know that, however, if we can't fill the gap between the decline of easy-to-get energy with other sources (shale, tar, wind, solar, whatever) and keep up with demand, that will be the major shift and likely collapse that we hear talked about. I think we have a few years before this all plays out yet, so don't get too worried or excited just yet.

       We need another movement like "occupy" but larger, more organized and with better support. People take notice of movements. Black people didn't wait for the government to legislate their civil rights. They went out and demanded fair treatment. We need to get off our asses and make our corporate oligarchs responsible for what they've done to this country and the planet.

       Those whose eyes are open have been warning of the gradual and intentional dismantling of America for decades.  It's very encouraging to witness people 'waking up,' in larger numbers than ever before and at an amazing pace.  We can only hope that it's not too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with OP in that things are heading toward a tipping point.  And, once the threshold is breached, the American people will have a decision to make; to dismantle and rebuild the government, or acquiesce and evolve from blind slavery to witting slaves.

       I haven't looked into all of these scandals, but I'm keeping up with the mainstream narrative, which is that none of these scandals are that bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       My impression is that the real scandal is Benghazi (although I can't say that I know much about it) and that this scandal was diffused by the government admitting to several smaller scandals that distracted the media and caused a circus, but when the dust settles there won't be much left to incriminate the white house.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time as all these scandals are going on, the mainstream liberal media (Maddow, Stewart, Maher, NYT, WaPo etc.) are all pushing the line that the Benghazi thing is just the Republicans trying to score political points over nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public is falling for it. Everything will return to normal.

       Exactly. People are too overworked to put any effort or thought into the big picture. The average westerner is too busy trying to just survive, and maintain the Status quo.  And the funny thing is, we think we have it the BEST in the world, and that our society and government/system is superior to all others. We're arrogant enough to believe we've nearly already reached the peak of humanity's potential, so instead of trying to find new ways to think, and improve society for everyone, we just go about our day to day lives not caring to try.

       I didn't mean for it to come off as a conspiracy.  I just know the people who read this sub are the most open-minded people on this site, and have knowledge about this kind of stuff.  They're also pretty damn good at critical thinking, so I figured this was the best place to post it to get meaningful responses and opinions.

       The powers that be would never let anything just fall apart. I mean really - let's talk objectively here. If you were the most powerful organization on earth with no accountability, and transcended borders and morals - would you just let it fall apart, simply because the MINORITY of people started to wise up a little?

       Only the pawns are being disposed of so far, taking the blame for others. Left media is starting to turn on Obama, who is nothing more than a rook. Atleast they are losing pieces, unfortunately our side is not very organized. We are playing a defensive battle, hoping they are overly aggressive and make mistakes, which they have been. If we could organize a meaningful strike at this time it would have a chance to be successful.

       Now, agree or disagree with her conclusions, but understand that this is huge. The 25-and-below crowd ain't buying the old bullshit. They're not with the racism, sexism, or other isms..and they will be running shit in this world very soon. Bad for the old guard, in many ways. I do think people are waking up, and its the younger crowd that's sparking it. Most people my age(early 40's) are still stuck in the old world. This is painful for them; But necessary for all of us to evolve.

       To take it metaphysical for a moment, we are all evolving. When your vibration increases, the lies of the lower vibration fall apart. This is what we're witnessing now.

       I'm with ya on this, brotha. I think the powerful have lost their grasp and are making desperation moves as of late. If everything on their side of things was rosy, I think life would be like the 90s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever they planned for post-9/11 really didn't come to fruition (one world order with massive population loss, to name a couple things). It showed their hand, more than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like everything is worse off now than ever, but I believe - in order to break free of their control - all the malicious shit they've been doing and continue to do must be exposed.

       Metaphor for "the powers that be" (government, corporatocracy, big banks).  Basically the idea that everything you know to be true only exists because you be
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       believe it is true.  You've been brainwashed by the government, the media, and schools to think that our current system is the best system the world has ever known.  But nobody mentions the things like
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        US spends more on prisons than it does on education
       </li>
       <li>
        Our "defense" budget is larger than the next 10 countries combined- isn't it coincidental that those nations don't spend as much and are involved in less international conflict?
       </li>
       <li>
        The US is ~5% of the world's population, we consume 25% of the planet's resources, and contribute 30% of the world's pollution.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These are small things compared to what kind of statistic or event you would need to get real change to happen now.  But all you need is one big thing for enough people to lose faith in tptb, and then they have nothing but force to try to save themselves (at that point the people have won, because once they do that their system is over).

       I agree with you. This is only the beginning. The problem is so many people are controlled and don't think for themselves...so only a few will resist.

       Iv been following this situation for a long time now and I constantly had that "tipping point" feeling you have. But the longer you are in this business the more you start to understand that the tipping point is farther than it feels.

       This madness could easily go on for 5 more years. I'm just hoping for a sun spot that will take out our entire electric infrastructure. Get this society to start showing its ugly head and start the cleaning process. Politics will not change, the people will not change, we need a firm smack to the face. We need our asses kicked.

       I think the movie Oblivion is analogous to what is happening in America and the World right now.  I just watched it tonight and the message in that movie just gives me goose bumps.  I implore all of my fellows on this sub reddit to watch it!  This is the dawning of the age of the age of Aquarius and 2012 was never suppose to be the end of the world.  It was the end of the Pisces era.  We are now entering the era of enlightenment.  Everyone is waking up.  It is the era in which the truth can no longer be suppressed by TPTB.  Slow and steady (and peaceful) wins the race.  Keep it rolling my brothers and sisters.

       I agree with you on almost everything. The only thing is Boston was NOT under martial law. They called every household and recommended we stay inside. We could still go outside, we could still do whatever. The national guard was not armed. Besides that, your totally right

       If you think Boston was an insidious martial law situation, you are fucked in the head.  People were shooting guns and setting off bombs!  What do you want them to do?  Trust me, they didn't even HAVE to tell people to stay in their homes, they just did in case some nutjob like you ran out into the street to become famous (and probably dead).
