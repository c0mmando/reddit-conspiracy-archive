<p>I understand why socialists wouldn&#39;t be conspiracy theorists, but what&#39;s with the lack of anarchist conspiracy theorists?</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m the only left leaning conspiracy theorist in the world. Can somebody explain this phenomena?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you accept that there is a high level of brainwashing that is taking place to keep the &quot;red&quot; and the &quot;blue&quot; at constant odds, than consider the following.</p>

<p>If the people associating themselves with the red side of politics then they are subjected to brainwashing consistent with anger, brow beating rhetoric, an abundance of pride etc.;</p>

<p>Than the blue is subjected to pseudo science and confirmation bias via self patting on the back. </p>

<p>If you listen to liberal media it&#39;s reoccurring theme is &quot;We are smarter, more sophisticated, more open minded, more cultured, generally better.&quot;</p>

<p>It acts as the counter net to capture the would be intelligent sheep that the red net misses via it&#39;s ranting and raving chest pumping fervor. </p>

<p>Most of the time for liberals, and like minded blue people, they believe that by simply abstaining from an argument and playing the passive aggressive card somehow fulfills their need to &quot;do something&quot; well in actuality they do &quot;nothing&quot;.</p>

<p>The thing that makes challenging these people&#39;s ideals is that they believe they are morally on the right side of every subject, naturally... they have been told they are. No matter what the subject NPR listeners can be completely content with doing nothing. </p>

<p>So why do you not see them on that side? Well, in my opinion, it is much easier to laugh, mock, point the finger, throw poo at the crazy-nutjob-religious-yahoo. But you see they grew up in an environment where they had zero contrast (this includes our newly labelled theorists, &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. In places like Canada they pride themselves on laughing things off and passive aggressively calling you dumb and crazy to your face by their dismissive behavior).</p>

<p>However, the liberal mind is surrounded with people with degrees all patting you on the back, saying &quot;look at those crazy religious fools, a good thing you are a free thinker and smart enough to join the sophisticated side; By the way, put this sticker of Obama on your car, he supports children.&quot;</p>

<p>The smart man is the hardest to convince they have been fooled because they have confidence in their intellect and cannot fathom they have been duped, for that would mean EVERYONE has been duped... and that is just not possible. But just like the reds, they are only living in an environment made up of &quot;confirmation bias.&quot;</p>

<p>Btw, you might be able to consider me a &quot;left&quot; leaning theorist ( I despise the usage of the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; ). Although we can all agree left or right that whatever this shit is has to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are somewhat correct, but if this was during the Bush administration (which was only 6 years ago) it would be the exact same argument but fill in the blank with the other party.  </p>

<p>I hope people are more enlightened than to still think that there is a party that is better than the other. Haven&#39;t we learned by now that its the same thing no matter what? That is the game, that is the biggest trick of all. Give people a side to yell at the other guy for and you got yourself a situation of tension rather than harmony throughout the general public, the powers that be will stop at nothing to make sure anyone who still believes in the Right/Left Liberal/Conservative paradigm will continue to keep their blindfold on and continue to stay connected to their plan; its goal is to distract you from the truth that it is all an invisible mind cage that keeps the ignorant blind and the arrogant deaf.</p>

<p>Think of it this way, the left and right are two arms connected to the same beast with the same mind and goal.</p>

If you actually look at what they&#39;re doing, they have a lot in common, because they&#39;re integrated into the same system, but one party is actually trying to get somewhere in terms of individual rights, and the other is trying to ban abortion and &quot;nontraditional marriage&quot; and using phrases like &quot;legitimate rape&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok then, how do you name the fundamental difference between propping up the individual with the help of the state or propping up the state with the help of the individual? There <em>is</em> a dichotomy, and it is not false. Because you are also one of those who forget that <em>political parties are political and for the state</em>. Why should they care about things outside of the state system?</p>

<p>edit: Propping up the state with the help of the individual is obviously the right, just to clarify that. More surveillance, more police, more military. Propping up the individual/citizen with the help of the state means more welfare and/or more education. In the end it mostly converges, but the left way is just more comfortable for the lower classes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be some bland about it, but it tends to go contra to the political party in power.</p>

<p>Post 9/11 the Theory that Bush knew and allowed the attacks or orchestrated them so he could start a war for oil was a left wing conspiracy. </p>

<p>I think as one party is in power, the group without power tends to find more conspiracy theories as to what the other side is doing. I was recently talking to someone who believed boston was a false flag by neocon conservatives to take power from Obama, I remember I thought to myself wow you&#39;re adorable and your like a unicorn, but he is really just early to the party, as he enters his lame duck phase the left wing side will pick up their own theories.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s historically how its gone, also remember that not everyone here aspires to the same beliefs, some people have very different theories that are apolitical as well.(although really since 9/11 political conspiracy theories have really come to the forefront)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to fall into a nihilistic world view but I&#39;m not so narrow minded that I&#39;m open to reason / scientific fact....and even though I&#39;m morbidly fascinated by &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and agree that some exist, affected our history and are currently in play, I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist by any stretch,  although I think some would disagree.  The left -right paradigm is laughable in its absurdities as of the last 30 or so years, maybe longer. They both represent the same interests while splitting the people with highly emotional social issues I.e. race, abortion, gay rights etc.when in reality those issues really are of no consequence to us in the chaos that is our universe. Skin color and cultural identity,  safe and humane procedures for women and the rights of consenting adults is really pretty simple, though most have been conditioned to respond to these types of issues in a polarized manner. 
The left-right and even anarchists,  tea party libertarians, conspiracy theorists and others all act as  cogs in the greater machine of one dimensional human existence thats feeding industrial necessity or complete sensual gratification or both. Either way the masses are herded by simple prods from the political and social  influences, whom work in concert to achieve  a desired agenda where they remain distracted by their own self interest no matter thier self identified political / social role or affiliations. This makes it easy to control us, the biggest conspiracy is the one we tell ourselves to perpetuate our current reality.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s because we get banned here.</p>

<p>But look at the moderators, their politics, and how they post. Their willingness to discuss rationally. Heck, some of them regularly delete their posts because of how foolish they come off. They are essentially destroying this community from within. Slowly marginalizing everyone except for the new target of the powers that be, freedom fighting citizens, or, domestic terrorists as they will be called. The top rated post in this thread being a perfect example of such tone.</p>

<p>Furthermore if there are a number of people that significant disagree with that mod, is there a reason <strong>why</strong> it should <strong>not</strong> be reflected in the mods post? <em>What is the mod trying to hide??</em></p>

<p>I think you are destroying the community because you don&#39;t raise the bar of discussion. You hold people to your arbitrary standards and beliefs. Your response being a demonstration of your inability to actually grasp the points of the people you converse with. Everyone knows 9ksins regularly deletes his posts because they make him look like an insane and petty fool grasping at straws. This is no secret. That you can&#39;t even admit to this is a reflection of how disingenuous you are. </p>

<p>Do the mods of this subreddit think the readers are too unintelligent to notice a pattern of downvotes in 9ksins posts? I&#39;m sorry, but this is why I think you don&#39;t help this community at all, your points <em>defy</em> rationality. You focus discussion to certain topics and viewpoints that are consistent with how gov&#39;t infiltrators want to make conspiracy theorists look. It&#39;d be fairly ironic if it wasn&#39;t obvious what your intent is.</p>

<p>9ksins deletes his comments <em>after the fact</em> as opposed to when he actually posts them and they get downvoted. Furthermore, if your point were true, he&#39;d be deleting his posts immediately, which would be incredibly pointless.</p>

<p><strong>Is</strong> there a reason the traditional reddit community guidelines <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> apply to 9ksins? If his posts are that inflammatory, maybe he should consider only posting every 8 minutes (ya know, like reddit intended?). </p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>No</strong>, this is a ridiculous assumption on your part as a moderator. A lot of people find 9k sins posts to be inflammatory junk. It&#39;s why they jump on him and it&#39;s why he deleted his posts. You just assume the massive number of people that disagree with you is a brigade. When really it&#39;s more of a hint towards the fact that 9ksins has an atrocious posting style. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to see any evidence of this, and if you bothered to read my post you&#39;d know I tied a few other ideas into this as well. It&#39;s not just the bar of discussion. Once again, the disingenuous nature with which you respond to my post is demonstrative of the fact that you don&#39;t raise <em>any</em> bars in terms of conversation.</p>

<p>Umm no, what you provided was a joke response that doesn&#39;t apply to the situation at all. You can try to convince everyone here of whatever <em>you&#39;d</em> like, but his posts speak for themselves and anyone who has seen the type of posts he deletes knows what I&#39;m talking about. If you&#39;d prefer not to acknowledge this widely known phenomena, feel free to, but it only serves to outline this dishonesty you bring to the conversation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you think I&#39;m a government infiltrator? What have said that makes you think that?</p>

<p>Infiltrator? Did you bother to read my post? I already explained why you fit the bill for a character that is destroying this place from within. If you&#39;d like to discuss specific reasons, well, do it. Don&#39;t just ask broad questions that were already answered. This of course being, <strong>yet another example</strong> of your inability to have a fair and rational discussion. Thanks for proving my points!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>left and right are tools of control, but more to the point, a lot of left anarchists ARE conspiracy theorists, and their conspiracy of choice is capitalism. They know the game. Furthermore, to me, at some point, the ability to imprint minds via cultural, economic, and political hegemony is the sort of power that conspiracy theories rely on anyway.</p>

<p>*different level of deconstruction: The free market as today is not free in most areas. And a completely free market does not exist, as the free market is a legal tool of exchange. But a legal tool is never free in itself. Also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episteme">this</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, any one assuming a conspiracy is either of a left or right nature needs to reassess why they are still caught up in the Right vs Left, &#39;Liberal and Conservative&#39; Paradigm. </p>

<p>That is a system that has been set up for us whose sole purpose is to give us the illusion of choice. I am not just talking about elections, I&#39;m talking Ideologically speaking.</p>

<p>The truth is there is no left or right, its only a way for people to find more easily the differences in our fellow man. The truth is we are all one, united by rights to live in peace and collaboration; As opposed to fear and destruction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s basically a combination of <a href="/u/big_rawr_monster">/u/big_rawr_monster</a>&#39;s post and <a href="/u/jaquesaustin">/u/jaquesaustin</a>.</p>

<p>But generally speaking it&#39;s because the &quot;left&quot; has a more collectivist mindset and the &quot;right&quot; is more individualist mind set.  </p>

<p>While there is nothing inherently wrong with a voluntary (emphasis on voluntary) collective, like anarcho-communism, the collectivist mindset lends itself more to group-think which tends to downplay or squelch any questions or voices of dissent.  This is not to say that the right doesn&#39;t have group think, because it does, just in the spectrum of &quot;right&quot; there is less inclination to the behavior.</p>

<p>So if it&#39;s not what Jaques was talking about which I&#39;ve defined as &quot;establishment confirmation bias&quot;; IE: collectivism of the side in charge; and it&#39;s not the intellectual elitism of the left described by Big rawr monster then it&#39;s the general collectivism of the ideological spectrum of the &quot;left&quot;.</p>

<p>The key is to be an individual first and a collective second, but we are invariably both simultaneously.  When everyone gets this right, human civilization will change more in a week than it has in hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Because if you have too many down votes in a short period of time, reddit makes you wait 8 minutes between making new comments. And that is very annoying when you&#39;re having a pleasant chat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>9ksins deletes his comments <em>after the fact</em> as opposed to when he actually posts them and they get downvoted. Furthermore, if your point were true, he&#39;d be deleting his posts immediately, which would be incredibly pointless.</p>

<p><strong>Is</strong> there a reason the traditional reddit community guidelines <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> apply to 9ksins? If his posts are that inflammatory, maybe he should consider only posting every 8 minutes (ya know, like reddit intended?). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the voting cliques don&#39;t care what you say. They down vote you becauseof who you are. To silence you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>No</strong>, this is a ridiculous assumption on your part as a moderator. A lot of people find 9k sins posts to be inflammatory junk. It&#39;s why they jump on him and it&#39;s why he deleted his posts. You just assume the massive number of people that disagree with you is a brigade. When really it&#39;s more of a hint towards the fact that 9ksins has an atrocious posting style. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think I&#39;m destroying the community because I don&#39;t raise the bar of discussion... that&#39;s odd because the rules I enforce actually have raised the bar for discussion. The exact opposite what you claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to see any evidence of this, and if you bothered to read my post you&#39;d know I tied a few other ideas into this as well. It&#39;s not just the bar of discussion. Once again, the disingenuous nature with which you respond to my post is demonstrative of the fact that you don&#39;t raise <em>any</em> bars in terms of conversation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Everyone knows 9ksins.... bla bla. I just explained why he deletes his history but you want it to be something else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Umm no, what you provided was a joke response that doesn&#39;t apply to the situation at all. You can try to convince everyone here of whatever <em>you&#39;d</em> like, but his posts speak for themselves and anyone who has seen the type of posts he deletes knows what I&#39;m talking about. If you&#39;d prefer not to acknowledge this widely known phenomena, feel free to, but it only serves to outline this dishonesty you bring to the conversation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you think I&#39;m a government infiltrator? What have said that makes you think that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Infiltrator? Did you bother to read my post? I already explained why you fit the bill for a character that is destroying this place from within. If you&#39;d like to discuss specific reasons, well, do it. Don&#39;t just ask broad questions that were already answered. This of course being, <strong>yet another example</strong> of your inability to have a fair and rational discussion. Thanks for proving my points!</p>

<p>Is there something about the following sentence that you <strong>don&#39;t</strong> understand??</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You focus discussion to certain topics and viewpoints that are consistent with how gov&#39;t infiltrators want to make conspiracy theorists look.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking forward to being banned for pointing out your inability to have a fair and rational discussion. </p>
