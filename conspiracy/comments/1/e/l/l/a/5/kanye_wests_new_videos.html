    <div class="md"><p>Kanye is the most materialistic joke in recent history. Rapping about high fashion and expensive cars/jets, and how rich he is. What a hypocrite. 
Now he&#39;s warning people about the NWO and corporations? Bitch, please. He&#39;s a huge part of the problem propagating these views to his people who can barely get by. Encouraging black culture to worship money and to get it at any cost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you heard Kanyes music though he hasnt rapped about materialistic things he always has tracks about conscious shit and even associated with conscious rappers. Thsts why I really think there is s good side and an evil side. I personally feel a bunch of crlebs politicians etc made their own network so ppl dont have to sell their soul. I know that is crazy but I really think a lot of then have planned shit out to counter the evil </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kanye is part of a system that is part of the problem.   But maybe he is waking up.  Although for his level of success I would suspect that he had to give in a great deal to the mentality of those in power of his industry.    But people change and he just might too.   Interesting lyrics.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems obvious that the people getting upvoted have never actually listened to much of Kanye West&#39;s songs or heard him give interviews. The guy thinks AIDS was developed by the government. Almost all of his songs that reference designer clothes deal with the fact that buying all these clothes is part of a self consciousness brought about by consumer culture and the mass media. The guy went on television for a Hurricane Katrina donation drive and told everyone that the president hates black people and talked about the double standard  with the phrases &quot;looting&quot; vs &quot;looking for supplies&quot;. </p>

<p>Instead of actually addressing Kanye Wests material we have people who see this post and say &quot;Oh look, it&#39;s generic rapper who I&#39;ve never listened to and now he&#39;s talking about the things I talk about! What a materialistic hack.&quot; </p>

<p>This is why a large portion of Reddit views this sub as being comprised of retards. You aren&#39;t capable of taking 5 minutes and doing a simple google search on some rapper before proclaiming he&#39;s a materialistic hack but somehow you&#39;re the authority on how the government orchestrated 9/11. Fine work fellas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t heard anything about this yet so thanks for the heads up. I thought the song was pretty sick and I&#39;ll be happy when we can actually listen to the track rather than someones cell footage. The projection was kind of lackluster. He&#39;s giving voice to a lot of people&#39;s frustrations with the current state of affairs. He&#39;s not really saying anything incredibly new. Yes, corporations are soulless and exist to take your money. I liked the bit about the folks up in the Hamptons and how Kanye plans on fucking their spouses.</p>

<p>*Edit: I thought OP was asking for out take on the song. It seems obvious that the people getting upvoted have never actually listened to much of Kanye West&#39;s songs or heard him give interviews. The guy thinks AIDS was developed by the government. Almost all of his songs that reference designer clothes reference the fact that buying all these clothes is part of a self consciousness brought about by consumer culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All rappers talk about is how much money they make, how cool they are, how many women they get, what kind of brand name clothes they wear, what kind of cars they drive, what kind of planes they fly in, what sports teams they prefer, how they get good drugs etc.
