       Kanye is the most materialistic joke in recent history. Rapping about high fashion and expensive cars/jets, and how rich he is. What a hypocrite. 
Now he's warning people about the NWO and corporations? Bitch, please. He's a huge part of the problem propagating these views to his people who can barely get by. Encouraging black culture to worship money and to get it at any cost.

       Oh wow! 7 hours later and still no response from Quattrocket. It's almost as if he's never listened to more than 2 of Kanye West's songs. Ironically one of them was probably Gold Digger.

       He's never "played the other side." Kanye has always been materialistic. Just because he's a conscious rapper doesn't mean he is a hypocrite for owning a maybach.

       If you heard Kanyes music though he hasnt rapped about materialistic things he always has tracks about conscious shit and even associated with conscious rappers. Thsts why I really think there is s good side and an evil side. I personally feel a bunch of crlebs politicians etc made their own network so ppl dont have to sell their soul. I know that is crazy but I really think a lot of then have planned shit out to counter the evil

       Kanye is part of a system that is part of the problem.   But maybe he is waking up.  Although for his level of success I would suspect that he had to give in a great deal to the mentality of those in power of his industry.    But people change and he just might too.   Interesting lyrics.

       I agree. To me I didn't sense any change in him, especially with the lyrics, "You see there's leaders and there's followers, but I'd rather be a dick than a swallow-er." To me he's calling us the followers aka the "swallow-ers" while he's just going to continue being a dick feeding us BS.

       Kim Kardashian is worth $40 million. Ray J is worth $6 million and Kris Humphries is worth $8 million(I feel ashamed that I even googled this shit).
      </p>
      <p>
       Kanye is the only recent guy shes fucked that is worth more than her. She didn't get anything from Kris Humphries. Infact Kris Humphries was the one asking for shit from Kim.

       Kanye was/is convinced the government introduced crack and AIDS into the urban black neighborhoods to control, subdue, kill them. New Slaves is actually a lot more mild than previous social/conspiratorial observations in his work.

       It seems obvious that the people getting upvoted have never actually listened to much of Kanye West's songs or heard him give interviews. The guy thinks AIDS was developed by the government. Almost all of his songs that reference designer clothes deal with the fact that buying all these clothes is part of a self consciousness brought about by consumer culture and the mass media. The guy went on television for a Hurricane Katrina donation drive and told everyone that the president hates black people and talked about the double standard  with the phrases "looting" vs "looking for supplies".
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of actually addressing Kanye Wests material we have people who see this post and say "Oh look, it's generic rapper who I've never listened to and now he's talking about the things I talk about! What a materialistic hack."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why a large portion of Reddit views this sub as being comprised of retards. You aren't capable of taking 5 minutes and doing a simple google search on some rapper before proclaiming he's a materialistic hack but somehow you're the authority on how the government orchestrated 9/11. Fine work fellas.

       What in the living fuck are you talking about? Other than completely assuming what people are saying about and how they're reacting to this video, what makes you think you know why people are upvoting it, or that they didn't read it? Or that if they do know about him that they have to think a certain? You're just a walking fallacy.

       Well I'm not "completely assuming what people are saying about"  the video. See, they've actually typed out a response to it. I'm not reading peoples minds. They've actually come out and said it. I never claimed to know why people are upvoting these comments. I just outlined what was wrong with them.

       I probably shouldn't have even responded to your comment but it made me feel a certain?

       I hadn't heard anything about this yet so thanks for the heads up. I thought the song was pretty sick and I'll be happy when we can actually listen to the track rather than someones cell footage. The projection was kind of lackluster. He's giving voice to a lot of people's frustrations with the current state of affairs. He's not really saying anything incredibly new. Yes, corporations are soulless and exist to take your money. I liked the bit about the folks up in the Hamptons and how Kanye plans on fucking their spouses.

       *Edit: I thought OP was asking for out take on the song. It seems obvious that the people getting upvoted have never actually listened to much of Kanye West's songs or heard him give interviews. The guy thinks AIDS was developed by the government. Almost all of his songs that reference designer clothes reference the fact that buying all these clothes is part of a self consciousness brought about by consumer culture.

       All rappers talk about is how much money they make, how cool they are, how many women they get, what kind of brand name clothes they wear, what kind of cars they drive, what kind of planes they fly in, what sports teams they prefer, how they get good drugs etc. 
some are talking about what's going on in the world but if you don't seek out rap you may have never heard it.
