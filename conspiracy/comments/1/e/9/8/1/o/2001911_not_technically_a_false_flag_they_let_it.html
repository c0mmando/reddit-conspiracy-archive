       All the public evidence says they knew it was in the works - but they deliberately allowed it to happen through clever structuring of incompetence, and devious plotting (like Stalin and Chernobyl), to excuse the escalation and accelleration of the "security state."
      </p>
      <p>
       This allows them to allow conspiracy theories - false flag, one-plane, no-plane, whatever theories, that sound bonkers, but hides the actual truth of the matter, thereby discrediting conspiracy theorists on to the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sort of like NLP here and Cybernetics in the Soviet Union - they were used by the in-group, but discredited to the out-group, to continue their "dominance."
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who sacrifice their freedom for security deserve neither. - IDK some guy.

       How did they let WTC7 collapse? I didn't see any plane hitting it, and it fell at free fall. They did it themselves and blamed an imaginary djihad group called al qaida.

       We might never find out. But that's not the point. The point is that they craftily and knowingly let it happen, for use as an excuse to crack down on so-called terrorism, which as a country America has never really tasted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel has real terrorism problems, where militants murder people by the scores and they really suffer. America just uses the terror of terrorism as propaganda.

       This is possible but more complicated - they did install the puppet regime in Iran, they did ship in Lenin... They did fund Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein... So effectively, I suppose you're right.

       But it's so much more than that. From what I understand the skill needed to simply fly a boeing 757 or a 767 is rather great, and not meant for an amateur pilot. At the flight school that the pilots of flights 11 and 175, the instructor remarked that they were average students, unremarkable. But the flights on the day of 9/11 were beautifully choreographed, expertly done and nearly impossible for anyone but a skilled and experienced pilot, and even then, a true feat. It doesn't make sense that those we have accused were by and large unable to do what they did. If it were just the government ignoring it, that would be one thing but to be unable to answer how these men were capable of being experts without any indication of that skill before that flight? Thats looking like an entirely different story than the one we know.

       That's bullshit it wouldn't take that much skill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would take skill to do a proper takeoff, navigation, and landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking over the plane after it had already gotten within sight of NYC, turning off auto-pilot or whatever, punching the throttle then keeping the plane on target for the towers would not require nearly as much skill as a real pilot needs to keep the plane safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       With my version of the theory, you don't need so many fancy cover-ups - they just let them do it though they knew of the plot in advance, then used it as an excuse to escalate the security state, as per their evil plan.

       I mean, I work on facts here, I'm reading the assessments made by people who know what they are doing and can intellegently figure out what happened. In fact, here's one source:
      </p>
      <p>
       However, on 9/11, in piloting Flight 77 into the Pentagon, Hanjour would have needed to do much more than simply point the plane at a target. Because Flight 77 at first seemed to overshoot its target, the Washington Post will note that “the unidentified pilot executed a pivot so tight that it reminded observers of a fighter jet maneuver. The plane circled 270 degrees to the right to approach the Pentagon from the west, whereupon Flight 77 fell below radar level.… Aviation sources said the plane was flown with extraordinary skill, making it highly likely that a trained pilot was at the helm.” [WASHINGTON POST, 9/12/2001]
      </p>
      <p>
       That there is the pilot that couldn't yet fly by himself in the other aircrafts he used, but somehow managed to fly like a fighter pilot... in a big ass fucking plane. Amazing how much skill you can bullshit though, I mean, our military should probably start picking kids out of flight school and putting them in giant planes that they can't fly and demand military precision. Because... who needs training when you can just magic it.

       Propaganda? Like saying that you can just jump into planes even if you can't fly them and manage a well timed terrorist attack with precision? I gave you a credible source, quoting a pilot familiar with the plane, and all they are doing is describing to you what it takes to do what is done. Look at pilot testimony on how incredibly hard some of the things done at the day were, rather than just blindly denying what I'm saying.

       Sigh, when the MSM are discrediting the international story then yes, yes I do. Because thousands of people demand another investigation in 9/11 and they find only deaf ears. If a MSM source is contradicting that story it should be noticed... because it isn't typical. But there are so many websites, many groups of pilots, that support this FACT and the MSM covered it initially before they were told to shut the fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sorry, but you question my devotion to conspiracy? You're not refuting me with facts or even resources that lead you to believe that what I'm saying is impossible. You keep insulting me for no reason whatsoever. I thought you were a theorist who would appreciate what I was saying, but instead of seeing inconsistencies in the INTERNATIONAL REPORT BY THE MSM, you've decided to actually fall in line with what we were told, that these men did it even if they couldn't really do it. It seems to me like only one of us is sticking with the NIST documents, and isn't me.

       OK well the other most likely theory is something literally almost exactly like the Lone Gunmen episode where the auto-pilot was reprogrammed and locked in to fly the planes into their targets, and then Al-Quaida blamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also not out of the question. "We have the technology!"

       The flight manifest supposedly contained high-level government tech guys and some officials.

       I agree with this theory though, I was trying to illustrate the craziness of saying these men did this when it's apparent they could not. I just didn't go the extra step of saying who did it and how. But I didn't know some of this stuff so that's pretty neat

       Not only did they orchestrate it, they made a TV miniseries about it, which aired on Fox of all places in 2000, before actually carrying it out.  The series was appropriately titled "The Lone Gunmen".   They didn't need any pilots or highjackers to be in on it because the planes were remote controlled from the ground.

       Mythbusters can do it with a car, they did it as an experiment in WW II (and obviously the technology has advanced since then). It's not out of the question.

      <p>
       They knew it was going to happen and exploited that fact and expanded the scope to allow for full demolition of the buildings, evacuation of gold from the vaults, execution for certain individuals in certain positions in offices in the strike zones, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow the money...  They took a small scale terrorist plot, likely hatched by the CIA/FBI, like we're hearing all the time now, and they blew it up into a full scale militarized action with so many avenues of profit, it's sickening.  Very likely, portions of the operation were handed off to Mossad.

       I doubt it. Whether the Israeli government of the time was involved or not, it would have been roped into the scheme with lies and manipulation of whatever sort, so that they could then make them look guilty - another "blame the Jews" scenario so that they would have less credibility in the future.

       Regardless of how, follow the money and you've got a big fat conflict of interest regardless - one that should have been prosecuted as high treason and been punishable by execution by firing squad. Or is it irregardless?

       The "dancing Jews" Mossad agents and the phony moving company traced back to Israeli ownership is where I tie Israel into the plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's impossible to know to what extent their involvement could have been, but having the foreknowledge to be there to film the event (allegedly) and rejoice in a little victory dance atop their van implicates them to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arrested... Released... Deported... Never heard from again.  Mossad had a hand in there somewhere, to be sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard theories that there were explosives in their van and it was their job to demolish the bridge closest to ground zero, but they got spotted and reported as suspicious looking characters and picked up by the cops.

       Have you considered that perhaps it's a Media ploy to demonize the Jews?

       Those could be fake Mossad agents. Mossad isn't a "get up and dance on our conspicuous van" agency, it's an elite cloak and dagger secret agency.

       Perhaps you should do the bare minimum of research into Mossad.

       So now the US media is plotting to demonize Jews?  Seriously?
      </p>
      <p>
       The aftermath of 9/11 saw the achievement of most of Israel's goals in the Middle East, rampant Federal Reserve money-printing, and the Mossad-backed Northern Alliance taking over Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more complicated than just "they let it happen".  Someone put references to 9/11 in television shows and on Federal Reserve Notes.  Someone demolished WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all evidence points to 9/11 being orchestrated by a group of megalomaniacal, neo-conservative Zionists.  It's much more likely that they would get caught celebrating on top of their ironically-painted van, than secretly try to demonize Jews and then cover it all up afterwards.

       Gonna go with "freemasons," but they don't deserve such an honorable title. I prefer "brickstackers," because with their IQ that's all they're good for - stacking bricks.

      <p>
       And yes, I think that the US media, now having spilled over onto the internets, is trying to gradually make Israel and Jews and Muslims and Christians and anyone else who goes against their Satanic regime look bad, and weaken them.

       Oh really? Like what? A continuing conflict with the Palestinians and a civil war that America can poke its filthy hands into on its doorstep and then blame on them? Those goals?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about the references - Lone Gunmen had an episode with a plot almost exactly like 9/11 . It's called "normalization" - make the absurd seem just a normal part of life. "Just drop it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless Zionists are co-opted by brickstacking fucks, then it would make no sense for Israel to make more enemies than it already had at the time.

      <p>
       Just like it makes no sense today for Syria to be making an enemy of Turkey.
