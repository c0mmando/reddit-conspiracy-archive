<p>It comes down to, we have to get him out. If we can&#39;t, the march <strong>MUST GO ON</strong>. This is insulting and clear as day they are wrongfully imprisoning him and we have the right and duty to call them on that - on grounds they havr now jeapordized the trust between our government and us.</p>

Without the full support of citizens, firing the first shots will only serve to hurt our cause. The media knows exactly how to spin this against us. It sucks, but for now that&#39;s the messed up reality of what our situation is :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Kokesh would want us to utilize maximum restraint in this situation. The whole reason he organized the armed march was to goad the <em>executive branch</em> into firing the first shot. If they do, we win. If we do, we lose. It&#39;s as simple as that. </p>

<p>If even one civillian in a peaceful march gets gunned down by some overzealous and trigger-happy law enforcer, the whole country will errupt in revolt. </p>

<p>Frankly, I&#39;m glad this happened. It is a wonderful advertisement for the armed march and indeed a very obvious attempt at supression by the government. They&#39;re playing right into our hands. </p>

<p>Stay vigilant people! Be smart!</p>

<p>Im sorry to say it, but most of the citizens of this country are never going to be on board with any kind of armed insurrection, at least not until it is way too late. I used to think that when things get bad enough there would be an uprising, but now it is clear that the propaganda is strong enough that we&#39;ll be living in a totalitarian state no better than russia before people realize something has gone wrong. and by then we&#39;ll be screwed.</p>

<p>Im not saying this is a good time to act. Im not urging any one to be fool-hardy. Weinhimer is right, that it probably would do more harm than good. But this may mean that we dont have any way out of this at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got you, player. Sorry those folks didnt have a minute to share their opinion, maybe they are busy too or something. I personally like Adam a lot, he&#39;s a friendly guy if you ever get to run into him and he has a strong philosophy politically. He is definitely someone I really respect for taking daring and constructive positions on things and the fact that he works to mobilize people. I don&#39;t agree with all of his positions, but I&#39;m glad he&#39;s out there speaking for change. I would recommend watching some of his videos, even the short ones, to get a better idea of his libertarian/volunteerism/anarcho-capitalist beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complainants&#39; statement of facts constituting the offense or violation</p>

<p>On or about May 18, 2013, defendent ADAM KOKESH forcibly assaulted, resisted, opposed, impeded and interfered with officers and employees of the United States, that is, uniformed National Park Service Rangers while they were engaged in, and on account of, the performance of official duties, in violation of <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC00111.html">Title 18, United State Code, Section 111</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>During the event, defendent ADAM KOKESH was addressing the group over a loud speaker system just after RICHARD TAMACCIO, charged elseware, urged over the loud speaker those present to smoke marijuana and announced a &quot;countdown&quot; to when participants should light their marijuana. The crowd was also urged over the loud speaker to form a tight circle to hinder law enforcement officers.</p></li>
<li><p>National Park Service Rangers approached the members of the crowd who were seen in possession of what appeared to be marijuana cigarettes. KOKESH was next to and had locked arms with a person who had a marijuana cigarette. As the Ranger approached the person with the cigarette, KOKESH physcially blocked and obstructed the Ranger. As the Ranger pushed forward, KOKESH grabbed the Ranger by the arm to hold him back. KOKESH was then taken into custody.</p></li>
<li><p>The cigarette that the Ranger was attempting to recover was alter seized by other Rangers and the contents were later tested and determined to be marijuana. </p></li>
<li><p>Based on the above, I believe that probable cause exists to charge defendent KOKESH with violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 111.</p></li>
<li><p>Donald Reed National Park Service</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some videos of the arrest.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=bhUokieDlNQ#t=27s">Front view</a>; clearly shows Kokesh did not grab arm of Ranger as Donald Reed described in the letter</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=NNOnooHSwug#t=25s">Back view</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The most I could see is Kokesh was indeed locked arms with the other protester but that was it. Kokesh didn&#39;t swat at or make any kind of combative motion towards the policemen in any way. He was impeding an arrest but also wasn&#39;t blocking the police from moving. Anything more than that simply is not true, based on the several videos showing the incident.</p>

<p>The officer is facing the side of the bald gentleman he is attempting to arrest. </p>

<p>In this video right as Kokesh says &quot;we&#39;re going to make it difficult for the police here&quot; his left hand/arm attempts to block the officer. The officer is pushed back into the women who says, &quot;Ouch.... on my foot!&quot; About this time you see Kokesh&#39;s left arm get flung back as the officer removed it from blocking/holding him. They then move into arrest him while he squeals about being assaulted.</p>

<p>The videos you link is after he says that and the cameras weren&#39;t pointed that way. What the officers have deemed as &quot;assaulted, resisted, opposed, impeded and interfered with&quot; has already occurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. It&#39;s a federal offense. A felony assault? Held without bail?</p>

<p>There are people, every damn day, in this country who nearly kill their family members by beating them so badly. They&#39;re released on about 5K bail within hours to go right home and start all over. It happens thousands of times, every day. </p>

<p>So, let&#39;s say Adam made it difficult for police to comb through dozens of other people actually committing crimes in order to arrest him, who was (maybe) committing a crime. Is his treatment warranted? Is it legal? Is it just?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few things to keep in mind...</p>

<p>First, the officers made a b-line to Kokesh.  There is no doubt that they wanted him, and went straight for him.  They had no probable cause, they simply went straight to him and proceeded to assault him.</p>

<p>Second, at no time did an officer see him commit a crime.  He was not smoking pot, nor did he have anything on him.  At no time did he resist arrest.  How is one charged with &quot;resisting arrest&quot; and that be the only charge?  What was he being arrested for in the first place?</p>

<p>Finally, why was he placed in federal custody?  How is it that he has not been given the ability to contact anyone, or have a lawyer?  </p>

<p>This is cut and dry.  Kokesh was arrested because of his upcoming March on Washington.  He was kidnapped, and falsely arrested and charged in an attempt to prevent him from moving forward.  </p>

<p>This will cause the number of people attending this march to SWELL, having seen tyranny first hand, I can promise you this will not stand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One could make the argument that he was arrested for &quot;encouraging others to break the law&quot;....I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s an actual law, but this could not be viewed as &quot;inciting a riot&quot;, since this was simply a countdown to lighting up...not asking people to get violent.  With that said, shouldn&#39;t everyone who lite up be arrested?  From what I read, yes a few, but not all were arrested....but, those people went to a local jail and were released without bail (charged with a misdemeanor).</p>

<p>However, Adam was NOT charge for inciting a riot, or &quot;encouraging others to break the law&quot; (still not sure if that&#39;s actually a crime).  He was charged with &quot;resisting arrest&quot; and &quot;failing to process&quot;.  If you read  the paperwork (I think there is a link to it somewhere), there is mention of the activities, but the CHARGES are only listed as resisting and failure to process.  So, one has to ask &quot;how can resisting arrest be the main charge&quot;? Isn&#39;t that like putting the cart before the horse?  What exactly did he do (the reason for his arrest in the first place) that enable him to &quot;resist&quot; it?  </p>

<p>I hope you get my logic, cause it&#39;s pretty hard to be charged for resisting an arrest, when the reason for the arrest doesn&#39;t show up as a charge.</p>

<p>For example...</p>

<p>I break a window in plain view of a police officer.  I am arrested for breaking the window, but resist my arrest.....therefore, I have 2 charges....one, willful destruction of property, and resisting arrest.  Now, lets say I&#39;m just standing there minding my own business and a police officer says &quot;you&#39;re under arrest&quot; and I say &quot;why&quot;, but then he grabs me and I resist...have I broken the law?</p>

<p>Clearly, Adam was not resisting arrest (as the video clearly shows).  So, what exactly did he do wrong?  Why is he in a federal jail, and why has he had no contact with the outside world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They took him Because he is a threat. You are right and everyone else is, they technically had no right to arrest him but they did because they can. We have no power against them and we are loosing power everyday. There are countless videos of people standing there ground and knowing there rights but they are still arrested, why because the police are inferior to us and can do anything they want. Until we get the rights back from our constitution they will just keep arresting us to keep us quite as they grow there army bigger and bigger, we will get weaker and weaker. </p>

I could see that maybe being considered assault. I don&#39;t know what direct participation Kokesh had in it, but he certainly seemed to be encouraging it at least, which is enough for a conspiracy charge...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although a participant, Adam was not the organizer.  This still doesn&#39;t explain how he was charged with &quot;resisting arrest&quot; and &quot;failure to process&quot;.  What was the charge he was resisting?  In other words, if he was going to be arrested for something, but resisted, what was he resisting? </p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t explain why he was singled out, and booked into a &quot;federal&quot; jail, and not just a local one.  Out of all the arrests, he was the only one who did not simply go to a local jail and release after a promise to appear.</p>

<p>You can argue that what he did was enough for a conspiracy charge, but the police or &quot;feds&quot; disagree with you...since this is not part of the charge.</p>

<p>Now they almost have no choice but to hold him till after July 4 because of all the media coverage, but on what legal grounds? What prosecutor is going to pursue these fake charges? </p>

<p>None of this adds up. Is Obama trying to start an all out rebellion?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the only thing I can figure. This falls directly in line with the Sandy Hook shootings, that they have used to further the gun control agenda. There are videos on YouTube of Congressional members asking why DHS needs to purchase so much ammo, and the answer they provide is &quot;there is lead time on making it, and we don&#39;t know&quot;.</p>

<p>Kokesh is a divisive figure, pushing the 2nd amendment agenda but also being on infowars.com, which a lot of people feel is controversial. Here he is on a major stage, pushing marijuana reform in an &quot;illegal&quot; manner, so a lot of people will argue against that, whilst a number of people completely agree with it, considering the recent legalization efforts in Washington, Colorado, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The easiest way to defeat a populous is to divide and conquer. Some people learn from history, others ignore history and are doomed to repeat it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, people are poorly informed on what constitutes assault. All you have to do is make someone feel like they are facing an imminent threat. You don&#39;t even have to lay a finger on them. </p>

<p>That being said, and having watched the video, he most certainly did NOT assault anyone, or even resist arrest in any way. It&#39;s all obviously trumped up because of the march he&#39;s organizing. But the executive branch has failed here. All they&#39;re doing is giving the march free publicity, and making obvious their deperation to stop the public from overthrowing them. </p>
