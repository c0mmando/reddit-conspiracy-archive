<p>I mean in theory it sounds great, but it also sounds like a free anarchy hybrid. It wouldnt really work out. And as a force 100k large, it seems that if they were going to get any legit backing and support for that life style, they would have by now...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Sovereign, the system was inherently made to service you, the citizen of the land. As you are now, you are merely a corporation and the police are there to shake you down and collect the debt you signed into oweing the corporation known as the &#39;United States Of America, Inc.&#39;, when your mother signed your STRAWMAN into being with the &#39;Birth Certificate&#39;. Roads are merely an obstacle of which a Sovereign may travel but not &#39;drive.&#39; &#39;Parks&#39; as you know them are just land that has been prettied up; its land, its natural, and you&#39;re free to go there if you are so inclined. You don&#39;t need the DMV, as a Sovereign doesn&#39;t require a license to travel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used quotations because those things are figments of the imagination made up by the owning corporations. Driving is merely traveling with a LICENSE (licenses and permits are another way the main corporation U.S.A., Inc. keep you documented and taxed). And yes, Sovereign humans may go wherever they please at any time. They stop me at least once a day, but I haven&#39;t gotten a ticket yet.But think about it for a second, why do you need a driver&#39;s license? Because the government says so? As a Sovereign you do not fall under the jurisdiction of the &#39;government&#39; that works off of the Uniform Commercial Code. The weird reality is that the UCC only applies to your STRAWMAN and other CORPORATIONS. People just assume it applies to their living being, which it does not. As a Sovereign you are bound by only Common Law.

    <div class="md"><p>I have traveled in an automobile, and on paved roads. I hate paying sales tax. Its just easier to pay a minor sales tax than to prove Sovereignty to numerous corporations and take them to court for every minor purchase. No, you are not subject to the IRS as a Sovereign. And I think it may help here to put on the record that I am NOT the ultimate source of knowledge on this subject, but I DO know enough to get by. The whole process of becoming and maintaining Sovereignty is a long and arduous one, and I am still being mentored and taught every day. Please, if you wish to know more, do your homework.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to be honest, this whole idea seems silly. </p>

<p>A birth certificate isn&#39;t a contract. It&#39;s just a record of your coming into this earth. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t call is (with quotations no less) the &quot;United States of America Inc.&quot; because it&#39;s not a corporation. That&#39;s a weird concept. </p>

<p>The US doesn&#39;t need your consent to impose the law upon you. By existing within these borders you follow their rules. And those rules aren&#39;t some commercial code, they&#39;re the god damn law that we&#39;re all subject to. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t get to choose whether or not you are subject to the law. You&#39;ve seen the video of your kin being tased at the courthouse, right? That&#39;s what happens when you take your bizarre ideas to court. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t sovereign when they leave their reservations. Shit, they aren&#39;t even that sovereign on their reservations. You can&#39;t legalize murder on an indian reservation for instance.

<p>And the justice system is flawed, sure, but that doesn&#39;t mean the law doesn&#39;t apply to anyone if they don&#39;t want it to. There will always be injustice and unfair treatment under the law, but we can strive to to our best to make it work for us.
