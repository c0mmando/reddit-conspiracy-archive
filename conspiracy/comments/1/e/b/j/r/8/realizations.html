       I used to think that there was a 'New World Order' coming, and I thought it was going to be horrific. So I start researching what I thought I was afraid of. Then I came across this

        video
       </a>
       (please watch!). This video outlines and explains the basis on which we all are imprisoned, and how to solve it. Please help this get to the front page, as it is vital that as many people as possible watch this video, so that we as individuals can regain our humanity and not be corporate fictions for the rest of our natural lives.

       I agree with it's primise.  I have seen this info elsewhere in a better format but I can't find it.  This video was poorly put together and it looks like sections were edited out. Also the "consent" section is in there twice with the same footage/clips.

And yes, the video is poorly produced but I can't find the info anywhere else either. I do apologize for that. It is the best I can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I do believe this information is of poor quality because of how many times it has had to have been re-made over and over after it being hidden or erased fully by the 'powers.'

       I mean in theory it sounds great, but it also sounds like a free anarchy hybrid. It wouldnt really work out. And as a force 100k large, it seems that if they were going to get any legit backing and support for that life style, they would have by now...

       As a Sovereign, the system was inherently made to service you, the citizen of the land. As you are now, you are merely a corporation and the police are there to shake you down and collect the debt you signed into oweing the corporation known as the 'United States Of America, Inc.', when your mother signed your STRAWMAN into being with the 'Birth Certificate'. Roads are merely an obstacle of which a Sovereign may travel but not 'drive.' 'Parks' as you know them are just land that has been prettied up; its land, its natural, and you're free to go there if you are so inclined. You don't need the DMV, as a Sovereign doesn't require a license to travel.

       Why do you put quotations around words like "drive" and "parks?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think anyone can go on any land at any time? Do you recognize private ownership of land at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you plan on dealing with police if you drive without a license? Regardless of your opinion, they will police traffic on any road inside their territory, and mandate conditions for driving privileges. Have you been ticketed or arrested?

       I used quotations because those things are figments of the imagination made up by the owning corporations. Driving is merely traveling with a LICENSE (licenses and permits are another way the main corporation U.S.A., Inc. keep you documented and taxed). And yes, Sovereign humans may go wherever they please at any time. They stop me at least once a day, but I haven't gotten a ticket yet.But think about it for a second, why do you need a driver's license? Because the government says so? As a Sovereign you do not fall under the jurisdiction of the 'government' that works off of the Uniform Commercial Code. The weird reality is that the UCC only applies to your STRAWMAN and other CORPORATIONS. People just assume it applies to their living being, which it does not. As a Sovereign you are bound by only Common Law. Assuming you HAVE watched the video and have a bit of a basic understanding, try

       But the government doesn't recognize any of these concepts you're talking about here. How is it that you've been stopped numerous times driving inside the borders of a state and haven't been ticketed? Like I was saying, regardless of how you see things, they see you as inside their jurisdiction.

       I have traveled in an automobile, and on paved roads. I hate paying sales tax. Its just easier to pay a minor sales tax than to prove Sovereignty to numerous corporations and take them to court for every minor purchase. No, you are not subject to the IRS as a Sovereign. And I think it may help here to put on the record that I am NOT the ultimate source of knowledge on this subject, but I DO know enough to get by. The whole process of becoming and maintaining Sovereignty is a long and arduous one, and I am still being mentored and taught every day. Please, if you wish to know more, do your homework.

       Well, to be honest, this whole idea seems silly.

       A birth certificate isn't a contract. It's just a record of your coming into this earth.

       You can't call is (with quotations no less) the "United States of America Inc." because it's not a corporation. That's a weird concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US doesn't need your consent to impose the law upon you. By existing within these borders you follow their rules. And those rules aren't some commercial code, they're the god damn law that we're all subject to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't get to choose whether or not you are subject to the law. You've seen the video of your kin being tased at the courthouse, right? That's what happens when you take your bizarre ideas to court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with this, man. I can't wait to see what happens when you get pulled over for driving without a license and try this shit, Please make sure to record it.

       You have been brainwashed well. Ask yourself this, what about the Native Americans? They have Sovereignty as a WHOLE, which is recognized by the color of law. They don't need licensing. They don't pay taxes. And if 'we're all subject to' the "law", why are criminal bankers and corrupt politicians still breathing free air and not the stuffy kind found in jail cells? Good day sir.

       Glancing through your post history- You're a former Marine who smokes a ton of weed to deal with your paranoia and anxiety. This Soverign thing sounds like a paranoid delusion to me. Get help, man. Stop self-medicating. Talk to a psychiatrist or psychologist. Don't get fucked by the long dick of the law by trying to pull some legal trick on them.

       No, I realized a lot of corruption around me while being a marine. Which is why I now question everything. I self medicate because I'd rather smoke something natural than take the millions of pills prescribed that don't work.

       Well, sometimes pills do work. And you don't have to take pills. Just talking to a specialist would probably help a lot in dealing with the paranoia and anxiety.

       Thanks, Doctor. As a matter of fact the anxiety did stop once I felt like I was in control over my life again. And it did help me to open my eyes to things around me. If we all didn't have a little bit of paranoia, would anyone care to investigate 9/11? What about the current attempts to deny the holocaust?

       They aren't sovereign when they leave their reservations. Shit, they aren't even that sovereign on their reservations. You can't legalize murder on an indian reservation for instance. And these reservations are special privileges we've given them to feel better about destroying their societies and occupying land that was previously theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the justice system is flawed, sure, but that doesn't mean the law doesn't apply to anyone if they don't want it to. There will always be injustice and unfair treatment under the law, but we can strive to to our best to make it work for us. You can't say that because some shitty people weren't prosecuted that you don't have to obey the law.

       It doesn't seem to be working, since you've fallen under the sway of a very unusual interpretation of the law, one that doesn't seem to be based on reasonable premises. Most people would be unconvinced by the arguments you've presented here in favor of this concept. It's probably significant in that it's a philosophy where you are constantly under attack by the government, who are trying to force you into debt slavery or some shit. It's a paranoid delusion, dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many lawyers do you think are a part of this movement? Is there any judicial precedent for your interpretation of the law?

       I'm not sure. I'll let you know if I find out. Like I said, I am a novice. I will continue to explore this and see how it helps or doesn't. All I said is that it helped me out and I thought others should know, maybe it could help them too.

       Well that's a hopeful sign then. I think you should take a closer look at this Sovereign movement, and maybe look at some of the counter-arguments to it. You don't get new info from an echo-chamber.
