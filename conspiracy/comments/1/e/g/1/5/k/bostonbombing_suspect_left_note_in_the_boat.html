       Bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds (which he didn't get till they found him in the boat), finds a pen but no paper, writes a fucking book on fiberglass gel coat
       <em>
        with a pen
       </em>
       , providing JUST the evidence they needed to solidify his involvement.

      <p>
       Do me a favor-Throw a pen in your pocket, go write on boat...see how long that lasts. I bet that surface is too smooth for a ball point pen to operate more than may a word or two. Of course, then they'll just say "It was a QUILL PEN! The boat owners wrote poetry on scrolls while pulling tubers in the harbor!"

       I'm not sure if that is conflicting information or just the FBI agent being lazy in how he described the writing instrument. I have seen markers referred to as pens, it isn't accurate, but it isn't very damning.

       How does he know his brother is dead at the time he allegedly writes this note. He saw him injured I presume,but reports say Tamerlan died in hospital, not on the scene... explain? Oh wait I forgot , Islam automatically bestows its followers with the gift of pre-cognition.

       He supposedly ran him over, so it'd be a pretty fair assumption. He was either caught or dead, so not that much different.

       Definitely not a fair assumption. People do survive being run over, myself being one of these people (assuming he did in fact run him over). The tone of media reports imply a certainty in Dzhokhar's message that his brother was dead which just isn't feasible given the info available to him at the time, if we are to believe the official chronology. Additionally, being caught and dead are also definitely not interchangeable terms. In fact they couldn't be more different in the context of an event such as this. Some media sources refer to his message waxing lyrical about how "he would not "mourn" his brother for he is in heaven with Allah". Since when do you mourn someone's capture?

       I got the impression that the majority of people do not survive, but I could be wrong. Regardless, it is a fair number, and it would still be plausible for him assume that he killed him. Also, didn't the first brother supposedly have some sort of suicide vest?
      </p>
      <p>
       I meant that if he was captured he's still fairly screwed/might never see his brother again. I wasn't aware of anything that was in the message, you would right about that part.

       Majority survive, especially as he started off on the ground and there wasn't much time to pick up speed.  Adrenaline rush which would have been present also helps tremendously.  So actually his death is unlikely enough to be fishy in that scenario.

       I showed my father, a trauma surgeon, the photo of the dead body and he said that the massive amounts of purple bruising (contusion) and oedema in the chest and face are consistent with the crush injuries that one would sustain from being run over by a vehicle. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that injury was what killed Tamerlan.  I don't doubt he was run over, but the official cause of death focussed more on the gunshot wounds to chest and extremities if I recall.
       <br/>
       The content regarding crush injuries (blunt force trauma) seems to be included as a secondary exacerbating factor. The media allegations subsequently appear to have inflated the bit about being run over by a vehicle as an afterthought to fit their other reports. 
I'd be interested to see a copy of the death report to see the exact wording and priority given to each injury type. 
Based on what my father said, I don't doubt he was run over, but the question remains: by whom? (Eyewitness reports said a Police SUV hit him, others say the brother in the Merc... I suppose we will know, or be fed, more at a later date).

       This is hearsay.  Nobody has seen any evidence of this, but we have seen evidence excluding this possibility.   If I am to weigh the two, I go with Tamerlan in custody- gives himself up to save his brother, brother possibly escapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the police now say that the officer was shot with friendly fire and the boys were unarmed.  Where is the gun with his prints?   Where is the dashcam footage?  Where is the video of them placing the bags?  Where is any evidence that they killed MIT officer.   And Danny the carjacking victim?  What a load of bullshit that story sounds like.

       Regarding 'Danny': I  found it a bit odd how the shitrags like Daily Mail and New York Post could sleuth out and publish the full names of victims who asked to remain anonymous; of Tsarnaev's 3 YEAR OLD CHILD (the naming of whom is illegal btw); his wife; his extended family; HER extended family etc etc. Conversely, they have now dutifully respected the wish of 'Danny' to remain anonymous. Normally they'd have found out who he was and published pictures of him leaving the gym or buying a burger by now. How effing convenient.

       Yes I do. Don't get me wrong, he was there for some reason which wasn't good. But the way the FBI have been setting up terrorist attacks just to thwart them doesn't sit well with me.

       What's the odds of having a Saudi and a pair of Chechyan terrorists in the same place, same time when a bomb goes off?

       how do you reconcile this view with the fact that he is almost certainly going to plead guilty? or when the CCTV is released of him placing the bomb?
      </p>
      <p>
       or that people in the neighbourhood watched the shootout with police in which he was involved, next to the car that was hijacked (after his brother told the driver that they were the perpetrators of the bombing?)
      </p>
      <p>
       or when they found the exact same sort of bomb in the back of the car him and his brother had hijacked?
      </p>
      <p>
       or the fact the Russians (a 3rd party to this entire affair) had told the US Authorities about his brother being an extremist some time before?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all in favour of innocent until proven guilty etc. but this isn't a matter of that. This is a matter of people willfully ignoring the facts to suit their own agenda.

       proof of action doesn't demonstrate intent.  And a video of him putting down a bag(which nobody has seen but which official sources have been very clear exists) doesn't even prove action.

       How many people?  2?  They also had conflicting testimony about who ran over his brother.  According to this witness testimony tamerlan threw a pressure cooker at police who were over 100 feet away?  And how does one person shooting at 40 people who are trying to kill him prove that they did what they are accused of?  You know what would be good evidence here- if the gun Tamerlan supposedly owned and was shooting is proven to be the same gun which killed the MIT officer.  There is supposedly video there too.

      <p>
       The russians know the agency is in bed with the extremists over there.  You think this was a warning and not just the russians calling him out?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you reconcile these details and discrepancies:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Uncle Ruslan's intelligence connections
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <del>
          The Balkans
         </del>
         The Caucuses being an intelligence hotbed for the US
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There were no police wounded in either "shootout" except by friendly fire
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Tamerlan was able to travel as a non-citizen to and from russia, where he participated in a intelligence led "camp", even though he was on a terror watchlist (the FBI of course claims that he had to be legally taken of of this watchlist because they weren't able to find any evidence against him)  Supposedly there was an issue with his documents which is why they missed it?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And we can't forget historical context.  How do you reconcile the details of the 1993 wtc bombing?

        this never happened. There are eye witness accounts to the contrary. At the time there were conflicting statements because some poor bastard decided to rob a shop at a similar time or something. There is footage of the guy you are talking about actually handcuffed and on the floor, and he has subsequently been prosecuted for a seperate matter. This link is to eye witness video/pics and an account of someone who watched what happened.

       are you predicting the future now?  we would have seen this video as soon as FBI had it if it existed then.

       Awwww, I think it's cute how your self image is so bad that you resort to making feeble attempts at belittling random people on the internet for a quick pick-me-up. It's OK, this comment is buried so deep no one will ever know about your low self esteem. This will be our little secret, ok? Have an up vote.

       Same problem. Could just be a lazy way to describe a marker, or it was a felt tipped pen. This article did a better job quoting the video though.

       Actually, I carry sharpies all the time. I have one in my pocket now, not saying this is or isn't normal in general, but that is my situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had a boat, where one could probably see the sense of having a waterproof writing utensil around, there would probably be some sharpies handy on that too. This is actually where I figure he got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, at least judging by all the gas station bathroom "art" I see around where I live, quite a few people of his age group appear to have them at hand frequently as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could think of lots of simple reasons how he would have had one handy, my main point is his ability to have a way to write or not is not exactly a solid piece of information to pin a conspiracy on.

       This was brought out because of the huge social media viral awakening,  which has now reached 30k followers (8k more the day they come out with this unbelievable moronic statement.   If this note was really there then went on earth didn't they say that in the 72 hours it took for him TO WRITE a confession to the FBI?  He couldn't talk so he wrote it on paper to the FBI, and now conveniently when people are really starting to question if he is innocent?  Doesn't bother anyone that this COULD HAVE BEEN YOU OR ME?   Why is nobody asking why the backpack doesn't match the picture they released?   What about the car jacked victim,  why has he not come out and identified himself?  He's the hero in the whole story (had he not have escaped. ... I mean released. . Anyone know how the official story reads now? ) who called the police and gave them information on what vehicle they drove in,  and there wereabouts that night,  oh and that they confessed to him they had killed the cop at MIT too, AND THEM THEY LET HIM GO?   These are RUTHLESS jihadists we're dealing with that couldn't wait to get to heaven and meet his brother in Paradise with virgins waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had he really have been a radical jihadist who hated America, DO YOU REALLY THINK HE WOULD HIDE AND COWER IN A BOAT?   Remember you only get virgins and meet your bro IF YOU DIE!   Obviously he didn't want to die,  and he believed enough in America to give himself up after being shot at 30 plus times in the boat,  to have his day in court. Or so he thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why is the MSM so willing to report this news (broken by a single CBS news reporter based on anonymous sources,  but they aren't even willing to question why there were Craft mercenaries at the finish line which there IS ACTUAL PROOF OF in pictures?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is if a terrorist who is on 2 watch lists,  one from FBO, one from CIA, is able to fly to Russia and receive terrorist training,  and build up a small Arsenal of guns,  grenades,  and bombs,  then how are gun laws going to keep us safer?

       These other scandals are just cover for taking heat of Boston case.

       lol so true..  So much blood.. my friend was shot in the leg and in the matter of 20 minutes on the way to the ER the floorboards on his side of my car were flooded with an inch deep of blood that coagulated to a jelly sheet by the time i got to the car wash about an hour or two later.

       No way he was bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds.  But of course you know that.

       There is no reason to release every bit of evidence found to the public. The expectation that every juicy fact will be revealed immediately in hd video is only a recent one, since the internet.

       It was mentioned almost immediately after it was just not one of the main talking points. I thought it was bullshit right off the bat. I remember hearing he was writing shit about "Allah" and stuff like that. I still think it didn't happen but I will say that it was mentioned maybe like a day after the capture.

       It's really weird. A day after they caught him on the boat my father was telling me about written messages they found that he wrote on the boat. I asked him today after I saw it all over the news and he thought it was weird too. I have tried looking for articles on it from weeks ago and I cannot find anything. I know he listens to a lot of talk radio and has a lot of friends in military/police so maybe he heard it from one of those sources. I will still try to find an older article. This is really weird.

       No. Why should it be. They just can't release evidence to the public for no reason. That is what the courts are for. Otherwise it would be almost impossible to get an impartial jury

       I don't know why release anything? Probably because people were bitching about "evidence" not being released. What do you guys want? If they release evidence it is "convenient" and "fabricated. If they don't release it than they "are trying to hide something"

       I think it's going to be pretty hard to find an impartial jury. I'm far away in London and I've still had my judgement clouded one way or another by media press and social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also.. I'm just surprised the message wasn't mentioned. I don't expect copious photographic documentation of Dzhokar's every move, as I agree that is for the court trial. Comparing this case with the information coming from the Cleveland trial, shows just how little information has been given out (that wasn't later changed in some way) regarding the Boston bombings.

       I just feel that since 'they caught the bad guy', they will want to 'give him what he deserves' which in their mind doesn't include a fair trial. Regardless of the amount of evidence against him, I don't think anybody close to this situation would allow for him to make a legitimate defense during trial. They wouldn't want anything else come out that goes against the narrative that's been fed to us.

       Also, the government involvement in previous attempted terrorist attacks (those that you read about "FBI foils terror plot" in reality the FBI is also involved in many of these, providing equipment and/or coercing people) as well as terrorist attacks that were allowed to happen on U.S. soil.

       The media can do whatever the hell they want. The media [and reddit] was very careless in the reporting of things after the bombings. People seem to forget they have no right to see any evidence. The evidence is for the courts. Now you are saying the letter is fake?

       "Bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds" -- what!?

      <p>
       Let's review the official stories. First he had a gun and was involved in a firefight with the police. He tried to commit suicide by shooting himself in the throat. Then he didn't have a gun and actually
       <em>
        stabbed
       </em>
       himself in the throat. To now "bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds"...

       Don't forget, he couldn't speak because of the throat wound, but he reportedly swears profusely inside the ambulance on the way to the hospital.

        The neck wound apparently did not initially silence Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, who was swearing profusely in the ambulance ride after his final confrontation with the FBI, according to a source familiar with the case.

       Yes, it was allegedly given before his Miranda rights were read, so it's inadmissible in court.  My hunch is that's exactly why they're trumping up this "note" in the boat story.  It'd be funny if the kid ends up denying there was any note ever written.

       No trial if there is a plea deal (he would need to plead guilty) and if the grand jury find the prosecution does not have enough evidence then there will be no trial - there is a grand jury happening sometime soon - just has not been reported in media but people are being subpoenaed to testify. This is behind closed doors I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope he pleads not guilty - makes them show their proof in court and then lets see how many of these 'official ' govt admissions are admissible in court.

       That guy said now he has already testified - yesterday I think- so probably explains the timing for note on the boat being released to media - the critical piece of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This just shows they don't have any decent PROOF. This would be hilarious if there wasn't a 19 yr old boy in solitary confinement right now facing the death penalty who nearly the whole of America wants to kill. It's a complete tragedy - I can't get over it.

       I'm willing to bet this is a bullshit motive made up in order to hide the real motive. The Feds always hide a home-grown terrorists motives. It's probably because they don't want to publicly state Americans are getting pissed off at their Government.

       FWIW...He was likely in the boat for HOURS before the shootout and before it got dark, so he would have had plenty of time to write his "confession".
      </p>
      <p>
       The initial shootout with police and the two brothers happened in the early hours of Friday, April 19th.
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/01/justice/boston-marathon-timeline">
        Source
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout that entire day, police searched the area.  It wasn't until around 6 PM Friday evening that the homeowner found Dzhokhar hiding in the boat.  He would have had ALL DAY to hide in that boat and write whatever note was allegedly found.  Even under a tarp, there would have been adequate light to see what he was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I think the boat confession is bullshit.  It conveniently negates any legal issues with his pre-Miranda confession in the hospital.  I'm only pointing out the timeline to argue against what some have said about it being too dark in the boat for him to see.  He'd been in there nearly all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only logical move now would be for Dzhokhar to die in the hospital.  This will finally tie up all the loose ends and the MSM can focus on the bravery and heroic spirit of the survivors.  Perhaps a few sound bites from amputees calling for more cameras on the streets or a greater police presence at large outdoor events.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is a blood clot from his massive injuries will travel to his brain, causing a stroke.

       No, he doesn't have to die in hospital.  He can plead out and spend the rest of his days in an institution, being medicated.   He won't have contact with the outside world, and even if he did, he's made a plea.

       BULLSHIT!  First, we are to believe that he confessed by "nodding his head" (cause he couldn't speak), but he demanded a lawyer and stopped nodding after he was told his Miranda rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, weeks later, out of no where...they FIND his confession on the inside of the boat?  Nobody noticed it till now?  Did the FBI find it weeks ago but decided to sit on the information, or did they just find it now because they forgot to examine the crime scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Don't worry, before long they will change the story once again from "he found a pen" to "he found a sharpie".  Hell, they might even say he found clipboard with his personalized stationary with his name clearly embossed on the header.

       I'm confused by the part of the report that claims he referred, in writing, to his brother's death and predicted subsequent martyrdom. How the fuck would he have known at that point that his brother was dead? He saw him injured I presume, but reports say Tamerlan died in hospital (or on the way to hospital?) after failed attempts to treat him... explain? Either way, if the official story is to be believed, Dzhokhar would have been long gone from the scene at the time of his brother's death. Oh wait I forgot Islam automatically bestows its followers with the gift of pre-cognition.

       Hey, every time I'm wounded and on the run I write incriminating notes only with the very best writing instruments. I don't use a cheap crappy Bic, I use a $500 gold Cross fountain pen to write essays denouncing the capitalist pigs. Also write on 200-year old parchment because it photographs beautifully.  These kids these days and their boats.

       Why wouldn't he send a text message or try to call someone?  Maybe his phone battery died?  Maybe he figured he was being hunted and couldn't use the phone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Best guess I have is that he was already in custody.  That's why he didn't phone anyone to take responsibility.   The whole boat thing was just for show - the manhunt had to make precedent using the military to search house to house.  And they cheered.  Boston, you pussies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what is the point of a terrorist act if the fucking terrorists aren't claiming responsibility?  I guess this is the reason for producing a 'note'.. such bullshit.   I'm ashamed at Americans that buy this crap.

       That's why this is classic conspiracy train of thought. This is absolute solid evidence confessing to something they think is fabricated. They then go full bore saying it supports them more then almost anything else. It's what you have to do when you are clearly being proved wrong, double down and claim to still be right.

       The police and media are presenting a conspiracy theory of two brothers, masterminding this plot.  Their story does not stand up to scrutiny.  They are the conspiracy theorists and we are debunking it.   It practically debunks itself.
