       They have the capability, in theory at least, to access all websites. Can't use any of it in court without a warrant though, thankfully.

       Thanks to ndaa they can bypass court all together. Also, the justice department allowed warrants for every single request last year. So it's not much consolation.

       NDAA would only be involved if it was believed to be some urgent national security matter. Despite however arbitrarily defined such a thing may be, it's safe to say that the majority of people are safe from it. Now, on the other hand, people could unknowingly be subject to their data being seized/examined under CFAA/ACTA.

       oh for sure, you know because reddit asks you for so much personal info -.- i find some of these conspiracy theorists on this site look waaay to much into things. how can you live a good life thibnking that everything is a conspiracy? i mean yea, 9/11 and the federal reserve and the jfk shooting are all legit theories and have alot of evidence. but to say reddit is gathering your information, i think thats coming from a very paranoid person. reddit is a place of free speech. if it was controlled by the gov, dont you think there would be a lot less posts on

       Except nobody on Reddit gives away personal information and aside from the fact that most of the content is jokes, half of it is just reposts from older reddit or other websites. There would be no reason to gather intelligence on over 2 million users, and if the government had a problem with one or two of them users, it would be a lesser waste of time to just question them individually. We're not super hackers, this is just a newsboard at the end of the day.

       So, I dont understand why a government looking out for social trends and mindset would be called "Intelligent gathering". I think the implication from the question that its some sort of conspiracy. We all know the government is a for-profit business, and doesnt every business do this, isnt it just market research at the end of the day? Theyre quite open about this type of thing.
      </p>

       Your last sentence implies that Im some sort of under cover information gathering operative. I assure you I wouldnt be on a thread hundreds of pages down, when theres probably only OP and you reading this, if my objective was to gain peoples personal deets. I think you might need to get outside some more.

       I don't see what your obsession is with people trying to get personal information. Gathering intelligence is actually what it means; reconnaissance is not confined to the CSI-esque finding out who people are.

       Correct. The part where it gets into conspiracy territory is what they're "selling". Although, I'm not sure what you mean by "quite open about this type of thing" in the context.

       I said "for all I know", I never implied anything more than a possibility. Surely if you're on r/conspiracy then you're aware of the concept of shills(which is not necessarily the hardcore undercover agent idea you put forth).

       If you're not even going to permit me to be suspicious, then there's little point in talking to you. Making such a big deal out of it makes it only seem more dubious.

       I'm not going to just take your word for it, and there's no reason to. You keep failing to even acknowledge this part, and keep going on the defensive, when I'm not actually making any accusations. There is nothing in your history that particularly stands out, but using that as  absolute evidence is to assume that shills are incompetent.

       Okay then, let me address everything you've just mentioned, seeing as you've accused me of being on the defensive. In actual fact I was just trying to back out of this conversation because you seem a bit deluded to me but anyway...

      <p>
       first of all, the grammar in this sentence makes it hard for me to understand the point you're making. secondly, i havent said anything about stalking. what i'm simply saying is that gathering intelligence on social trends, moods, opinions means jack shit if you dont know what demographic this "intelligence" is coming from. eg, whats the point in finding out people bought more cucumbers this week than last week. you need to know who bought them, why and where in order to make a profit, thats where privacy laws are broken in order to obtain these personal details. seeing as reddit doesnt have any of this information, intelligence gathering on here can be summarised as nothing more than social marketing and trend watching. thats not stalking.

       Im not sure which part you're referring to that I havent acknowledged. I think Ive been very open about my opinions, they just differ from yours, Maybe instead of "acknowledge" you should have said "agree with". What you term as "defensive" is actually just me disagreeing with what you're saying. If I were a shill, I would indeed be extremely incompetent at it, when I'll I've done so far is give lame advice at 3am and posted far too much in

       I havent heard of these things, but I can still assure you theyre not interested in this thread. Reddit is one of the most popular sites on the internet and because of that theres about two thousand posts above this one of which maybe one might make it to the front page tomorrow. They dont give a shit about the little guys with no voice like us.

       incorrect, the central bank that controls the "government" has the final say....all that matters is that you fear the government, and percieve them as the ones in charge....that way you direct all focus on the "decoy" and never pay too much attention to the ones who steer the ship....those who have been granted the rights to create currency...the only way you will win is to stop using their money
