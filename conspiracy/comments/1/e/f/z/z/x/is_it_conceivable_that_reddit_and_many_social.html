<p>I don&#39;t see what your obsession is with people trying to get personal information. Gathering intelligence is actually what it means; reconnaissance is not confined to the CSI-esque finding out who people are.</p>

<p>Correct. The part where it gets into conspiracy territory is what they&#39;re &quot;selling&quot;. Although, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;quite open about this type of thing&quot; in the context.</p>

<p>I said &quot;for all I know&quot;, I never implied anything more than a possibility. Surely if you&#39;re on r/conspiracy then you&#39;re aware of the concept of shills(which is not necessarily the hardcore undercover agent idea you put forth). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dont see whats so difficult about intelligence gathering meaning more than stalking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>first of all, the grammar in this sentence makes it hard for me to understand the point you&#39;re making. secondly, i havent said anything about stalking. what i&#39;m simply saying is that gathering intelligence on social trends, moods, opinions means jack shit if you dont know what demographic this &quot;intelligence&quot; is coming from. eg, whats the point in finding out people bought more cucumbers this week than last week. you need to know who bought them, why and where in order to make a profit, thats where privacy laws are broken in order to obtain these personal details. seeing as reddit doesnt have any of this information, intelligence gathering on here can be summarised as nothing more than social marketing and trend watching. thats not stalking.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not even going to permit me to be suspicious, then there&#39;s little point in talking to you. Making such a big deal out of it makes it only seem more dubious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have permission to do whatever you want, this is an open message board. I cant quite believe I let myself get dragged into a meaningless thread like this either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not going to just take your word for it, and there&#39;s no reason to. You keep failing to even acknowledge this part, and keep going on the defensive, when I&#39;m not actually making any accusations. There is nothing in your history that particularly stands out, but using that as absolute evidence is to assume that shills are incompetent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im not sure which part you&#39;re referring to that I havent acknowledged. I think Ive been very open about my opinions, they just differ from yours, Maybe instead of &quot;acknowledge&quot; you should have said &quot;agree with&quot;. What you term as &quot;defensive&quot; is actually just me disagreeing with what you&#39;re saying. If I were a shill, I would indeed be extremely incompetent at it, when I&#39;ll I&#39;ve done so far is give lame advice at 3am and posted far too much in <a href="/r/sex">/r/sex</a> </p>

<p>and why is that exactly? Have you never heard about the 50 cent army, astroturfing and internet sockpuppets, etc? Maybe it&#39;d be less likely if Reddit wasn&#39;t one of the most popular sites on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I havent heard of these things, but I can still assure you theyre not interested in this thread. Reddit is one of the most popular sites on the internet and because of that theres about two thousand posts above this one of which maybe one might make it to the front page tomorrow. They dont give a shit about the little guys with no voice like us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You didn&#39;t say it, you implied with the same thing you write again right before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was just pointing out the same thing you did.</p>

<p>This conversation is now over because I cant be arsed writing back to you. I think you might be a little too hung up on conspiracies, though this is the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I should probably expect that, you need to know the world isnt all bad my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>incorrect, the central bank that controls the &quot;government&quot; has the final say....all that matters is that you fear the government, and percieve them as the ones in charge....that way you direct all focus on the &quot;decoy&quot; and never pay too much attention to the ones who steer the ship....those who have been granted the rights to create currency...the only way you will win is to stop using their money</p>
