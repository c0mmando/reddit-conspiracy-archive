        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was left alone in a swimming pool, and not knowing how to swim i quickly slipped under the water and passed out. The last thing I remember is seeing the face of a very demonic looking human-reptile, and he was talking to me in a very condescending and hateful way. I can&#39;t remember what he said at all, but I can recall the emotions I was feeling and it basically amounts to him saying &quot;you are powerless and I own you&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard it said that you have to accept evil and allow it to come inside of you for it to take a foothold, so I must have believed this and allowed him to come through. From that moment on I thought God had died, that was the first thing I said when I came to. It was basically a shadow hanging over me making me sad and anxious and full of fear. I became uninterested in sociallizing and I remember many times questioning the &quot;purpose&quot; or &quot;usefulness&quot; of happiness, and generally having a feeling of being above the mundane masses who only want to be happy. It was a very warped thought process.</p>

<p>The years went by and I made some friends, but not good ones. What I have learned is that these entities feed mostly on fear, and that their influence and power grows the more you feed them. As the years went by I became more downcast and my thoughts became more unstable. It eventually escalated into a mental breakdown that was classified as &quot;schizophrenia&quot;. I didn&#39;t believe this for a second, and thankfully today I am not on meds. I kept remembering my mom telling me how drastically my personality changed since that incident in the pool. It must have been very hard for her, trying to reach me and understand what I went through when I couldn&#39;t even begin to explain to her (she&#39;s not very open minded).</p>

<p>Eventually I went to a shaman who got rid of the entity, and I&#39;ve learned to take responsibility for my state of mind and stay &quot;whole&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sharing this because I can&#39;t talk to anyone in my life about it, and I am hoping somebody can share a similair experience, hopefully one where they come out stronger. I&#39;ve heard Carlos Casteneda say these archons are here to challenge us, but I feel like my youth was mostly eaten up (I&#39;m 25 now), which is not to say I didn&#39;t experience joy, but I can honestly say that I wasn&#39;t happy since the day I drowned until I saw the shaman just a few months ago.</p>

<p>Essentially this reptile creature wanted my mind and to feed off my emotions, and he did for about 20 years. The hardest part was feeling so isolated, even isolated from myself as if my feelings and thoughts just did not match up.  What bugs me now is how cut off I feel when I look around and see the lives my peers have built, whereas I have scared off all my friends with my bad attitude. I&#39;m rambling now, but I think this is the place for such a rant. We&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your story doesn&#39;t exactly add up in terms of the sociological development of an infant at that age. Idea&#39;s such as &quot;god has died&quot; and things like &quot;uninterested in sociallizing and I remember many times questioning the &quot;purpose&quot; or &quot;usefulness&quot; of happiness, and generally having a feeling of being above the mundane masses who only want to be happy.&quot; Wouldn&#39;t really fit unless you&#39;re talking about 5-7 years after the fact</p>

<p>Anyway, even so I sympathize with the story as a few key points linger ominously in my mind. I feel like I&#39;ve had a few dreams where I&#39;ve had the exact same thing as what you described in the first paragraph happen to me. There is something which feels like an intruder(Even in my dreams, where nothing is stable, it feels like a different consciousness) and attempts to do something along those lines. I&#39;ve always been firm of will and have usually managed to get extremely aggressive with this kind of presence, talk back to it, fight it off, attempt to do the same things it&#39;s doing to me to it. As life goes on though and I sporadically have these encounters there&#39;s always the fear that the wear and tear of life, and drifting in and out of depression and good phases, I might lose out in one of these meetings and it might be a catalyst for an awful change in my life, such as you experienced (If it&#39;s just a internal dream then there&#39;s nothing to worry about obviously)</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess I kind of rambled too, but another thing I wanted to ask is if you could give more details about the Shaman you ended up going to. How did you find him, of what path did  he follow, and how did he help you</p>

<p>There, now its grammatically correct to get the point across, if you don&#39;t its on you. Kids don&#39;t understand greed when they&#39;re being greedy at a young age, they just want something. It isn&#39;t until later when they understand the concept of greed they associate that feeling and incident with greed, if at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You can literally say this about every memory everyone has.&quot; That was my point.</p>

<p>Because we conceptualize now with words, and a huge vocabulary and understanding of grammar that kids at that time don&#39;t have. Doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t conceive the concept, just not in the organized fashion or way we do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely wrong. Sit there and try to conceptualize a situation, a person, anything, without using words. You WILL NOT be able to conceptualize that as clearly, or in as complex of a manner, as you would without using words. Imagine trying to describe the relationship between colors, without words. Imagine trying to conceptualize a relationship of power, without words. Is the more powerful a king? That implies things. A president? That also implies things. You cannot describe concepts as accurately without words as with them. That is why a cat, generally, and in my opinion, will keep freaking out over the same sound instead of learning what it is and why it isn&#39;t a threat. No consistent labels, which imply things so it doesn&#39;t have to observe from a blank page, means less of a control and understanding over your ability to conceptualize. </p>

It was a bad enough experience that i ended up in the hospital...since then(was about 4 years ago) a ton of things these archons told me would happen to me and the world in general has come true...i dont think they are bad entities...they way i look at it is i would have forgot everything they tried communicate if it wasnt such a scary experience...i would have never remembered any of it...like they knew it had to rip my understanding of the universe apart in order for me to gain anything from it...crazy..even typing a response to you now brought a revelation to me...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is an interesting but sad story.  I wish to know more about what the sham-men did, and where did it go?  Just curious.</p>

<p>Your story is pretty unique, you seem to be casting a net here to see if somebody else has had such an experience.  But it is too rare and your net too small.  I think you&#39;ll have to look for people with these experiences if you really want to find one.</p>

<p>How quickly did your mind recover?  Just knowing what i know of neural networks you&#39;d still have plenty of hard wiring left over that would take some time to clear out, but at least its not being actively reinforced.</p>

<p>Did you ever get a brain scan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ll bet you could have sold him on ebay.  &#39;I&#39;m getting rid of this evil thing.  I would highly not recommend taking it, but hey, science.  Buyer be ware.&#39;</p>

<p>on a more serious note it is good to hear you&#39;ve rebounded.  You will be of help to anybody still going through such an experience.  &#39;don&#39;t fight it sucka fish, expel it.  There is light at the end of that tunnel&#39;</p>

<p>Callahan technique, sounds interesting.  I think i could use a go at it for a couple things.</p>

<p>Food for my thoughts, if i may ask, what thoughts were its favorite food?  To kill, to subvert, to destroy.  When good things go bad?  General emotional suffering of the host?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe your brain realized it was dying, and some of the basic survival structures in the brain (everybody has a &quot;reptile brain&quot; that is older than our &quot;thinking&quot; brain) appeared in your consciousness as abstract images. The evil bad feeling might have just been your &quot;lower&quot; survival processes saying, &quot;fuck this is bad this is awful we&#39;re fucked we&#39;re dead,&quot; and in your altered state, you interpreted it in a unique and emotional way.</p>

<p>it is in many sense the &quot;bedrock&quot; on which your &quot;higher&quot; processes sit (complex, frontal cortex thoughts, etc), and is also in charge of unconscious social drives like sexuality and dominance, so you may have damaged it by not getting enough oxygen, and later all of the things it responds to in life were lessened or diminished.</p>

<p>In my experience demons, angels, gods, etc, etc, are all analogies for psychological concepts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting story indeed. I&#39;ve never encountered reptilians, but, I do have some paranormal experiences, enough so I don&#39;t think you crazy or delusional right off. I assume you read David Icke; Try Franz Bardon&#39;s work as well. Once you understand the multidimensional aspect of this universe, NONE of this stuff is crazy. What happens, though, is we fall back to sleep, lulled by the mundane, everyday false reality we perceive when we only use our 5 senses.</p>

<p>My experiences, which range from(while in the dream state) being visited by multidimensionals, being aboard spacecraft(but not in an alien abduction kind of way), and visiting another planet, have shown me how little information we really have in our day to day existence. Our five senses are like five channels on a cable box, except, this universe has infinite channels. People think 5 is all there is.</p>

<p>They are wrong.</p>

<p>I hope you continue to get better. Don&#39;t fall back asleep. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rocky. I was in an outdoor area, sort of grand canyon-ish. I needed to enter a cave, which was shielded. To open the shield, I needed to trace certain symbols in the air on front of it. If you remember the old James Spader movie &quot;Stargate&quot;, the symbols were similar, also like Reiki symbols(which led to my being attuned to Reiki, currently level 2). Anyway, that&#39;s all I remember. And, yes, In that way you just know something in the dream state, I knew this wasn&#39;t earth. I don&#39;t expect you or anyone to believe this, but it did happen. *shrug</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shills/sheeple dont need proof, they rely on the fact that people who see anything other than the norm are classed mentally unstable because that is what everyone is told to think. They cant help being ignorant sheep - imagine spending your whole life thinking one way then being told you are wrong, it would be devastating, that&#39;s why they are so defensive. As mad as your post seems, I wouldnt want to doubt you. I&#39;ve never met you so I cannot judge you but I do believe there is a whole other plain of consciousness or whatever out there which we can tune in to. DMT seems to be the way. When you are younger however you would most likely have a more healthy pinneal glad which is said to be linked to human spirituality - could well be that and whatever plain you ended up on were the result of you seeing your demons, glad you are fine now. Peace man. </p>
