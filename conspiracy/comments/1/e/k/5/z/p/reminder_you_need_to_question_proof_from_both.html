        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I ran across <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1eirck/sandy_hook_shooting_predicted_in_2010_on_internet/">this thread</a> earlier.  I commented on it which basically was full of &quot;omg&quot; and &quot;scary&quot; types of comments, when I had seen the original thread months ago and knew it was basically a joke.  This subreddit is about asking questions and backing them up with some sort of evidence.  It was kind of disheartening to see that many people just automatically took it for being true. You shouldn&#39;t believe that everything is automatically true, no matter what side it supports.  Perhaps you think an event is a false flag or something,  just because something comes up that supports that - QUESTION THAT TOO. Discuss the facts and provide evidence.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Sorry that title is pretty bad and excessive,  but you get the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything should be questioned, totally agree.  Just because an official story stinks doesn&#39;t mean that those long YouTube videos with all caps titles, overly dramatic music and computer generated voice narration are suddenly all true.  At the same time, truth is sometimes found in the weirdest of places.  However, running into the arms of alarmists and fear-mongers is the worst thing you could do.</p>

<p>Speculation or even imagination is fine as long it&#39;s not presented as fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. The truth is almost always somewhere in between. In absence of fact, one should still ask tough, vital, or insane questions or express ones hypothesis without making a definitive claim or jumping to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Just like in Clue, even if you think you have good reason to think you know where all the cards lie, you can still be dead wrong in your accusations or assertions.</p>
