    <div class="md"><p>Monsanto and friends <a href="http://www.carighttoknow.org/">spent serious cash</a> to stop Prop 37 in CA. It would be safe to assume they are doing the same for other bills. </p>

<p>Monsanto is <a href="http://rense.com/general33/fd.htm">heavily ingrained</a> into the FDA (and EPA) and their policies. </p>

<p>Around the world, Monsanto is bankrupting agricultural economies to force people to use GM seeds and <em>not</em> re-use, as well as being ingrained into many other government&#39;s policies as well.</p>

<p>If we somehow manage to get GMO&#39;s labeled—which I highly doubt due to American ignorance, <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037913_vote_fraud_Proposition_37_election.html">potentially rigged elections</a> (I&#39;m not convinced prop 37 had fowl play in vote counts but it&#39;s possible), the tens of millions of dollars being funnelled into slander of the bills, and the silence of the corporate media—that in no way means we have &quot;won&quot;. Remember, GM crops can bread with regular crops and make retard babies. A few more years of GM crops making 90% of our food, and there won&#39;t be anymore un-infected crops left (I could be incorrect about this).</p>

<p>And, most importantly IMO, without an education campaign labeling GMO&#39;s will do almost nothing. Everyone who knows the potential health effects of GMO&#39;s, is already eating organic. Anyone who doesn&#39;t know the difference, has no reason to pick non-GMO products just because they&#39;re labeled. </p>

<p>this is a very uphill battle, and it&#39;s just one aspect of a system of plutocratic control that has dominated our species for thousands of years. Until the public learns to think for themselves and transcend all the superficial bullshit, this system will continue, and the strangle hold will potentially get increasingly tighter, until we are all dead. Educate yourself, educate your friends, make an effort to get people to think for themselves. No one is going to save us; we&#39;re not going to get lucky. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason the FDA does not allow the labeling of GMO foods is because Monsanto would go out of business if they did. On their website, Monsanto states they oppose all action to label GMO&#39;s because they are just as good as other foods. Of course, they assure you that they are safe, even though they are opposed to even allowing independent studies samples for testing. </p>

<p>There is a reason that GMO&#39;s are banned in Europe. The people demanded quality food, and they got it. We aren&#39;t at that stage yet, because not enough people are informed about the problem. Most think that GMO&#39;s are for the betterment of the people, rather than making the agricultural industries job easier. In 2012, 90% of GMO foods were genetically modified to contain pesticides. This is not for people&#39;s health, it&#39;s for profits. Once people can see that, we will see a shift. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d side with &quot;prevail regardless&quot;: it&#39;s currently very hard to get into the GM business and it&#39;s not like the benefits GM can provide (even if you&#39;re certain that it&#39;s very risky health-wise, you can&#39;t deny that it&#39;s a good business choice) are going to be forgotten about by the companies using GMOs. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also of the opinion that most people who care enough about GMOs to stop eating them would have already done so, although I can&#39;t really base that on anything. I&#39;d imagine that people who dislike the idea enough to not eat it or to avoid it even if it&#39;s cheaper but who don&#39;t actually care enough to try to avoid it without it being labeled don&#39;t make up a particularly big demographic. Feel free to prove me wrong, though -- like I said, I don&#39;t actually know about this!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>well they are automatically a much greater health risk compared to organic, or non-GMO. I think that the health-risk is not worth it for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh, that&#39;s not really true. You can argue against shady business practices used by companies who make GMO and that there are other aspects of food that make them unhealthy, but saying that genetically modifying food automatically makes it dangerous is a drastic oversimplification of a complicated topic. There are some studies suggesting that genetically modified foods can be harmful, but there are more showing that they aren&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way that is a good business choice, is A) if there are no health risks, or, B) you are profiting from the product and not using it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lots of people have avoided eating some foods entirely because they cannot be sure it is non-GMO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, but I don&#39;t really know how big that demographic is compared to the amount of people who either think GMOs are safe or who simply don&#39;t care enough to let it sway their purchases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even after 1 year of labelling, the sales of GMO products will drop</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I think it&#39;s fair to say that labelling things as genetically modified will have a negative impact, but it&#39;s hard to say if it would outweigh other things -- it&#39;s not the only factor determining how many people use those products. Price, the number of GMOs, marketing, market fluctuations, and a large variety of other things determine how profitable things are and how many of them get bought. Labelling is just one part of the equation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think its appalling how the Obama admin. passed the Monsanto Protection Act. it is very clear they are trying to get control of the world&#39;s food supply to ensure we stay fat, sick, and easy to control .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t buy this. Why would they want a fat and sick population? If they are attempting to control us, what grounds do we have to think that they&#39;re not already doing a good job? I hate to bring up yet another tired Hitler example, but the NSDAP seized complete control from the Kaiserreich without needing to make the population fat or sick. Power is not simple, and there are many reasons that might cause groups or individuals to gain or lose it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just finished reading Hybrid by Noel Kingsbury, and in it he made the rather startling (to me anyway) claim that up to 1,000 of the crop varieties currently being used in the world were created by &quot;induced mutation&quot; - the process of bombarding seeds or plants with gamma rays or x-rays.  His claim seems to be backed up by an internet search of &quot;gamma ray induced mutation plant breeding&quot;.  The process apparently creates huge numbers of useless, mutated plants, but it also creates some plants with useful traits that are then crossed with other plants to create improved varieties.  </p>

<p>So what was sold to me as organic, semi-leafless peas that I&#39;m now growing in my backyard were originally created by mutation breeding...  I know even less about GMOs than I do about mutation breeding, and have always been absolutely against them, but this new information has given me quite a shock.  </p>

<p>Monsanto clearly wants to be King of the World, and I&#39;m becoming more and more afraid that they will win.  GMO or not, I think as a company they&#39;re despicable.  But now I&#39;m wondering whether, for example, the problem with Roundup-Ready corn isn&#39;t so much the fact that it&#39;s GMO, but that the corn is doused with so much pesticide that that&#39;s what causes problems? </p>

<p>I live in WA State and a GMO-labelling initiative is going on the ballot, although after California I&#39;m not holding my breath.  I&#39;d also like those seeds I bought to have been labelled...   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never understood the anti-GMO stuff. Yeah I know, Monsanto... But maybe someone can explain to me how artificial selection is much different in the end product than modifying a desired gene? </p>

<p>Almost none of the plants or animals we use for food existed when humans first came on the scene; we tinkered with their genetics through selective breeding to suit our needs and desires. Now science has given us a tool to skip generations of breeding and get what we want now. How is that bad?</p>

<p>And I know all of the claims against GMO, so I&#39;m just curious how y&#39;all see the difference between shuffling genes randomly until we find a trait we want and directly changing the trait on demand. </p>

<p>I mean, there would have to be a massive scientific conspiracy if GMOs are as bad and as poisonous as some people claim. Are all scientists evil? Or is it the technology that is inherently evil and people can&#39;t be trust with it?</p>

<p>Just curious. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>well they are automatically a much greater health risk compared to organic, or non-GMO. I think that the health-risk is not worth it for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh, that&#39;s not really true. You can argue against shady business practices used by companies who make GMO and that there are other aspects of food that make them unhealthy, but saying that genetically modifying food automatically makes it dangerous is a drastic oversimplification of a complicated topic. There are some studies suggesting that genetically modified foods can be harmful, but there are more showing that they aren&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way that is a good business choice, is A) if there are no health risks, or, B) you are profiting from the product and not using it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lots of people have avoided eating some foods entirely because they cannot be sure it is non-GMO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, but I don&#39;t really know how big that demographic is compared to the amount of people who either think GMOs are safe or who simply don&#39;t care enough to let it sway their purchases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even after 1 year of labelling, the sales of GMO products will drop</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I think it&#39;s fair to say that labelling things as genetically modified will have a negative impact, but it&#39;s hard to say if it would outweigh other things -- it&#39;s not the only factor determining how many people use those products. Price, the number of GMOs, marketing, market fluctuations, and a large variety of other things determine how profitable things are and how many of them get bought. Labelling is just one part of the equation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think its appalling how the Obama admin. passed the Monsanto Protection Act. it is very clear they are trying to get control of the world&#39;s food supply to ensure we stay fat, sick, and easy to control .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t buy this. Why would they want a fat and sick population? If they are attempting to control us, what grounds do we have to think that they&#39;re not already doing a good job? I hate to bring up yet another tired Hitler example, but the NSDAP seized complete control from the Kaiserreich without needing to make the population fat or sick. Power is not simple, and there are many reasons that might cause groups or individuals to gain or lose it.</p>
