    <div class="md"><p>Wait, you&#39;re telling me that if someone gets their legs blown off in a well-documented explosion, the burden of proof rests not with the people who think he was a double amputee actor, but with everyone else?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not our job to debunk ridiculous theories with no credible evidence. If I told you an invisible, fire-breathing unicorn lives in my backyard, is the burden of proof on you to disprove that, or with me to provide solid evidence of its existence?</p>

<p>And since you say the picture of Baumann with both his legs intact is clearly a photoshop, what is your evidence? Especially since it&#39;s so clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t think anyone will be able to convince me otherwise. I tried believing the official story but it didn&#39;t piece together like it should. It also makes sense that (since this isn&#39;t the first false flag) the people behind it had a motive, like always</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just have to believe, and you can almost seem them. I have seen many that show his whole body, but none that actually show legs that aren&#39;t covered by jeans. That doesn&#39;t stop me from believing that there was no conspiracy. All I have seen is little suggestive &quot;oddities&quot;, most if not all are debunked, and on the other side, is the massive task of conspiricizing all the victims, their blogs,  stories and the insanity of all these people participating in some massive conspiracy to fool Americans.   </p>

<p>If anything, the Boston event and all of the reapplication of common conspiracy ideas to the Boston story makes me believe much less in prior conspiracy theories, because you can see the fallacy being generated in real time.  There are still blogs presenting debunked ideas as &quot;new&quot; evidence.  The best one to date in my opinion was the &quot;dust&quot; video, but if you think about it, a tiny clipped view of something that was most like unfurling towels is hardly evidence of a &quot;massive conspiracy&quot;. </p>

<p>Take the flipping Puerto Rican / American flags on the Ohio Monster&#39;s porch... It &quot;seemed&quot; weird, but it was just the wind. I think most &quot;conspiracies&quot; are really &quot;just the wind&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between questioning the official story and demanding evidence that hundreds of people are in on a conspiracy, including a man who lost his legs, doctors, EMTs, spectators, reporters, etc. </p>

<p>Instead of demanding proof that Jeff Baumann is a double amputee actor who managed to rip his prosthetic legs off and discard them without anyone seeing, how about providing some evidence of your own? Something that shows that hundreds of people who knew him before the bombing were wrong about him actually having legs, maybe? </p>
