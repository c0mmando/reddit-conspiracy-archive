       Perhaps, but this photo ended that little theory for me. If you believe he had prosthetics before the event, you'd have to believe everyone including those two sweet-looking girls are "in on it".

       But then again...the shade is hitting the left side of Jeff's face but not the left side of the redheads.

       i am not into the Boston conspiracy but that is THE WORST photoshop ever, man.  NOTHING about it looks right..it's way off...the colors are wrong for the setting, most notably to me.  wtf?ETA: the redhead on the left (our left) looks like she was cut out with scissors and taped in.  weird.

       Despite the usual siren voices trying to ridicule anyone who thinks Baumann is an actor, these people present no evidence to dispel this suspicion (wearebornfree's image of Baumann + legs is clearly a photoshop).

       You mean the burden of proof which rests on the mainstream media to establish before they print something as "fact"? That same burden of proof which is not being met because the US media know that their brainwashed consumers can't tell the difference between fact and fiction? Yes, I do understand it. You?

       Wait, you're telling me that if someone gets their legs blown off in a well-documented explosion, the burden of proof rests not with the people who think he was a double amputee actor, but with everyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not our job to debunk ridiculous theories with no credible evidence. If I told you an invisible, fire-breathing unicorn lives in my backyard, is the burden of proof on you to disprove that, or with me to provide solid evidence of its existence?
      </p>
      <p>
       And since you say the picture of Baumann with both his legs intact is clearly a photoshop, what is your evidence? Especially since it's so clear.

       Let me ask you something:
      </p>
      <p>
       if he was an actor, where were his prostetichs hidden and why does he suddenly have elongated bones from his stubs? If we're too believe he already had fake legs, then the bone would have been cut off, not suddenly returned.

       Good luck there have been many posts on here asking the same thing. There are no  pictures of his bare legs. They are either covered or not in the picture and now there gone. Weed thru all the hate people here are still against the theory of using crisis actors. Good luck on your search.

       They are all in on this right?  When you look at the whole picture, this event was real, but I totally understand that when you look at the macro level things seem off.  Truth is not black and white.

       Yeah I don't think anyone will be able to convince me otherwise. I tried believing the official story but it didn't piece together like it should. It also makes sense that (since this isn't the first false flag) the people behind it had a motive, like always

       You just have to believe, and you can almost seem them. I have seen many that show his whole body, but none that actually show legs that aren't covered by jeans. That doesn't stop me from believing that there was no conspiracy. All I have seen is little suggestive "oddities", most if not all are debunked, and on the other side, is the massive task of conspiricizing all the victims, their blogs,  stories and the insanity of all these people participating in some massive conspiracy to fool Americans.
      </p>

       If anything, the Boston event and all of the reapplication of common conspiracy ideas to the Boston story makes me believe much less in prior conspiracy theories, because you can see the fallacy being generated in real time.  There are still blogs presenting debunked ideas as "new" evidence.  The best one to date in my opinion was the "dust" video, but if you think about it, a tiny clipped view of something that was most like unfurling towels is hardly evidence of a "massive conspiracy".

       Take the flipping Puerto Rican / American flags on the Ohio Monster's porch... It "seemed" weird, but it was just the wind. I think most "conspiracies" are really "just the wind"...

       I can't seem to find a picture that shows my legs either.  Honestly unless its a posed professional shot, I don't think people focus on legs.  We tend to look at each other's faces when acknowledging each other so I think we instinctively photograph that way as well.

       you have that back-asswards... professional shots usually ONLY focus on the face unless it is a group photo, amateur shots often include everything in the scene because it is about keeping the memory and context of the picture.

       I cant imagine witnessing widespread corruption, misinformation, lies and evil yet calling someone who questions the official version of things delusional. Seriously. If you dont believe the authorities of the world are capable of corruption then you have no place criticizing people for asking questions because the proof (not speculation, not theories, proof) exists. I guess ignorance is bliss eh buddy?

       There's a difference between questioning the official story and demanding evidence that hundreds of people are in on a conspiracy, including a man who lost his legs, doctors, EMTs, spectators, reporters, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of demanding proof that Jeff Baumann is a double amputee actor who managed to rip his prosthetic legs off and discard them without anyone seeing, how about providing some evidence of your own? Something that shows that hundreds of people who knew him before the bombing were wrong about him actually having legs, maybe?
