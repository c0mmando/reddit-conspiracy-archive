       I think this should be mandatory. And also should reflect in court to a major factor if by chance a bunch of "malfunctions" just happen to occur on questionable police behavior. This benefits them also in showing any abuse towards them also. I believe every single officer should be on camera (other than privacy issues which does leave a small gap) at all times while on duty. They want cameras then put em there.

       By law every public street surveillance camera should have a live feed open to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every police officer who has a camera either on his/her person or dashboard should have a live feed that goes to a secure cloud from which either the defense or prosecution can obtain evidence. The police can keep a local copy, if they wish, but should not have administrative access to the master.

       If I'm not mistaken, there are ways to access those cameras. Whether or not it is legal is another matter I'm unclear on. One of my friends said that they are all on the internet, and all you need to know is it's "address" so to speak. I don't know how he did it, and I'm not nearly as good with computers.

       It all depends on the way the cameras are set up. Many non-professional surveillance cameras are set up with the default password or no password. Those can be accessed if connected to the internet which they sometimes are without the owner being aware. The controlling computer or dedicated box might be on his/her internal network and only too happy to send packets through the router out to the net unbeknown to the owner. There are thousands of systems like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt, however, if that professionals who set up police and homeland security cameras leave the feed open to the public. But, I think they should and for stationary cameras it would be trivial in terms of difficulty.

       LOL, imagine the questions being put to the cops in court. Those fuckers would never win a case. There is no way a cop could go their whole shift without some sort of dumb thing or even innocent thing being said or done, that a good defence couldn't twist in our favour.

       Defence: Tell me about 'the big tittied blonde' you saw 4 hours before the alleged incident.

       Defence: Goes to show how unprofessional the officer is, calling the officers credibility, as an impartial law enforcer, into question.

       Judge: I'll allow it.

       Defence: There is a period of 20 minutes after you brought my client to the police station that you turned off your camera. Why did you do that?

       Cop: I needed to have a bowel movement.

       Cameras will be on all the time, and some abuse will be prevented. We love technology, so we'll simply hand over many judgment calls to computers. Cops won't pull you over because you are suspicious, but because the behavior analyzer algorithm flagged your conversation and movements as unusual.  That way the big breasted blond won't matter.

       What you propose is a principle found within David Brin's
       <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/transparency.html">
        Transparent Society.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/transparency.html">
        The idea:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brin argues that a core level of privacy - protecting our most intimate interactions - may be preserved, despite the rapid proliferation of cameras that become ever-smaller, cheaper and more numerous faster than Moore's law. He feels that this core privacy can be saved simply because that is what humans deeply need and want. Hence, Brin explains that "...the key question is whether citizens will be potent, sovereign and knowing enough to enforce this deeply human want."
       </p>
       <p>
        This means they must not only have rights, but also the power to use them and the ability to detect when they are being abused. Ironically, that will only happen in a world that is mostly open, in which most citizens know most of what is going on, most of the time. It is the only condition under which citizens may have some chance of catching the violators of their freedom and privacy. Privacy is only possible if freedom (including the freedom to know) is protected first.
       </p>

       Here is the thing with camera's in general. When they are allowed to be not turned on or not used or the footage they capture not to be delivered or destroyed they really serve no universal purpose and are way too easily manipulated to only serve a particular agenda. That goes for all evidence pretty much.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't think every officer should have a camera nor do I think there should be more camera's in general. I do think and agree that "we" should look into how they are used and try to set up a system so that abuse is actually punishable.

       I'm saying camera's should be used well. Those camera's were used wrong. Having more camera's is not a solution when we don't have a system that uses the camera's that we have.

       Always-on wearable video cameras backed up in the cloud in real time will be here soon. This will change everything in subtle ways as privacy will come to mean only what you do when you're alone.  Crowd-sourced panoptical surveillance is arriving piece by piece even now--far too rapidly for our legal system to deal with it. The result is that police powers expand exponentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until the last 50years humankind never have to worry conversations being tapped and monitored--today, any and all communications might be subject to government surveillance. This is a profoundly more intrusive form of government than any societies in history had to deal with. The thing that's especially concerning is that most people don't appreciate there even has been a change in police powers of the government. Everyone has surrendered so much already, and the power grab continues at an even more rapid pace as technology develops.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, police will wear these cameras as will everyone else. Police abuse will be cut down, but that's a fairly insignificant issue in the grand scheme compared to the larger questions of governmental control.

       For the sake of some simplicity, this post will focus on local law enforcement. Understand, the information listed may differ from department to department. My intention is not to insult you, but to discuss this idea based on realities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first question that came to mind when I read this was, "who's paying for and monitoring this mandatory camera system that you suggest?" Currently, agencies pay for their own camera systems. And they have a lot of companies/designs to choose from. Most of these companies only go so far to install their systems and give initial training or training manuals. Oh, you want audio too so you can hear any possible verbal harassment, intimidation, or coercion? Well Mr. Police Chief, that's actually going to be a separate recording system. And all your officers will need mic packs. And chargers. Can your budget cover that for all your cars and personnel? What about detectives? Fleet managers? Records clerks? That secretary at your front desk? Does she need a camera? This idea was suggested by the citizens right? It's what they want. For protection. Then I'm sure they won't mind being taxed more to provide it, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so now how do we record and store this? Well, Chief, you can use DVD-R, DVD-RW, internal hard drive located in the vehicle, we've got wireless automatic upload, we've got this weird system that you plug the car into via cable and dock at the end of shift, and if you're feeling hipster then we can hook you up with a VHS. Don't worry though, the majority of these systems are designed to require as little user handling and knowledge as possible. Your patrol officers won't even handle the systems past logging in at the beginning of shift. The camera is continually running and when the emergency lights turn on it will start recording automatically from 30 seconds back. All you really need is a couple of property sergeants trained on how to handle DVD replacement and storage. What if something breaks, you ask? Don't worry Chief, it's under warranty. Just send it back. Yeah you'll be without a camera or mic for a bit but the warranty replacement option is way cheaper than hiring technicians for all these electronics. What's that? The citizens want live feed uploaded to a cloud service? But, your department doesn't even have computers in your cars.. Guess you can buy some of those too. More taxes. Cloud storage security, sir? Well, you'll have to get an IT staff to handle that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet you're wondering what your liabilities might be from the public having instant access to video evidence of an ongoing investigation. Well rest assured, those Internet investigators never make mistakes. They don't ever go on white knight initiated witch hunts based upon opinion or misinformation. Actually, you'll probably be able to downsize internal investigations and your detectives. I doubt any bystanders or innocents will have personal information indiscriminately posted online.

       It's simple. As a first responder (medical), I can assure you those cameras are not to protect YOU, they are to protect first responders FROM you. People are fucking crazy, for every good, upright person you help you will encounter three who want your career because of some perceived injustice. Also a live feed or access to this information without some sort of buffer would be very unethical. No one is guilty until proven guilty, consider the Boston situation and Reddit's involvement. Just my 2 cents anyhow.
