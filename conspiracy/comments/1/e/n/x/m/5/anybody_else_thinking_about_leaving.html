    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve got the resources to get out of the country (I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s what you&#39;re implying in your OP), you probably don&#39;t need to. All you need to do is get out of cities and large towns, and settle in somewhere with a small population, a decent distance from anywhere else, and become as self-sufficient and friendly with your new neighbours as possible. Those are the communities that will survive if shit goes really bad.</p>

<p>*<em>To give you some context, I just worked it out: if you look at the UK, the population per square mile of the whole country is equivalent to every person in America living inside an area roughly 1.7 times the size of Texas. Trust me, you have enough room. There won&#39;t be thousands of people roaming through the countryside and getting to every place you could want to settle.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m inclined to agree, but this kind of preparation is important because, before we can rebel and overthrow the current regime, we have to become independent of it. Right now, people cannot rise up against the machine because they are too reliant on it. Encourage everyone you know to take up gardening and to prepare a survival pack. Organize emergency procedures for you and your family and close friends, and if the internet gets turned off, put that plan into action without even waiting to find out the news by word-of-mouth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My pack would allow me to survive indefinitely in the wilderness. It contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>tent</li>
<li>sleeping bag</li>
<li>ground tarp (cut to match the footprint of my tent)</li>
<li>water microfilter (for heavy metals)</li>
<li>water UV pen (for viruses and bacteria)</li>
<li>water bottle</li>
<li>cookpot and utensils</li>
<li>2 ea of heavy and light socks</li>
<li>1 ea of thermal layer, light outter layer, and heavy outter layer (synthetic materials are best because of weight, collapsability, and quick drying)</li>
<li>rain pants and rain coat</li>
<li>waterproof boots</li>
<li>25 ft of synthetic chord (for suspending my food from a tree away from camp at night)</li>
<li>machette with saw back</li>
<li>hatchet with hammer back</li>
<li>knife/multi-tool (its very useful to include scissors and a wire cutter)</li>
<li>rimmed hat and netting (for bugs)</li>
<li>gardening gloves</li>
<li>collapsible shovel</li>
<li>GPS as well as a paper map</li>
<li>phone</li>
<li>2 flashlights</li>
<li>medical supplies (antibiotic, anti-hystemine, various bandages, cortazone cream or something similar for bug bites, iodine tablets, tweezer, aspirin, eyedrops, gauze wrap, tape)</li>
<li>sewing and patch kit</li>
<li>waterproof matches</li>
<li>compass/mirror/binocular/magnifying glass multi-tool</li>
<li>a few extra ziplocke bags and garbage bags (very handy for lots of things. Keeping things dry is imparative in the wilderness. Nothing short of nuclear holocause will make you more miserable outdoors than getting you and your stuff wet)</li>
<li>edible and medicinal plants book</li>
<li>dangerous animals and plants book</li>
<li>firearm</li>
<li>fishing pole, line, and tackle</li>
<li>food (usually dried foods like noodles, oatmeal, dried fruits. Also trailmix, hot chocolate mix, flatbread, and some tuna or jerky). I carry about 7-8 lbs of food, and if necessary I can make it last a full month without any supplimentation from fishing or gathering. </li>
<li>assorted heirloom seeds, for a garden if I need to survive long-term</li>
</ul>

<p>My back weighs about 55 lbs with that stuff. I carry a little over 45 of it in my main backpack, and the remainder in a front-mounted pack that is easy to access while walking and helps to offset the weight of the backpack. I&#39;ll actually be adding another 10 lbs to it because I want to have a portable solar panel, battery, tablet PC, and external harddrive. But those aren&#39;t immediate necessities, just long-term ones, to me. Learning to build a solar panel is quite easy and very handy. They can last more than a decade and solar cells can be bought cheaply on ebay. </p>

<p>Also, do some gardening this year. This is the right time to get seeds into the ground, right now. You&#39;ll learn some stuff that you&#39;ll be glad to have learned, if you ever really need to survive off the grid. And take some short-term hiking trips with your pack, to work out which things you might want to add, change, or remove. I can&#39;t describe how great it feels to have a survival pack prepped, and know that if society crumbled tomorrow, I&#39;d be right as rain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah, you need to seal any solar panel from moisture (not oxygen) if you want it to last long. But it&#39;s not that tough. You just use the same kind of sealant that you use on fish tanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>technically you are right, in that it takes oxygen and moisture to really ruin a cell.  how are you sealing them?  are you using EVA or painting them with something?  are you evacuating the cavity (it sounds like you are putting them between glass with some caulking on the edges.  almost all sealants breathe and will not keep out the moisture and oxygen for long.  how long have your projects lasted?  are they decaying faster than a percent per year?  i would be very surprised if they are, but if they are please link to something using this method.  </p>

<p>When i looked into doing this it quickly became clear that it would be cheaper to just buy panels pre-made, and i try to make everything myself too.</p>

Also, just FYI, if your filtration system ever messes up or gets broken, filtering water through a few layers of regular cloth will remove upwards of 95% of all contaminents. </p>

<p>Good on you for preparing. I&#39;ve done the same and have been encouraging others to be prepared for shit to hit the fan. I&#39;ve had enough of our executive branch turning into tyrrants. I&#39;m just trying to raise other people&#39;s hackles so we can overthrow them en masse. </p>

When it boils in your blood, and you know, that it&#39;s now or never. There will be a time when the people like you and me who fear for OUR future will know we have to stand for that future. We cannot let money and greed rape and poison this planet. Learn as much as you can because an education is the only thing that can never be taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can run, but you can&#39;t hide.</p>

<p>Even if you &quot;run for the hills&quot; unless you have food and supplies stockpiled and hidden you will never survive more that a month.
There will be no way to store any large animal you might kill for meat and when winter comes, anywhere in the north of the US you will need shelter. </p>

<p>Plus there will be thousands of people like you that will be foraging for food. Some of them will be more experienced and more prepare than you and they will take everything from you, and depending on how long you accidentally might have survived too long, they might even eat you,,lol</p>

<p>This is not like in the early 1900s when animals where plentiful.
Nowadays, all the states have their own fisherys which stock all the rivers and lakes in the US every year.. Almost any fish you catch in the US is not a wild fish but one stocked by them.</p>

<p>You will be eating insects and tree bark until you succumb to disease from lack of nutrition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstood what I meant. I was saying, if the internet goes out (and with 3D printed guns schematics now proliferating like wildfire, it&#39;s a real possibility), don&#39;t wait to hear about what happened by word of mouth, or on the radio. Grab your provisions, find your people, and be all set to go off the grid. If you stand around waiting to hear what happened, your chances of survival are not as good. </p>

<p>For example, if the internet went down (which would probably coincide with cell phone deactivations, as it did in the regional internet shut down in LA during the 2011 occupy protests. People could not even call 911), people would start milling about in the streets, asking their neighbors what&#39;s going on. And without reassurances, people would start looting stores, looting houses, stealing cars, etc. We&#39;ve seen it happen with less extreme circumstances than lacking internet and phone service. And if that happens, and you&#39;re still standing around, the smart people will have already taken the things they need to survive, possibly including your survival gear if you  weren&#39;t paying attention to it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I meant. </p>

<p>And yes, I&#39;ve spent more than a continuous month camping in the wilderness, with nothing more than what I could carry on my back. I know exactly what I&#39;ll be doing if shit hits the fan, and so do all my closest people. </p>

<ol>
<li>If we all turned our backs on the system which many are now doing, they become powerless. </li>
<li>Start growing your own food, start community food co ops, we need food, shelter, water. When we have these things self sufficiently and stop purchasing their products we are free.</li>
<li>Look into your spirituality, Buddhism, Christianity, anything from the light and start understanding the power of meditation and prayer.</li>
<li>Build the world you are looking for, start today, a small thing like planting a seed, others will follow.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally left 10+ years ago and established my life in another country.  Saying that, my situation is different.  For your situation I have no idea as I don&#39;t know your situation and what you&#39;re prepared to do.  If you can leave do it.  Canada, South America some place cheap and less connected to USA might be a good idea which leads me to think about South America.  Its a big change perhaps easy to travel by foot, but its not just the physical aspect its the mental due to no family and no friends but you need to speak the language and be qualified to work.  This is a long shot and you will likely be able to seek asylum in another country if the USA goes south.</p>

<p>If you can get an Indian citizenship and go on the reservation.  Otherwise learn to survive in the country, find food etc.  You might find a survival course in your area.</p>

<p>Packing supplied for a few weeks isn&#39;t going to help you as you will face other problems like other humans, wild animals, weather.  1-2 weeks of food will go fast so whats the next step?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO the best thing to do beyond learning and practicing survival skills and combat training/good PT, is to move to a place where you can effectively stand and fight. Find a militia, join; just make sure you have something to contribute. Learn basic skills to the best of your ability like blacksmithing, carpentry, mechanics, etc. Learn how to live without electricity, read maps..
.most of you know this but not everyone realizes what they will have to learn to go without.... there is no where that will be untouched by this man made catastrophe when it all ends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best you can do is think it through. Think of everything you&#39;ll be leaving behind. Think of your friends, family, whatever pets you may have. Personal items too. Think about how prepared you can be, prepared to live on your own and alone for the majority of your life without very little, if any, luxury.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t be able to take anything but the most necessary supplies with you. Think it thoroughly and through first before you decide to actually do this. Because once you start giving everything away and cut off all ties, there&#39;s very little chance you&#39;ll ever get it all back aside from potential, understanding people.</p>

<p>Just think. Because this is a major life event you&#39;re trying to bring on to yourself and you just have to know: Is it worth it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have. A doozy of a good one. TIt was the site where I first learned about executive order 13603, in which the executive branch grants itself the authority to seize any resources deemed necessary for the continuity of government, including forced human labor, even during peacetime, without congressional aproval, and not subjectable to judicial review. </p>

<p>And there is <em>zero</em> hyperbole in that assessment. There are actually even further reaching implications that are just as disturbing, but I don&#39;t want to get all long-winded about it right now. The full document is quite short, maybe 4 pages, and I highly recommend reading it (search: whitehouse.gov national defense resource preparedness), as it dismantles much of the bill of rights, and is effectively a secession of the executive branch from the checks and balances of the other two branches. It kinda makes worrying about the NDAA and the Patriot Act seem a bit laughable really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve encountered very few people who are aware of the executive order. And it was already signed in March of 2012. The article was not hyperbolic about it, either. I read the full document myself and I was far more disturbed after reading it than I was reading the summary of it on Info Wars. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve fallen into the dogmatic practice of generally condemning everything that comes from a source you dislike. Be cautious with that. Don&#39;t become one of those people whose so sure he&#39;s right and so sure others are wrong that you are unable to listen to reason. </p>

<p>Like I said, Info Wars does tend to be sensationalist and hyperbolic, but they have a few occassional gems that are worth noting, as with many news sources. </p>
