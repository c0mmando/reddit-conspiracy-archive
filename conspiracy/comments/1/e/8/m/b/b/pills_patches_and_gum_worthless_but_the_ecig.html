For me and hundreds of people i have talked to the E-cig is the ONLY thing that works, the ONLY thing that keeps them from going back to cigs, and the ONLY thing that they can afford to help them quit and it is inexpensive (costs me 4times less per month compared to cigs)  even as a permanent replacement to smoking.... And now the attack begins. Vapor lounges are being told they can no longer sample their products to customers and they can no longer use their e-cig in the building, employers are doing the same. On top of that employers health insurance companies are saying they are going to charge e-cig users the same extra premiums as smokers. ON TOP OF THAT these same companies will pay for you to use pills, patches or gums instead -- worthless, more expensive, and will make you more addicted to cigs when you do relapse, seen it a hundred times. i dont know how to wrap this up without ranting.- Fin- ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaper here - been at it 11 months and counting. </p>

<p>RJ Reynolds is sponsoring legislation to put a sin tax on eliquid from what I hear. </p>

<p>Big pharma has a vested interest in patches, gums, and pills - they are none too happy. It&#39;s a big reason the FDA doesn&#39;t like them. Luckily the FDA failed to classify them as drug delivery devices back in 2010 - which would have likely made them available as prescription only. </p>

<p>Not sure if it&#39;s out yet, but Nicorette Quik Mist is what the FDA would have preferred to have available. </p>

<p>The first known patent for an e-cig was from <a href="http://www.e-cig.org/2009/11/07/new-invention-of-1963-the-smokeless-non-tobacco-cigarette/">1963</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s also not forget that nicotine is technically not currently a controlled substance in the US, as I understand it. </p>

<p>However, vaping is getting big and less fringe - friends and family of vapers have just as much interest in e-cigs because they have made their loved ones healthier. Because of that, they&#39;ll be harder to suppress IMO. </p>

<p>Not only that, but we got more than enough signatures on the most recent petition to supposedly garner a response. At the very least, they know most people are aware of and highly in favor of our beloved devices. </p>

<p>Vape on, bud. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They own a certain portion.  Lorillard (parent company of Newport cigarettes) owns Blu e-cigs.  RJ Reynolds is reported to have their own model under development.  They want to profit from over-pricing while having their friends in congress tax and regulate the good small vendors/manufacturers out of existence.</p>

<p>However, the biggest and most successful e-cig hardware manufacturers (Joye/Ovale/Janty, Vision, and Kanger) are Chinese owned and independent of big tobacco.  The most popular eliquids are made by independent vendors in the US, and there&#39;s also a growing DIY segment of vapers.</p>

<p>I do expect to see big tobacco make a larger grab at the &#39;cig-a-like&#39; and disposable section of the market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I switched to RYO years ago and noticed that my cravings or need to smoke went way down, I still couldn&#39;t quit though. I bought an e-cig back in December and quit cigarettes the same day. I have had maybe 4 cigarettes since quitting. Tried chantix, zyban, cold turkey and none of that stuck. This was way too easy with the e-cig. </p>

<p>Scary that there is even &quot;debate&quot; about this product... chantix requires a fucking minute extra in a commercial to explain all of the potential side effects, but dr&#39;s will happily give that garbage out... but a couple of items (propylene glycol/vegetable glycerine) that are on the FDA&#39;s &quot;fit for human consumption&quot; list are too scary and might need regulation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldnt tell you for sure if quitting is easier after moving to an e-cig because i actually like the &quot;smoking&quot; sensation, i only quit cigs because i dont like my lungs being full of junk but i do like the feeling of &quot;smoking&quot;. I did notice that it is no longer a necessity for me to use the e-cig like a cig during certain times for instance, getting in a car i used to ALWAYS light up now i take 40 minute drives, get to my destination and forget i even had my ecig. it is like the craving is just gone gone gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a really good point. I am a frequent user of the E-cig and have almost quit smoking regular cigarettes. I was also wondering about the whole insurance thing to. I have to pay an extra 1000 dollars a year because I am a smoker. So if I quit smoking and use the E-cig Im wondering if that would drop the smoking premium, but if I read your comment correctly it does not work that way with the E-cig. It is amazing that big tobacco and Insurance companies urge you to quit smoking and its ok to use nicotine gum patches and spray but not E-cigs. 
well that tells you something write there. Maybe if the E-cig was approved by the fda to administer nicotine into your system it would be ok like gum patches etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;m ONLY going to be picky about your facts because you used capitals. But there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands who stopped smoking before e-cigs came out. </p>

<p>Also</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m aware there has been little testing on the health implications of e-cigs, so I couldn&#39;t blame companies for ruling against there use in buildings before possible future law suits. I could be totally wrong how ever, wouldn&#39;t be the first time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been a growing number of studies - I would check in at <a href="/r/ecr">/r/ecr</a>.  The independent ones are the ones to look at.</p>

<p>To date, the worst they&#39;ve found is an example with trace amounts of heavy metal nanoparticles.  There are many factors to consider - such as how hot the coil runs when in use, how long the coil has been used.  This hasn&#39;t been replicated in other studies as far as I know.  It&#39;s still a young industry and more studies are welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm. After reading through the comments.... something really bothered me. I used to vape cannabis a lot. Smoking is retarded, period, vaping is great. </p>

<p>So... why don&#39;t people just vape fresh / untampered tobacco? The boiling point of nicotine is 477F, below the combustion of the plant, and there&#39;s plenty of herb vaporizers that go above that. If the dumbass government tries to tax these things, all you have to do is just buy an herb vape, and them some tobacco, and shred it up all fine like into a powder. Vaping herbs has existed for a longgggg time, this new &quot;e-cigs&quot; are just cashing in on the fact most people don&#39;t know... I guess it takes a little more work, but how stupid can the government be to tax this </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is actually my backup plan if regulations or cost make it too much of a hassle.  I have a Vapir No2, and would use an MFLB on the go.</p>

<p>One issue with herb vaporizers is that they consume a shit-ton more power - the ceramic heating element needs more power to run that hot, and that heating element needs to stay hot for a session.  With an e-cig, it&#39;s on demand since the liquid vaporizes much quicker and doesn&#39;t need to get nearly as hot.  Most experienced vapers prefer a manual switch over an auto switch (activated by sound or suction), so you are only consuming power when taking a hit.  There are portable vapes, but they aren&#39;t very efficient or convenient for nicotine delivery (butane may be an exception, haven&#39;t used one, personally).</p>

<p>E-cigs also produce more vapor - herb vapes have much thinner vapor, and the learning curve is much higher for someone trying to switch.  They don&#39;t emulate the smoking experience as well.</p>

<p>Also - people will be more likely to think you are getting stoned in public.  I would rather get pulled over with any kind of e-cig than an herbal vaporizer. </p>

<p>Finally - flavors.  I personally stick with tobaccos and the occasional mint, but lots of vapers much prefer the Willy Wonka rainbow of flavors once they get their taste back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that one is.  But I like it because of the battery life and the extra power that I can crank out of it.</p>

<p>I started out with a &quot;generic&quot; starter kit.  A cig-sized battery and the &quot;refills&quot; (pre-filled cartos).  It showed me that it COULD work, but that the little piddly convenience-store unit I was using wasn&#39;t going to cut it.</p>

<p>Then I moved on to an <a href="http://i.imgur.com/huuMbPj.jpg">e-Go</a> unit.  It&#39;s more the size of a cigar.  I was able to quit my cigarette habit overnight with it, but it didn&#39;t have the battery life I wanted and I couldn&#39;t crank the voltage up as high as I wanted to, so I went with the Vamo, which I absolutely love.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit cumbersome to carry around, and it does attract attention when I pull it out.  But it could be worse.  I could still be smoking &quot;analogs&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you used something available at Walgreens or a gas station (or anything similar), there&#39;s your problem.  E-cigs of that class often use between 24mg and 36mg nicotine strength (i.e. way too much).</p>

<p>And a cartridge is nowhere near a pack&#39;s worth.  Pack equivalency&#39;s are always wrong and misleading.  I don&#39;t use anything that uses &#39;cartridges&#39; however.</p>

<p>I use all USA made liquid.  The Chinese liquid is no good.  It&#39;s very harsh and some are suspected to contain diacetyl.  Not to mention the flavoring ingredients can often be irritants themselves.</p>

<p>Frequency of usage depends solely on the individual.  Social situations make me nervous and I&#39;ll use it more.  Barely use it when chilling at home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most medical professionals state that nicotine by itself is in the same class of harm as caffeine - of course you&#39;d be better off without either.</p>

<p>I&#39;d argue that you&#39;re removing substantially more than half the risk.  The smoke, tar, and additives cause the vast majority of detrimental health effects - smoking cigarettes is basically freebasing nicotine.  Not to mention many who are primarily attached to the oral fixation aspect work their way down to zero nicotine and stay there.  Some people use it as a stepping stone to quitting nicotine altogether.  Some people use them so they&#39;re not smoking around their kids, don&#39;t want to go outside in the cold when they&#39;re at a bar, or don&#39;t want to stink up their new car.  Some smokers do give a shit about second-hand smoke and know it&#39;s harmful.  They&#39;re a means to an end, and all vapers have their own goals - whether it&#39;s replacement or a weaning instrument.</p>

<p>Vaping is about harm reduction.  Vapers know if they want to <em>eliminate</em> all harm, then doing neither is the way to go.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that you aren&#39;t getting the tar and chemicals that cigarettes have, but you&#39;re still smoking! Also, since you are able to smoke e-cigs inside most establishments I feel like most folks using these are actually smoking more. Slightly healthier? Probably. A safe alternative? No.</p>

<p>Quick disclaimer-I applaud any efforts to quit smoking, I smoked for a long time and quit and couldn&#39;t have made a better choice for my health. I just feel that making the commitment to quit, rather than replace, is the better path to take. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, common misconception.  Thanks for being a stand-up internet person in your retraction.</p>

<p>To your point, it&#39;s absolutely better to quit altogether, most vapers will agree with you (air&gt;vapor&gt;smoke).  Nicotine by itself, while not terribly harmful, is still a highly addictive vascular constrictor.  Not sure how long you were a smoker, but the addiction latches on pretty hard with some people - chemically and psychologically.  For the die hards, it&#39;s a great option.</p>

<p>Nicotine is not bad for you at all (unless you&#39;re drinking it like cool-aid or injecting it like saline). There isn&#39;t enough information for vaporizing the other ingredients to say either way, but traditionally, they are harmless...</p>

<p>It&#39;s a safe alternative to inhaling smoke (inhaling vapor).</p>
