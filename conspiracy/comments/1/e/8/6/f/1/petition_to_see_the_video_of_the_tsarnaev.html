        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">259</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-05-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/rand0mnewb.html">rand0mnewb</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am going to make a petition on <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">Whitehouse.gov</a> asking the Obama administration to release the video that depicts the suspect(s) droping the bag that allegedly has the bomb in it.</p>

<p>I will not assume they did or did not commit the crimes. I am simply asking the public be shown the proof. I want the petition to be very neutral so those who believe 100% they did it are willing to sign also. I will make the petition accurate, and articulate while maintaining ease of understanding for those who are not as well versed in communication.</p>

<p>Does anyone know the name of the restaurant that recorded the video footage? Does anyone have any information aside from the name of the establishment that you feel will help our case?</p>

<p>Please upvote this, i want to get as much input as possible to ensure everyone with any relevant information sees this. Please repost or cross post this to any subs you feel might have valid input. If you see anyone posting information that is clearly wrong please let me know. I will fact check everything to the best of my ability before making the petition but we all make mistakes, so all of you helping point out any disinformation will be greatly helpful.</p>

<p>I feel it should be easy to get the required 100k signers if all we want is the proof. If we do hit that mark and they refuse to release the video that will speak volumes about the legitimacy of any evidence they have. I would like to think if thats the case it would open some eyes as well.</p>

<p>EDIT: So, no word on the name of the restaurant. <del>How about this, did the footage come from near blast one, or blast 2?</del> It comes from blast site number two. Still unable to confirm the source of the footage.</p>

<p><del>It appears as though blast number one was between lenscrafters and the public library. I don&#39;t see any potential restaurants in that area that would have reasonably captured that video as evidence. Since i am unable to confirm the source of the video i guess ill have to leave that detail out.</del></p>

<p>EDITX2: &quot;The people of the United States of America have a vested interest in the release of surveillance footage that &quot;clearly&quot; shows the alleged suspect(s) placing a package at bombing site number two. There have been many wild rumors surrounding this case and the public would like to see this video. There have already been dozens of videos, pictures, and other proofs released, yet the single most compelling video the public would like to see has yet to be shown to us. There are many people who believe the brothers are innocent. There are also many people who believe the brothers are guilty. We believe releasing this video will be the most effective manner of quelling these public fears, and proving what so many already know as truth.&quot;</p>

<p><del>If you have any input feel free to post it as a response to any of my posts, or as a PM to me. Thanks in advance</del></p>

<p><del>Still working on body text for the petition. Wont be creating it tonight, but i haven&#39;t given up! Going to bed soon but i will return.</del></p>

<p>After several lengthy discussions with some fairly educated folks i&#39;ve decided it is in the best interest of all parties to wait to file this petition till after the trial provided it doesn&#39;t get released at that time. I won&#39;t forget about this, and will keep an eye out for the trial dates.</p>

I&#39;m sorry but wait til after the trial for all this bullshit if they don&#39;t release it. It is very crucial evidence, and that is not something they will just release to the public before the trial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, we will have to wait till then.  At that point we will be in a different crisis and will lose interest with that bullcrap.  That&#39;s how we do.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really agree.  I think we should let the chips fall where they may.  Let the accusations, allegations and speculations rain down upon us and we&#39;ll just have to sort it out.  This is solution in the problem reaction solution dynamic when we have media and government working so diligently to deceive.  It gets to the point where they can&#39;t tell the truth anymore about anything because instantly people would realize the level of deceit which has been going on for quite some time.  The contrast would be overwhelming between real truth and the pseudo-truth we are being fed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you are saying, but I am going to float a bit off the conspiracy bandwagon here and lean on the libertarian one for just a bit.  Our government has already screwed the pooch with this boys rights to due process.  My very biggest concern here is what people are doing to the Bill of Rights.  I do not think it is wise to bow to the pressure from the media (and yes, technically Reddit is media) to release evidence prematurely.  That would be another smack to his rights to a fair trial by a jury of his peers.  --Now this is all assuming that the boy is innocent.</p>

<p>If the boy is indeed connected to this crime--by violating his rights again, we would be making it easier for his defense attorney to get him off--scott free.  I really want to see that video too, but stuff needs to be done correctly here.</p>

<p>I&#39;d assume as this kind of FF would take so long to plan, they&#39;d have done this before the actual event, not after. So an extra 6 months really wont make any difference in terms of how legitimate the video is.</p>

<p>Contact either a lawyer who does freedom of information law, or Michael at Muckrock(he&#39;s not a lawyer but he knows what he&#39;s doing and has gotten some really controversial stuff released) about how you can get access to documentary evidence in a pending case. </p>

<p>There is a good chance that you won&#39;t be able to until it&#39;s actually introduced into evidence in the case, and then you&#39;ll probably have to contact the clerk of the district court of massachusetts. This page has information about how to get copies of materials in a criminal case file:

<p>If because its poorly written perhaps you could elaborate on what i could improve, putting your opinion aside (that doesn&#39;t mean i don&#39;t respect it). Like i said, i will looking into speaking with him, or at least reading his materials.</p>

<p>I maintain that this petition will probably do nothing, but its a first step, as much for me participating in the quest for truth as trying to get the video released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, too, would like to see this video released. When public officials go on record and blatantly lie about otherwise unmistakable things (finding a gun in the boat along with Dzhokhar, right down to the very make, only to later recant) causes me to inevitably question the validity of all their claims.</p>

<p>As fellow US Citizens, we should all be concerned about just this misinformation alone. </p>

<p>Another concerning factor are people who say, &quot;It&#39;s evidence! It can&#39;t be released.&quot; When I hear this, I think about police and investigators releasing video footage in other crimes. For example, a guy robs a gas station ... the footage is on the 9o&#39;clock news, no problem. </p>

<p>Is there a distinction between the two, and if so, what is the reasoning behind holding one vs the other?</p>

<p>Another observation pertaining to the FBI and their release of video... If they combed over all the video submissions, had been watching Tamerlan for years (including recording telephone conversations), no one on the entire task force looked in their database of potential Boston area terrorists before releasing the pictures of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan to all of the United States claiming they needed help identifying them? </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand a lot of this case.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>One is an act of national terrorism, one is misdemeanor theft. With a gas station robbery it&#39;s very much an open and shut case. X goes in to store, pulls out gun, demands money, leaves. With the Boston bombers, they&#39;ll be looking for other suspects for a start. They&#39;ll also be examining the tapes to see how they could get away with it. It was a huge breach of security, and one that shouldn&#39;t have happened. They&#39;ll want to make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again before letting everyone know just how they got away with it.</p>

<p>As they&#39;ve not given a reason (that I know of) for not releasing the footage yet, that&#39;s all we can do. </p>

<p>Although, I&#39;m not really sure why people want to see the footage. It&#39;s not our job to argue the case that he&#39;s guilty or innocent, that&#39;s the job of his defence attorney and the prosecutors. I have full faith that his attorney would do a better job than us armchair detectives.</p>

<p>This is my point though. The evidence wont be intangible or else his defence attorney would have had him out by now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what if he did drop a backpack?  That doesn&#39;t mean that he is guilty of what he&#39;s being accused of.</p>

<p>I believe there&#39;s a good chance he dropped a backpack.  I don&#39;t believe that he was knowingly part of a terrorist plot to light a bomb at the boston marathon.  And even if he was, I am certain that this goes a lot further than what we&#39;re being told.</p>

<p>I just think this is like focusing on the plane at the pentagon.  There isn&#39;t enough proof to make it the crux of the argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, but a lot of people will think it is fake because of the pixels and stuff. </p>

<p>Johnson was president until 1969 and Tom Hanks was born in 1956. Most people don&#39;t know that Tom was allowed to fight in Vietnam at 12 or that he was awarded the medal of honor at 13. I think it is because of how mature Tom looked at 13.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No but there was plenty of videos showing military airplanes hitting the trade center as well as multiple people in each video saying that wasn&#39;t a normal airliner. It looked military. Half the videos I saw when I was doing a major report on it during high school was taken down and my 20 page report had to be scrapped for agent orange during Vietnam. :-/</p>

<p>O, plus there&#39;s videos saying that the weapons we used in Iraq used depleted uranium and that a lot of people who used these weapons in our military will get sick and have mutated children. ;_;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Military airplanes generally have no markings, less windows, and big engines on the airplane. With that in mind, the videos that I found, forums I went too, news articles and eye witness reports, they all noticed a grey plane with no markings on it, no lines on the tail of the plane as well as no tail number. They also noticed that the planes looked too big to be commercial airplanes. There was one video were in a nearby building the whole office noticed that nobody was in the cock pit as it hit the 2nd tower as well as, again, no markings on the airplane and almost no windows on the side. I could go on but that&#39;s what I found in the few short months I did research on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how people do not understand this. Since the release that they had the video people have asked to see it. I&#39;m sorry but wait til after the trial for all this bullshit if they don&#39;t release it. It is very crucial evidence, and that is not something they will just release to the public before the trial.</p>
