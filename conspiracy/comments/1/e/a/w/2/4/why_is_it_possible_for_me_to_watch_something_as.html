       One (Reese Witherspoon) is not an ongoing investigation/trial, while the other (Boston Bombing) is still being investigated and the trial hasn't started.  In order to avoid contaminating the jury (more than it already is) and to ensure a "fair trial" it is better to not make public certain evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now while I wish it was public, I do understand the point.  But it does allow for evidence tampering or just to hide evidence that could contradict the "official" story.

       Not that it should matter, but the New Orleans shooter(s) trial (if there is one) will presumably be a state issue whereas the Boston trial is a federal issue.  It'd be interesting to see if there is anything comparable to the example you listed of the New Orleans shooter video being released before the trial and a comparable video being released when the matter would involve a federal issue/trial that had not taken place yet.

       Not necessarily. Here's some info on the case law in massachusetts on the investigatory materials exemption. If

        /u/CaptainHowdy43

       (f) Secret investigatory materials (sometimes): “investigatory materials necessarily compiled out of the public view by law enforcement or other investigatory officials the disclosure of which materials would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure would not be in the public interest.”  Often misused, this provision “does not … create a blanket exemption for all records that investigative officials create or maintain.”  “Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law” (Sec’y of State, rev. March 2009) at 15, citing District Attorney for the Norfolk District v. Flatley, 419 Mass. 507, 512 (1995), and WBZ-TV$ v. District Attorney for the Suffolk District, 408 Mass. 595, 603 (1990). Rather, it applies to three kinds of materials.  First, it covers “information relating to an ongoing investigation that could potentially alert suspects to the activities of investigative officials” (applicable only so long as the investigation is ongoing).  “Guide,” at 15. Second, it covers information that would reveal “confidential investigative techniques” the disclosure of which would prejudice future law enforcement efforts (applicable indefinitely).  Bougas v. Chief of Police of Lexington, 371 Mass. 59 62 (1976).  Third, and finally, it requires redaction of information, such as details in witness statements, “which if released create a grave risk of directly or indirectly identifying a private citizen who volunteers as a witness” (applicable indefinitely). Globe Newspaper Co. v. Boston Retirement Board, 388 Mass. 427, 438 (1983) (defining “identifying details” and “grave risk of indirect identification”). In each case, the custodian must demonstrate that there would be a prejudice to investigative efforts.The exemption may be employed “to allow for the redaction of the names and addresses of witnesses and victims or to remove information on the record which if released, will so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure would not be in the public interest.” SPR Bulletin 3-03, Public Record Requests and C.O.R.I. (Nov. 21, 2003) (noting, however, that Supervisor of Public Records “will not uphold any claim of an exemption if it is not substantiated by clear evidence”).

      <p>
       You don't necessarily need special forms, FOI requests are usually just in the format of a business letter. RCFP has automatic letter generators that you can use here:
       <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/foia">
        http://www.rcfp.org/foia
       </a>
       . It's best to enlist the help of a lawyer or somebody else experienced in FOI requests because public agencies will sometimes play a lot of games with their responses and deny things unjustifiably. I could also recommend some books if you're interested. Of course not everybody has time/money for lawyers/experts/books so you can just try the RFCP form letter if that's you.

      <p>
       Probably depends on the state. Every state has its own statute. The RFCP website is a good resource for researching that.
