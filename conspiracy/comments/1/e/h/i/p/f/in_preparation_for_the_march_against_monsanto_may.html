        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-05-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/danxmason.html">danxmason</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are several noted hazards in animal studies showing that GMO food is <a href="http://www.responsibletechnology.org/gmo-dangers">carcinogenic, allergenic, and mutagenic</a>. And yet, people eat GMO food every day despite there never having been a safety study in humans.</p>

<p>One human study, tested to see if GMO DNA was incorporated into human gut bacteria (this was not a safety study). This is known as <a href="http://www.i-sis.org.uk/hgthumangut.php">horizontal gene transfer and it was shown to occur</a>. Now, any time you eat a GMO product, you are at risk of having your own gut bacteria produce the antibiotic resistance proteins, the herbicide resistance proteins, the insecticide proteins, and novel proteins from the GMO product.</p>

<p>I thought Bt (insecticide) and Glyphosate (Round-up) were safe? Bt insecticide is <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032407_Bt_insecticide_GMOs.html">not safe for humans</a>. And even if it was, the Bt made in GMO foods is active, whereas the pesticide form is a pro-toxin (inactive). The pesticide can be washed off and degraded by the sun, but GMO Bt cannot. Also the concentrations are different. Glyphosate in round-up is also dangerous to humans by <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/14160">interfering with the P450 detox system</a>. Round-up ready GM farms use 2-5 times more round-up than non-GM farms.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t even address the fact that every time you shoot trasngenes into an organism, you cause massive collateral DNA damage. A single gene can create 38,000 proteins. Many proteins cannot be digested by the body and are extremely toxic, including prions and lectins. Do you think eating GMO corn and soy is worth the potential risk of mad cow disease? I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>But I thought GMO food helps feed the world? No. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/feb/16/india-rice-farmers-revolution">Organic farming will feed the world</a>. GMO farming will destroy it.</p>

<p>Why not just let the GMO grow and eat only organic? Like a free-market system? That would work if there <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=genetically-modified-crop">wasn&#39;t cross-pollination</a>. Once GMO DNA is in nature, it is nearly impossible to stop. Until all GMO food is banned world-wide, there will always be questions of safety.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a safe GMO. This statement holds true until we see several valid peer-reviewed large-scale double-blind randomized control safety trials in humans.</p>
