       I have noticed  there have been lots of posts about martial law, police state and cops going to homes kicking down the door and arresting people just because someone called the cops on them. My question is Whens does a citizen loose there rights when a cop investigates a complaint from another citizen.
 Lets say my neighbor calls the police on me for sitting in my front yard and tells them I am acting strange When do I loose my rights as a citizen for the police just to come and question me because of my neighbors suspicion. Say the cop comes and asks me what I am doing and I just get up and walk away do you think he will leave, most likely not. Most likely he will ask for ID and then say stop and yell or threaten me or taze me or hell even shoot me, But on what grounds does he have the right to talk to me. Am I missing something I understand cops have to check things out on a call but to what extinct. Its almost a grey area were if it were more defined it could help innocent victims from being prosecuted for being innocent. If you have any opinions feel free to help me determine some answer for these victimless crimes.

       Unfortunately this doesn't address what someone should do when they are confronted on their own property doing nothing. The best thing to do, is to go inside, lock yourself inside and if the cops insist on talking to you, talk through the window. Say "Sorry, I don't talk to the police. If you have a warrant for my arrest, please show it through the window. Otherwise, I am sorry." Repeat ad nauseum.

       None of that will prevent the police from kicking in your door and tasering you if that's what they came to do. Unfortunately, the best course of action when this happens is unclear. Judging by recent incidents, your only hope is to be filming it and hope that it gets published and goes viral after the fact.

       So, when the police come to your house because your neighbor called in a perfectly legitimate noise complaint about your dog, you think the best response is to hide in your house and talk through the window?

         Officer of the law can  ask you to identify yourself.You must identify yourself. If you do not identify yourself, then they have reasonable suspicion of you.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You also have the right to have that officer identify himself before you have to give him your name.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have the right to refrain from saying things that will be and can be used against you  in court or in Officer hearsay notes, everything you say will be used against you! And that is everything.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You can answer the Officer's requests politely.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He cannot enter your house without a search warrant. The reasonable test is that, unless someone cries for help inside your house, or if someone calls for a crime., in which case he would have a warrant to enter. If you cooperate, then he has to get a warrant.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Politely ask for the warrant, if he wants to search your property. Again anything you Utter will be used against you.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You should ask the officer if you are under arrest( this important, often they  will accuse you of avoiding arrest, when you were never informed of the intended arrest).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         IF you are not under arrest, you have the right to excuse yourself. Communicate this to the officer.  he should let you go, or let you know that you are being detained.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If  the Officer asks you to wait for more questions. At this point, regardless of your innocence.  It is imperative that you say  nothing and ask for a lawyer.The Officer must stop questioning you when you request lawyer, and provide you a way to contact  this said lawyer.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The officer is still permitted to ask you question, DO NOT VOLUNTEER ANSWERS. Remain Silent. This is very important.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Consult your lawyer.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do not Answer any police questions at this point.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have the right to say nothing. Remain silent.

       Can't stress this enough. Lots of people think they can outsmart a professional almost exclusively trained to trip you up and incriminate yourself. You won't win by talking. Only by shutting your big fat trap can you hope to even come to a stalemate.

       Best cop advice I ever got came from what Leguizamo says in "Empire";

       <p>
        Keep your mouth shut.
       </p>
       <p>
        Close off your mind. Try to relax. Don't listen.

       <p>
        Everything they say is a lie.

        They'll tell you they got witnesses, that your boys turned on you.

       <p>
        All lies.

       This depends on where you live. Here in Arizona a cop can ask for ID, but I am only required to provide it if I am driving a vehicle, or being charged of a crime. Otherwise you are free to simply refuse to answer their questions. It is not a crime to refuse contact with a police officer unless you are being charged of a crime.

       If a cop sees you crawling into a window at 3am - even if it IS your window, meaning you aren't committing a crime- they are doing the right thing when they demand you show you have a reason and right to be crawling into a window at 3am.

       So, if a cop sees someone crawling into your bedroom window at 3am he should just mind his own business and keep driving?

       First off, let's try to keep the argument coherent.  Our simulated event was someone climbing into their own house at 3 am, and being spotted by the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, we need to realize that an "authority figure" requesting your ID is a search of your papers and person.  Our Bill of Rights explicitly states that no search may be granted, but upon probable cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police work on a system of reasonable suspicion of which leads to investigation which might or might not lead to probable cause.  If a cop sees me climbing into my window at 3 am, he has reasonable suspicion.  He has the right to question my actions, but not complying with his request for my ID is not grounds for probable cause.  This has been proven in court time and time again.

       No, but guess what is? Climbing into windows in the middle of the night. Probable cause is not some set thing defined in stone.  It is the extrapolation of a subjective perspective supported by circumstances.  If you see someone climbing into windows at 3am, it is reasonable to suspect that they are committing a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, climbing into windows in the middle of the night is enough to give police officers -acting reasonably and prudently- the right to see your proof that you have the right to be crawling into that particular window. In other words, your ID showing that the window in question is your own.  Why would you even need to get confrontational about it?

       I never said I would be rude or disrespectful to the police officer, but as you said climbing into a window at 3am is REASONABLE SUSPICION, not PROBABLE CAUSE.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I decided to run from the police that would be a whole different ballgame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's continue our little story.  Let's say I am half way in the window.  One leg in and the other out.  A cop rolls up to the curb and shines his light on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would I do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well if it's my house I would probably want to know why the cops are shining their bright ass spotlight on my house.  Being that I am a reasonable man, I would probably understand what the situation might look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if I am climbing through my window at 3 am, I think I might have lost my key and maybe even my wallet.  Hell, they might have been stolen from me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I would proceed to engage the police officers in a stable, reassuring, and non combative way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would probably say something like, "It's OK, I just (locked myself out... lost my keys... )" whatever reason.  I would probably wave at them and tell them that I would meet them at the door.  Regardless of what the cops say at this point I would enter my house and meet them at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would answer their questions politely and levelheaded.  At some point I would probably reasure them that everything is OK, and that I would be going to bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, tact plays a huge role when dealing with the police.

       Look - please understand this. If the cops catch you crawling into a window, they have the right to
       <strong>
        immediately
       </strong>
       apprehend you. There should be no doubt about this whatsoever.   If that is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       your home, then they are endangering every person in the building by allowing an unidentified person to enter it.  This is something that happens in the real world
       <strong>
        all the time
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If some guy broke into your house and stole all your shit because he "waved the cops away from the front door" you would be screaming bloody murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bar for probable cause is not as high as you seem to think it is, and ultimately, it would be a judge's decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I suggest that you do a ride-along? Pretty much every police department in the country allows civilians to do a ride-along.  Just say you want to learn more about police work. It will give you a much better idea than some random website about "sovereignity".

       Understand this, we are talking about what is legal, and what is Constitutional.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is absolutely no law, here in AZ, that states you can not enter your house from a window, at any hour.  Nor is there a law that states that I must show ID upon request by a law man.  Unless I am driving a vehicle or being charged with a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, no law was broken.  If I refused, or couldn't show ID, and the cop arrested me (charged me of a crime); at that point I would be required by law to show ID, and would most likely be let go.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point a formal complaint would be filed with the department.  Why?  As I said before, refusing to show ID to the police is not evidence, in which probable cause is based.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might believe this to be unfortunate but, the police have no obligation to protect you or your shit.  In most instances, unless there is a complaint by a neighbor, or an active search going on most cops wouldn't look twice.  I kinda like it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exercising my right to not have my personal items, which includes my identity, search by the man is not criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and one more thing, if it happened at my house, it would all be recorded.

       What country do you live in, man, and on what planet?  Do you not understand that day in and day out police officers across the country are working to protect people's safety? Taking women from abusers, arresting drunk drivers, catching and gathering evidence against rapists - police work is not about you and your fantasy struggle against the man.

       All people like you end up doing is misinforming lots of people with their absolute misunderstandings of law and police procedure.  If you think it's "wrong" to ID people climbing into windows, I just don't know how to correct your error.  Your understanding of constitutional law and criminal proceedings is profoundly flawed. That is all.

       Again: go for a ride-along.  Meet some real cops. See what their day-to-day is like.  Ask an attorney what he or she thinks would happen if the cops came across you breaking into a house and you refused to identify yourself.  Ask the cops!

       Calling you a shill is not a desperate act admitting defeat. Actually, it's more of a description. You are shilling for the police and the establishment, no? I never said you were "in on it", but then again to me you're just some jackhole on the internet.

       Some states have stop and identify statutes. If you live in one of these states, you should familiarize yourself with what your local law requires of you:

       Do not disobey any physical orders, or physically resist anything, or fight the police, even if they seem unreasonable or a violation of your rights. One exception: depending on the circumstances and the state law, there might be times it might be in your best interested to NOT cooperate with tests or directions that relate to your sobriety. You should consult an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction on this if you are worried about police hassling you for sobriety-related issues in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides asking questions like "Am I under arrest or am I free to go?" or "Is that an order or may I refuse that request?" do not make any statements. In fact, as soon as possible you should invoke your right to remain silent, whether you think you are under arrest or not. Since 2010, you actually
       <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/01/AR2010060102114.html">
        must speak to invoke this right
       </a>
       actually remaining silent is not enough and cops can continue to ask you questions even if you are not answering them until you say "I am invoking my right to remain silent."
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not consent to anything. Questions phrased as "Do you mind..." or "Would you mind ..." are questions which you may answer "I do mind, and I don't consent to that."
      </p>
      <p>
       Police don't have to show you warrants. People think they do, but they don't. The warrant just needs to exist somewhere. Some police departments have policies of bringing warrants when they execute searches and some don't bother. Don't get too worked up about it in the moment if they say there is a warrant but they don't have a copy. Just investigate it later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops may lie, and they frequently do, and it does not really taint any evidence they gather.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entrapment probably doesn't mean what you think it means. Very little is actually entrapment. Undercover police do not have to say they are police if you ask them.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - Do not talk to cops. Do not resist arrest or disobey lawful orders. If your rights are violated, have a lawyer deal with that after the fact.

       So basically if a cop is called to my residents for NO reason besides a citizens intuition I can either answer his questions,  invoke my right to remain silent and hope he leaves or stand up and walk away and hope I don't get tackled. TL;DR- Do not sit outside in the front yard for fear of being arrested because of a neighbors intuition.

       I am assuming you live in the USA. That being the case. You have no rights, until you have been arrested, prosecuted and appeal to a higher court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amiright?
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn term 'custodial interrogation' . Because of this term you must immediately request, vocally, to be mirandized and then remain silent. If at any point you utter a sound after requesting to be mirandized you will have waived your miranda rights. That is your law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA law enforcement agencies are not required by law to mirandize you, even upon arrest, unless you request to be mirandized. That is your law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you are being arrested when accosted by a law enforcement agent you are  deemed in  a 'custodial situation', that being said you are always free to leave but that will not prevent them for arresting you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, 1) request to be mirandized 2) STFU 3) walk away.
      </p>
      <p>
       forcing them to arrest you for no reason is the only option you have. But then again... NDAA. Amiright?

       Yeah, but he invoked his rights and then blurted something out in response to something that wasn't interrogation. The point is that unless you are in (1)in custody and (2)being interrogated, Miranda doesn't do anything. So if they don't read you Miranda warnings AT ALL and then you decide to make a spontaneous confession because the silence is so awkward....that's voluntary and admissible.

       Because the police just violated your rights, because the courts have placed them above the law, and they have every expectation that you do not understand the law as it pertains to your innocence and their operational parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your best defense is to educate yourself about your rights to a level where you can present this knowledge in a calm and expedient manner in front of menacing shocktroops. It may mean the difference between a scary afternoon and a life-ruining experience.
