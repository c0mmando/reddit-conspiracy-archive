    <div class="md"><p>To me it seems most of the stuff is actually the same conspiracy. Government cover up. Definitely not my favorite because I hate it. </p>

<p>As for incident I&#39;d say 9/11 because of its timing at the &quot;rise&quot; of the information age and the extremely scientific approach you can use. Also because it has been such a catalyst for many changes the past decade. And it truly is a global one. If that gets exposed pretty much every person in the developed countries would be affected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose &quot;realistic&quot; would be equivalent to &quot;substantiated by valid evidence&quot;. In this case, of the conspiracy theories popular &#39;round these parts (the kind not publicly acknowledged by the majority of people), of those that I find most interesting, the one that is most substantiated by valid evidence is the theory that the CIA conspired to assassinate JFK.</p>

<p>The theory i find most interesting without any concern about valid evidence is the story of John Titor and his &quot;time machine&quot;, the fundamental physics of which were discovered by scientists working at the LHC around now or sometime in the near future. Actually, I&#39;m not even sure that qualifies as a conspiracy. hmm.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Conspiracies are meant to be wild stretches of imaginative lunacy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure i agree with that. I mean, some of them are obviously way out there, like the philadelphia experiment or hollow earth, etc. But conspiracies happen all the time, and conspiracy theories are just perceptions that a group have performed an act in secret. Criminals get charged with conspiracy in courtrooms. Governments claim other governments (or groups) conspire to do things. I believe in the conspiracy that advertisers try to deceive the public about the value of the product they&#39;re selling.</p>

<p>The border between what conspiracy theories seem reasonable and which are wild stretches of imaginative lunacy is fairly blurry, and though the conspiracy theory community as a whole is not often responsible for hard-hitting investigative journalism (in aggregate it&#39;s actually a lot of noise and fear and confusion), members of that community occasionally are.</p>
