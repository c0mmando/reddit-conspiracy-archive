        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The new Xbox Sensor seems to me, too be cleverly and secretly linked to the Government.</p>

<p>After some research the Xbox doesn&#39;t always need to be connected to the internet, but it does at some stage of set up. That tells me that they want to know your Internet password, so when your Xbox is &quot;off&quot; they can enable the camera and internet connection, recording everything you do and then sending the data across the internet. </p>

<p>Its simple, if you think about it, the Government want to know what you are always up too, so why not introduce a fun, spying on you, console?</p>

<p>I believe Microsoft work with the Government because of the way they bought Skype, when they didn&#39;t need too.</p>

<p>Too me this all makes sense, thoughts on the conspiracy from you guys would be awesome!</p>

<p>Edit (1:26pm): After some more thought to this, the Microphone could be the key. It could work on keywords, where once said, automatically triggers a recording device to receive the data? What do you think to that?</p>

<p>Edit (4:25pm): Excuse my lack of terms, I wrote this out quickly trying to work. I may have made a misunderstanding for some people when I mentioned &quot;your Internet Password&quot;. They wouldn&#39;t need too, to be honest.</p>

<p>Edit (9.39pm): There has been a lot of comments, some negative, but mainly people interested in other things they could be doing. A major one is Kinect being able to check your heartbeat, what do you all think about that?</p>

<p>Edit (10:44pm): People are unsure about what I meant by Microsoft buying Skype. This is another conspiracy but I believe they were paid the money by the Government, to make a purchase of Skype in order to see more about you, hear your calls and see what you type, easier. This is just a conspiracy again so don&#39;t be mad as me please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest, I am amazed that no one else seems to be talking about this. I am extremely creeped out by the notion that Microsoft wants to put a camera and a microphone in my living room. People can can say oh sure but your phone has one and so does your computer, okay, but they aren&#39;t designed to be able to, for example, measure my heartbeat or count how many people are in the room. Although Microsoft hasn&#39;t specifically commented on the always on or always online rumours, the microphone will at least be on at all times, how else would it know when you said, &#39;Xbox on&#39;. </p>

<p>And I wouldn&#39;t put it past either party (Gov&#39;t or Microsoft) to sieze the opportunity to partner up and peer into your life. It&#39;s unsettling for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the government is feeling bold enough to openly spy on AP reporters, you can bet your personal shennigans are already on the docket to be found suspect and recorded. </p>

<p>Kinect was a direct opposition to any freedom loving individual in the first place. The Kinect 2 is the logical progression of such a device as created under the dictates of an openly fascist Corporatocrasy, and it defintely looks the part - <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kinect-2-for-Xbox-One-640x353.jpg">logo, all seeing eye, and not much else</a>. They&#39;ve got your grocery receipts, they&#39;ve got your phone records, they&#39;ve got your pictures and all your connections to friends family and enemies. </p>

<p><strong>But that&#39;s not enough.</strong> </p>

<p>They want to know when you sleep when you eat when you have sex what content you watch and play who comes to your door who sells you pot how much alcohol you drink how many non consumers you shelter to and who hates the government the most in your household. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This week, Judge Kaplan in the southern district of New York concluded that the &#39;roving bugs&#39; were legally permitted to capture hundreds of hours of conversations because the FBI had obtained a court order and alternatives probably wouldn&#39;t work. The FBI&#39;s &#39;applications made a sufficient case for electronic surveillance,&#39; Kaplan wrote. &#39;They indicated that alternative methods of investigation either had failed or were unlikely to produce results, in part because the subjects deliberately avoided government surveillance.&#39;&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, if we take this to mean a software install, the software would have to make the phone shutdown sequence turn off the screen, but not really turn the phone off (at least the microphone and 2G radio and CPU would have to remain on).  The phone battery would last a week at most (more likely ~2 days).  Right now, it you turn off your phone, the battery will probably last a few years.</p>

<p>I could also buy that many phones may be programmed to periodically wake up like every day or something just to check whether to switch to spying mode, then shutting off.  But being immediately able to spy on an &quot;off&quot; phone without such a timer or having obvious battery drain on turned-off phones isn&#39;t possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>alright...  let me see if i get this right...</p>

<p>when the battery is in the phone, it is getting some power to basic components.  the main board has to be getting some reduced power, even when it&#39;s off.  when you press the power button, it doesn&#39;t complete a power circuit to the phone the way a light switch does to a light bulb, instead, it send a signal to the phone telling it to begin the boot up procedure.  the same is true of all computerized devices.  computers have a feature called &quot;Wake on LAN&quot; that allows other networked devices to send the boot-up instruction to the computer, same as pressing the power button.  the network card in a computer will also be receiving reduced power when the computer is technically turned off, so that it can still receive these commands.  (Wake on LAN is disabled by default on most motherboards, so all you tinfoil hat wearers can relax.)</p>

<p>i&#39;m not sure how this applies to cell phones.  on the one hand, as long as the battery is in it, the phone is getting power, and presumably some kind of &quot;Wake on LAN&quot; technology could be implemented to turn the phone on from a network.  however, i would assume cell phone manufacturers wouldn&#39;t want their customers batteries to run down while the phone is turned off, so i would assume they would cut power to the antenna while the phone is off.  if the antenna isn&#39;t getting power, the phone can&#39;t communicate over a network.</p>

<p>in short, while i&#39;m sure smartphones could have a &quot;wake on LAN&quot; feature, it sounds like it would be detrimental to the customer, so most phone manufactures would not design phones with this feature enabled.  but i&#39;m not positive.</p>

<p>the only thing i am positive of, is that if that phone is outside of the reach of a cell tower or WiFi signal, even if it&#39;s turned on no government or corporation can communicate with it.  GPS track it, yeah, but send and receive data, no. </p>

<p>&quot;This week, Judge Kaplan in the southern district of New York concluded that the &#39;roving bugs&#39; were legally permitted to capture hundreds of hours of conversations because the FBI had obtained a court order and alternatives probably wouldn&#39;t work. The FBI&#39;s &#39;applications made a sufficient case for electronic surveillance,&#39; Kaplan wrote. &#39;They indicated that alternative methods of investigation either had failed or were unlikely to produce results, in part because the subjects deliberately avoided government surveillance.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>this is a false statement, and one that obviously comes from a place of ignorance of computers and networking technology.</p>

<p>let me ask you, how, exactly, is microsoft supposed to communicate with an xbox in order to turn it on and download information from it, if that xbox has no network connection, indeed no way to connect to it from the outside world at all?</p>

<p>microsoft would have no way of communicating with an xbox that has no internet connection.  period.  </p>

<p>which is why they designed the xbox so that it must connect to the internet at least once every 24 hours.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>tell me, could you dial 911 from an unactivated phone from the moon?  how about Antarctica?  how about the bottom of the marianas trench?  the answer is &quot;No&quot; to all of the above.  </p>

<p>NO computer CAN EVER communicate with ANY other computer (xbox, phone, laptop, desktop, server, google glass, microwave, etc...) without a network, and some communication medium.  </p>

<p>if you have an xbox plugged into the power outlet, but you live in the hills of montana, and there&#39;s no internet access at your house, that xbox will never, EVER be able to communicate with microsoft&#39;s servers.  period.  don&#39;t argue with me on this point, cause it&#39;s moot, and you&#39;ll just end up making yourself look like an idiot.  </p>

<p>unfortunately, microsoft designed the new xbox so that if you DON&#39;T connect it to the internet AT LEAST once every 24 hours, you will lose any and all ability to perform any function on the machine.  it is intentionally broken in order to force the end user to comply to the rules.  this is the scary part.</p>

<p>besides, until just recently (the last 2 comments) your argument has been &quot;microsoft can connect to the xbox even if the xbox isn&#39;t connected to any network.&quot;  which is patently false.  you&#39;ve only just recently (within the last 2 comments) changed your argument to &quot;well, they&#39;re going to have a cell data transceiver in there!&quot;  and you base this belief on exactly zero evidence.  </p>

<p>if, and i mean IF microsoft puts a cell data card in the xbox without advertising or announcing it, that would be a pretty big deal, but we network techs WILL find it within the first few days of release.  but that&#39;s a big &quot;IF,&quot;  and not even the basis of your argument until you finally realized that no, computers cannot communicate without a network.  just admit when you&#39;re wrong.  it&#39;s not that hard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google&#39;s Nexus 7 tablet had the 3g/cell chip on board at release (Broadcom).  No mention of this was really made at the time.  On the second release they then announced a lower price and 3g capabilities.  The full hardware system didn&#39;t change much, if at all.  I doubt anything sinister was involved, but my point is that the hardware is readily available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if we crack open the xbox one and find a GSM / CDMA transceiver, then it will have network capabilities other than LAN / WiFi.  but my point stands, ANY computer needs a network connection to connect to ANY other computer, <a href="/u/chainednmaimed">/u/chainednmaimed</a> is under the impression that you plug the power into the xbox and suddenly it can talk to microsoft&#39;s servers without ANY network connection.  he&#39;s an idiot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t disagreeing, just adding some information.  But, technically, depending on your definition of &quot;network&quot;, there are many other ways than ethernet/gsm/cdma to transmit/receive communications.

    <div class="md"><p>well yeah, they&#39;ve talked about making lightbulbs that could transmit data through inperceivable fluctuations in light frequency, but they are by no means industry standard.  quantum networks are just around the corner, and they would enable communication between any 2 points in space without any medium between the 2 computers, but this is still within the realm of science fiction, and even when the technology does exist it will be limited by cost to only major corporations and governments, not to be included in every teenagers xbox.</p>

<p>if the xbox wants to communicate with microsoft&#39;s servers it will HAVE to do it through one of the currently accepted, industry standard means, cat5/cat5e/cat6 ethernet, WiFi, fiber, cat3 phone line, or cell network.  the belief that all an xbox will need is a power cord in order to communicate data to and from microsoft is laughable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So living in Seattle, I know someone who works on the Xbox development team. He told me last year that the current Kinect system listens in and takes random pictures of you and the surrounding area. They can see the clothes you wear and the furniture in your room and send you tailored advertisements. This new system is obviously far better and will do a lot more of the same. I have since purchased a privacy cover for my current Kinect. Although Xbox One does everything I want it to do and then some, I am in a debacle with the constant use of video recognition. But Dish and Comcast are installing small cameras into their boxes as well... We will be forced to conform if we want cool things. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>does it really matter if you have it plugged in to the internet ever?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes.  there would be no way for the xbox to transfer recorded data to microsoft&#39;s servers without a network connection.  however, the xbox is designed to not let you play any games unless you connect it to the internet at least once every 24 hours.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>could they not simply turn on your camera like they can do with a cell phone. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>the cell phone still needs a network connection in order for the government or a corporation  to access it, or the data on it.  if you were stranded on a desert island with no cell towers within hundreds of miles there would be no way for you to call out, and no way for the government or any corporation to see your whereabouts or connect to the phone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all it has to do is have the hardware inside and they can connect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wrong, there also must be a method of connection, be it WiFi or a cell tower.  this is why i wouldn&#39;t have a problem with all of the xbox&#39;s new &quot;features,&quot; as long as they let me use it offline.  but since microsoft REQUIRES the xbox to be connected at least once a day, there&#39;s no guarantee they won&#39;t use that window of opportunity to download relevant data from your xbox.  </p>

<p>if i were using MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-2, then yes, my communications would be much more vulnerable to decryption in a man-in-the-middle attack.  SHA-256 is the latest and greatest, it&#39;s what the military uses, and it&#39;s what i use. </p>

<p>Here you reveal that, in fact, you have zero understanding of this topic.  SHA256 does not use a private key.  That&#39;s all there is to that.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the proof of this is laying in plain site for any person who thinks of where to look.</p>

<p>The reason these are all still in use by the govt is multifold.  The first and foremost reason is simple: allowing people to believe they enjoy the protection of &quot;encryption&quot; entices them to speak freely while being monitored.</p>

<p>Not at all.  I&#39;m not worried about me, I&#39;m worried about someone or something else.  And this entity is already actively being &quot;gotten at,&quot; there is no question that this entity is presently in danger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, why are you talking about symmetric ciphers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because SHA256 isn&#39;t an encryption method to begin with.  Furthermore, public/private key cryptography is typically used for symmetric key exchange.  This is how TLS/SSL work, for example.  Thus, the post about using an Ubuntu server to encrypt various chat methods was really a comment about using symmetric cyphers.  Unfortunately, the person making the comment did not realize that, and it seems you don&#39;t either.</p>

<p>It is almost unheard of for the actual cypherstream to be encrypted with the public/private key, because that is too slow.</p>

<p>In other words, for &quot;secure communication on the internet&quot; it all boils down to whether, e.g., AES is secure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you not realize that, by the nature of us being anonymous internet users, nothing we say has any meaning whatsoever if not backed up by sources?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree.  You can ignore me and continue to believe that encryption keeps your secrets from the U.S. government, or you can take me at my word and behave in a way that is actually safer for you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your choice to determine that I&#39;m not a credible enough source for you, but that doesn&#39;t mean everybody will make the same wrong choice that you do.</p>

<p>As for the proof, when it comes out you will understand what or whom I am protecting at the moment.</p>

<p>And as for &quot;them getting me,&quot; all I can say is that I am unconcerned on that front, to say the least.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t &quot;wipe the floor&quot; with someone by saying...</p>

<p>That was in the context of talking math, which nobody here is doing yet.  I&#39;m not starting because then presumably I would be explaining the thing I&#39;m not explaining.  If you want to bring up some math, I can respond to that, sure.</p>

<p>Anyway, you&#39;re baiting me into saying more than I should, and it&#39;s not like you have any particular credibility, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other news, I&#39;ve developed a wonderful perpetual motion machine, constructed out of a few pieces of plywood joined together into a wheel. The principles behind it are obvious to everybody who is anybody. I can&#39;t give out the secret, because my friends in government would be assassinated if I did that. The only reason people believe in &quot;conservation of energy&quot; is that oil companies want to make you think you need them. You&#39;re just going to have to trust me on this.</p>

<p>Well, you claimed that SHA256 (and all hashes) are broken, which is a separate issue from whether AES is secure.</p>

<p>You can ignore me and continue to believe that encryption keeps your secrets from the U.S. government, or you can take me at my word and behave in a way that is actually safer for you.</p>

<p>In theory, but no intelligent person would trust a random anon&#39;s word over sourced math. Heck, I wouldn&#39;t even trust a random anon&#39;s word over the government&#39;s, without sources. Why would anybody in their right mind consider you a credible source? </p>

<p>You&#39;re the one who&#39;s bringing up extraordinary claims. I&#39;m not going to go through all the math behind SHA and every other hashing or crypto algorithm waiting for you to say something.</p>

<p>It is amusing that you seem to believe that various cryptographic methods have been mathematically proven secure.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Go find these proofs and provide some citations.  This waste of your time will be good for the rest of us.</p>

<p>FTFY.</p>

<p>Considering that P != NP hasn&#39;t been proven, you&#39;ve got nowhere to begin.  I really don&#39;t have time to waste on you.  Of course most agree that P != NP, but I would like you to please cite a proof for that.  There, I started with the math.  Show me a proof that P != NP.</p>

<p>Of course not. However, proving them <em>insecure</em> is something lots of people try to do all the time, and there&#39;s lots of incentive to publicize it. Previous methods have been shown to have vulnerabilities, and new methods have been developed.</p>

<p>Security is always best when algorithms are publicly available for everyone to pick through. Unless you have anything at all to back up your assurance that SHA256 (and everything else, apparently) is broken, I&#39;ll trust the scientific consensus over a random anon. </p>

<p>They keywords thing I&#39;m sure is quite real, but almost without a doubt suffers from a massive amount of false positives, and thus is probably limited to a subset of actual communications over select social networks(probably just private messages).

    <div class="md"><p>To all worried about this being a tool for spying. I know there are so tech savvy people on reddit. I propose you build some device that can identify when data is being collected from the mic/camera, place this in between the kinnect and xbox or/and between the xbox and network connection. Once completed randomly say things that you think might instigate a spying session over a period of time and see if you console tries to communicate. I wouldn&#39;t expect immediate results as this is a brand new console if any. I do however think that some testing is in order before accusations are thrown. I&#39;m not saying MS wouldn&#39;t do this, I&#39;m saying this is something that you can test. I&#39;d even go one step further and disassemble to box to ensure there isn&#39;t a cell radio making a network connection unneeded. Look at all the angles before you panic. One more thought, if this behavior was thought of by the manufacturer than this same practice should be conducted on later models of the xbox one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any and all devices that transmit audio or video information can be turned on remotely by the &quot;man&quot;! Cell phones, laptops, TVs and now the xbox. The only way to know that it is not happening is too remove the microphone or the camera or take the battery out and remove it&#39;s power source. Adobe announced a &quot;subscription service&quot; recently so instead of selling self contained programs like photoshop you can buy the subscription that will need an internet hookup for &quot;updates&quot;...remember this is the company that wanted to secretly install code that would send a message to the FBI when someone scanned &quot;money&quot; into photoshop...they are all working for the government...they are not allowed to tell anyone that they are working with the government otherwise they would go to prison.

    <div class="md"><p>just noticed your edits op... I said the same thing..the application is already being used by the DHS in regards to trigger words in search engines and social media, and then stored in a database...I&#39;m guessing there is an algorithm used to see how many words are used, and in what context, but I don&#39;t have info as to that.... also, the FBI can tap into people&#39;s phone mics when they aren&#39;t even on the phone...both instances are well documented and not some batshit conjured up conspiracy.... but you&#39;ll get those that say no way no how, and they&#39;re we&#39;re all tinfoil reptiliians if we believe that... when in fact, its already being done..lmao</p>

<p>as far as heart beat, no idea...I haven&#39;t seen anything to support it, not sure if the heat sensor can tap into that somehow, dunno...</p>

<p>as far as them buying into Skype, I don&#39;t buy  it that thats why microsoft got it... not buying that  one bit as someone could go to jail and the company would suffer tremendously if it was ever proven...now, as to gov&#39;t using the patriot act in order to tap into the kinect&#39;s video application..thats the same as the cell phone mic thing, and yes, they could do that as well</p>

<p>I doubt they are actually working WITH the gov&#39;t, but since we have the Patriot Act, the gov&#39;t doesn&#39;t need a warrant to go to microsoft and have them tap into someone&#39;s video call or camera/mic, etc.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t believe that the new xboxes will actively be monitoring every single household that has one.  that would be too much data even for the government or microsoft to try to store and sort through.</p>

<p>what i am worried about is this:  lets say you become a &quot;person of interest&quot; for one reason or another, like maybe you said &quot;fuck obama&quot; on facebook.  well, suddenly a law enforcement office wants to know more about you.  so they get a warrant, and a subpoena, and begin harvesting your information from various sources.  facebook, twitter, google, and your internet service provider all GLADY hand over information.  but what if it&#39;s not enough?  well, now they can do more than just see what you&#39;ve been doing on computers.  now they can use that subpoena to have a live audio / video uplink to your living room to see if you&#39;re smoking a bowl or doing anything else that would warrant jack booted thugs breaking down your door, shooting your dog, ransacking your house, and locking you up for 10 years.  </p>

<p>Protip: if they cared about knowing who is smoking a bowl, your door would have already been kicked in.

Before taking into account external peripherals, remote receiver, HDMI input, the more constrained form factor, or kinect.  Then you get to the Kinect itself.  The night vision camera on it is far better than what the military has on helicopters. I bet if you gave it a portable power source it could also replace a $4000 FLIR.</p>

<p>I know the XBOX is supposed to be subsidized by live memberships and games.  5 years of live gold, even at full retail is only $300.  And this is supposed to be MS&#39;s cash cow.  Maybe it is government subsidized for the surveillance use.</p>
