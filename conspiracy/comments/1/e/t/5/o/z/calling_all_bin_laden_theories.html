<p>I&#39;ll start.</p>

<p>The most wanted terrorist of all time and we dump his body in the ocean!?  I&#39;m not saying we parade the body around like a trophy but dumping it like that smells like, &quot;quick, stash it here, they&#39;ll never know.&quot;</p>

<p>I could go on, with many tangents, you first.</p>

<p>**This was my first post, thanks to the people who shared, this was fun.  By the bye: bin Laden was a Saudi national, the first arrest in the Boston Bomber had Saudi connections, any thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it isn&#39;t designed to do anything, it&#39;s a perfectly reasonable question.  The fact is that you have no reasonable response, which is why you ignored it and pretended that I had some ulterior motives.  But I have no interest in asking you for &quot;proof&quot; that he died in 2001, and was not going there.</p>

<p>I would like to know why you believe a report from 2001 by Fox News but wholly disbelieve similar reports by the same organization (and also by more well-respected outlets than Fox News) from a decade later, with far more rigorous reporting, more reliable witnesses, and far greater detail a decade later?  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>you have no reasonable response</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite the contrary. The 2001 FOX article about OBL&#39;s death was based on a Pakistan Observer report citing a Taliban official. No proof of him being alive has ever surfaced since then. FOX News articles on OBL&#39;s &quot;death&quot; in 2011 cited US politicians, one of whom was Obama as he was gunning for reelection. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>far more rigorous reporting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Western MSM is under much more government control today than it was in 2001. They either say what they&#39;re told to say or they lose their status and their access to government officials (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Thomas#Resignation_controversy">Helen Thomas</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>more reliable witnesses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Politicians and government lackeys? You&#39;ve got to be kidding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>far greater detail</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what you get when a magician plans a complex illusion.</p>

<p>What it all comes down to is whether one believes a subordinate of bin Laden that had nothing to gain or a politician whose re-election  was at risk. I tend to lean towards the former. Especially when the only &#39;evidence&#39; released for the 2011 &#39;death&#39; turned out to be <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/galleryoffakebinladens.php">photoshopped images</a>.</p>

<p>Now go back to r/conspiratard. I&#39;m not responding again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That I do not know. But more on Bin Laden. Wasn&#39;t he in a us controlled hospital the day of 9/11? We all know he was a CIA agent in the 80s. His family has ties in the oil biz with the bin laden family. All videos of him these past years show him getting younger(lol). And it just so happens a reporter found the initial tape tying him to 9/11 days? after 9/11. You gotta remember, the 9/11 myth was forged within an hour or so of the initial attack. The &quot;structural damage&quot;, the Al Qaeda ties. Last week someone posted a video tying Israel to the attacks which is one of the most compelling piece on the subject I&#39;ve ever seen. Remember also, in time, high up Saudis were found to be responsible for funding the attacks. When relatives of victims banded together and tried to sue, Obama made it illegal, TWICE. Even when insurance agencies who paid out billions have not been allowed to sue. How much of a coincidence is it that most recently, the Saudi/Boston deal? Hmmm  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama has already proved he was willing to wipe his ass with the constitution in order to get re-elected. Its all circumstantial evidence, but there&#39;s enough that it&#39;s plausible that he&#39;s still alive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do read the mainstream outlets, but only through a filter. These outlets are all owned by six different organizations, Time Warner, Walt Disney, Viacom, News Corp., CBS Corporation and NBC Universal. In reality they are a cartel that stick to the same talking points. So I consider MSM as a single source, and alternative media as individual sources deserving of the same scrutiny. </p>

<p>What infuriates me about the MSM is they toe the line for governments, rarely ask good questions, and they spend too much time on nonsense stories like Jodi Arias. These organizations are just as unreliable, if not more unreliable, than alternative sites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider myself a strong skeptic, but one thing we (conspiracy believers and skeptics) almost all agree on is that the mainstream media is corrupt, spend much of their time on stories that don&#39;t matter, and can be politically influenced.  </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t believe is that they&#39;re usually wrong or lying, that they don&#39;t have some worthy, diligent reporters, or that alternative sites - who generally have zero reporters on the ground to cover a major story - are in any way more reliable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got in an argument via Facebook with a local Fox News affiliate&#39;s journalist. A young man from my home town had Tourette&#39;s, and when he&#39;s nervous, he blurts out what&#39;s making him nervous. He boarded a plane, and immediately began screaming &quot;bomb&quot; over and over again. He was taken off the plane, and banned from flying. The journalist posed the question, whether it was right or wrong. This was about a week after Boston. My argument was that is news station, and his big brother networks, had been continuously playing on loop the scene of the attack, bombs going off, blood on the ground, and body limbs, and how they instill fear into people in this way, and how he was apart of the problem. People wouldn&#39;t be so paranoid if msm did not up play the violence and trauma. He could not get this through his head, so I finally resorted to asking him why our government/msm displayed the picture of the older brother&#39;s gruesome dead body(if it was him or not) but could not display a 5 second clip of Lanza entering that school, or one single photo proof of Bin Laden&#39;s body. That&#39;s when the correspondence stopped and my Facebook was blocked. Btw older brother has been &quot;buried&quot; no less then 30 minutes from where I live. And trust me, a number of people to do some investigating if you know what I mean. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No but its funny how most of those seals are now dead...i remember a blonde reporter..reporting that bin laden was living comfortably in a villa in pakistan some years before the raid took place. But id also like to point out bin laden was supposedly died in like 2004...but the mass eaters only respond to movie like plots and i believe the raid on bin ladens compound was faked and planned for many years prior...just like 9/11 just like a lot of stuff thats been going on...and most of it has shocking correlations to astrological events strange goings on...fucking solar cults controlling the world...they know how to use our solar systems energy to grab ahold of our attention make us believe what they tell us...its been used for a long time...its a game...</p>
