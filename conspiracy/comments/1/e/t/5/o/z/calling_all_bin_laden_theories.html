       In light of the recent rulings, blocking release of photos of bin Laden's dead body, I would like to hear your thoughts on him, his life, his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll start.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most wanted terrorist of all time and we dump his body in the ocean!?  I'm not saying we parade the body around like a trophy but dumping it like that smells like, "quick, stash it here, they'll never know."
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on, with many tangents, you first.
      </p>
      <p>
       **This was my first post, thanks to the people who shared, this was fun.  By the bye: bin Laden was a Saudi national, the first arrest in the Boston Bomber had Saudi connections, any thoughts?

       No, what about it seems tricky?  Most people here are distrustful of anything the MSM reports, but when they happen to report something that fits into a conspiracy theory, then it's gospel.

       Why do you believe the MSM from 2001, is basically my question.

       It's a question designed to start an argument that would lead to trying to get me to  provide 'proof' of bin Laden's death in 2001. It's a typical r/conspiratard troll tactic and I no longer respond to Redditors using tactics like that. I just downvote 'em and move on.

       No it isn't designed to do anything, it's a perfectly reasonable question.  The fact is that you have no reasonable response, which is why you ignored it and pretended that I had some ulterior motives.  But I have no interest in asking you for "proof" that he died in 2001, and was not going there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to know why you believe a report from 2001 by Fox News but wholly disbelieve similar reports by the same organization (and also by more well-respected outlets than Fox News) from a decade later, with far more rigorous reporting, more reliable witnesses, and far greater detail a decade later?

       Quite the contrary. The 2001 FOX article about OBL's death was based on a Pakistan Observer report citing a Taliban official. No proof of him being alive has ever surfaced since then. FOX News articles on OBL's "death" in 2011 cited US politicians, one of whom was Obama as he was gunning for reelection.

       Western MSM is under much more government control today than it was in 2001. They either say what they're told to say or they lose their status and their access to government officials (

      <p>
       What it all comes down to is whether one believes a subordinate of bin Laden that had nothing to gain or a politician whose re-election  was at risk. I tend to lean towards the former. Especially when the only 'evidence' released for the 2011 'death' turned out to be
       <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/galleryoffakebinladens.php">
        photoshopped images
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now go back to r/conspiratard. I'm not responding again.

       Everything you said there is debatable, one-sided, not what I was referring to, and/or false.  Since you won't be responding again (what's wrong with a healthy debate? seriously) I won't bother pointing out all of these things, since it would be a waste of time and you'd rather trudge forward blindly than have a reasonable discussion with somebody who disagrees with you.

       That I do not know. But more on Bin Laden. Wasn't he in a us controlled hospital the day of 9/11? We all know he was a CIA agent in the 80s. His family has ties in the oil biz with the bin laden family. All videos of him these past years show him getting younger(lol). And it just so happens a reporter found the initial tape tying him to 9/11 days? after 9/11. You gotta remember, the 9/11 myth was forged within an hour or so of the initial attack. The "structural damage", the Al Qaeda ties. Last week someone posted a video tying Israel to the attacks which is one of the most compelling piece on the subject I've ever seen. Remember also, in time, high up Saudis were found to be responsible for funding the attacks. When relatives of victims banded together and tried to sue, Obama made it illegal, TWICE. Even when insurance agencies who paid out billions have not been allowed to sue. How much of a coincidence is it that most recently, the Saudi/Boston deal? Hmmm

       Obama has already proved he was willing to wipe his ass with the constitution in order to get re-elected. Its all circumstantial evidence, but there's enough that it's plausible that he's still alive.

       In terms of political scandals for Obama and the Government; the IRS, AP and even the Benghazi thing doesn't really implicate them in anything illegal...incompetent and heavy-handed...yes, illegal no. The 4th shoe better have some meat to it or it will be like the boy who cried wolf.

       I disagree. I think all of these scandals were illegal. It's possible that Obama will walk away from them, but somebody is going to jail.

       It really all depends on how loyal his minions are. I hope they all start blowing the whistles. It would be amazing to impeach Obama for these crimes.

       The IRS was a "convenient grouping" for "accounting" purposes; Benghazi is mess that may yet splash on Hilary in the form of perjury-- in not knowing about the level of threat and lying to congress; and the AP thing seems to rest in the exception to 1st Amendment stuff. A Clinton committing perjury is barely illegal.

       One more thing to add. When the Soviets were at war with the Taliban, we were secretly supplying them with weapons. What makes anyone in this country think for one second Russia doesn't in some way support these guys against us?

       He probably died in 2001,

      <p>
       killed by a missile or shot by a gun

       Osama told the BBC he didn't commit the crime,

       I wish I had evidence, and this is just speculation, but I would think that he was "extraordinary rendition-ed" to a CIA black site. Why would you kill the head of Al Qaeda? Keeping him alive and in US custody would probably benefit the US HUMINT efforts.

       Hey, huckleberry season in the mountains. I apologize for the time lapse. Thanks for the reply. I think "They" needed to "kill" him because the War on Terror had run its course and Obama needed a win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who needs the #1 terrorist, he doesn't matter when the Arab Spring is causing plenty of unrest and fiscal opportunities. But just wait. The Syrian Rebels that we are NOT giving weapons to will breed the next generation's Bin Laden. Just like Bin Laden was born from US involvement in Afghanistan in the 70's.

       What I've learned from this subreddit: He died in late 2001.  Or he died in 2004.  Or he's still alive.  But the one thing that
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       didn't happen is that he died in 2011, despite the fact that every reliable news outlet in the entire world has reported it.

       I do read the mainstream outlets, but only through a filter. These outlets are all owned by six different organizations, Time Warner, Walt Disney, Viacom, News Corp., CBS Corporation and NBC Universal. In reality they are a cartel that stick to the same talking points. So I consider MSM as a single source, and alternative media as individual sources deserving of the same scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       What infuriates me about the MSM is they toe the line for governments, rarely ask good questions, and they spend too much time on nonsense stories like Jodi Arias. These organizations are just as unreliable, if not more unreliable, than alternative sites.

       I consider myself a strong skeptic, but one thing we (conspiracy believers and skeptics) almost all agree on is that the mainstream media is corrupt, spend much of their time on stories that don't matter, and can be politically influenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't believe is that they're usually wrong or lying, that they don't have some worthy, diligent reporters, or that alternative sites - who generally have zero reporters on the ground to cover a major story - are in any way more reliable.

       I got in an argument via Facebook with a local Fox News affiliate's journalist. A young man from my home town had Tourette's, and when he's nervous, he blurts out what's making him nervous. He boarded a plane, and immediately began screaming "bomb" over and over again. He was taken off the plane, and banned from flying. The journalist posed the question, whether it was right or wrong. This was about a week after Boston. My argument was that is news station, and his big brother networks, had been continuously playing on loop the scene of the attack, bombs going off, blood on the ground, and body limbs, and how they instill fear into people in this way, and how he was apart of the problem. People wouldn't be so paranoid if msm did not up play the violence and trauma. He could not get this through his head, so I finally resorted to asking him why our government/msm displayed the picture of the older brother's gruesome dead body(if it was him or not) but could not display a 5 second clip of Lanza entering that school, or one single photo proof of Bin Laden's body. That's when the correspondence stopped and my Facebook was blocked. Btw older brother has been "buried" no less then 30 minutes from where I live. And trust me, a number of people to do some investigating if you know what I mean.

       My favorite is the Obama = Osama theory.

       Add to that, Cheney played Ayman al Zwahiri.

       No but its funny how most of those seals are now dead...i remember a blonde reporter..reporting that bin laden was living comfortably in a villa in pakistan some years before the raid took place. But id also like to point out bin laden was supposedly died in like 2004...but the mass eaters only respond to movie like plots and i believe the raid on bin ladens compound was faked and planned for many years prior...just like 9/11 just like a lot of stuff thats been going on...and most of it has shocking correlations to astrological events strange goings on...fucking solar cults controlling the world...they know how to use our solar systems energy to grab ahold of our attention make us believe what they tell us...its been used for a long time...its a game...

       He was involved...but i have no doubts he wasnt the master mind...he was the perfect villian to blame it on...and he probably in many ways is a messiah figure to many fundamental islamic groups...all these up risings in the middle east...this was all planned...one world government shit...the worst isnt behind us...

       That's funny. I hope you're wrong in your assessment though. If these scandals just pass away, I'm gonna be pissed.
