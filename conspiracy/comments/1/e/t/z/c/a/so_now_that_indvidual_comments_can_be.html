      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The term comes from a 1963 speech, "Message to the Grass Roots", given by African American activist Malcolm X, wherein he explains that during slavery, there were two kinds of slaves: "house Negroes", who worked in the master's house, and "field Negroes", who performed manual labor outside.[1]
       </p>
       <p>
        He characterizes the house Negro as having an easier lifestyle than the field Negro, and thus as unwilling to leave the plantation and more likely to support existing power structures that favor whites over blacks. Malcolm X identified with the field Negro, who worked outside and faced harsher conditions and treatment. The field Negro, he said, was more likely to revolt against repressive conditions and owners.

       I am more inclined to believe the reference to artificaly slowling down page loads for non-gold or the reference to advance publications might have done it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one shadowbans over the word faggot or house-negro (which is actually an idiom); and if they do we need to really consider how this website views the right to have an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not gratuitously call them faggots or house-negroes; I did so because I was suggesting they are monetizing for a third party in a decietful way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I'd call Alexis a house negro as well for daring to champion the internet as a pathway to popular sovereignty while simultaneously owning a fucking PR firm called Nerd Labs who may or may not take on work right here on reddit.

       Yeah, no, I really think it was calling them faggots and house-negros.  They're admins, they're human, they'll take offense to things like that, and they aren't above retaliation -- especially considering they have power that you don't.

       I know that you're delusional beyond belief, but seriously, believing that it was because of "the reference to artificaly slowling down page loads for non-gold or the reference to advance publications" is babbling, tongue-chewing insanity.

       Hi! I'm a queer woman. I have friends who are gay men. I don't think it's okay to use "faggot" the way you used it. Many people agree with me, including many straight white males.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this is the 2010s, and racial references have been considered verboten since… somewhere in the sixties? Maybe the eighties if you're in some parts of the Deep South?
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, sexual and racial slurs are not considered appropriate for pubic discussion in this day and age. Using them will get you downvoted in most forums that are not made up of reactionary white dudes; this is simply not acceptable language.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was an admin of a discussion forum of any kind and someone started throwing around "faggot" and "house-negro" the way you did here I would certainly consider banning you. There are plenty of ways you could have expressed this sentiment without using sexual or racial slurs - "lap-dog" comes to mind, for instance.

       Downvotes are fine; using faggot and house-negreo to justify censorship is one of the many slippery slopes that reddit has undertaken on their way to digg v4.

       Politically correct or not, they could have downvoted but they censored.

       I agree with what the OP posted but the reference to house negroes might have incited action. I understand what was implied- the term is used to describe sycophants and yesmen who parrot whatever those in charge say. But most people have been programmed to kneejerk that into an OMG RACISM and hit the report links.

       This is how it works when a mod removes a comment. Admins did remove the comment there (because they are the only mods of that sub) but it was standard mod-removal as far as I can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a new kind of "shadow-ban" or anything new for that matter. And they almost certainly removed it because OP stupidly used slurs to attack them.

       If the child comment is remove along with the parent you only see [deleted] for the parent.

       Also true, but sometimes even without a child I still see the parent's [deleted] corpse. Might just be me not really paying attention those few times, I dunno.

       I don't understand what your problem with gold is. The admins have always been upfront about the fact that it exists as a revenue stream, and that it's completely optional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because god forbid the the people that own and operate this site try to generate revenue to pay staff, operate servers, and, you know, run their fucking business. Would you rather them extract information from your comments and sell that to advertisers and worse?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand the criticism when we're dealing with outside companies trying to game the community with subliminal (or blatant) advertisements. But when you start attacking the site itself for trying to make money (in a very upfront way, no less), you enter into ranting lunatic territory.

       My problem is not so much with the edifice of gold itself, but rather with the seemingly extortionist way in which it has been implemented coupled with an administrative structure who has vested conflicts of interest with regards to the free flow of information.

      <p>
       Slowing down page load times for non-gold users was not optional.

       Who did Paul Graham go to when he got that initial 20,000 in seed money for the move up north? I guess that is what all of this boils down to.

       A content aggregate in a manipulated state serves as a permanent call to action for those who believe the content mafia's death grip on mediums of information dissemination across television, radio and print ends there. The internet will be free, fuck Nerd Labs and those like them.

       This IS censorship, but you made it easy for them with your personal attacks. You actually discredited your own (valid) argument, because humans tend to get defensive when name-calling starts. Especially the word faggot...you could have explained yourself better there, because that is a word mostly used by hateful bigots to degrade gays. However, if "faggots" and house-negroes" offends someone, they need to get the fuck off the internet, this is not a place for sensitive types.

       Any excuse for censorship is a bad excuse because it just leads to wider definitions of what a useable excuse can be.

       If a top level comment is removed before anyone responds to it the comment doesn't show up as "deleted", it's just not there. That means one of the admins removed your comment. They probably removed it because it because you called them "faggots" and "house-negroes" you dumb ass.
