    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The term comes from a 1963 speech, &quot;Message to the Grass Roots&quot;, given by African American activist Malcolm X, wherein he explains that during slavery, there were two kinds of slaves: &quot;house Negroes&quot;, who worked in the master&#39;s house, and &quot;field Negroes&quot;, who performed manual labor outside.[1]</p>

<p>He characterizes the house Negro as having an easier lifestyle than the field Negro, and thus as unwilling to leave the plantation and more likely to support existing power structures that favor whites over blacks. Malcolm X identified with the field Negro, who worked outside and faced harsher conditions and treatment. The field Negro, he said, was more likely to revolt against repressive conditions and owners.</p>

<p>No one shadowbans over the word faggot or house-negro (which is actually an idiom); and if they do we need to really consider how this website views the right to have an opinion.</p>

<p>I did not gratuitously call them faggots or house-negroes; I did so because I was suggesting they are monetizing for a third party in a decietful way.</p>

<p>Then again, I&#39;d call Alexis a house negro as well for daring to champion the internet as a pathway to popular sovereignty while simultaneously owning a fucking PR firm called Nerd Labs who may or may not take on work right here on reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;m a queer woman. I have friends who are gay men. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s okay to use &quot;faggot&quot; the way you used it. Many people agree with me, including many straight white males.</p>

<p>Also, this is the 2010s, and racial references have been considered verboten sinceâ€¦ somewhere in the sixties? Maybe the eighties if you&#39;re in some parts of the Deep South?</p>

<p>In general, sexual and racial slurs are not considered appropriate for pubic discussion in this day and age. Using them will get you downvoted in most forums that are not made up of reactionary white dudes; this is simply not acceptable language.</p>

<p>If I was an admin of a discussion forum of any kind and someone started throwing around &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;house-negro&quot; the way you did here I would certainly consider banning you. There are plenty of ways you could have expressed this sentiment without using sexual or racial slurs - &quot;lap-dog&quot; comes to mind, for instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand what your problem with gold is. The admins have always been upfront about the fact that it exists as a revenue stream, and that it&#39;s completely optional.</p>

<p>Because god forbid the the people that own and operate this site try to generate revenue to pay staff, operate servers, and, you know, run their fucking business. Would you rather them extract information from your comments and sell that to advertisers and worse?</p>

<p>I can understand the criticism when we&#39;re dealing with outside companies trying to game the community with subliminal (or blatant) advertisements.

    <div class="md"><p>My problem is not so much with the edifice of gold itself, but rather with the seemingly extortionist way in which it has been implemented coupled with an administrative structure who has vested conflicts of interest with regards to the free flow of information. </p>

<p>Slowing down page load times for non-gold users was not optional.</p>

<p>Hiding the money stream upwards to advance publications is nefarious.</p>

<p>Hiding Alexis&#39; owndership of Nerd Labs is nefarious.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just muckraking in Aaron&#39;s honor; having been in Medfahd from the very start. </p>

<p>Who did Paul Graham go to when he got that initial 20,000 in seed money for the move up north? I guess that is what all of this boils down to.</p>

<p>A content aggregate in a manipulated state serves as a permanent call to action for those who believe the content mafia&#39;s death grip on mediums of information dissemination across television, radio and print ends there. The internet will be free, fuck Nerd Labs and those like them. </p>
