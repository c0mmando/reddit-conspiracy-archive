       I just read that a minute ago. So I guess when a person has a knife that means you have to use lethal force instead of the array of non lethal weapons you have in your belt.

       Is there a possibility that under any circumstance they conducted this interview without searching the suspect first? A knife was just sitting around and nobody thought that it might be a bad idea?

       The interview happened in his home, and he was being questioned, not detained. If they weren't detaining him there would be no reason to search him(nor would they have the right to) and as it took place in his home it's not out of the question he grabbed something quick from a drawer or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, think of what you're suggesting. If the FBI wanted him dead to cover something up do you really think they would need to stab one of their own agents to do so? Wouldn't it be more likely they just shot him right away? They're in control of the crime scene, the public will never see it, the local police will never see it, the state police will never see it, why would they go out of their way to actually stab an agent when they know the scene wasn't going to be publicly scrutinized anyway?

       Come on. Your going to ask some one questions about a triple homocide and who is linked to the "Boston bomber" and you're not prepared for that? They are trained for a reason. Not to use excessive force and keep these guys for questioning.

       I totally agree. I wouldn't hesitate to shoot some one who is attacking me. I just like to think that these men in uniform(all uniforms) are trained to handle these circumstances. I agree with you though.

       You would expect that if an individual is being questioned, he is a person of value. So even IF i were to buy that maybe he did attack with a knife, the fact that they would respond by shooting him dead (instead of capturing him for further questioning), smells like Bullshit.

       This entire Boston Bombing investigation is nothing more than a debacle and a circus show. They think we are idiots, which most of the populace are, and we are being taken for a ride. Fuck this shit. SMH.

       Uhh dude really?  You do realize that this is America and cops don't think twice about shooting you if you have a weapon.  On top of that this guy is being questioned in a major bombing case?  Come on, you are telling me that if you were that cop you woudln't have shot him?

       He was probably told by Tsarnaev sr. that he was an FBI recruit the entire time. That's the only reason FSB would try to contact FBI, as to tell them "we know he's your guy". Now it all makes sense. Sons of bitches!

       Man killed had told friend he feared being set up, and FBI pressed him to stay around for a final interview. FBI was accompanied by two Massachusetts State Police officers, at least 2 FBI and "other law enforcement", he didn't own a gun either. So just to recap, suspect was by himself, against at least 4 confirmed law enforcement officers, but yet the FBI agent was the one who was afraid, and feared for his life? How hard would it be for 4 LE officers to stop an unarmed (no gun at least) suspect without deadly force? This kid had already been interviewed and even spoke to media. WE NEED TO STOP THIS NOW!

       Does anyone else find it disturbing that HE LET THE POLICE INTO HIS HOUSE VOLUNTARILY and then started a "violent altercation"? Or how about the fact that he canceled his ticket back home at the FBI'S pressing?   Or how about the fact that a suspect in a triple homicide in which A KNIFE WAS USED" wasn't searched for a knife?
