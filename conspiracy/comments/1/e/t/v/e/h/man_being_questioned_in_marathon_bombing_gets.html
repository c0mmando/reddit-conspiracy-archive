    <div class="md"><p>The interview happened in his home, and he was being questioned, not detained. If they weren&#39;t detaining him there would be no reason to search him(nor would they have the right to) and as it took place in his home it&#39;s not out of the question he grabbed something quick from a drawer or something. </p>

<p>Regardless, think of what you&#39;re suggesting. If the FBI wanted him dead to cover something up do you really think they would need to stab one of their own agents to do so? Wouldn&#39;t it be more likely they just shot him right away? They&#39;re in control of the crime scene, the public will never see it, the local police will never see it, the state police will never see it, why would they go out of their way to actually stab an agent when they know the scene wasn&#39;t going to be publicly scrutinized anyway?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would expect that if an individual is being questioned, he is a person of value. So even IF i were to buy that maybe he did attack with a knife, the fact that they would respond by shooting him dead (instead of capturing him for further questioning), smells like Bullshit. </p>

<p>This entire Boston Bombing investigation is nothing more than a debacle and a circus show. They think we are idiots, which most of the populace are, and we are being taken for a ride. Fuck this shit. SMH.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man killed had told friend he feared being set up, and FBI pressed him to stay around for a final interview. FBI was accompanied by two Massachusetts State Police officers, at least 2 FBI and &quot;other law enforcement&quot;, he didn&#39;t own a gun either. So just to recap, suspect was by himself, against at least 4 confirmed law enforcement officers, but yet the FBI agent was the one who was afraid, and feared for his life? How hard would it be for 4 LE officers to stop an unarmed (no gun at least) suspect without deadly force? This kid had already been interviewed and even spoke to media. WE NEED TO STOP THIS NOW!
