<p>It&#39;s unclear what exactly you mean that &quot;the US committed [it].&quot;  Clearly you believe it was a government conspiracy of some sort and to some degree, but since there are innumerable variations of that conspiracy theory -- variations that are often at odds with each other, with themselves, with basic logic, and sometimes with the laws of nature -- it&#39;s impossible to know which version of the conspiracy you subscribe to.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we please stop using this like it&#39;s a powerful argument? In my experience, talking about how the towers fell is not an effective way to get people to reconsider the official narrative.  Instead of a bunch of non-engineers making wild claims about molten steel and temperatures, why don&#39;t we put out some actual facts regarding these events. </p>

<p>Dick Cheney changed the hijack response protocol so that planes could not be intercepted without his permission. He conducted war games on 9/11 that introduced false radar blips, muddling everything. We already had a draft of the Patriot Act before 9/11. We immediately went to war with a country that wasn&#39;t behind the attacks. We had Bin Laden in a hospital in Dubai months before the attacks and didn&#39;t get him. We had detailed, documented warnings from several counties in the months leading to the attacks, and yet Cheney sent several of our response jets on training missions overseas. Several people were placing bets against the stocks of the airlines involved with 9/11 in the days leading up to the attack.</p>

<p>In summary, there are dozens of documented sources that provide much clearer evidence of a conspiracy than this tired old talking point about steel&#39;s melting temperature.  If you want sources, read Michael Ruppert&#39;s Rubicon, or check out his YouTube videos.</p>

<p>Edit: I didn&#39;t realize there was such a lively discussion about WTC-7 below me.  I&#39;m very interested in this as well, but again, non of you are providing specific sources, and you won&#39;t have good luck convincing people. There are much more important, documented aspects of this conspiracy that don&#39;t hinge on how the buildings actually fell.  Yes, I believe we took them down, but you&#39;ll sound far less crazy to an outsider if you don&#39;t focus on only that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not wish to be rude, but if you do not consider the molten metals to be one of the <em>most</em> damning and revealing pieces of evidence, then you do not understand how molten metals work. Completely forgivable. Most people have no use for that knowledge. But in this case it is of utmost importance. </p>

<p>The scientific laws of thermodynamics detailing blackbody radiation have beed thoroughly explained over and over again, and are among the most fundamental and consistently proved conclusions of science. (If the thermodynamics of blackbody radiation is wrong, then very nearly <em>all</em> of science is wrong as well.) And while I may not be an engineer, I <em>am</em> a physicist, so I can make claims to the veracity of those conclusions, although plenty of other imminently qualified physicists and metalurgists have already done so. </p>

<p>As Sheldon would say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Engineering.  Where the noble semi-skilled laborers execute the vision of those who think and dream.  Hello, oompa-loompas of science.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But jokes aside, the simple, provable science regarding the molten metal argument goes like this: All molten metals  exceeding several nanometers in thickness are considered &quot;blackbodies&quot; (matter that absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation without reflecting it). And the temperature of <em>all</em> blackbodies can be measured simply by looking at their color (once they reach a critical minimum temperature and start radiating photons), no matter what type of atoms comprise them. So the pictures of the molten metal flowing out of the towers is completely sufficient for gauging their temperature, and cannot be dismissed as some type of metal with a lower melting point (like the aluminum comprising the planes) because, again, the color of blackbody radiation is independent of atomic composition and <em>only</em> dependent on temperature. <em>And the temperatures of the molten streams in those pictures far excedes the maximum temperature attainable by jet fuel.</em> </p>

<p>You could easily reference a chart on blackbody raditation temperatures-by-color and compare them to the photos to determine for yourself the temperatures of those streams. But I agree that it is useless trying to convince people without showing them evidence, so I have included links to some pictures/videos of the 9/11 molten metal and a blackbody color chart. I hope you will be curious enough to check it out. I&#39;d be interrested to hear what temperature you think they are, based on the chart.</p>

<p>This does not negate any of the points that you bring up. They are salient points as well, because they indicate <em>who</em> may have been involved, but the molten metal helps indicates both who and <em>how.</em> The obvious temperatures of the metal, and the abundant presence of lab-grade, explosive-quality nano-thermite in the debris, allows us to draw some very significant conclusions. First, jet fuel could not have been responsible for the molten metal - we can tell that just by looking at the metal and a blackbody temperature chart. Second, the nano-thermite was lab-grade (highly expensive and technical), so it came from someone with access to weapons-grade explosives (this can be determined by observing the size of the nano-particles, and the specific ratio of reduction/oxidation agents. The smaller and more consistenly sized the particles are, and the more specific the ratio of reagents, the more technical expertise and expensive equipment is required to synthesize it). And third, because there was a HUGE amount of thermite in the debris, the buildings had to have been thoroughly riddled with it (if it were a single large cache instead of smaller deposits throughout the buildings we would have seen an <em>enormous</em> explosion), which means only someone with sweeping access to the WTC buildings and a whole lot of weapons-grade thermite could have put it there. And there are <em>very</em> few people who meet those criterion.</p>

<p>So, without intending to sound patronizing, <em>now</em> do you see why the molten metal (and thermite) argument is so potent? It narrows the list of suspects more than perhaps any other evidence, and it provides the most testable conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never seen such a thoughtful, articulate argument on this matter before, thank you. I would certainly agree, based on the charts and photos,  that the temperature of those metals is well in excess of 315C. Your comment also motivated me to investigate the sources claiming nanothermite was used, and I would agree with you this is a powerful and important argument. I suppose I got fed up hearing some poorly thought out ideas from others and just moved on to different elements of this conspiracy, but now I can appreciate how damning this evidence is, thank you</p>

<p>Secondly, according to the panel of experts assembled by NIST, the debris that you are claiming is molten steel was determined to be aluminum from the plane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you would believe something the gov&#39;t tells you? This is the same group behind. The USS Maine, going along with the Balfour Declaration and getting 140k US men killed in WW1, the same group who intercepted over a 1000 japanese coded messages and let the Pearl Harbor incident happen so we could get into WW2 and we lost 470k men in that one, then lets add the Gulf of Tonkin lie that got 58,500 men killed in NAM. Lets add the tuskegee experiment, and then the radioactive material dispersed on St Louis, The Iran Contra Affair, CIA involvement in bringing cocaine into the US. This is also the same gov&#39;t that went after Saddam Hussein for WMD when in November of 2000, Time magazine cover story ,he says he will not accept US Cash for oil anymore and Gaddaffi did the same in 2011.  Well if you believe the gov&#39;t? Fuck you, just fuck you. You deserve whatever happens to you in the long run. And for the record NIST did not release their computer model numbers which showed why building 7 , a class one constructed building came down like a demo which had never happened before and never happened since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, so instead of addressing the evidence, you just spout off random events. That&#39;s typical conspiracy copout tactic.</p>

<p>And no, it&#39;s not just according to NIST, and their panel of experts, that the substance featured in the linked video. It&#39;s also according to analyses from the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Structural Engineers Association of New York, both of which consist of experts in the field.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re still being quite hostile. Why is that? I&#39;ve shown you nothing but respect.</p>

<p>That is certainly not the case. For example, I hate the current media meme of &quot;deficits bad, must cut!&quot;, when all evidence is against that position.</p>

<p>...no? A quick look at the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf">table of contents for the report</a> show that it is much more about the perpetrators, and policies we can implement to mitigate risks of terrorist attacks. I&#39;m not sure how Building 7 would fit into a report like that.</p>

<p>Well, first off, it&#39;s not an unexplained collapse. It&#39;s an explained collapse.</p>

<p>Secondly, several other buildings fell that day. A list can be found on Wikipedia. Why are you not complaining that those buildings were left off as well?</p>

<p>Honestly, I really don&#39;t think you&#39;ve proven your case that this specific building should be mentioned when the contents of the report you referenced has nothing to do with the specific buildings that fell, but about the geo-politics and responses of the country.</p>

<p>Wow, what an immature thing to say. Why would you care about fake internet points? Honestly, this is about facts and skepticism, and I&#39;d like to prove to you that my position is the one where the facts on. I mostly base this on the consensus of experts being on my side, rather than your side.</p>

<p>But, it doesn&#39;t seem to me that you really care about any of those things, and prefer to have a conspiracy theory despite the evidence. And that&#39;s a shame.</p>

<p>&quot;All those&quot;?  It&#39;s a miniscule, basically zero percent of the profession of millions of professionals.  And what, exactly, have they &quot;signed&quot;?

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there was molten metal present, and I never claimed otherwise. However, the claim was that there was molten <em>steel</em> present, and that was determined to be false by the NIST, and by independent evaluations from ASCE and SEANY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the beauty of the molten metal is that it doesn&#39;t matter what kind of metal it was because the temperature of a radiating blackbody can be determined by its color <em>alone</em> and the color of the molten metal pouring from those towers easily excedes the maximum temperature of burning jet fuel. Even if someoen claims it was the aluminium from the plane, they still could not explain how that aluminium reached temperatures over 1000 degrees Celcius. Not with jet fuel anyway.</p>

<p>And the freefall was not for certain walls, it was for the entire building during 2.3 seconds of the 5.4 seconds NIST originally purported (which includes the crimping of the center of the roof, before the bulk of the building even began to fall. Analyses that begin timing from when both edges start collapse are consistent with free fall speed).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then the claim of the OP, that the US &quot;committed&quot; it is just an opinion.</p>

<p>The problem is that in this subreddit, opinions miraculously trans-mutate into facts that other conspiracy theorists use to perpetuate the dis-information. There is no solid evidence that the US purposely destroyed the towers, but that doesnt stop people - who all have an anti-government bias - from connecting dots that just aren&#39;t there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the downright dodgy and inept 9/11 investigation done by the U.S. government and lamestream media, then it would be naive to accept the 9/11 Commission report at face value because there is no &quot;solid&quot; evidence to back up their official conclusions either. Furthermore, given Uncle Sam&#39;s looooong history of propaganda and disinformation and false flag attacks, staing that &quot;conspiracy theorists in this subreddit&quot; perpetuate 9/11 disinformation is the proverbial pot to kettle black attack that hints at your own pro-government &quot;opinion&quot;. That said, I believe the dots are there, and they reveal a completely different perp outline, only &#39;We the Peons&#39; are not and can not be allowed to ever see them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we please stop using this like it&#39;s a powerful argument? In my experience, talking about how the towers fell is not an effective way to get people to reconsider the official narrative.  Instead of a bunch of non-engineers making wild claims about molten steel and temperatures, why don&#39;t we put out some actual facts regarding these events. </p>

<p>Dick Cheney changed the hijack response protocol so that planes could not be intercepted without his permission. He conducted war games on 9/11 that introduced false radar blips, muddling everything. We already had a draft of the Patriot Act before 9/11. We immediately went to war with a country that wasn&#39;t behind the attacks. We had Bin Laden in a hospital in Dubai months before the attacks and didn&#39;t get him. We had detailed, documented warnings from several counties in the months leading to the attacks, and yet Cheney sent several of our response jets on training missions overseas. Several people were placing bets against the stocks of the airlines involved with 9/11 in the days leading up to the attack.</p>

<p>In summary, there are dozens of documented sources that provide much clearer evidence of a conspiracy than this tired old talking point about steel&#39;s melting temperature.  If you want sources, read Michael Ruppert&#39;s Rubicon, or check out his YouTube videos.</p>

<p>Edit: I didn&#39;t realize there was such a lively discussion about WTC-7 below me.  I&#39;m very interested in this as well, but again, non of you are providing specific sources, and you won&#39;t have good luck convincing people. There are much more important, documented aspects of this conspiracy that don&#39;t hinge on how the buildings actually fell.  Yes, I believe we took them down, but you&#39;ll sound far less crazy to an outsider if you don&#39;t focus on only that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never seen such a thoughtful, articulate argument on this matter before, thank you. I would certainly agree, based on the charts and photos,  that the temperature of those metals is well in excess of 315C. Your comment also motivated me to investigate the sources claiming nanothermite was used, and I would agree with you this is a powerful and important argument. I suppose I got fed up hearing some poorly thought out ideas from others and just moved on to different elements of this conspiracy, but now I can appreciate how damning this evidence is, thank you</p>
