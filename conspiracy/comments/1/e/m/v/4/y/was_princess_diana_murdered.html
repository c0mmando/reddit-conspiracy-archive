       Hi. Yes. And I hunted down something for you. This documentary was financed by the owner of Harrods (and the father of Diana's boyfriend at the time of her death) and directed by Lilly Allen's dad, the famous actor Keith Allen. It is banned in the UK. It was shown at Cannes. I haven't watched it yet, but I'm going to. Apparently it is a little sensationalist, but otherwise very good, and contains the pertinent info.

       I agree.  If he hadn't have been captured on CCTV, you could have blamed it on a mix-up in the laboratory during the autopsy process and nobody would likely ever have known.  He seemed absolutely fine in the CCTV, but if that's proof of a conspiracy why release the footage at all?

       Apparently this is because French paramedics prefer to conduct more advanced treatment on-board than their British and American counterparts do.  They use the ambulance as a mobile hospital rather than a modestly equipped vehicle to get to a bricks-and-mortar hospital more quickly, as we're used to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think any of the ambulance crew were "in on" anything, although some theorists have suggested that there were "paramedics" at the crash site who were anything but, if you know what I mean.

       Well, the doctor in charge was suspect, can't remember the name, also the fact that Henri Paul's blood sample had lethal levels of carbon monoxide and wasn't DNA tested to verify it was his blood.

       she was bumped off, she either agreed to be married to Dodi, step child being related to the future king of England, big no no, i think she may have been pregnant, she was embalmed in France, destroying any evidence of a pregnancy, as above.

       It would be a lot easier than you think, as you started the public would be more willing to accept a car crash, her where abouts would be well known, same with routes, just need an oppertunity, small team, a blinding light, a narrow spot, tunnel is great, very little to no traffic at that time.
