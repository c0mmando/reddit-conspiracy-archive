    <div class="md"><p>Hi. Yes. And I hunted down something for you. This documentary was financed by the owner of Harrods (and the father of Diana&#39;s boyfriend at the time of her death) and directed by Lilly Allen&#39;s dad, the famous actor Keith Allen. It is banned in the UK. It was shown at Cannes. I haven&#39;t watched it yet, but I&#39;m going to. Apparently it is a little sensationalist, but otherwise very good, and contains the pertinent info. </p>

<p>I agree.  If he hadn&#39;t have been captured on CCTV, you could have blamed it on a mix-up in the laboratory during the autopsy process and nobody would likely ever have known.  He seemed absolutely fine in the CCTV, but if that&#39;s proof of a conspiracy why release the footage at all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>asks why it took 2 hours to get Diana from the car to the hospital.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently this is because French paramedics prefer to conduct more advanced treatment on-board than their British and American counterparts do.  They use the ambulance as a mobile hospital rather than a modestly equipped vehicle to get to a bricks-and-mortar hospital more quickly, as we&#39;re used to.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any of the ambulance crew were &quot;in on&quot; anything, although some theorists have suggested that there were &quot;paramedics&quot; at the crash site who were anything but, if you know what I mean.</p>
