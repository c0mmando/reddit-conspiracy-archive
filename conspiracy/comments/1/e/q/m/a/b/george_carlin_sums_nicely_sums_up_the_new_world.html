        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice . . . you don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own, and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying . . . lobbying, to get what they want . . . Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I’ll tell you what they don’t want . . . they don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that . . . that doesn’t help them. That’s against their interests. That’s right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fuckin&#39; years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers . . . Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your fuckin&#39; retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it . . . they’ll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fuckin&#39; place. It’s a big club and you ain&#39;t in it. You and I are not in The big club. By the way, it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good honest hard-working people . . . white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue, these are people of modest means . . . continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don’t give a fuck about you. They don’t give a fuck about you . . . they don’t give a fuck about you. They don’t care about you at all . . . at all . . . at all, and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That’s what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes everyday, because the owners of this country know the truth. It’s called the American Dream cause you have to be asleep to believe it . . .”</p>

To me it seemed like the comedy was a mask for the thoughtful stuff; you had to know his comedy to know that he was talking about this stuff... this was before the internet, and he was popular but he wasn&#39;t Eddie Murphy. Besides, what does it matter? He&#39;s right, he&#39;s inspirational and he&#39;s dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Few people have driven my present day worldview as much as this kind sage. The 1st time I watched the &quot;Religion is Bullshit&quot; clip on YouTube I was 17 and couldn&#39;t believe someone had taken on that topic so bluntly. I was just getting into Carlin beginning in 2006 then he died in 2007 and I became a rabid fan of his. Anyways the point is if Carlin could see the shit that is going on today, the bank bailouts, the looting of 401k&#39;s, and the talk of handing Social Security to the criminals on Wall Street he would be turning in his grave. He called the great Social Security Swindle that Congress is deliberating right now 10 years ago and about a dozen other things. George Carlin IS simply prophetic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All great points, but what is the solution? I would recommend the elimination of the republican party and turning the democratic party into two wings of its moderate and slightly less moderate factions. Then we could have a democracy that represents the will of the people. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not going to happen because poor religious idiots vote for the interests of billionaires and giant corporations because their pastor said to vote republican because of the gays and eliminating women&#39;s choice.</p>

<p>If anything democrats are worse then republicans. At least a republican knows hes a douche, a democrat thinks they know best, and that their progressive liberal ways are the answer. Bullshit. &quot;the road to hell is paved in good intentions&quot; pretty much sums up Democrat bullshit</p>

<p>Its amazing how much the media and americans today accept scandal after scandal in the Obama administration. If either Bush had these scandals, they would have been impeached last week. </p>

<p>The one thing i did miss about Bush Jr. He was so fucking retarded, people had to pay attention because they didnt know how, or how badly, the the retard W, would fuck things up next. With Obama its like... &quot;well hes young, and black, seems like a cool guy that makes hip, pop culture reference..he knows what hes doing, i trust him. </p>

<p>What a shitty, shitty country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one thing, during the Cheney administration people were fucking afraid to say anything because of the terrorism they unleashed in the middle east and were successful in branding any criticism as being unpatriotic or a terrorist sympathizer (I know it gets complicated because the US were the terrorists in this instance). So, no it&#39;s not the fucking same. Republicans want to destroy Medicare and Social Security. Do you want your fucking parents eating catfood and pissing into the gutter. Democrats actually occasionally help the people despite being totally corrupt as well. What the fuck do you think the affordable care act was about? I have a pre-existing condition and can, for the first time in my adult life, buy some fucking affordable insurance within a year. That aint no &quot;everyone is the same&quot; bullshit. Only the dems would have done that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, if you knew your shit, you would know that the government has always raided the SS fund and, if reimbursed, would fund SS for 75 years. We will see if they honor their bond, trust, whatever. Ok, now I&#39;m laughing. You&#39;re right, we&#39;re screwed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I knew that, where did i imply that i didn&#39;t? Its a fairly common governmental practice in history. Now, if you knew your shit, you would realize that SS has been raided to help fund the ridiculous debts that have been built up. Much of which has been caused by bullshit social programs that generally dont actually help anyone because government is shitty. Democrats are shitty, republicans are shitty, back to the original point. </p>

<p>If you look at the debt history it basically started exploding in the 60s when social programs took off, and vietnam started, and has been exponential ever since. Other then ridiculously inefficient and ineffective social spending, Wars are also the big driver of the debt that causes SS to be raided like you said. </p>

<p>Many of these wars have been fought under democrats, since im sure you&#39;d blame that on republicans (think you believe dems so much better, even though they are equally terrible and destructive). Both parties have a nasty history of wars dating back to their origins. So both are equally responsible for the debt debacle. Its the fault of the populous for accepting such bullshit and being herded around like a bunch of mindless sheeple. </p>

<p>I also love how you say &quot;if reimbursed&quot;. How is the government going to reimburse it? Theyve already spent it. Not only did they spend it all on shitty social programs, wars, and tonnes of other bullshit like the war on drugs, but the infrastructure of the country is falling apart. All those trillions in debt and there isnt even anything tangible to show for it</p>

<p>Welcome to the welfare state of the military industrial complex. Good luck with your SS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t belabor the point, but Dubya sent the debt soaring from 5 trillion to 11 trillion in 8 years on a pointless unjust war and huge expansion of Med part D which explicitly forbids the government from negotiating bulk purchases from Big Pharma (as the VA can do) and so now the tax payers hand over full retail for every pill. Oh, and then he broke the economy on the way out. So don&#39;t give me all this false equivalency bullshit. I will be able to get health care insurance for the first time in 30 years because of a pre-existing condition, congestive heart failure. I can finally afford the defibrilator I have needed for 2 years. I know it is all a give away to private insurance, but fuck. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t agree more about the welfare state of the military industrial complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>-Bush took it from 5 - 11..So what? I already said republicans are just as bad. Besides Obama has increased it just as much in barley more than 1 term. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you think the economic problems we&#39;re in began solely under bush, you need an economic history lesson, and im not about to be the one to spend my time giving it to you. Read up. Start with Currency Wars by James G Rickards (2010). </p></li>
<li><p>How much Longer can obama use the excuse that W gave him a broken economy anyways? Does the next guy get to say &quot;obama made things worse!&quot;.....Maybe, if Obama would prosecute the wall st. and big bank scumbags that launder money for drug cartels, or use preditory foreclosure practices on Americans, or insider trade &amp; rig markets, juuuust maybe some of these fundamental problems would begin to fix themselves, or maybe they wouldnt have happened at all. And im not talking about &quot;we need more regulation&quot; im talking about these were laws that were broken, and the govenrment settled for fines to prevent &quot;lengthy&quot; court proceedings. WTF is that. Look up Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of the recent opinions shes given on the issue. All those examples i listed by the way, are RECENT major scandal banks have been implicated in, and have been fined for by the U.S government. No one goes to jail. Ever. They just pay a speeding ticket. What a joke. (Republicans do this too dont worry)</p></li>
<li><p>I resisted responding to your point about your health issue, multiple times since its not overly relevant, but since you bring it up again. This is a debate about the governing, corrpution, and future of a country, and to an extent the world. The fact that you like many other Americans, have been put in a situation where your vote is compromised at the price of health care is truly sad. Obviously its not right, but Obama care wont solve anything, and the fact that so many Americans are forced to put up with the blatant corruption, tyranny, lies, and killing, just to get access to healthcare is depressing. </p></li>
<li><p>Obama care is about lining pockets, and putting healthcare in centralized government control. If democrats really cared about healthcare they might want to consider the amount of freedom theyve given the food industry regarding processed foods, many of which the U.N recently stated were very unsafe for human consumption. How about Americas obesity problem? Diabetes, Cancer? All direct correlations with shitty food. How about Monsanto, and GMO plants? You know the ones like GMO corn banned in the European union because of their documented links to cancer and other severe health problems? Hungary even burned entire fields of them when they realized the corn had made its way into farmer seed supply. How about Coca-Cola? A Corporation with a documented history of deep political power and sponsorship, the same company whose flagship coke product was proven to contain Cancer causing carcinogens last year? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lets not even get into the pharmaceutical industry, you know the industry that is one of the leading killers of Americans, at some of the highest costs? What a joke. </p>

<p>The point being, If democrats really cared about the health and wellbeing they might want to start with a few of those. Maybe there wouldn&#39;t be such a health epidemic. </p>

<p>I wish people would just stop paying so much damn attention to democrats and republicans and make informed decision based on the people and ideas. And by that i don&#39;t mean just listening to whatever 2 opinions CNN/FOX/NBC think you have to choose between. There&#39;s always more than 2 options. </p>

<p>God forbid the people have more than 2 options. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was funny, but he could be angry as well. To me it seemed like the comedy was a mask for the thoughtful stuff; you had to know his comedy to know that he was talking about this stuff... this was before the internet, and he was popular but he wasn&#39;t Eddie Murphy. Besides, what does it matter? He&#39;s right, he&#39;s inspirational and he&#39;s dead.</p>
