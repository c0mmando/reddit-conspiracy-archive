        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been lurking on r/conspiracy for awhile and occasionally post things that I think may be relevant.  One thing that I haven&#39;t ever been able to grasp is just HOW the powers that be would turn our country into a police state.  I understand that the televised events of the Boston bombing are slowly getting us acclimated to the heavy artillery and heavy battery that everyday police forces are using.  My problem always was, &quot;how does this translate into small town USA?&quot;</p>

<p>My father in law has been with the police force in my hometown for almost 30 years, and is second in command on the force.  They employ 9-12 officers at any given time.  Population of this town is under 5,000 people.  Since getting to know him, I&#39;ve had a unique perspective of police officers.  Most of the ones that I know are good guys that barely make any money and are genuinely in it for the right reasons, he included.  </p>

<p>But last night he told me that their force was going to be getting 2 M16 assault rifles with more to come down the road, and training to go with it.  This really scared me, as I never thought that &quot;militarism&quot; of the police force would trickle down this far to rural America.  Why would a peaceful town with less that 5,000 people need their police officers to carry assault rifles.  Thoughts?</p>

<p>They can&#39;t borrow indefinitely and printing more money? Seriously? Do you think that is how economy works? I know the US treasury does, but that is not the real world. They know the dollar can&#39;t be used for much else than toilet paper soon. That&#39;s why they buy all the gold they can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha! you think too there is an all encompassing collapse, do you? What about personal collapse? If one by one just falls out of the economy there is no problem with high oil prices and money printing, because the velocity of the ecomony slows down. Britain did not just implode, it made pffffft the last 80 years and in about 10 to 20 years, it will be as flat as Romania, figuratively spoken. Look at the hot air that is in congress, there is so much left to leak out. This is a viable scenario as long as anybody does not find any mistake in it.

<p>In ten or twenty years, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the majority of paid work in companies, that is, work that isn’t done by machines, being done by these “certificate” holders. They’ll live in ever expanding slums, autonomously policed by RoboCops and drones. They’ll have fast Internet and there will be Superbowl commercials about how great all of it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police are not designed to protect you, they are designed to protect the regime. This is documented fact (source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia">{1}</a>, <a href="http://gunssavelives.net/blog/supreme-court-ruling-police-have-no-duty-to-protect-the-general-public/">{2}</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/28scotus.html?_r=0">{3}</a>). </p>

<p>Now that regime is scared, extremely scared. It is scared of the internet, it is scared of hackers and whistleblowers, it is scared of Occupy and Patriot groups, it is scared of 3D Printers and right to firearms. </p>

<p>That is why they are arming up, that is why every branch is garnering more and more power. That is why SOPA/PIPA/CISPA came up right after the start of the Arab Spring, because they realized just how dangerous the internet could be; they want it controlled. They saw how Occupy emerged the same way. And now they are terrified of Libertarian and Patriot groups, they are horrified of the 3D Printed gun. </p>

<p>The Empire is on the Run. But as Mike Rivero infamously says, &quot;The fastest way to bring down a dictatorship - is to force it to act like one - where everyone can see it!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The federal govt. realized that the army/national guardsmen would not be stupid enough to collaborate in their ploy to turn authoritarian... So they formed the DHS and TSA and whatnot.</p>

<p>But to really clinch the hold of totalitarianism, psychologically, they want to drill this mentality into the common populace, starting with those who have presumably signed up to protect that populace.</p>

<p>Authority figures of all sorts are candidates, in effect, for &quot;authoritarianizing&quot; - from police officers to doctors to managers to professors to teachers.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s already a school-to-prison pipeline, for troublemakers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That could be right but given all the other efforts to clamp down on your rights, security and privacy you can&#39;t just write it off as the simple answer.</p>

<p>The US army has been allowing a whole bunch of their old equipment to be passed on to police with huge subsidies so they don&#39;t cost as much.  Does small town US need military type weapons to deal with their issues?  I&#39;m guessing they have less crime that requires M-16&#39;s and AR15&#39;s in officer hands.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more about the slow assimilation of the police force into a military one.  The media hypes the news that people hear and since its always doom and gloom, the people will accept it.   They don&#39;t NEED it, the police have always had the tools to do their jobs, the intentional escalation is the worry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that would be a waste of taxpayer money?  Because people are going to find out or realize, one way or another, that there are tanks under those tarps?</p>

<p>The military ships tanks via rail instead of <em>driving them down the highway</em>--and would would you say about <em>that</em>?--because shipping things via rail is efficient.</p>

<p>Why does the military ship tanks around at all?  Because they&#39;re transported via rail to a shipyard and then transported via ship to wherever.  Or they&#39;re transported from one base to another for training.  Or storage.  Or maintenance/upgrades.  Or because one unit needs more tanks because someone decided they did or a tank unit gets deactivated or transferred to another base.  Etc, etc, etc.  Many, many reasons that have nothing to do with a show of force (people know we have lots of tanks) or staging for the coming unrest/whatever.</p>

<p>It seems you need it explained. Cost for a M1 Abrams tank is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams">$8.58 million</a>. 25x25 tarps cost <a href="http://www.tarpsonline.com/tarps/blue.aspx">$35</a> online.</p>

<p>&quot;the US military is a beast that cannot be tamed by anyone—not the President or the Congress—because it is simply too profitable. And so, of necessity, the new venue for military operations will have to be the US itself. There are some inconvenient laws currently on the books that make this difficult but, as the experiment in Boston has shown, they can now be safely ignored.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh, all conspiracies aside, I&#39;d say its perfectly fine for a cop, especially one in a rural town, to have a rifle in his car. Whats the difference between that and a slug shotgun that they already carry? I get the militaristic likenesses, but honestly its an all around useful tool. Pistols can&#39;t solve all problems you know. And they arent going to be carrying them... they will just have them in the squadcar for when the need arises. If I was a cop, I would want one.</p>
