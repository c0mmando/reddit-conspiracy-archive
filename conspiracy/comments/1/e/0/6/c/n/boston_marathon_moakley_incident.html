       This has been nagging at me since it happened and I gotta ask about it because it was just so fishy. I was watching a live news feed after all the media was told that a suspect was definitely in custody. Does
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       have any idea what the hell went down at Moakley Courthouse?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's stuff I remember seeing/being reported.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Media outlets are abuzz with reports that a suspect is definitely in custody (according to some anonymous inside informant)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People/media begin to gather at Moakley Courthouse to see if they can catch a glimpse of anything
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All of a sudden, people are quickly evacuated due to a Code Red, which I assume means bomb threat. Onlookers and media alike are pushed
         <em>
          way
         </em>
         back from the courthouse.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Amidst all this panic and an active bomb threat, a tinted van (with a man in a bullet proof vest hanging on to the passenger side) swoops in and quickly goes into the back entrance of the building
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There were reports of a judge being allowed back in (in the midst of an active threat? o.O). One reporter suggests they might need the judge to help do a sweep but that's an absurd notion. Why would highly trained 
teams put a judge in danger? Clearly wrong.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People continue to be pushed back and there is all sorts of police, fbi, homeland security, swat, etc. presence
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Someone from the courthouse says that they will process the suspect no matter what's going on at the courthouse; suggests they'll use alternate buildings.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The all clear is given around 4pm (when most people at the courthouse typically finish their day - reports that many people have gone home already becuase it was so late). Some guy waves a green flag (is that something they typically have lying around? and why not just speak into a megaphone or something?..just sayin')
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Denial of the original report. (I wonder what ever happened w that informant)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Press conferences cancelled, citing the bomb threat (which was cleared already)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I don't know what all this means, but I know it's significant somehow. Some sort of fuckery was going on within these law enforcement circles. There was something that changed and the worst part is, the entire public was shut out. I feel like people were being massively manipulated, especially because the bomb threat made a convenient cover for the Feds to control who and what went into that building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, if I got any parts of the story wrong or omitted anything, let me know.

       We will probably never get real evidence to solve this.    I think they were prepared to nail the saudi terrorist kid who just happened to be injured by the bomb.

       Because the Executive Branch (i.e., police) aren't allowed to invade the sanctum of the Judiciary Branch.

       It's possible some liberal judge demanded to be present during the search by the Executive Branch.

       From what I understand, this was a ploy to get all the reporters away from the hospital and to converge on the courthouse. It worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, a bomb threat was called into the hospital and much of the staff was evacuated.  A helicopter landed on the roof, the Saudi national was whisked away and when the staff returned, his chart was noted as "transferred out" or something to that effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was orchestrated by the government.

       I saw it on the news the day it happened. The MSM was all up in arms because the FBI "leaked" that they had a suspect in custody and then criticized the media for falsely reporting it. Some members of the media said that their sources worked for the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is one brief excerpt I found:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Police on Wednesday evacuated the federal courthouse in Boston because of a bomb threat amid reports of a breakthrough in the marathon bombings investigation.
       </p>
       <p>
        An AFP reporter at the scene said scores of people were ordered out of the building near the Boston seafront and two fire trucks were present.
       </p>
       <p>
        Police moved onlookers more than 100 feet (30 meters) back from the building, but there was no immediate sign of an emergency.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Separately, part of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, where many victims of Monday’s bomb attack were taken, was also briefly evacuated.
        </strong>

       I wasn't aware of the bomb threat to the hospital. Can you link any news coverage on it?
      </p>

       Also, can you explain to me more about the Alharbi theory? Why do you believe it would be in anyone's interests to cover up his ties with the bombing?
