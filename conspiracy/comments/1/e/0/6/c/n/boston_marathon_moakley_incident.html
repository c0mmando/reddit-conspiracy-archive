        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has been nagging at me since it happened and I gotta ask about it because it was just so fishy. I was watching a live news feed after all the media was told that a suspect was definitely in custody. Does <em>anyone</em> have any idea what the hell went down at Moakley Courthouse?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s stuff I remember seeing/being reported.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Media outlets are abuzz with reports that a suspect is definitely in custody (according to some anonymous inside informant)</p></li>
<li><p>People/media begin to gather at Moakley Courthouse to see if they can catch a glimpse of anything </p></li>
<li><p>All of a sudden, people are quickly evacuated due to a Code Red, which I assume means bomb threat. Onlookers and media alike are pushed <em>way</em> back from the courthouse.</p></li>
<li><p>Amidst all this panic and an active bomb threat, a tinted van (with a man in a bullet proof vest hanging on to the passenger side) swoops in and quickly goes into the back entrance of the building</p></li>
<li><p>There were reports of a judge being allowed back in (in the midst of an active threat? o.O). One reporter suggests they might need the judge to help do a sweep but that&#39;s an absurd notion. Why would highly trained 
teams put a judge in danger? Clearly wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>People continue to be pushed back and there is all sorts of police, fbi, homeland security, swat, etc. presence</p></li>
<li><p>Someone from the courthouse says that they will process the suspect no matter what&#39;s going on at the courthouse; suggests they&#39;ll use alternate buildings.</p></li>
<li><p>The all clear is given around 4pm (when most people at the courthouse typically finish their day - reports that many people have gone home already becuase it was so late). Some guy waves a green flag (is that something they typically have lying around? and why not just speak into a megaphone or something?..just sayin&#39;)</p></li>
<li><p>Denial of the original report. (I wonder what ever happened w that informant)</p></li>
<li><p>Press conferences cancelled, citing the bomb threat (which was cleared already)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t know what all this means, but I know it&#39;s significant somehow. Some sort of fuckery was going on within these law enforcement circles. There was something that changed and the worst part is, the entire public was shut out. I feel like people were being massively manipulated, especially because the bomb threat made a convenient cover for the Feds to control who and what went into that building.</p>

<p>Please, if I got any parts of the story wrong or omitted anything, let me know. </p>

<p>Because the Executive Branch (i.e., police) aren&#39;t allowed to invade the sanctum of the Judiciary Branch.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible some liberal judge demanded to be present during the search by the Executive Branch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, this was a ploy to get all the reporters away from the hospital and to converge on the courthouse. It worked. </p>

<p>At the same time, a bomb threat was called into the hospital and much of the staff was evacuated.  A helicopter landed on the roof, the Saudi national was whisked away and when the staff returned, his chart was noted as &quot;transferred out&quot; or something to that effect.</p>

<p>This was orchestrated by the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw it on the news the day it happened. The MSM was all up in arms because the FBI &quot;leaked&quot; that they had a suspect in custody and then criticized the media for falsely reporting it. Some members of the media said that their sources worked for the FBI.</p>

<p>Here is one brief excerpt I found:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police on Wednesday evacuated the federal courthouse in Boston because of a bomb threat amid reports of a breakthrough in the marathon bombings investigation.</p>

<p>An AFP reporter at the scene said scores of people were ordered out of the building near the Boston seafront and two fire trucks were present.</p>

<p>Police moved onlookers more than 100 feet (30 meters) back from the building, but there was no immediate sign of an emergency.</p>

<p><strong>Separately, part of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, where many victims of Monday’s bomb attack were taken, was also briefly evacuated.</strong></p>
