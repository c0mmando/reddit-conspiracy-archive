    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t understand the connection you&#39;re trying to make.  serious question, i&#39;m not trolling or being deliberately obtuse:  are you meaning to imply that the testimony of his friends and associates was bogus?  </p>

<p>what i find interesting is that the way this is worded makes it seem as though their testimony described his <em>manner</em> of death, not just that he was suicidal, as if to say he stated that he was planning to decapitate himself in a working car fire.  </p>

<p>No it is not that simple. I was trying to bring to attention that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_testimony">testimony</a> and memory of events are<a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/loftus-palmer.html"> not completely reliable</a>.</p>

<p>You are correct about the wording of the article.  As it currently stands it does imply at some level that the person planned some elaborate and contrived suicide as well as implying that he told people about his supposed suicide plans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the main question is if they knew how he killed himself before talking to the police and saying what he told the friends before hand. If they were consistent and they did not know how he killed himself it would seem pretty credible. But if they had info on how he killed himself and then talked to police it would be less credible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe that the Butwin family was one of those killings made to look like a suicide- PLENTY of &quot;friends&quot; who came forward within minutes of the tragedy to bring up financial difficulties, health probs, and so on. I thought it suspicious. Uh.. look up the Butwin case if you want.. it was the guy that &quot;killed&quot; his entire family &amp; lit the van on fire in the Arizona desert. Because every suicided guy needs to get rid of the evidence. But yes, back to the subject, I&#39;d be leery of ANY friends/associates with information promoting the idea of suicide. You just can&#39;t read a person&#39;s mind, you know? I mean, who are THEY to determine why a person did it? </p>
