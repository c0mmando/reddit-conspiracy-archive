       They are bringing out these big "scandals" now as a distraction from the Benghazi hearings which were super critical of Hillary Clinton.  They can throw Obama under the bus now because he is in his second term, but they cannot have Hillary being publicly shamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the news didn't bring up the Benghazi hearings, they came at us with that murder verdict and those women being "found" in that guys house, then when that wasn't distracting the right wingers, they pulled these IRS and phone tapping scandals.  It's like a blinking light that pulls the attention away from something they don't want us discussing.

       It doesn't even matter who is behind the reigns anymore. The system is so broken that the president is claiming to hear about these scandals through the news. I shudder to think what surprises the next president in office has in store for us. Who would have ever imagined that Bush would look like a saint in comparison to Obama

       They are purposely focusing on the politics of benghazi.  Why not look more into what Stevens was actually doing there?  The CIA and heavy weapons were involved, but the only narrative we have is that it was just simply a terrorist attack.  What was the motive of the rebels?  What about the CIA outpost that was also hit?

       It brought it up for like a minute, it was completely overshadowed by those missing women suddenly being found and that murder trial verdict was conveniently set for the same date as the Benghazi hearings, at least here in the US it was overshadowed tenfold.

       Well, it's first of all  rediculous to think that the federal government has any power to change the date of a murder trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, there's been pretty much nonstop coverage o the hearing - which is surprising because literally no new information came out.

       Not on MSNBC or CNN, and yes TPTB can in fact do anything they want really, if they own the media and public perception, that Jodi Arias trial was a media event they probably had a hand in arranging the dates, etc.  To think its out of the realm of possibility is "rediculous" as you put it.

Im sorry for calling out fox nbc and msn .. I also looked for it via bing, google, and duckduckgo .. all I could find was blog coverage that had links to the live stream via CBS.

       I always find it funny that people with a strong distrust for the media, are the first to blame the media for not covering something they want it to. Not only that, but they claim to not watch the "MSM" and then complain about it not covering something. Well if you don't watch it, how do you know they aren't covering it? Of course YOU haven't seen any coverage because you haven't been WATCHING.

       There's a flip side to that as well.  There was a nearby base that housed CIA operatives and military commandos.  There was information that plenty of security was available but were commanded not to act.

       I disagree, I don't think the any administration would cover up a scandal involving the death of an ambassador with a scandal involving the Department of Justice attempting to snuff out the freedom of the press. I can buy it regarding the IRS scandal, that reeks of 1930's Chicago politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illegal seizure of the Associated Press phone records is a potentially much larger scandal in that it has really pissed off people on both the right and the left. Somebody leaked that this- but who?

       Who said anything about it being a detriment to the "future of the species"?  The species will still be here, it will just be enslaved, more so than now.  It's main purpose is to set the stage for world government under an unelected, undemocratic, private technocratic organization run by the big banks and robber baron families.  It's part of something called "the open conspiracy" they make their intentions very clear if you know how to see through the flowery rhetoric. It's part of a very old plan that is coming to a head.  Sorry, but you've obviously never studied this stuff.  Here's a little "fragment" for you:

        This partnership
        <strong>
         commits all States to engage in a continuous and constructive dialogue

        , inspired by the need

        <strong>
         interdependence of the community of nations
        </strong>
        and that sustainable development should become a priority item on the agenda of the international community. It is recognized that, for the success of this new partnership,
        <strong>
         it is important to overcome confrontation and to foster a climate of genuine cooperation and solidarity

       The robber baron families and big banks SET UP THE UN.  They are standardizing the world's infrastructure and laws in order to bring about standardized world government.  They will use the guise of environmentalism to control every aspect of your life from your water intake to your power consumption to what kind of car you can drive.  Eventually once the big carbon tax schemes get in place everyone will technically be enslaved, more so than now.  They push this "equity" meme to get the poor and "liberal" types on their side.  They have an army of NGOs and non-profits that are working to change culture as well as infiltrate local governments, as stated above in your "combating poverty" excerpt, the NGOs will be working hand in hand with local governments.  The NGOs are more or less the henchmen for the UN.  The robber baron families fund the NGOs, which create the non-profit advocacy groups that form fake "grassroots" movements in local areas in order to create the illusion of public support for the standardization of policy.  It's a genius plan, they've got you fooled.

       Look, I understand that the text is vague, and I am open to discussion the interpretation and implementation of A21, but you can't just make stuff up. For instance:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On Combating poverty, tell me where that isn't redistribution of wealth using NGOs? Communism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not to be racist, but that's such a stereotypically American things to say. Besides, it doesn't mention communism at all. In fact, it doesn't even mention redistribution of wealth. What it does talk about is empowering the local population and giving them more control over their own resources. In 3.7 "Giving communities a large measure of participation in the sustainable management and protection of the local natural resources in order to enhance their productive capacity;" or "Establish new community-based mechanisms and strengthen existing mechanisms to enable communities to gain sustained access to resources needed by the poor to overcome their poverty;"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm honestly not trying to cherry-pick, but A21
       <em>
        stresses
       </em>
       local and municipal control in many areas. It directly contradicts the globalist agenda. It continually emphasizes the need for a 'bottom-up" approach to most situations. Chapter 23: "23.2. One of the fundamental prerequisites for the achievement of sustainable development is broad public participation in decision-making. Furthermore, in the more specific context of environment and development, the need for new forms of participation has emerged. This includes the need of individuals, groups and organizations to participate in environmental impact assessment procedures and to know about and participate in decisions, particularly those which potentially affect the communities in which they live and work."
      </p>
      <p>
       You should look into Agenda 21 in Sweden, but you probably have since you've studied this. While I wouldn't judge it has a huge success by any means, there has been improvement in many of the areas targeted, including in the energy sector and public participation in governmental affairs. But nothing to indicate any
       <em>
        increased
       </em>
       centralization of power.

 But, as I mentioned originally, I'm interested in the text of Agenda 21 itself and whatever implementation that is the direct result of the agenda.

       The globalist agenda

        IS
       </em>
       bottom-up that's the point.  They are infiltrating local governments in the "approved" cities.  The small towns are dying off and the young people are moving into the cities, in Iowa(where I am) this is very obvious. T
      </p>
      <p>
       Agenda 21 has been updated several times, this includes the millennium development goals and every "+" meeting they've had, for instance Rio+20.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the excerpts you are citing are worded in a way that the people who are taking part in implementing it know what to do and that the people who are observing from the outside have a vague idea of what it
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       mean.  They bribe city councils with grants via the big foundations, then have the non-profits come in and cause a stir, then the NGOs arrive with the solutions to the "grassroots" movements' issues.  I cannot stress this enough, it is being implemented by stealth, dishonestly.  If you're in Sweden then you've already had the socialist propaganda shoved down your throat your entire life so all of this seems normal to you.  Here in the US, taxes are looked at as a bad thing, they literally enslave you to a system, so the less the better.  Agenda 21 initiatives increase taxes, property taxes, electric bills, food prices, etc.  How is that good for the poor? It's like this contradiction slips by people.  So we make people poorer, to somehow help the poor?  Makes total sense.  All while "saving" the environment from those pesky humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agenda 21 won't mention communism, it won't mention socialism, it won't mention fascism, because it doesn't want to blatantly spell out the goals, it makes it much easier to get people to go with it.  I mean shit, look at WHO put it together, people like Maurice Strong who is a Rothschild front man.  At the UNCED conference in Denver he was very adamant about kissing Rothschild ass, you should definitely look into that, there's the speech out there somewhere on the web.

       The standardization of laws, policies, schools, cultural norms, consumption patterns, infrastructure, taxes, etc, make bringing in a world government so much easier.  Let me put it this way, you slowly transition everyone into a standard way of life, especially at a local level making it seem less centralized, so that when the time comes to transition from nation-states into world government people notice no difference.  They're normalizing poverty lifestyles, hence the "walkable" cities and emphasis on public transit, the small cramped living environments, the focus on eating "local" food meaning you're not getting those oranges from Florida, or those Kiwis from NZ or wherever.
      </p>
      <p>
       My city is a perfect example, we had some guys from the "Walkable and Livable Communities Inc" come here and push their "smart growth" ideas, they want to tear up major roads and put walking paths in, to "encourage people to walk" instead of drive.  Yes great idea, except we live in Iowa and have some of the harshest winters in the country.   Here is a quote from
       <a href="http://wcfcourier.com/bluezones/articles/blue-zones-experts-visit-cedar-valley-looking-for-ways-to/article_46c61f76-1e54-5d6a-9a5a-e0fd6ddb4ed0.html">

        <em>

        , it's going to go

        ," he said. "Large cities in time will turn around, but it's going to be the smaller towns that have the ability to

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay so he is referring to some "next economy" meaning what?  For some reason we will all be walking everywhere, being "active", "knowing" "more" "neighbors" aka having more people crammed in around you.  Large cities are already sprawling so it will take a long time to consolidate them, but the "small towns" can "change more quickly" because for some reason we "work together"?  So he is pushing communitarianism basically, a nice way of saying socialism, collectivism.  This Blue Zones Project that he is a part of, is the local "grassroots" advocacy group(that didn't start here btw), funded by the NGO Wellmark, which is funded by the big corporation Blue Cross/Blue Shield among others.  This is the perfect Agenda 21 scenario.  They do it under the guise of "making things better", but really they are out to change everyone's way of life to their standard.  To get people ready for poverty, all under the guise of "healthy living".  Like they give a fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       The authoritarians have learned from the past, they need to condition people to changes as opposed to forcing it upon them.  You should read about social engineering and how that works.  Huxleys talked about it, so did Bertrand Russell.  The big think tanks all had super genius sociologists working for them and helped to lay out this plan.  It is a Fabian Socialist plan, the UN was created by the Royal Institute for International Affairs/Council on Foreign Relations and those groups were started by the Fabian Socialists.

       Actually the UN is setting up a Fascist world government that oversees a Soviet style communist slave population.  Calling me one of the dumbest people on here is just showing how dumb, in fact, you are.  Hate to break it to you.  A good portion of this sub agrees with this.  People who aren't stupid can see the big picture, unlike you, who has to keep making new accounts and still continues to troll for some unknown reason.
