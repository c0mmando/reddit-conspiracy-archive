        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Namely, the carefully constructed and yet utterly false initial story released by the US government disinfo agency the <strong>Associated Press (AP)</strong> within minutes of the shooting.</p>

<p>Recall.  That Ryan Lanza was lying dead in the school. The second shooter, his brother Adam Lanza was alive, caught in the woods. That Nancy Lanza was a teacher at Sandy Hook. That Adam Lanza killed their mother before the shooting, whilst Ryan Lanza killed their father, Peter. Ryan Lanza&#39;s girlfriend and another person were reported missing. Source - the Associated Press (AP).</p>

<p>Which &quot;journalist&quot; concocted this &quot;Lanza backstory&quot;, why and when? And why did AP release it without a shred of evidence? </p>

<p>Did the Sandy Hook operators make a huge screw-up by staging the shooting before their colleagues had killed Ryan and Peter Lanza? Did Ryan Lanza&#39;s comments on facebook save his (and his girlfiend&#39;s and father&#39;s) life?</p>

<p>Edit: The Associated Press is a newsfeeder organisation - they provide news to thousands of public media outlets. Most of the original news stories which sourced the above AP information have since (conveniently) been removed and updated, although there are still some if you google them. Here&#39;s one. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/ap-source-suspect-24-younger-brother-held-201020173--politics.html">http://news.yahoo.com/ap-source-suspect-24-younger-brother-held-201020173--politics.html</a></p>

<p>I believe the answer to those questions will reveal the truth of who carried out Sandy Hook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at what one of Ryan&#39;s friends here says it kinda backs up Sabremesh&#39;s narrative here. They had zero evidence of anything really, but some how 3 major news sources were reporting the exact same fairy tale, and just adding to it the first day. As you can see with this pic the image was captured at 5:46 PM EST and the bullets started flying through the &quot;front door glass of the school&quot; &lt;this came from wikipedia, not sure if this entry point is still the official story, I have heard different things and you can wager from what we have seen that it could change again. Only because the two officers to arrive first also had to shoot through the same exact door to get in.&gt; 9:35 AM EST, that is 8 hours from when the shooting started until Ryan Lanza, prolly got a call from a friend that said &quot;you&#39;re on my fucking TV DUDE!&quot; I will bring that back to seven hours for CT police to begin the investigation of Ryan&#39;s ID that Adam was carrying. In this seven hours these guys were able to create then disseminate said fairy tale. And in that time they were not able to, with all those cops everywhere. Follow a simple procedure, which is run the ID through the system, find where he works and call there to see. 1. If he was there at his job or he was laying dead in front of them or. 2. Since we no longer have a reasonable expectation of privacy and can easily find not only his cell phone number but track his phone without a warrant, call the FBI within 30 minutes could have a pinpoint position within a meter of his phones exact location. None of this happened. Why they didn&#39;t call his job and ask if he was there in the morning or if he missed work, has me baffled really. The first thing they would do is try to discover his movements throughout the day, to possibly aid them in discovering/catching a &quot;second gun man&quot; which was part of the fairy tale they had been spouting all day. No he posted on his facebook probably saving his life, and providing almost ironclad evidence of his where abouts all morning. They would have known this around at least 11:00 AM EST if they would have followed procedure. We won&#39;t really even get into the fact that Ryan weighed 50 more pounds than his brother and really looks nothing like him. People with Asperger syndrome can have strange facial features, my cousin has elfish ears and is high functioning just like Adam. I get that when you blow your head off shit can tend to get a little confusing. So enough time to do a full days work, yet the detectives inside the school doing the forensics, had no clue who this kid was in that time. Until people like us started posting images of Ryan&#39;s facebook page with his denials on CNN&#39;s facebook comments. Which changed the official story in reverse back to the cops. Does this sound about right to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you considered, I don&#39;t know, actually picking up the phone, calling editors, and asking the source of those initial reports? Maybe sending some brief, professional letters asking for the same?</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, if you can manage that without ranting and coming across like a loon you&#39;ll get some answers.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what cracks me up about so much of this. People like you scream for an explanation, even if there is an obvious one, but you don&#39;t actually do anything to go out and <em>get</em> an explanation. You don&#39;t do any <em>real</em> investigating, you just spew out a series of open-ended questions, dismiss any answer that doesn&#39;t fit your theory, rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Instead of asking questions into the nether, how about you go ask the people who can actually answer them? You fancy yourself someone investigating this thing ... THEN GO INVESTIGATE IT.</p>

<p>Granted, when the answers don&#39;t fit what you already believe you&#39;ll just dismiss &#39;em as part of the coverup, but at least you can put in some EFFORT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heck, they weren&#39;t even waiting to release complete stories. They were tweeting any update they got even before confirming its validity, broadcasting rumors on TV and the radio before confirming them, plucking rumors from social media and using them, and so on.</p>

<p>This is VERY common now. Newsrooms all across the US are pushing their reporters to Tweet Tweet Tweet and constantly update stories. They want your page views, they want to be first, they want to seem bleeding edge.</p>

<p>Many reporters are <em>frustrated</em> at being asked to work like this, but it&#39;s what their supervisors demand, so it&#39;s what they have to deliver.</p>

<p>The result has been a lot of shitty journalism. In <em>dozens</em> of breaking stories this has resulted in a slew of errors and inaccuracies being reported as the stories break, only to be corrected later when they get a chance to <em>actually</em> do their job.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lousy practice, but the public wants news NOW, with no delay, and is XYZ News doesn&#39;t provide it LMN News will.</p>

<p>That, or maybe this whole thing was a slip-up by the people who orchestrated this hugely complex false flag attack.</p>

<p>Somehow, I think if either of them were dead it would get out pretty quickly, what with their friends and acquiescence and coworkers loudly wondering where the heck they disappeared to, considering their connection to this shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really wasn&#39;t using my head, I was kicked into high gear when this shit went down that day. I should have screen shot the whole page, but only managed to get my snipping tool to work on this last relevant status update. Realizing now this will be seen as less than reliable without the entire page. It is what it is. What I remember was this post being the only thing on his page that had anything to do with Sandy Hook. Other things I noticed were, I think he may have fancied himself an artist, I seem to remember postings of some art work possibly in his back history. Having been around the block a few times myself I would judge some of that work to be slightly drug induced. I got the impression he would have subscribed to <a href="/r/trees">/r/trees</a><br/>
Ryan Lanza&#39;s last facebook post, before it was deleted.</p>

<p>The reason they published a story without all of the facts is because they were trying to scoop other news outlets. News outlets nowadays post all kinds of erroneous information from unreliable sources because they want to be the first to publish something. Later on they can go back and retract it. This is what happens when their is a 24 hour news cycle in a declining journalism industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or someone said &quot;family&quot; instead of just &quot;mother&quot; and a reporter took it to mean the whole family, or a load other perfectly reasonable, easy-to-make errors that can happen when a reporter is trying to get a million facts right on a huge, breaking, still-unfolding story, and trying to do it while dozens of others are trying to beat them to it.</p>

<p>Nah, who am I kidding? That&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>The far more reasonable explanation is that Sandy Hook was a carefully coordinated government attack involving dozens of agents and police officers, and potentially hundreds of other collaborators (families, actors, media members, and more), and that an unexpected change in plans was mistakenly revealed and quickly hushed up by the media. The hundreds who were involved in this conspiracy have thus far done a great job of remaining silent - it chills me to think what is being held over their head to ensure their silence - but thankfully the Internet has seen through their lies.</p>

<p>I mean it is obviously so easy to keep something like this a secret.  Nevermind that a current conspiracy involving at most 2 or 3 people, regarding a minor sports figure who made up a girlfriend, couldn&#39;t be kept secret for more than a couple months.  Surely something as large and as complex as this, with hundreds of moving parts involving hundreds of people would <strong>surely</strong> remain secret, oh except for these people here, who have seemingly &quot;divined&quot; the Real Story using nothing but YouTube videos of third-hand information.</p>

T=4
F=1 or X<em>T=4 years

I would be at least 100 times more scared=X of M then F

F=1</em>4  4 years of silence for Father O&#39; buttfukinlittleboys
M=100*4 400 years of silence for the military industrial complex factor in who records history and with my shitty country ass can&#39;t even pass Algebra 1 math skillz, We can be relatively sure that no one will ever fucking know about a conspiracy that is staged by M. That is unless you think I have been too generous when establishing the X of M? The thing about math is it doesn&#39;t lie. The values may not be exact, but even so a nuns ruler&#39;s effective range is 12&quot; long a ballistic missile&#39;s is 6,000 miles long. I think we can all agree with reasonable certainty that I have completely made you look  like an ass and like an ass your argument smells of shit. Shit we can also agree ranks just above my ability to do simple algebra. I&#39;m pretty sure my algebra teacher in high school had a stroke like the third day of my freshman year and nobody cared.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point Sabre is trying to make is, unless Adam did in fact have his brother&#39;s ID on him, it&#39;s an awfully lucky guess for them to say Ryan Lanza was the shooter. Depending on the time frame and whether or not the girlfriend was actually mentioned by name, it&#39;s odd at the very least that the report would have this much info about a family with no surviving family members in the vicinity of the investigation.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Is that what you call it when someone doesn&#39;t automatically accept that a few early reporting mistakes equals a conspiracy? You might want to take it down a notch.</p>

<p>Since I&#39;m obviously not going to make a dent in your conspiracy theorist armor, let me just leave you with one tip. Try not to take yourself so seriously, because it leads into pretty dark waters. You&#39;ve turned a few flippant comments on my end into some possible conspiracy where I&#39;m a government shill sent here to...I don&#39;t know what. Don&#39;t let yourself go from harmless conspiracy nut to full on PPD. There&#39;s no coming back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok... so this isn&#39;t really evidence at all.  Often as a story develops, the facts quickly change because they weren&#39;t known to begin with. 
A news agency (ie the AP) reports news as it happens, how is this supposed to be a 100% accurate process?  Its not even possible to have a news service that runs 100% accurate stories from the minute they happen.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this was or wan&#39;t a conspiracy one way or the other, but in order for this to pass the smell test it has to have more than ramblings and ravings. 
We need more quality posts that constructively help us identify conspiracies.  We need less posts that act as red herrings when actual conspiracies are happening. </p>

<p>In the script that the Sandy Hook planners had devised, Peter Lanza should have been murdered, just as Nancy Lanza was. Ryan Lanza&#39;s body should have been found at the scene, as well as Adam Lanza&#39;s body. </p>

<p>But whoever was tasked with abducting Ryan Lanza and killing Peter Lanza didn&#39;t do it. Unfortunately, nobody told the AP source at Sandy Hook, who revealed the official script in error. </p>

<p>For example, the explanation that Sandy Hook was the result of a lone kid going on a shooting spree is already proving to be false, especially because of massive, inexplicable errors in the supposed displays of grief we&#39;ve been prevented in the aftermath - after all the evidence came out, it became clear that the simplest and most likely explanation, to account for the evidence, is that the entire thing was staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reporters get a sniff of what&#39;s going down and they immediately call the local press (local reporting of this kind of event generates a lot of cash), the local reporter listens to the police scanners or just asks his police connection.  So the info he gets is, police have reports of gunshots at the lands house, police report back parent is dead, he interprets it as parents, so he finds the names of the parents and puts it in his story.  Remember, the local reporter is on a tight clock, he knows the nationals are in the choppers and coming fast.  He needs to sell as much story as he can to the news networks, so he&#39;s rushing the info.  As everyone at sandy hook appears to be completely useless at their jobs it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise that their local reporter is useless too.  Once the networks get their the story is very quickly altered, and a truer picture starts to come out.</p>

<p>I think the main conspiracy is that the water in sandy hook must have drugs in it.  Parents laughing their heads off, a nutty Jewish man with stuffed toys, a laughing oaf of a coroner, and a very relaxed happy police force.  Either that or sandy hook residents have access to the best weed ever.</p>

<p>Its convenient this smoking gun deliberately distorts the critical context here... which &#39;initial&#39; story? There is no single &#39;initial&#39; true story as published by A.P. or by other outlets, there was a fast fluid feeding frenzy stoked by hearsay, conjecture, rumour, social media and the medias own gluttony, that changed by the second as it was filtered and interpreted onto our screens. 
A.P. and the media in general published, changed, published, updated etc throughout the day...
They used social media as gospel, and skimmed through basic fact checking... and this is the foundation the smoking gun is built upon...

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at what one of Ryan&#39;s friends here says it kinda backs up Sabremesh&#39;s narrative here. They had zero evidence of anything really, but some how 3 major news sources were reporting the exact same fairy tale, and just adding to it the first day. As you can see with this pic the image was captured at 5:46 PM EST and the bullets started flying through the &quot;front door glass of the school&quot; &lt;this came from wikipedia, not sure if this entry point is still the official story, I have heard different things and you can wager from what we have seen that it could change again. Only because the two officers to arrive first also had to shoot through the same exact door to get in.&gt; 9:35 AM EST, that is 8 hours from when the shooting started until Ryan Lanza, prolly got a call from a friend that said &quot;you&#39;re on my fucking TV DUDE!&quot; I will bring that back to seven hours for CT police to begin the investigation of Ryan&#39;s ID that Adam was carrying. In this seven hours these guys were able to create then disseminate said fairy tale. And in that time they were not able to, with all those cops everywhere. Follow a simple procedure, which is run the ID through the system, find where he works and call there to see. 1. If he was there at his job or he was laying dead in front of them or. 2. Since we no longer have a reasonable expectation of privacy and can easily find not only his cell phone number but track his phone without a warrant, call the FBI within 30 minutes could have a pinpoint position within a meter of his phones exact location. None of this happened. Why they didn&#39;t call his job and ask if he was there in the morning or if he missed work, has me baffled really. The first thing they would do is try to discover his movements throughout the day, to possibly aid them in discovering/catching a &quot;second gun man&quot; which was part of the fairy tale they had been spouting all day. No he posted on his facebook probably saving his life, and providing almost ironclad evidence of his where abouts all morning. They would have known this around at least 11:00 AM EST if they would have followed procedure. We won&#39;t really even get into the fact that Ryan weighed 50 more pounds than his brother and really looks nothing like him. People with Asperger syndrome can have strange facial features, my cousin has elfish ears and is high functioning just like Adam. I get that when you blow your head off shit can tend to get a little confusing. So enough time to do a full days work, yet the detectives inside the school doing the forensics, had no clue who this kid was in that time. Until people like us started posting images of Ryan&#39;s facebook page with his denials on CNN&#39;s facebook comments. Which changed the official story in reverse back to the cops. Does this sound about right to you?</p>
