<p>I would figure on the average weekend, you should be able to drive down there and talk to people.  Especially if you are a legitimate journalist, like Alex Jones, and have bona fide credentials.</p>

<p>It seems weird, to me at least, that people so concerned about the truth are dragging their feet when they have access to Newtown, the people, etc... but are letting the trail get cold...</p>

I&#39;m pretty sure you could have posted a photo of yourself in the school next to Adam Lanzas dead body and these guys would have just claimed it was photo shopped. I am fairly certain that no amount of proof will sway some people. Anyone who seriously believes that the government pays people to get on REDDIT to discredit theories that only 3 people  believe (and that no one else is in danger of succumbing to because it is a rare breed indeed that is that stupid and closed minded) HAS REALLY GOT SOME PROBLEMS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep harping on this. Where, exactly, have you gathered that all the kids were shot in the face? Do you have a source indicating that all the kids were shot in the face?</p>

<p>You do realize that there were <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/newtown-ct-plans-burials-_n_2314785.html">reports of open-casket funerals</a> for <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cardinal-likens-newtown-teacher-jesus-funeral-article-1.1224378">multiple victims</a>, and that even before the funerals it was reported <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/newtown-undertaker-opens-week-hell-article-1.1221756">some would be open</a>, right?</p>

<p>But they&#39;re just MSM shills, of course. Best to ignore them. They&#39;re part of the Official Narrative.</p>

<p>All the children were shot in the face. None of the caskets were open. Got it.</p>

Does anyone else find it a little ironic that there is thread basically asking for someone who lives there to speak up now or forever hold their peace, and someone actually DOES and they are nice enough to post their ID to prove it to the best of their ability. Then they talk about events like funerals and the obviously missing children only to have everything dismissed because their grammar isn&#39;t perfect and therefore they MUST be lying? Because honestly, that is the behavior of a shill. Automatic dismissal with not a hint of real reason for doing so other than their own bizarre self motivated preconceived notions. Some of you are so convinced that it is a hoax that I&#39;m certain someone could show you photos of dead kids and video of Lanza going into the school only to have you say that it&#39;s faked or photoshopped. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ironic statement considering what it follows.  What makes you certain?  When can we expect to see such purported evidence.   As I said elsewhere, it only took a few years for a few ambibuous frames of a video of an object appearing to hit the pentagon to be released... a couple more and unconvincing footage of purported hijackers in a different airport.   Compared to all the security footage that should have been immediately available.. the longer you wait the more skeptical people become.  It&#39;s human nature.   Rail against it all you like but you have to agree that obvious evidence is not forthcoming.  Coupled with all the odd performances of purported grieving families and witnesses.   Our collective gut says hoax.   Don&#39;t like it?  Don&#39;t post in r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah i think I&#39;ll keep posting in r/conspiracy. It needs a few rational people. Far too many people who want to name call and piss on the graves of dead children for me to go away. And, aside from that, i do belong here because i don&#39;t discount every conspiracy, there are a couple I&#39;m quite interested in,  difference is i don&#39;t treat people like shit when they disagree with me, i just debate them or agree to disagree when im beat and unwilling to change my view due to what i think is still insufficient or shoddy evidence.  Only a petulant child throws a fit and calls names when they&#39;re cornered and can&#39;t get their way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just tired of every one just shouting shill. Ask the person for some more info. If they shut up or can&#39;t provide it or aren&#39;t willing to really debate, then they are probably just trolling. I think it&#39;s highly unlikely that there are any actual paid shills. What is more likely is that you have trolls or just people who are pissed off over something or another that&#39;s gotten passed around in here. </p>

<p>When everyone just shouts shill the second someone says something they don&#39;t like, or heaven forbid disagrees with them, it just makes the citizens of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> look as closed minded and as sheep like as those they &quot;condemn&quot;.

I think it is due to sandy hook. Denying dead children tends to attract trolls.  I would say there are a fair number of trolls, but shills? That&#39;s ridiculous. Quite different. It makes you all look ridiculous and paranoid which gives the trolls a little thrill and attracts more trolls.  Its like a self perpetuating cycle. The troll comes here to get a rise our of a paranoid person, he succeeds and gets screamed at and called a shill. He laughs for four hours over the ridiculous fact that some idiot actually believes that he was sent by the govt to spread disinfo. Then he goes and gets his troll friends who all comes back and do the same thing. Its like some people around here feed the trolls and the trolls feed them their paranoia...</p>

<p>There has been plenty of trolls making new accounts after some threads were featured on subredditdrama. So, as others do whether intentional or not, don&#39;t believe this sub-reddit has everyone with the same position or the same beliefs.

<p>It literally is not, at all. In reality there&#39;s no way you could do anything resembling a thorough investigation in one day.

<p>And that&#39;s all it would take. Realistically, there are probably several hundred people if not thousands who live in the (drivable) area and have seen the infamous Sandy Hook video.</p>

<p>Yet no one is doing it. Why? Because they love the fantasy, and have no need for any more evidence beyond the images they can glean from videos. They have everything they need for their story in front of them, and are not interested in anything else that could interfere with their tale.</p>

<p>This also ignores the amount of research that could be done over the phone and through other records available online. The problem is that the story isn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>I think it is more likely that people aren&#39;t doing it because:
1. Money
2. Time
3. Risk looking like a douche bag when people don&#39;t want to talk to you
4. Do not know how to conduct an effective investigation.</p>

<p>Granted, it could be done... but this is not just a day-trip, it is a genuine undertaking...</p>

<p>And perhaps someone is already doing it.</p>

<p>Wrong. As noted, it&#39;s close enough to many major population centers that I guarantee there are at minimum <em>thousands</em> who have seen the widely circulated video, think there is something to it, and have it within their power to go ask some questions on their own.</p>

<p>Thousands.</p>

<p>And all it would cost is a single day and maybe $80 or $90 for gas and food.</p>

<p>People have spent hours upon hours upon hours making videos and combing over Twitter posts ... but they don&#39;t have hours to hop in a car and ask some questions in the hope of someone say, &quot;Yeah, some of that stuff you saw on the news wasn&#39;t right?&quot;</p>

<p>So, here&#39;s my question to you, yet again. Do you honestly think that it would take a &quot;single day&quot; to interview everyone publicly involved in the event, family members who were interviewed that day, neighbors nearby who could&#39;ve saw something? If you honestly believe that, which is evident because you said that&#39;s all it would cost, then you&#39;re assuming that everybody in question will comply with you, will be present, and will be short and concise in their answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get downvoted for openly stating this, but fuck it.  I think you&#39;ve made very valid points.  I wonder how many people who <em>are</em> indeed within feasible driving distance would be willing to go through with this.  I think that in order for one to be willing to do some personal investigating on this matter, it would need to be effortless enough for them to be able to, say, get in their car and drive no more than 1/2 an hour to an hour in order to get to the location(s).  This, of course, already cancels out literally EVERYBODY on the planet that <em>isn&#39;t</em> within super close driving distance to Sandy Hook.  Of those individuals that ARE close enough, I wonder what their mindset is.  I wonder if any of the people in or around that SH area <em>are</em> indeed questioning and wondering about the MSM story.  I wonder if they think everything is as has been reported or if something&#39;s fishy.  I imagine that the number of people in the near vicinity that <em>do</em> question the MSM story might actually not be all that great in number.  I&#39;d be shocked if more than 100 people within a 60 mile radius of SH question the story as much as, say, the folks in this subreddit do.</p>

<p>And of those 100 or so, how many would be willing to drive and do some PI work of their own to try to uncover some stuff?  And of <em>that</em> fraction, which ones actually COULD do it? i.e. who are willing, but have a 9-5 job that keeps them from just getting up and going, or who are willing and have the time, but don&#39;t have a car, etc.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I think it would be cool if someone in or around the area would be willing to investigate, but it&#39;s not necessarily putting up any red flags as far as I&#39;m concerned that no one in or around the area is investigating because I don&#39;t think everyone else is as keen to just how fishy this whole story is.  I know it seems WAAAYYY obvious to <em>us</em> here that this whole thing stinks, but I also don&#39;t know just how aware others are of that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, don&#39;t assume that an investigator would ever necessarily need any of the info found here in r/conspiracy in order to get inspired to investigate SH.  It&#39;s possible that a person could simply figure out that the whole thing stinks on their own withOUT ever even knowing about Reddit period.  I wouldn&#39;t know the probabilities of this one way or the other, however, and, as such, I think where any possible PI got their &quot;inspiration&quot; is actually quite immaterial to the subject at hand here.</p>

<p>As far as the &quot;tangible, hard evidence&quot; needed in order to challenge the MSM&#39;s story, I <em>really</em> don&#39;t necessarily agree with that because the MSM&#39;s story has turned out to be SOOOO absolutely full of blatant holes that people have already found leaks left and right in the story without ever having stepped one foot in Sandy Hook.  &quot;Tangible, hard evidence&quot;, therefore, is not so much what&#39;s needed if one wants to show something awry afoot as much as sound logic in one&#39;s points.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We the sheep have been (purposefully, covertly, and erroneously) conditioned to regard individuals that question the MSM narrative as being general weirdos, vagrants, and &quot;loose screws&quot;.  The question being dealt with here, however, isn&#39;t necessarily whether the public would or would not regard as valid information discovered by some people (stupidly) called &quot;tin foil hatters&quot; as much as it deals with whether that information actually IS indeed sound or not.</p>

<p>I actually tend to reject the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; altogether, as its has purposefully (albeit covertly) been given an extremely sour connotation such that it absolutely tends to spoil the validity and repute of anything it is associated with.  This is a <em>very</em> purposeful foil on that part of TPTB designed to lead the sheep away from the truth of their (our) enslavement on this planet, and I personally just as well stay as far away from the word as I can (which I acknowledge is not always very easy since I <em>do</em> peruse through a subreddit bearing the very name).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly agree with everything you just said. I wasn&#39;t really referring to independent investigators, I was more or less saying that someone heeding the call to action made in this forum would likely need to leave any and all reference TO this forum out of the equation IF they were able to obtain good solid evidence and were interviewed for &quot;credibility&quot;.</p>

<p>MSM loves to poke fun at the &quot;tinfoil hatters&quot; (agreed, stupid term and we all know why people usually resort to name calling) which makes convincing the cognitively dissonant all that much more important. To affect real change, there needs to be a tipping point that finally connects to the people who suffer from the MSM delusion to the ones that have been &quot;calling a spade a spade&quot; for a while now.

<blockquote>

<p>Nothing against your family, as I mean the following toward <em>everyone</em> &quot;suffocating from cognitive dissonance&quot; (which has included often enough and <em>still</em> includes my own gf), but I personally feel that those suffocating from cognitive dissonance better then quickly pull their head out from the bag of MSM bull shit that they&#39;ve believed for so long and been stuck in all their lives.  I&#39;m a bit of a hard ass, and I&#39;ve had more than one disagreement (read &quot;fight&quot;) w/my gf about it, but we need to grow the fuck up and realize that our world is NOT as it seems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly, to them, media has no interest in lying. Why would they?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Believe me, I know about this mentality.  I remember my own moment of major cognitive dissonance happened a few years ago while I was researching the truth about what <em>really</em> happened on 911.  The moment was intense, to be sure (I cried and was really hurt upon realizing that TPTB are <em>that</em> fucking evil as to be willing to kill so many), but it lasted for I&#39;d say about one night, and then I realized that - again - shit was NOT as it seemed in this country/world...and at that point I simply shifted paradigms and just started doing more and more research into all the fucked up nefarious shit that goes on in this God forsaken planet.</p>

<p>Some people have a much easier time of dealing with paradigm-challenging (or shattering) information than others I guess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel that there are a great number of people out there that are so indoctrinated that the thought of something being orchestrated or staged is appalling and crazy talk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  Truth is that there&#39;s a very real part of me that wants nothing more than for those people to be woken up in the most fucking horribly Earth-shattering way possible. lol.  Again, I guess I can be an asshole like that, but I get pretty upset when I come across people who have a ton of hubris and haughtily, arrogantly proclaim that &quot;everything&#39;s okay and you all are just tin foil nut jobs for thinking that things <em>aren&#39;t</em> okay!&quot;  I just want to punch those fuckers in the face with the truth and say &quot;See!?  Look at <em>this</em>, you fucking dumb ass!?&quot; lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Media has a field day each and every time &quot;conspiracy&quot; is used as a descriptor for anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it&#39;s a purposeful ruse that&#39;s been conditioned into the masses so that the majority have a knee jerk reaction against those things TPTB don&#39;t want the masses to be aware of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To affect real change, there needs to be a tipping point that finally connects to the people who suffer from the MSM delusion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shit...After 911, I honestly don&#39;t know if that tipping point is even possible...It just seems that SO many of us really are 100% brainwashed.  I think the only thing that would/might do it is if the government/military just outright opens fire and started gunning down citizens in the street in front of everyone.  Even then, however.  The masses would wake up, but most would simply start running in fear instead of realizing it&#39;s all been a lie all along and start FIGHTING back to establish their/our <em>freedom</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly, too many far out conspiracies have spoiled the bunch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t entirely say that the far out conspiracies are exactly what has spoiled the bunch.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve helped credibility, of course, but I think what has really spoiled the bunch has really involved MSM-cointelpro-shills that have come in to purposefully skew and imbalance those who are really investigating things.  Again, the people that go TOO far out there <em>don&#39;t</em> help, of course, but I think if there wasn&#39;t a big movement to discredit those looking for the real truth in this world (and there IS a huuuge movement to discredit those looking for the real truth), then there wouldn&#39;t actually <em>be</em> that many people with theories that are too &quot;out there&quot; because the community wouldn&#39;t end up being as speculative as it unfortunately has to currently be given just how much TPTB lie and keep hidden from the public.</p>

I would if it meant less than POSSIBLY ending up tangled in a web of stories that could Possibly wind up getting me thrown into Guantanamo... Yeah resources are the problem. Not fear. </p>

<p>Seriously you think OP was the first person to think that someone other than federal agents should be investigating this! </p>

<p>To be completely honest if you drove into Newtown you would probably be able to spot a few Feds still sitting around. You think they are there to &quot;continue the investigation&quot;? I highly doubt it, they are probably there so that when people like you and me show up looking for the truth, an answer, or even a shred of evidence, they can black bag your ass and get you the fuck away.</p>

<p>Of course this all comes down to wether any of the stories are true or not. </p>

<p>To be honest I would just like to see what the school looked like in the hours after what took place. That in itself would answer a hell of a lot of my questions or possibly just replace them with more. And if I could make it out there I probably would to see what has happened at the school since, and what the townsfolk have to say. Though they may just get pissed that your a nosey conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>If someone were wanting to do it, and willing they would, but they probably wouldn&#39;t post a thing about it on reddit. Not because they found them self&#39;s black bagged but because they fear it. And if they did they better be damn sure when they post the evidence that there identity is safe while doing so. </p>

<p>I&#39;m geusing that town has seen quite a few strangers in the past month, and they probably asked there fair share of questions, turned over a few stones. Hell maybe even found a few skeletons, but that dosnt mean they will tell anyone about it. </p>

<p>I probably wouldn&#39;t though I am curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>/Face palm.  He did not say you could interview &#39;everybody involved&#39; in 24 hours.  He merely said you could mount an investigation in 24 hours.  Mounting an investigation does NOT mean you talk to absolutely everyone involved.  If your ridiculous theory had any merit it would be possible to talk to a sufficient number of invdivuals to find evidence of the (non-existant) &#39;cover-up&#39; within a 24 hour period.  This is what bamshoulddie is arguing.  </p>

<p>No where did bamshoulddie say an investigation would require talking to &#39;everybody involved&#39; as you claim.  Your argument is a straw man and damages your credibility (that is assuming anyone who believes this conspiracy has any credibility to begin with).   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, i disagree. I think my assumption is closer to the truth. Why else would she delete everything? If she were a liar or a shill or troll who just set up the account for fun, then why delete it? Why not just abandon or and star a new account, is not hard. I think, and yes i have zero proof but this is what a reasonable person would conclude, is that she deleted it because she put her actual photo up on her actual id and was afraid of being harassed in life. If she actually deleted her account ( I&#39;m on my phone so not going to check right now) i would say its because our was linked to get personal email.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m not saying you should absolutely believe her my point is that if you year anyone, liar or honest, like that chance are they are going to run off. Its sort of like using torture to obtain a confession, if you keep at it long enough, the person eventually gives up and regardless of whether they are guilty our not, they&#39;ll tell you what you want to hear. In this case you harassed (collective you) someone enough that they decided it want worth it and deleted everything and now you will never really know the truth. If you all had been nice to her, she might have been able to provide the more substantial proof you were asking for or, she might have accidentally revealed herself to be a troll. As it stands you instantly attacked her and didn&#39;t give her much of a chance either way. That indicates to me personally that someone here is scared of what she might say or what sort of proof she might actually have. Its much easier to harass her till she shuts down than deal with the fact that she might be telling the truth.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this sorry of behavior exactly what you accuse those supposedly perpetrating these supposed conspiracies of? Why would you want to operate in the same manner? Sort of makes one think, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

An explanation which is just as likely is the person became frustrated trying to discuss the subject here, and decided to extract herself from the manure pit.</p>

<p>They never claimed to view a funeral for a child shot in the face, open casket or othewise, and you still <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/172igg/are_there_no_sandy_hook_truthers_who_live_near/c81wi7j">haven&#39;t answered questions</a> about your &quot;shot in the face&quot; claims.</p>

<p>Fixed. I doubt I&#39;d leave my account up, either, if lunatics were <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/172igg/are_there_no_sandy_hook_truthers_who_live_near/c81vz95">posting where I&#39;d be that night</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re simply a troll, I at least hope it&#39;s because you make some money from your YouTube videos. At least that&#39;s an understandable reason.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re genuine, I kind of feel bad for you. You&#39;re terribly broken inside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legit question.</p>

<p>How could this be a hoax? Everyone is talking about the whole thing being staged, but it just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Who are the children who were &quot;supposedly&quot; killed? If the children never existed in the first place, then wouldn&#39;t it raise questions when the families bury a child that none of their friends or relatives ever heard of? If these are the actual children of these families, then what happened to them? Did they agree to have these kids shipped off for the rest of there lives to cover it up? Or are these &quot;families&quot; not real at all?</p>

<p>In any one of these situations, you would need thousands of people to be in on the conspiracy, try keeping that a secret and see how long it lasts. No one would be stupid enough to pull off a stunt like that.</p>

<p>The only way in which this could be possibly a hoax is if someone found a guy crazy enough to actually shoot up a school, which is still really risky, but the only way you would have a shot at pulling it off. But then why would you even risk that, with the rate at which mass shootings happen, it was only a matter of time before something like this happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve ever lived in a small town you&#39;d understand that virtually everyone in Newtown knows who&#39;s kids were killed.  Virtually everyone knows someone or other from the TV reports.  Yeah, I supposed a non-local could slip through once or twice, but if it happened regularly the people of Newtown would be talking about it on Facebook or elsewhere.  Especially if that person acted insincere or said anything inflammatory.  </p>

These people actually lost their kids.

<p>If there is any conspiracy here it has nothing to do with whether or not these kids were killed. Get a grip. </p>

He&#39;s challenging conspiracy theorists and asking why, if they&#39;re so certain this situation was filled with actors and fake deaths and lies and the like, they don&#39;t take the steps necessary to begin making their case by taking a drive and investigating. This is pretty clear if you read even just a few of his comments that he does not believe he conspiracy theory, and in fact thinks it&#39;s crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t do it, but if some crazy asshole would sneak into the school and got pictures of bullet damage on the walls or floors we could put this shit to rest. Well a lot of it anyway. The obvious solution is to go down a list of shit checking things off. You would only need to be in that town for a day. You needn&#39;t disturb any victims or property, but I think you could start to get a good idea after 24 hrs. I keep hearing something about a demolition of this school. Another possibility is to wait until demolition plans are set. Find the highest bidder that won the bid, try to get into contact with an adjunct flunky at this company and pay his ass for pictures of bullet damage. They will need to do some inner work on the structure to bring it down. Deduce from the info they have released, where the suspect possibly did the shooting. Think of everything so your flunky knew ahead of time where everything went down and any possible situations or needs to maintain his flunky persona and stealth. No bullet damage IS a smoking gun. Bullet damage however things become messy and if that was the case I would stop talking about this shit completely. In my humble opinion if kids did die? It&#39;s really not worth trying to Sherlock that shit back to possible government shooters. That would just be another 911 quagmire....giggity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of the Sandy Hook Truthers don&#39;t believe there <em>are</em> any dead children, and many others think that grieving parents were actors. Since they don&#39;t believe there are shell-shocked, saddened parents out there, why would they worry about hurting feelings? Those people were just a bunch of phonies, anyway, right?</p>

<p>You&#39;d think it would be a simple matter to go up there, talk to some neighbors and employers and the like, and determine that the people we saw on TV were not who they claimed to be, or that certain families don&#39;t actually exist, and a million other things that would confirm their suspicions.</p>

<p>Yet no one has done this.</p>

<p>Nick Phelps is a sales exec for UBM living in Newtown, not purported &quot;crisis actor&quot; Richard Sexton of Florida.

Again, we must simply conclude - based on the fact that anyone could have written that - that the Psychiatric Times is controlled by the CIA, or whoever pulled off this massive coverup, which was done in such a piss poor fashion that they couldn&#39;t even get non-married, non-related crisis actors to portray real, married ones from Newtown and they had to also use their extended families to portray other Newtown citizens.  The New World Order is just so hard up on resources and cash that they couldn&#39;t find more anonymous actors, is that it?  Couldn&#39;t pull the wool over your eyes, could they?  How do you people even know about the Sextons?  Where did they come from?  Was some conspiracy person just trolling around Picassa and found these people by accident?  I think not. </p>

<p>&quot;All we want is footage of the kids being evacuated!&quot; If released, that will be inconclusive; it can still have been a staged event.</p>

<p>&quot;We just need to see photos of Adam Lanza in the school!&quot; If released, they will not be enough. He was set up. Where is the other shooter (who doesn&#39;t exist)?</p>

<p>&quot;They just need to release security footage of Lanza entering the school!&quot; They could see it, and would then decide they need to see something else.</p>

<p>There will always be some anomaly or inconsistency or problem, usually of their own invention. Full, unedited footage from multiple security cameras could show the entire event from start to finish, bullet-riddled little children bleeding out and all, and they&#39;d still find something to latch onto that tells them &quot;the official story is full of holes!&quot; Lanza was mind-controlled, he was this, he was that.</p>

<p>No, you fucking can&#39;t. It&#39;s absurd to think anyone could go up there for a couple of hours do as thorough of an attempt of an investigation any one man could; being thorough would involve something like hundreds of phone calls, dozens if places to knock up on, locations to visit, hanging out in a general location for a period of time just asking random people, time it takes to have an interview with someone if they chose to agree. What if a certain person of interest is sick or out of town? You would be shit out of luck and you came for nothing if you&#39;re time constrained.</p>

<p>You could, you also could not. What if you only get two interviews from a witness that day? You pack it up and go home because you&#39;re there for 24 fucking hours.

<p>Yes, you can.

<p>Right, because you&#39;re DEFINITELY going to find Nick Phelps and EVERYBODY knows where he is for sure. And if you were to find him, he&#39;d TOTALLY talk to you. You see the problem with this? You&#39;re assuming way too many things. </p>

<p>My only assumption at this point is that you&#39;re being disingenuous.</p>

<p>After all, why would someone argue so vehemently against the idea of going to Newton to uncover at least <em>part</em> of the truth? Why so <em>angry</em> at the idea? Why so opposed to the notion that it could be done?</p>

<p>Is it because you don&#39;t actually believe what you&#39;re selling, or is it what I floated earlier, that you&#39;re utterly inept and therefore can&#39;t believe someone else could do what you cannot?</p>

<p>The reason why you are crying for someone else to go and vent your hostility Daphne is because the thought of other people in the town recognizing it in you terrifies you.  The thought of what they would do to you when you imagine you have to stop ... being a nation that sends a mountain of condolence cards and flowers but Americans instead.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legit question.</p>

<p>How could this be a hoax? Everyone is talking about the whole thing being staged, but it just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Who are the children who were &quot;supposedly&quot; killed? If the children never existed in the first place, then wouldn&#39;t it raise questions when the families bury a child that none of their friends or relatives ever heard of? If these are the actual children of these families, then what happened to them? Did they agree to have these kids shipped off for the rest of there lives to cover it up? Or are these &quot;families&quot; not real at all?</p>

<p>In any one of these situations, you would need thousands of people to be in on the conspiracy, try keeping that a secret and see how long it lasts. No one would be stupid enough to pull off a stunt like that.</p>

<p>The only way in which this could be possibly a hoax is if someone found a guy crazy enough to actually shoot up a school, which is still really risky, but the only way you would have a shot at pulling it off. But then why would you even risk that, with the rate at which mass shootings happen, it was only a matter of time before something like this happened.</p>

<p>They never claimed to view a funeral for a child shot in the face, open casket or othewise, and you still <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/172igg/are_there_no_sandy_hook_truthers_who_live_near/c81wi7j">haven&#39;t answered questions</a> about your &quot;shot in the face&quot; claims.</p>

<p>Fixed. I doubt I&#39;d leave my account up, either, if lunatics were <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/172igg/are_there_no_sandy_hook_truthers_who_live_near/c81vz95">posting where I&#39;d be that night</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re simply a troll, I at least hope it&#39;s because you make some money from your YouTube videos. At least that&#39;s an understandable reason.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re genuine, I kind of feel bad for you. You&#39;re terribly broken inside.</p>
