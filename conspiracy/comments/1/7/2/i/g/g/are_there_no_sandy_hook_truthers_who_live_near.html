       I ask because I think it's weird we have all of these videos based solely on media reports, but no one, even Alex Jones, has put "boots on the ground", to take some screen grabs from interviews done with parents and students in the aftermath of the "hoax" and ask if they know the people and see if they really are actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would figure on the average weekend, you should be able to drive down there and talk to people.  Especially if you are a legitimate journalist, like Alex Jones, and have bona fide credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems weird, to me at least, that people so concerned about the truth are dragging their feet when they have access to Newtown, the people, etc... but are letting the trail get cold...

       Don't let the name callers get you down. They are just pissed that you said something that didn't fit their fictional reality. I'm pretty sure you could have posted a photo of yourself in the school next to Adam Lanzas dead body and these guys would have just claimed it was photo shopped. I am fairly certain that no amount of proof will sway some people. Anyone who seriously believes that the government pays people to get on REDDIT to discredit theories that only 3 people  believe (and that no one else is in danger of succumbing to because it is a rare breed indeed that is that stupid and closed minded) HAS REALLY GOT SOME PROBLEMS.

       Wow a thread full of people wanting to investigate Newtown... then someone from Newtown responds and it gets ignored.

       You would think this would be at the top with people demanding proof. But nope.  The "conspiracy theorists" on here don't even bother to read half way down the thread.

       yeah and we never ask for proof on Reddit either huh? I mean, we would just have to believe them right? So it's best to just ignore it and never ask.

       lol the shills just come out of the wood work. its funny we have made such progress.  The shills have no chance and for them to suggest "truthers" go investigate its straight from the Cointelpro playbook.

       You keep harping on this. Where, exactly, have you gathered that all the kids were shot in the face? Do you have a source indicating that all the kids were shot in the face?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize that there were
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/newtown-ct-plans-burials-_n_2314785.html">
        reports of open-casket funerals

        multiple victims
       </a>
       , and that even before the funerals it was reported
       <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/newtown-undertaker-opens-week-hell-article-1.1221756">
        some would be open
       </a>
       , right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But they're just MSM shills, of course. Best to ignore them. They're part of the Official Narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the children were shot in the face. None of the caskets were open. Got it.

       I don't want to come off as pushy but you should do an IAMA on the toll this has taken on the community.  It would be very interesting to get a clearer understanding of the whole event and may shed more light on what hasn't been said.

       So you are picking at his grammar? Does anyone else find it a little ironic that there is thread basically asking for someone who lives there to speak up now or forever hold their peace, and someone actually DOES and they are nice enough to post their ID to prove it to the best of their ability. Then they talk about events like funerals and the obviously missing children only to have everything dismissed because their grammar isn't perfect and therefore they MUST be lying? Because honestly, that is the behavior of a shill. Automatic dismissal with not a hint of real reason for doing so other than their own bizarre self motivated preconceived notions. Some of you are so convinced that it is a hoax that I'm certain someone could show you photos of dead kids and video of Lanza going into the school only to have you say that it's faked or photoshopped.

       Ironic statement considering what it follows.  What makes you certain?  When can we expect to see such purported evidence.   As I said elsewhere, it only took a few years for a few ambibuous frames of a video of an object appearing to hit the pentagon to be released... a couple more and unconvincing footage of purported hijackers in a different airport.   Compared to all the security footage that should have been immediately available.. the longer you wait the more skeptical people become.  It's human nature.   Rail against it all you like but you have to agree that obvious evidence is not forthcoming.  Coupled with all the odd performances of purported grieving families and witnesses.   Our collective gut says hoax.   Don't like it?  Don't post in r/conspiracy.

       Nah i think I'll keep posting in r/conspiracy. It needs a few rational people. Far too many people who want to name call and piss on the graves of dead children for me to go away. And, aside from that, i do belong here because i don't discount every conspiracy, there are a couple I'm quite interested in,  difference is i don't treat people like shit when they disagree with me, i just debate them or agree to disagree when im beat and unwilling to change my view due to what i think is still insufficient or shoddy evidence.  Only a petulant child throws a fit and calls names when they're cornered and can't get their way.

       I don't think you know what the words critically and logically mean. You can claim you're seeking the truth by "questioning everything", but really it just means you can't tell good information from bad information.

       We have methods of determining whether something is falsely attributed. The problem is, you're starting from a conclusion and trying to find evidence, rather than letting the evidence inform the conclusion. 
Which brings us back to your inability to tell good information from bad information.

       What conclusion have I made?   Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  I am provably trained in scientific method.   Not that I give a shit what a throwaway cunt on the internet thinks.  Go fuck yourself.

       Have no words for your community, please understand that very severe consequences could happen for America if they go down the road of gun bans, like New York. What I am looking for is anyone who saw the shooter, not the nurse she already gave her story and she saw nothing but knees. Initial reports were that there were survivors, who, if any?

       If you post anything within 6 months of signing up for reddit, someone somewhere will accuse you of being a shill for whatever you post involves. (there's a whole subreddit where they find new people who even mention products like soda or computers and accuse them of being corporate plants)

       I predict you get more people calling your photo into question and demanding more proof than you do people who back off and apologize.

       Wow. What an ass you are. Seriously? How about, instead of yelling "shill" You ask celesticas to perhaps scan an ID and black out all of the personal bits leaving the part that says 
"newtown ct". I still think even that is a little rude to ask, but it's less rude than screaming "shill"

       This is because the vast majority of people do not have Reddit accounts, if they've heard of Reddit at all, and don't create accounts until they have something they want to post. It's weird that you need this pointed out. With that in mind, are you an overweight, bearded white male, by any chance?

       I'm just tired of every one just shouting shill. Ask the person for some more info. If they shut up or can't provide it or aren't willing to really debate, then they are probably just trolling. I think it's highly unlikely that there are any actual paid shills. What is more likely is that you have trolls or just people who are pissed off over something or another that's gotten passed around in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       When everyone just shouts shill the second someone says something they don't like, or heaven forbid disagrees with them, it just makes the citizens of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       look as closed minded and as sheep like as those they "condemn". I would think that the whole point would be to open up the eyes of people that you would think of as lost. That being said, you catch more flies with honey. Screaming insults and immediately brushing people off who might have something to offer is short sighted.

       I lurked for a long time before i started posting. Honestly it helps me get my dad because he is full blown tinfoil hat (not meant to be insulting, it is how it is) i get good arguments to use with him from here.  I noticed the uptick. I think it is due to sandy hook. Denying dead children tends to attract trolls.  I would say there are a fair number of trolls, but shills? That's ridiculous. Quite different. It makes you all look ridiculous and paranoid which gives the trolls a little thrill and attracts more trolls.  Its like a self perpetuating cycle. The troll comes here to get a rise our of a paranoid person, he succeeds and gets screamed at and called a shill. He laughs for four hours over the ridiculous fact that some idiot actually believes that he was sent by the govt to spread disinfo. Then he goes and gets his troll friends who all comes back and do the same thing. Its like some people around here feed the trolls and the trolls feed them their paranoia...

       some people have noticed but some take the bait and end up in an argument with trolls that you can spot a mile off. The Sandy Hook thing was posted here for about a week solid and then it died off only to be revived by trolls spamming the same exact video over and over and populating the comments with vile comments which weren't like that when it was originally posted.
      </p>

       There has been plenty of trolls making new accounts after some threads were featured on subredditdrama. So, as others do whether intentional or not, don't believe this sub-reddit has everyone with the same position or the same beliefs. There is people intentionally smearing this sub-Reddit elsewhere for whatever reason and making out as if everyone believes Sandy Hook was some sort of operation or we all listen to Alex Jones which for both not all do.

       Yes, please DO scan your ID-  even that though isn't proof of anything that happened at SANDY HOOK-  "You" apparently live in Newtown and there is no proof "you" are the person on the ID anyway.

       Even if you are some person who lives in Newtown- what does that prove exactly?

       They have enough "evidence" as it stands now to believe whatever they want to. Actual research is far more likely to be disappointing and contrary to the wonderful tale they've woven in their heads, and they know it.

       The real ticket to crazy town is when you realize that these theories often spill out of the same groups who think government is incompetent and should be gutted. I guess the incompetence stops at being able to coordinate local, state, and federal authorities to fool a town, state, nation and world that 20 children died, so that they MIGHT pass some legislation that would regulate high capacity gun sales GOING FORWARD (nobody is taking anybody's guns).

       People confuse the government for being incompetent when in fact it's that it doesn't wish to do any good for the people. If it wanted to do good for the people it would, and do a great job of it. Just like it does a great job if doing the wrong thing right now.

       So they don't have access to transportation of ANY kind to travel to Newtown?  You would think the search for the real truth would mean the people would do anything to expose the truth.  Driving to a town in CT on a weekend with some printed out screen captures isn't like going to the moon.  It's literally a day trip.

       I was having a talk with a friend who believes this conspiracy, and suggested he just go down to Newtown. We only live about 3 hours away, and he was ranting about how he'd do anything to defend his 2nd Amendment rights, etc. etc., but refused to take a single weekend day to visit the people he claimed were crisis actors.

       It literally is not, at all. In reality there's no way you could do anything resembling a thorough investigation in one day. Hundreds of phone calls, dozens if places to knock up on, locations to visit, time it takes to have an interview with someone if they chose to agree. What if a certain person of interest is sick or out of town? You would be shit out of luck and you came for nothing if you're time constrained.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point: The vast majority of folks do not have the time and resources to do this and they are not organized anywhere outside of youtube/reddit/blogs. Only a handful of folk could/would do this.

       And that's all it would take. Realistically, there are probably several hundred people if not thousands who live in the (drivable) area and have seen the infamous Sandy Hook video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet no one is doing it. Why? Because they love the fantasy, and have no need for any more evidence beyond the images they can glean from videos. They have everything they need for their story in front of them, and are not interested in anything else that could interfere with their tale.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also ignores the amount of research that could be done over the phone and through other records available online. The problem is that the story isn't there.

       I think it is more likely that people aren't doing it because:
1. Money
2. Time
3. Risk looking like a douche bag when people don't want to talk to you
4. Do not know how to conduct an effective investigation.

       Wrong. As noted, it's close enough to many major population centers that I guarantee there are at minimum
       <em>
        thousands

       who have seen the widely circulated video, think there is something to it, and have it within their power to go ask some questions on their own.

       Thousands.

       People have spent hours upon hours upon hours making videos and combing over Twitter posts ... but they don't have hours to hop in a car and ask some questions in the hope of someone say, "Yeah, some of that stuff you saw on the news wasn't right?"

       Wrong. Read this:

        No, you fucking can't. It's absurd to think anyone could go up there for a couple of hours do as thorough of an attempt of an investigation any one man could; being thorough would involve something like hundreds of phone calls, dozens if places to knock up on, locations to visit, hanging out in a general location for a period of time just asking random people, time it takes to have an interview with someone if they chose to agree. What if a certain person of interest is sick or out of town? You would be shit out of luck and you came for nothing if you're time constrained.

       My last post wasn't a rebuttal to your statement, it was a question based on what you actually said. At this point you're just being disingenuous. Here's what you said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And all it would cost is a single day and maybe $80 or $90 for gas and food.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, here's my question to you, yet again. Do you honestly think that it would take a "single day" to interview everyone publicly involved in the event, family members who were interviewed that day, neighbors nearby who could've saw something? If you honestly believe that, which is evident because you said that's all it would cost, then you're assuming that everybody in question will comply with you, will be present, and will be short and concise in their answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And. that. assumption. is. absurd.

       Way to deflect.  Seriously, you think everyone who questions this lives in Texas?  None of them live in CT or nearby?  Don't be obtuse, you shill.  As I said, just walk around Newtown on a weekend day, like Saturday, and ask if people know those people and how long they have known them for.  Stand outside a super market, where people usually go on the weekends, for even better exposure.

       I'm sure I'll get downvoted for openly stating this, but fuck it.  I think you've made very valid points.  I wonder how many people who
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed within feasible driving distance would be willing to go through with this.  I think that in order for one to be willing to do some personal investigating on this matter, it would need to be effortless enough for them to be able to, say, get in their car and drive no more than 1/2 an hour to an hour in order to get to the location(s).  This, of course, already cancels out literally EVERYBODY on the planet that
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       within super close driving distance to Sandy Hook.  Of those individuals that ARE close enough, I wonder what their mindset is.  I wonder if any of the people in or around that SH area
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed questioning and wondering about the MSM story.  I wonder if they think everything is as has been reported or if something's fishy.  I imagine that the number of people in the near vicinity that
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       question the MSM story might actually not be all that great in number.  I'd be shocked if more than 100 people within a 60 mile radius of SH question the story as much as, say, the folks in this subreddit do.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of those 100 or so, how many would be willing to drive and do some PI work of their own to try to uncover some stuff?  And of
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       fraction, which ones actually COULD do it? i.e. who are willing, but have a 9-5 job that keeps them from just getting up and going, or who are willing and have the time, but don't have a car, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah.  I think it would be cool if someone in or around the area would be willing to investigate, but it's not necessarily putting up any red flags as far as I'm concerned that no one in or around the area is investigating because I don't think everyone else is as keen to just how fishy this whole story is.  I know it seems WAAAYYY obvious to
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       here that this whole thing stinks, but I also don't know just how aware others are of that.

       Regardless, the investigator being inspired by r/conspiracy would need some SERIOUSLY TANGIBLE hard evidence if something turned out to be different than what's been reported. Does anyone really think that as much as r/conspiracy sees  irregularities in the MSM report, that if tangible evidence were found, it would be given one iota of credibility once it's been determined that the evidence was found by "them tinfoil hatters"? Someone recently mentioned the use of the phrase "conspiracy agnostic". If only that description could be used and understood because truly that's what i think myself and many in this forum are.

      <p>
       First of all, don't assume that an investigator would ever necessarily need any of the info found here in r/conspiracy in order to get inspired to investigate SH.  It's possible that a person could simply figure out that the whole thing stinks on their own withOUT ever even knowing about Reddit period.  I wouldn't know the probabilities of this one way or the other, however, and, as such, I think where any possible PI got their "inspiration" is actually quite immaterial to the subject at hand here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the "tangible, hard evidence" needed in order to challenge the MSM's story, I
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       don't necessarily agree with that because the MSM's story has turned out to be SOOOO absolutely full of blatant holes that people have already found leaks left and right in the story without ever having stepped one foot in Sandy Hook.  "Tangible, hard evidence", therefore, is not so much what's needed if one wants to show something awry afoot as much as sound logic in one's points.

       We the sheep have been (purposefully, covertly, and erroneously) conditioned to regard individuals that question the MSM narrative as being general weirdos, vagrants, and "loose screws".  The question being dealt with here, however, isn't necessarily whether the public would or would not regard as valid information discovered by some people (stupidly) called "tin foil hatters" as much as it deals with whether that information actually IS indeed sound or not.

      <p>
       I actually tend to reject the word "conspiracy" altogether, as its has purposefully (albeit covertly) been given an extremely sour connotation such that it absolutely tends to spoil the validity and repute of anything it is associated with.  This is a
       <em>
        very

       purposeful foil on that part of TPTB designed to lead the sheep away from the truth of their (our) enslavement on this planet, and I personally just as well stay as far away from the word as I can (which I acknowledge is not always very easy since I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       peruse through a subreddit bearing the very name).

       I mostly agree with everything you just said. I wasn't really referring to independent investigators, I was more or less saying that someone heeding the call to action made in this forum would likely need to leave any and all reference TO this forum out of the equation IF they were able to obtain good solid evidence and were interviewed for "credibility".
      </p>

       The reason I am of this belief is because I have a contingent of my family that is very conservative and, in their cases, are suffocating from the grip of cognitive dissonance. Sadly, to them, media has no interest in lying. Why would they? I feel that there are a great number of people out there that are so indoctrinated that the thought of something being orchestrated or staged is appalling and crazy talk. Media has a field day each and every time "conspiracy" is used as a descriptor for anything.

       MSM loves to poke fun at the "tinfoil hatters" (agreed, stupid term and we all know why people usually resort to name calling) which makes convincing the cognitively dissonant all that much more important. To affect real change, there needs to be a tipping point that finally connects to the people who suffer from the MSM delusion to the ones that have been "calling a spade a spade" for a while now. Sadly, too many far out conspiracies have spoiled the bunch.

       Nothing against your family, as I mean the following toward

       "suffocating from cognitive dissonance" (which has included often enough and
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       includes my own gf), but I personally feel that those suffocating from cognitive dissonance better then quickly pull their head out from the bag of MSM bull shit that they've believed for so long and been stuck in all their lives.  I'm a bit of a hard ass, and I've had more than one disagreement (read "fight") w/my gf about it, but we need to grow the fuck up and realize that our world is NOT as it seems.

      <p>
       Yeah.  Believe me, I know about this mentality.  I remember my own moment of major cognitive dissonance happened a few years ago while I was researching the truth about what
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       happened on 911.  The moment was intense, to be sure (I cried and was really hurt upon realizing that TPTB are
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       fucking evil as to be willing to kill so many), but it lasted for I'd say about one night, and then I realized that - again - shit was NOT as it seemed in this country/world...and at that point I simply shifted paradigms and just started doing more and more research into all the fucked up nefarious shit that goes on in this God forsaken planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people have a much easier time of dealing with paradigm-challenging (or shattering) information than others I guess.

       Yeah.  Truth is that there's a very real part of me that wants nothing more than for those people to be woken up in the most fucking horribly Earth-shattering way possible. lol.  Again, I guess I can be an asshole like that, but I get pretty upset when I come across people who have a ton of hubris and haughtily, arrogantly proclaim that "everything's okay and you all are just tin foil nut jobs for thinking that things
       <em>
        aren't

       Shit...After 911, I honestly don't know if that tipping point is even possible...It just seems that SO many of us really are 100% brainwashed.  I think the only thing that would/might do it is if the government/military just outright opens fire and started gunning down citizens in the street in front of everyone.  Even then, however.  The masses would wake up, but most would simply start running in fear instead of realizing it's all been a lie all along and start FIGHTING back to establish their/our

      <p>
       Well, I wouldn't entirely say that the far out conspiracies are exactly what has spoiled the bunch.  I don't think they've helped credibility, of course, but I think what has really spoiled the bunch has really involved MSM-cointelpro-shills that have come in to purposefully skew and imbalance those who are really investigating things.  Again, the people that go TOO far out there
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       help, of course, but I think if there wasn't a big movement to discredit those looking for the real truth in this world (and there IS a huuuge movement to discredit those looking for the real truth), then there wouldn't actually
       <em>
        be
       </em>
       that many people with theories that are too "out there" because the community wouldn't end up being as speculative as it unfortunately has to currently be given just how much TPTB lie and keep hidden from the public.

       I think you are all presuming the reason that people aren't doing this is because they don't have the resources to do so... I would if it meant less than POSSIBLY ending up tangled in a web of stories that could Possibly wind up getting me thrown into Guantanamo... Yeah resources are the problem. Not fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously you think OP was the first person to think that someone other than federal agents should be investigating this!
      </p>
      <p>
       To be completely honest if you drove into Newtown you would probably be able to spot a few Feds still sitting around. You think they are there to "continue the investigation"? I highly doubt it, they are probably there so that when people like you and me show up looking for the truth, an answer, or even a shred of evidence, they can black bag your ass and get you the fuck away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this all comes down to wether any of the stories are true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest I would just like to see what the school looked like in the hours after what took place. That in itself would answer a hell of a lot of my questions or possibly just replace them with more. And if I could make it out there I probably would to see what has happened at the school since, and what the townsfolk have to say. Though they may just get pissed that your a nosey conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone were wanting to do it, and willing they would, but they probably wouldn't post a thing about it on reddit. Not because they found them self's black bagged but because they fear it. And if they did they better be damn sure when they post the evidence that there identity is safe while doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm geusing that town has seen quite a few strangers in the past month, and they probably asked there fair share of questions, turned over a few stones. Hell maybe even found a few skeletons, but that dosnt mean they will tell anyone about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I probably wouldn't though I am curious.

       /Face palm.  He did not say you could interview 'everybody involved' in 24 hours.  He merely said you could mount an investigation in 24 hours.  Mounting an investigation does NOT mean you talk to absolutely everyone involved.  If your ridiculous theory had any merit it would be possible to talk to a sufficient number of invdivuals to find evidence of the (non-existant) 'cover-up' within a 24 hour period.  This is what bamshoulddie is arguing.
      </p>
      <p>
       No where did bamshoulddie say an investigation would require talking to 'everybody involved' as you claim.  Your argument is a straw man and damages your credibility (that is assuming anyone who believes this conspiracy has any credibility to begin with).

       So all conspiracy theorists are full-time workers who live nowhere near CT? There must be plenty of Lanza-types out there (well-resourced, doing nothing meaningful with their time). What about retirees? Some of you must be drug dealers who could take a couple weeks off?

       The Sandy Hook Conspiracy is best from a distance. It is a total product of the internet. It's easy to sit 1000 miles away and pontificate on how it didn't happen. Hell I bet a convincing case could be made that there was no Super Bowl last year (look at all the anomalies!)

       Celestia deleted his/her account after being called out for making ridiculous claims that open casket funerals were held for kids with supposed multiple gunshot wounds...

       Celestia wouldn't even mention who it was he/she allegedly knew, or which child's funerals he/she attended.

       Why is it I am the person who needs to explain myself again?  I was one of the few people on this forum with nuts enough to call out the stupid lying shill for being a complete liar- meanwhile, everyone else here was gobbling down what he/she said as gospel and not questioning the ridiculousness of his/her statements.

       That assumption holds about as much water as his/her claims that open casket funerals were held.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no proof of any aspect of this event, so when people appear out of the woodwork claiming "my uncle bob saw Adam Lanza do this" or some other outlandish claim you can't just sit there nodding your head and buying what they're saying 100%.

       No, i disagree. I think my assumption is closer to the truth. Why else would she delete everything? If she were a liar or a shill or troll who just set up the account for fun, then why delete it? Why not just abandon or and star a new account, is not hard. I think, and yes i have zero proof but this is what a reasonable person would conclude, is that she deleted it because she put her actual photo up on her actual id and was afraid of being harassed in life. If she actually deleted her account ( I'm on my phone so not going to check right now) i would say its because our was linked to get personal email.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm not saying you should absolutely believe her my point is that if you year anyone, liar or honest, like that chance are they are going to run off. Its sort of like using torture to obtain a confession, if you keep at it long enough, the person eventually gives up and regardless of whether they are guilty our not, they'll tell you what you want to hear. In this case you harassed (collective you) someone enough that they decided it want worth it and deleted everything and now you will never really know the truth. If you all had been nice to her, she might have been able to provide the more substantial proof you were asking for or, she might have accidentally revealed herself to be a troll. As it stands you instantly attacked her and didn't give her much of a chance either way. That indicates to me personally that someone here is scared of what she might say or what sort of proof she might actually have. Its much easier to harass her till she shuts down than deal with the fact that she might be telling the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't this sorry of behavior exactly what you accuse those supposedly perpetrating these supposed conspiracies of? Why would you want to operate in the same manner? Sort of makes one think, doesn't it?

       Besides, notice how he's getting increasingly angry and confrontational? He's thriving on it. If he's not genuinely mentally ill, then he's just someone who enjoys yanking some chains and making a few dollars while he does it.

       So why do you feel you are exempt from backing up your claims? You demand everyone else needs all kinds of proof, but you get to call people liars and shills with no proof whatsoever. Must be nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to verify that not a single open casket funeral occurred. If you don't, your posts should be roundly disregarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that someone deleted an account proves nothing. There could be many motivations. To automatically assume "aha! We caught you in a lie." is very presumptuous. An explanation which is just as likely is the person became frustrated trying to discuss the subject here, and decided to extract herself from the manure pit.

       If you're simply a troll, I at least hope it's because you make some money from your YouTube videos. At least that's an understandable reason.

       If you're genuine, I kind of feel bad for you. You're terribly broken inside.

       Legit question.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could this be a hoax? Everyone is talking about the whole thing being staged, but it just doesn't make sense to me. Who are the children who were "supposedly" killed? If the children never existed in the first place, then wouldn't it raise questions when the families bury a child that none of their friends or relatives ever heard of? If these are the actual children of these families, then what happened to them? Did they agree to have these kids shipped off for the rest of there lives to cover it up? Or are these "families" not real at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       In any one of these situations, you would need thousands of people to be in on the conspiracy, try keeping that a secret and see how long it lasts. No one would be stupid enough to pull off a stunt like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way in which this could be possibly a hoax is if someone found a guy crazy enough to actually shoot up a school, which is still really risky, but the only way you would have a shot at pulling it off. But then why would you even risk that, with the rate at which mass shootings happen, it was only a matter of time before something like this happened.

       lol I guess you're not a real conspiracy theorist then sense you cant even trace my IP address. I live in CT but if you're too lazy to check then I guess none of you're arguments are ligament. Also by you're response I can now tell you are 11 years old or insane, actually probably both.

       Says the guy who doesn't know the difference between since and sense.  How about, take a picture of your drivers license with information besides state blocked out and a time stamp with your username, then I will believe you if it looks legit.

       Yeah no fucking way im releasing my information like that. Call me a shill or whatever the fuck you want to believe, but I just dont think a nut like you is worth going through the trouble of taking a picture. Hey you're the "detective" so go ahead and trace my IP address faggot, or maybe someday I will get so pissed off at you freaks that I will take a picture. Other than that ether drive to CT yourself or trace my IP.

       Doubters should have just gone to the funerals. Too late now though... maybe we should dig up the dead children's corpses! Yes!! Stand them up and parade their lifeless perforated little bodies to satisfy our anti-government paranoia!

       Possible? I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it is a factual certainty that is unassailably true. Such certainties do exist, and this is one of them, a very sad one at that.

       Perhaps if we are all just armchair skeptics. But if anybody was really interested in what happened just go to the town and talk to people. This is Connecticut not the moon. Also, independent local news exists and thanks to the interwebs you can read it:

       If you've ever lived in a small town you'd understand that virtually everyone in Newtown knows who's kids were killed.  Virtually everyone knows someone or other from the TV reports.  Yeah, I supposed a non-local could slip through once or twice, but if it happened regularly the people of Newtown would be talking about it on Facebook or elsewhere.  Especially if that person acted insincere or said anything inflammatory.

       I live in Newtown. There is no reason to put "boots on the ground" to interview the "actors" because THERE ARE NO FUCKING ACTORS YOU NITWIT. These people actually lost their kids. And to be crestfallen because an even bigger nitwit, Mr Jones, isn't running around my town like a bull in a china shop badgering grieving parents to satisfy your retarded notion that all these kids are made up, is pretty fucking sick and twisted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is any conspiracy here it has nothing to do with whether or not these kids were killed. Get a grip.

       You pretty strongly missed missed his intent. This guy thinks the conspiracy stuff is bunk. He's challenging conspiracy theorists and asking why, if they're so certain this situation was filled with actors and fake deaths and lies and the like, they don't take the steps necessary to begin making their case by taking a drive and investigating. This is pretty clear if you read even just a few of his comments that he does not believe he conspiracy theory, and in fact thinks it's crap.

       Thank you Bam.  I'm trying to remain "neutral" to keep the discussion moving, so as to ask for someone to explain why they don't really search for proof, so I have been kind of vague on my feelings, as I have been called a shill too many times this month as it is.

       I wouldn't do it, but if some crazy asshole would sneak into the school and got pictures of bullet damage on the walls or floors we could put this shit to rest. Well a lot of it anyway. The obvious solution is to go down a list of shit checking things off. You would only need to be in that town for a day. You needn't disturb any victims or property, but I think you could start to get a good idea after 24 hrs. I keep hearing something about a demolition of this school. Another possibility is to wait until demolition plans are set. Find the highest bidder that won the bid, try to get into contact with an adjunct flunky at this company and pay his ass for pictures of bullet damage. They will need to do some inner work on the structure to bring it down. Deduce from the info they have released, where the suspect possibly did the shooting. Think of everything so your flunky knew ahead of time where everything went down and any possible situations or needs to maintain his flunky persona and stealth. No bullet damage IS a smoking gun. Bullet damage however things become messy and if that was the case I would stop talking about this shit completely. In my humble opinion if kids did die? It's really not worth trying to Sherlock that shit back to possible government shooters. That would just be another 911 quagmire....giggity

       Many of the Sandy Hook Truthers don't believe there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       any dead children, and many others think that grieving parents were actors. Since they don't believe there are shell-shocked, saddened parents out there, why would they worry about hurting feelings? Those people were just a bunch of phonies, anyway, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think it would be a simple matter to go up there, talk to some neighbors and employers and the like, and determine that the people we saw on TV were not who they claimed to be, or that certain families don't actually exist, and a million other things that would confirm their suspicions.

       THIS!  I can't believe with 100,000+ readers in this sub, no one lives near Newtown, even 50 miles away.  I think if 100 people kicked in 1.00 each to someone who lives nearby, there could be literally devastating evidence showing it was a media hoax...

       The sad fact is, people are quite happy analysing the media reports and building up "evidence" from these, rather than actually doing anything beyond looking at grainy screenshot from low res online video for inconsistancies and photoshops.

       Why would you need to specifically talk to any of the victims parents?  Is it still "harassment" to ask a question to the guy who works at the gas station?  Or the cashier at the grocery store? Or ask a question to a local officer?  Or ask a question to literally anyone in the town other than a dead child's parents?

       This. There must be enough of you to pitch in and make this happen. Or contact Alex Jones, he must be rolling in it by now. If the so-called crisis actors are in fact real bona fide people who still live in the area it should be easy to monitor them don't you think?
For the chance to expose the conspiracy of the decade and bring the US government to its knees surely you would be willing to spend some time/effort/money?

       What people are essentially doing is trusting the very media sources they denounce by relying solely on them for their conspiracy fodder.  There's only so much info you can get from CNN and MSNBC clips, and even
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       will only be what they want you to see.  (This goes for all topics, not just Sandy Hook).

       Nick Phelps is a sales exec for UBM living in Newtown, not purported "crisis actor" Richard Sexton of Florida.  I'm sure I could figure out how to prove this even further with photos and whatnot, but that might take me 5 minutes.  You aren't worth those 5 minutes.  Do it yourself.  Oh, I forgot, you already know the answers 'cause you saw it on the Youtube!

       Oh, OF COURSE!  How did I know you were gonna say that?  Again, we must simply conclude - based on the fact that anyone could have written that - that the Psychiatric Times is controlled by the CIA, or whoever pulled off this massive coverup, which was done in such a piss poor fashion that they couldn't even get non-married, non-related crisis actors to portray real, married ones from Newtown and they had to also use their extended families to portray other Newtown citizens.  The New World Order is just so hard up on resources and cash that they couldn't find more anonymous actors, is that it?  Couldn't pull the wool over your eyes, could they?  How do you people even know about the Sextons?  Where did they come from?  Was some conspiracy person just trolling around Picassa and found these people by accident?  I think not.

       His linkedin site lists zero information about how long he has held that position and zero information about his past. The profile picture still looks like Richard Sexton more than it does not look like Richard Sexton. Laura Phelps,

       Oh, well that sure must be direct evidence that he doesn't exist.  I should probably tell my Dad to fill out his LinkedIn profile a bit better now that you mention it.  Someone might think he's a man that does not exist since LinkedIn is pretty much the same as the Social Security Administration.  Due to your crack detective work, we simply must conclude that the CIA controls the editorial content of the "Psychiatric Times."  Thanks for your hard work.

       stupid arguments abound, people should just focus on the release of security footage. dont even have to release footage of the inside of the school, just the complete and uncensored security footage of the outside of the building. of all entrances and exits. that should be released on the internet. the "only" suspect is dead, there for no need of a criminal investigation. Why no release? The school had a brand new state of the art security system. its a no brainer. i dont need to go across the country to sandy hook, i just need to see those tapes.

       Assuming those tapes were released and showed no more than a shadowy figure entering the building with a gun - would that really convince you?  Because i think you would just call it fake.

       Of course that wouldn't be enough for them. Nothing will ever,

       "All we want is footage of the kids being evacuated!" If released, that will be inconclusive; it can still have been a staged event.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We just need to see photos of Adam Lanza in the school!" If released, they will not be enough. He was set up. Where is the other shooter (who doesn't exist)?
      </p>
      <p>
       "They just need to release security footage of Lanza entering the school!" They could see it, and would then decide they need to see something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will always be some anomaly or inconsistency or problem, usually of their own invention. Full, unedited footage from multiple security cameras could show the entire event from start to finish, bullet-riddled little children bleeding out and all, and they'd still find something to latch onto that tells them "the official story is full of holes!" Lanza was mind-controlled, he was this, he was that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most fun you get from following these theories is watching the way they weasel around each time some pet smoking gun gets debunked.

       So what would a "day-trip investigation" look like? Are you just going to knock on doors randomly? Good luck with that. The police will tell you nothing. Neither will any first responders. A random person has no standing, and you will be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you happen to knock on the door of a family who lost a child, in which case, you will probably get knocked the fuck out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I know Sandy Hook was a false flag, but those kids ARE dead. Elements in our govt. are behind it. But unless you have an "in" with someone well-connected in Newtown, if you go you will discover NOTHING.

       Literally, you could get there within 5 hours from most of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine, not to mention Connecticut itself. Heck, it's only just over 5 hours from the border of
       <em>
        Virginia
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Planning a 16-hour day means with 10 hours of driving you'd get
       <em>
        six full hours
       </em>
       to talk to shopkeepers, neighbors, employers. All SORTS of people. If you planned your trip right you could knock out a dozen or more interviews in one day and be sleeping in your bed that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess most of r/conspiracy's huge readership don't live in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, probably Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, or Connecticut, and therefore can't do this.

       No, you fucking can't. It's absurd to think anyone could go up there for a couple of hours do as thorough of an attempt of an investigation any one man could; being thorough would involve something like hundreds of phone calls, dozens if places to knock up on, locations to visit, hanging out in a general location for a period of time just asking random people, time it takes to have an interview with someone if they chose to agree. What if a certain person of interest is sick or out of town? You would be shit out of luck and you came for nothing if you're time constrained.

       You could, you also could not. What if you only get two interviews from a witness that day? You pack it up and go home because you're there for 24 fucking hours. If you want to sit there and imagine the best case scenario for someone doing this, be my guest but you're not being realistic.

       Yes, you can. Unless you're inept, poor at planning, and don't know what you're doing - maybe that describes you, which is why you're so sensitive about it? - you can EASILY talk to a number of people, especially if you plan ahead of time about which doors to knock on, what businesses to visit, and so on.

      <p>
       You know, I haven't heard "100 rounds of bullets" go off near my house, but if I did my response, most sane people's response would be to hit the floor, go to a safe location in my house and call the cops.

        Police response was instant apparently.

      <p>
       You're surprised that the local police responded to multiple calls of shots fired in a small town faster than the national media did?!

       The reason why you are crying for someone else to go and vent your hostility Daphne is because the thought of other people in the town recognizing it in you terrifies you.  The thought of what they would do to you when you imagine you have to stop ... being a nation that sends a mountain of condolence cards and flowers but Americans instead.

       So you leave a trail. Make sure several people know where you are and what you are doing at all times. If you do disappear then that sucks for you but you can rest in peace knowing that you helped confirm a conspiracy and blow the government wide open. Who wants to take one for the team?

       That's not the point.  This incident JUST happened.  Unlike 9/11, where the crime scene(s) were cordoned off and limited access was given afterwards, there is no reason for people out for the truth to be unable to conduct an investigation of the people involved, especially if those people are thought to be actors.

       Absolutely - we also have to ask why absolutely no one from Sandy Hook has mentioned the fact that they don't remember these people or certain things don't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have government agents come in and intimidated everyone with a passing connection to anyone involved in this? Mind control? Why haven't we heard anything about this - I'm sure that if an actor replaced one of the parents at my child's school, I (or at least a few other parents) would recognize this.

       Maybe Sandy Hook is like Springfield from GI Joe. The
       <em>
        entire town
       </em>
       is in on it, but rather than covering up a secret COBRA base underneath it's hiding agents of the New World Order!
      </p>
      <p>

       Absolutely - we also have to ask why absolutely no one from Sandy Hook has mentioned the fact that they don't remember these people or certain things don't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have government agents come in and intimidated everyone with a passing connection to anyone involved in this? Mind control? Why haven't we heard anything about this - I'm sure that if an actor replaced one of the parents at my child's school, I (or at least a few other parents) would recognize this.

       The sad fact is, people are quite happy analysing the media reports and building up "evidence" from these, rather than actually doing anything beyond looking at grainy screenshot from low res online video for inconsistancies and photoshops.

       People confuse the government for being incompetent when in fact it's that it doesn't wish to do any good for the people. If it wanted to do good for the people it would, and do a great job of it. Just like it does a great job if doing the wrong thing right now.

       Legit question.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could this be a hoax? Everyone is talking about the whole thing being staged, but it just doesn't make sense to me. Who are the children who were "supposedly" killed? If the children never existed in the first place, then wouldn't it raise questions when the families bury a child that none of their friends or relatives ever heard of? If these are the actual children of these families, then what happened to them? Did they agree to have these kids shipped off for the rest of there lives to cover it up? Or are these "families" not real at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       In any one of these situations, you would need thousands of people to be in on the conspiracy, try keeping that a secret and see how long it lasts. No one would be stupid enough to pull off a stunt like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way in which this could be possibly a hoax is if someone found a guy crazy enough to actually shoot up a school, which is still really risky, but the only way you would have a shot at pulling it off. But then why would you even risk that, with the rate at which mass shootings happen, it was only a matter of time before something like this happened.

       Yes, please DO scan your ID-  even that though isn't proof of anything that happened at SANDY HOOK-  "You" apparently live in Newtown and there is no proof "you" are the person on the ID anyway.

       Even if you are some person who lives in Newtown- what does that prove exactly?
