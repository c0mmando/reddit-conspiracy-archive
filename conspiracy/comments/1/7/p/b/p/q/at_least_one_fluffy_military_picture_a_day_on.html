       I mean it's kind of ridiculous isn't it? So many pictures of soldiers and dogs being uploaded. It's so obviously engineered it makes me nauseous. Or am I just being paranoid?

       There are a lot of articles out there about this effort of the pentagons. Here is one,

       because it's just pissing me off to much to see this shit every day and when I speak out about it I end up -100 karma for the day. That's getting old.

       Yeah that post was pretty awful and obviously propaganda as well. If it was legit and true they would be putting their posts in
       <a href="/r/military">
        /r/military
       </a>
       or something. They have to know that posting in the regular subreddits pisses some people right off and results in nastiness.

       If they just wanted to share their experiences or something they would be doing it in their own reserved and "safe" space for that.

       Hey, btw.. Talking in links doesn't really work when you are obviously hostile to my viewpoint. See I just won't click on your link so whatever smarmy and moronic little thing you have to say there is totally wasted on me.

       Well if they blamed the Druze or the Welsh for every single thing, and yet offered no proof. It would always be the Welsh, but they don't blame the Welsh or any other minority for all the world's ills, just the Jews.

       You're the one who made a post because some redditor in the military posted a picture to r/pics, as if that wasn't allowed in that particular subreddit. He posted the same picture to f/ladybonersgw, that's definetely a conspiracy thought up by the Pentagon.

       You don't have to like it but that redditor is allowed to post it there as well as on r/ladybonersgw, and you still have no proof that it's propaganda other than your word. I'm not denying that there's propaganda on reddit but that doesn't seem to be the case.

       I do have proof it is propaganda. It is fact that the pentagon runs a social media unit. Reddit is one of the largest social media and marketing sites in the world right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that unit was established suddenly reddit begins seeing posts like that one I am talking about. Posts that are all fluffy fluffy nice nice about the military. We also know that the military believes in such concepts as "winning hearts and minds," and using softpower to gain influence. That is exactly what these sorts of posts are doing and so coupled with the fact that the pentagon is spending resources on social media I think I got a case.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have is, "oh no it's not propaganda, where is your proof?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I have more proof than you do I think that about finishes this discussion.

        It is fact that the pentagon runs a social media unit. Reddit is one of the largest social media and marketing sites in the world right now.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't deny that. Do you have proof linking said redditor to this social media unit? How do you know he's not a regular redditor?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        where is your proof?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The burden of proof lies on you, you came up with the idea. I could go around telling people I can fly, and when they tell me I can't, I'll just tell them to prove I can't.

       <p>
        Since I have more proof than you do I think that about finishes this discussion.

      <p>
       You don't have any proof.

       Obviously you can't prove that certain people online are paid by the government to post things. However, if you use some judgement, it's pretty obvious this is the case. You don't have to believe us, no one is forcing it on you. Next time you see military propaganda-like posts, just take a look at the account history of OP. Often they are new accounts (within 10 - 15 days) and have only posted nonsense in other subs. This is not something you can ever prove, but requires a little bit of logic. Even the Israeli government has admitted to commenting on sites and infiltrating social medias. Why wouldn't the US do the same?

       I didn't say the US wouldn't do, after all the Pentagon has a social media unit as OP said. I just asked for proof that this was the case in point since the redditor who posted said picture to r/pics has been a redditor for 5 months. He also posted the same picture to r/ladybonersgonecuddly, again I don't deny that the Pentagon uses social media, but that just doesn't seem to be the case here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize I don't have to believe it, but if you're gonna make a claim you should be able to back it up.

       Honestly there are pictures of dogs and cats in these places everyday.. is it a conspiracy by the animal shelters?? There are hundreds of thousands of posts on reddit, there are also redditors who are legit soldiers.. If redditors didnt enjoy the images they wouldnt upvote them. We are already in a fuck load of conflicts, and the military has no need to advertise and boast support for wars we are already in.

       Anything that makes the military seem something other than what they truly are is propaganda. The US military is a force for carnage and empire and that is what history will record and say about us. All this soldiers and their dogs is just pure fucking hogwash.

       How does a picture of a soldier and their dog make the
       <strong>
        entire military
       </strong>
       look any different? Are you suggesting this photo is staged? Or maybe you are suggesting that soldiers don't have dogs as pets?

       No, it's just a soldier with their dog. I don't know if you know this, but their are a shit-ton of people in the military. Many of them use reddit. Many of them (just like a good portion of redditors) also want upvotes and karma.

       Unless you have proof of your claims that this is propaganda, you'd do well to stop posting and delete this thread. No one needs your paranoid delusions or insane rants.

       No fool, they will be defined by history as a force for empire. Not to mention the most cowardly generation of soldiers the earth has ever produced. I mean hiding in their bases while unmanned drones fly around and kill civilians... What the fuck!? I'm supposed to respect that?!

       Soldiers for the empire?  Since the US isnt an empire, than you must mean Japan..  I havent seen any Japanese soldier pics on but I am pretty sure YOU are clicking on the pictures to view them so the best idea is not to click on pictures that are military in nature..  You might want to realize though, military involves a lot of sitting around where they might use a phone or laptop to browse reddit and other social sites.

       See... this is just retarded. You are so ignorant as to think that in order to be an empire the map itself has to say EMPIRE OF UNITED STATES huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Connect the fucking dots. We have military bases all over the world. Our soldiers have their feet on the ground in something like 150 different countries. Look it up!
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that but we control the politics and flow of resources in many of those countries. We exploit the shit out of them and that makes them our provinces. We control those nations and thus they are a part of our empire. Please try and understand this very important reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This might help. Look at it from the historical point of view. Imagine you are a historian 100 years from now. How else could you possibly characterize these deployments, occupations and resource grabbing ventures?

       Calm down there internet tough guy..  US isnt an empire, Japan is the only empire left in modern times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont doubt the us like most western countries are spread around the world but most are specialists or trainers..  Any country that has major networks of questionable people you will see higher concentration.  Blame history or past generations for giving us this world, to think the US is to blame is just insane.

       Fuck off with your holier than thou attitude, you think you're the only vet on this subreddit?  If you weren't such a worthless piece of shit you would have pulled your head out of your ass, quit the military when your term was up, and made something better of your life.  Instead you are a part of a war machine that kills innocent women and children every day and get paid for it. It doesn't matter what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       specifically do because your role supports it and that makes you just as bad as the worst of them.

       Wow good thing this is my first term. I signed for 6. and I already have my mind set on getting out because YES I DON'T AGREE at all with the way our military and Government does things and kills innocents but it doesn't take away the thousands of lives we saved last year. You need to fuck off with your assumptions and putting millions all in the same group.

       And plus RESCUE saves both sides. Like how we are actually in another providing support/aid in a country non combat just medically helping people. Why is that hard for people in this subreddit to understand

       I think it would be easier to rescue people if we weren't also blowing up their neighbors with drones. There's no hate, its just pointing out hypocrisy and imperialism.  No one on this sub doesn't want people to be rescued, to say we are hating on that notion is actually absurd. We just want the military to not be there and we feel bad for the "collateral damage" as it is so inhumanely put.

       Who says that what I am saying is bull shit? I am not saying that what the USA is doing is good at all. But some parts of our military conduct amazing things such as Rescue. We save lives mean while you tell me I can't take some pictures with some locals we make friends with or a stranded cat that we get to keep as a pet for the 6 month deployment. Grow up man.

       You can't excuse murdering children because the military does some nice things occasionally. That does not balance. That amount of acceptable child casualty is just plain flat out zero. The shame of what has been done in the name of "protecting" the American people can never be lived down.

       I love how the down vote brigade came through and upvoted this guy. He thinks everything is bad when he can't the good. I understand the bad things happening and that is why I am getting out because I don't agree. But the things we do in rescue truly are amazing and wish they would understand that.

       Soldiers for the empire?  Since the US isnt an empire, than you must mean Japan..  I havent seen any Japanese soldier pics on but I am pretty sure YOU are clicking on the pictures to view them so the best idea is not to click on pictures that are military in nature..  You might want to realize though, military involves a lot of sitting around where they might use a phone or laptop to browse reddit and other social sites.

       No, it's just a soldier with their dog. I don't know if you know this, but their are a shit-ton of people in the military. Many of them use reddit. Many of them (just like a good portion of redditors) also want upvotes and karma.

       Unless you have proof of your claims that this is propaganda, you'd do well to stop posting and delete this thread. No one needs your paranoid delusions or insane rants.
