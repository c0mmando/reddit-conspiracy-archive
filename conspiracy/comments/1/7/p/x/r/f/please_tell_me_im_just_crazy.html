       Ive recently woken up and spent a lot of time wading through the web of theories, truths, and disinformation. I've come to the conclusion that a great many things are playing off of each other and involved in yes, "a global conspiracy".
      </p>
      <p>
       My concern is that this is far too heinous to accept. If I do accept these possibilities as realities then my entire lifes plan has to be readjusted accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm smart, not just because I got good grades but because intelligence is a measure of cognizance, deductive reasoning, logic, and ones ability to apply them cohesively for an end result of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is obviously why one would get good grades, and universally as opposed to in just one field.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I'm skeptical of much, motivated to discern, and capable of hypothesizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       With so  many things happening all at once to reshape our world, someone please tell me I'm just crazy, and not smart. I want to go back to a blissful ignorant existence, but I can't of my own accord.

       If you can think it, so can they is how I see it.

       How you and I see it seems the running census of how others do and I can only hope it doesn't go this way.

       Wasn't at all implying you are a zombie. I was instead expressing a hope that more people like you will come forward, and we can reach critical mass, like Dat_Nugga_Dust mentioned. The 100th monkey is an example  of critical mass being reached.

       Didn't think you were! It seems people are waking up in all she groups and socioeconomic groups but I'm still not very hopeful with the burden of the truth in my mind.

      <p>
       One of my friends has a theory I'm wanting to believe, that when the shit hits the fan, aliens will intercede and save mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fantastical? yes, plausible? I don't know. Not sure how I feel about aliens. Though if they are watching, I'd assume from the human perspective, that a supreme being would have the same supremacy complex that our leaders are following to bring this plan to fruition.

       Both and neither. It's all illusions, layer upon layer of illusion to distract you from your own divine nature. You've seen past the external illusion, now you have to gaze inward for your answers. It's all up to you "100th Monkey". Find you inner rebel. Break your chains of conformity. Let go of all things Ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intellect and schooling can only take you so far, most will never be able to see past it all. Try not to share anything like this with people who you know are not like minded. Also keep your open mind but don't forget to shut it off and debug every now again. Meditate bro.

       Ok. So, all those reasons you listed of why you got good grades? Those are all the reasons this foulbastard
       <em>
        didnt
       </em>
       get good grades.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, one of us is clearly not very smart. If it makes you feel better, just assume its you, as - and think about this - have you ever met anyone who "got good grades" that actually
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       smart, or were they just very good at doing what they're told? No matter how stupid and pointlessly asinine it was?
      </p>
      <p>
       And how many people have you met that are crazy? Now, how many of them
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       they were crazy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some random foul thoughts from a bastard.

       I see where you're coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only cite intellect in reference to grades because if exercising the inherent qualities necessary to achieve, anyone can have good grades because it all boils down to effort or will/want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the people in my closed minded small town only correlate intelligence to your gpa, thus by having good grades everyone always told me "your so smart", which is annoying in truth because living an ordinary existence only makes a person neurotic about wasting said intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often though, I've seen those who I know are smarter then me purposely sabotage their grades as a way of rebelling against the purported definition of intelligence.

       All you do is over use words. You're not smart, you probably don't know shit about shit. But that's okay, were all retarded. You don't need to feel the urge to pretend to be some ingenious product of man kind. You're not wise, nobody is. You aren't special because everybody is "special". In experience; he who claims to know, does not.

       Do it, then you'll have a dog in the fight.  As opposed to just sitting back and letting it unfold.  Since becoming awake I bought a house, had a kid and will probably get married soon.  Now I care more than ever!  The biggest threat in the US right now is Agenda 21 which is why I started my little sub there, it is driving up the property taxes every single year because of the measures being taken locally and at the state level.  I can see it unfolding so, now I'm fighting it.

       Oh yeah, it's everywhere.  I cannot believe more people haven't woken up to it.  Problem is, is that the media won't point out that almost every medium/large city has a new "sustainability" plan that is literally word for word uniform with every other plan in every other city.  That is how they are getting this through, localization.

       Iowa the whole state is immersed in it.  The health initiatives of Agenda 21 are being pushed via something called "The Blue Zones Project" pushed by big insurance companies to make cities more "walkable" and "livable" and then they give big grants to local areas for  "health care improvements".   Here is a post I made breaking it down:

       I think you may be soliciting compliments in the guise of requesting reassurance! However, many people on this subreddit would, I think self-identify as possessing the following traits.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are lateral/flexible thinkers; less suggestible than average; less hidebound by ideology. They are people who are able to tolerate uncertainty (ie juggle multiple possible explanations for an event) and yet are highly driven to find which of those explanations is actually the truth, however difficult that may be.

       No solicitation here, compliments are as useful as karma. If I want to feel good about myself I'll sit with my cat or call my girlfriend.

       My real purpose for posting was a hope to be called crazy because I quite honestly don't want all the conspiracies to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If of course the opposite happened and my concerns are validated, then I hope for suggestions from the like minded as there's not many people I know that can see the big picture, thus can't offer resolutions or suggestions on how to deal with it.

       Yes, you are crazy. Everything is fine and is what you were lead to believe by those in society around you.  You had the best publicly funded education tax dollars could buy that is light years ahead of anything those farmers had available to them in the 1800s.  It did a great job of catching you up on all that you needed to know by the time you were 18.  You now should have a basic understanding of civics, algebra, electrons etc. and a basic understanding of what is expected from you and normal socialized behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a media that lets you know if anything is amiss or corrupt. I mean they let you know when a few bad apples in Britain were fudging some numbers at the bank with that whole LIBOR thing. If there were any other scandals they would let you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       You live in a representational democracy where the leaders are beholden to the will of the people and if they ever got corrupted or abused their power, we the people would vote them out of office.  Remember the last time that things went awry? It was the McCarthy era. We learned about it in school.  People then found that when government abuses started occurring our amazing system of checks and balances kicked in and righted the wrongs and we learned from that experience. If anything were wrong like that now, we'd know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in an amazing democracy where people can give voice to whatever belief or misguided notion they may have. Remember that whole Occupy thing?  I mean we know they were a bunch of Communist sympathizers who didn't even know what they were protesting (except a general dissatisfaction for some reason with our beloved Capatalist way of life). The government let them say their piece even though they clearly had misguided and wrongful beliefs. Why, there was even a small group of tents in my town.  They were children who had never lived in the other societies they were idolizing, but let them live in Cuba for a day and they'd come around.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11.  That was performed by a group of Muslim extremists who happened to exploit a security flaw in the US infrastructure. They hated our way of life because we have promiscuous women and don't follow their religious beliefs. They feel that since we don't believe like they do that our culture might undermine their societal structures when the people in their countries see how great everything is here due to our free democratized Capatalist society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus we need the war on terror.  This is to ensure we root out and protect those who might seek to replicate 9/11 style attacks.  Now sure mistakes have been made and it turns out there weren't any WMDs in Iraq. But never attribute to malice that which can be ascribed to ineptitude.  Sure a few blunders happen but we're in uncharted waters here.  Even the enhanced interrogation techniques are necessary these days.  Though a bit messy we need them because they could stop an attack in a quick fashion and save countless lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       We learned everything bad that could happen from the past and observing the atrocities of World War II. As they taught us in school these things can never happen again because we learned. A few other things you might be concerned about that are no cause for concern. Sweat shops and the possible exploitation and abuses of those in the developing countries: Our beneficial corporations are bringing jobs and prosperity to these poor people that had no opportunities before. They can't be blamed for the exchange rate. The 19 cents an hour they make goes much farther there than it would here. The companies learned that it's bad business to abuse the employees after the Kathy Lee Gifford scandal and Nike's bad press following the revelations of their practices. They now have strict internal standards to make sure that sort of thing doesn't happen as the market punishes businesses who don't have strong employment rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings us to unions. They're bad. They add another layer of corruption and bureaucracy and cause inefficient non competitive businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GMO'S you may have heard about? Perfectly fine. The FDA says so. The one claim about them being harmful was a study done by a French guy who had an agenda. The companies that "sue farmers for patent infringement after cross pollination from the wind?" An urban legend created after a Canadian canola farmer who blatantly stole the seeds used that excuse in court as his defense in 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banks and Fraud? We already went over how the media and our government institutions catch the few bad apples that try to get away with any chicanery. If there were any other problems we'd know about them. We have government institutions like the NSA and FBI who monitor most communications. They would surely catch any fraudulent activity as it is in their best interest because tax dollars get used to prop up markets whenever a market implosion happens due to fraud or bad business decisions. Which 2008's market implosion was a result of. Bad business decisions. Ineptitude, not malice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ok. You were starting to go crazy reading all the crazy talk on the Internet. You forgot rule #1 that you were taught in school. Don't trust anything on the Internet. Even Wikipedia is an unreliable source. It can all be written by  anyone giving rise to wild rumors and speculation being treated as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back to bed. Everything is fine. Everything is under CONTROL...

       I'm not sure why you think I'm going on so heavily about my own intelligence. Yes, I made a baseline declaration to establish within my question that I'm no chump. People need a point of reference to respond to my question of being crazy or smart. If I provided no credibility then how can that determination be made?
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond the initial post, I've made no claims other than to try and defend myself from those who are perceiving my post as pompous or arrogant. I didn't mean it to come off that way. I really could care less if randoms on the internet think I'm eating up the attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only wish to know if intelligence is a precursor to seeing the truth as its unfolding or if in truth its all a convenient fabrication brought on by a  hyperactive thought process.
