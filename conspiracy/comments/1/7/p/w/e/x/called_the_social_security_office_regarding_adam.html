The man says that he called genealogybank, and then he called the SSA office to confirm that their records were legitimate, he said that they were giving excuses like a broken computer/frozen computer and then they could not give him the information.</p>

<p>Surprise, my story matches his. He put me on hold ambiguously, came back to tell me he was having a computer problem, was on hold for a few more minutes, and finally he returns. Oh and he has no idea who I was talking about, never heard of him, never watched the news in the past two months and could not give me any information.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlhsqU-V3CY&amp;feature=youtu.be">Phone call was about 25 minutes long. Edited out being on hold, only the five minutes of conversation.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think you&#39;re going to get any meaningful information out of SSA? I interact with them (grudgingly) as part of my work handling decedent&#39;s estates, and they are a fucking pain in the ass regarding the release of information, even for family members of decedents or people making claims for disabled/injured people, or dependents of decedents.</p>

<p>The SSI Master Death Index is available to the general public but it&#39;s <em>really expensive</em>, especially for anything like near-realtime access (e.g., to show data from 2012, and especially December 2012). The information will percolate out to the free or cheap sites, but it&#39;ll probably take months or a year or so for that to happen - most of the companies that would make that information available to the public only subscribe to quarterly or annual updates. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t expect to get any meaningful information from a random phone clerk at SSA any more than I&#39;d call the DMV and ask them complicated car title questions, or call the IRS and ask tax questions. Here&#39;s a hint: if you call once and ask your question, you&#39;ll feel like you have a real answer. Call again, you&#39;ll get a different answer. Call again, you&#39;ll get a third answer, and then you&#39;ll never bother with calling them after that, because it becomes clear that they just make shit up when they don&#39;t know how to answer your question, or don&#39;t want to. </p>

<p>Exactly, I know for almost certain that if I were to call again and get someone else, I&#39;d get a whole new line of answers and inquiry (and that I would be on hold while they fix their broken/frozen computer aka while they ask a supervisor).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The SSA guy told me they have cost recovery. I guess they are not setup to sit there all day looking up records for curious people.</p>

<p>If you want them to check their records you need to file a Freedom of Information Act request, give them $25 and wait 6 months. But I doubt it would help if that lawyer had the info sealed.</p>

<p>or buy your own copy of the master death index for $1000</p>

<p>The reason those websites charge money is because they pay to get the SSDI.</p>

<p>I think you missed the original video where the guy claimed to have called the &quot;SSDI office&quot; and told a story about being shuffled around to different departments and being asked for his personal information, making up stories about computer failures etc</p>

<p>There&#39;s just no SSDI record, yet anyways. Unless his dad rushes off to file for his sons death benefits from all those hard years of work he paid into his social security. lol</p>
