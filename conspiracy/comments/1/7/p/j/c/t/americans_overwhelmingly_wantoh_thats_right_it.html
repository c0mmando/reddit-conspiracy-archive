       Lobbying was so pernicious more than a century ago that it prompted a nine part series in Cosmopolitan entitled

       . Today it is a $3.5 billion a year bribery/extortion racket that owns and operates Washington D.C. Congress is perfectly content with it and as much as I would like to see it end, I don't think it will do anything but worsen until it destroys America. RIP Uncle Sam.

       Of course they are content, those bribes are get them reelected. Paradox of the century: 10% congressional approval rating, 90% incumbent reelection rate. The system will either cause a revolution or collapse on itself. Either way people will get to start over.

       It's close enough for all practical purposes but for the purist, it was a 9% approval rating and an 85% incumbent reelection. Your evaluation is quite precise, though ;).

       Ron Paul is an extraordinary man. Not only did he win the election you mention despite an unfavorable gerrymander but he mounted a credible presidential campaign and served his entire term in the House  "without even talking to lobbyists," to paraphrase him. He was the exception to nearly every rule in Washington, and a paragon of integrity and virtue to which every legislator should aspire. He will be sorely missed in the coming years.

       I get frustrated when politically inactive people whine on the internet, and take the "well you useless people are stupid you can't change anything stop trying" stand.  It's useless, self-defeating, and you should be ashamed of yourself.  Have a downvote.

       C'mon, you've gotta admit that the common citizen is at least partially responsible for the problems that face our society. People actually vote for a lot of this garbage. And they continue to vote for the people who oppress them and others. Majority interests are just as suspect as special interests.

       I'm of the belief that healthcare had a lot of positive things to it. BUT you think about it and it's basically making it illegal to not give money to insurance companies.

       I'd make the argument that just as many, if not more of our problems are caused by democracy. Stupid people voting for stupid things they should have no say in whatsoever. It becomes more obvious when our "representatives" act against the will of the majority they claim to represent, but even when a majority imposes it's will on a minority, it's still wrong. I don't think any person or group of people has the right to rule over humanity, whether it be an all powerful king or the angry mob called democracy. Even if 95% of people voted that I'm not allowed jerk off, I'm still going to do it. Fuck em.

       Perfectly true, but people don't want to hear it. They've been trained not to listen. They like to think they are free, and that they make their own informed decisions. Which is enough to make a person laugh hysterically, or weep tears of blood.
