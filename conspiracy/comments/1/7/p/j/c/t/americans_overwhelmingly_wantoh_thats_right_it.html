Today it is a $3.5 billion a year bribery/extortion racket that owns and operates Washington D.C. Congress is perfectly content with it and as much as I would like to see it end, I don&#39;t think it will do anything but worsen until it destroys America. RIP Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>Bushs internet = 3rd world internet is fine</p>

<p>obamas internet =bandwidth caps are even better</p>

<p>bushs wars = start them</p>

<p>obama wars = privatize and expand them</p>

<p>bushs prisons = privatize them so that the police state cannot be dismantled.</p>

<p>obamas prisons = build more</p>

<p>bushs education fuck education</p>

<p>obama education = fuck education</p>

<p>bushs social security = almost no cost of living increases,and cut where possible</p>

<p>obama social security = one small increase during selection year, and cut where possible(500 billion due to obamacare)</p>

<p>obamas health care policy = romneys health care policy</p>

<p>But but but.... gay marriage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

I don&#39;t think any person or group of people has the right to rule over humanity, whether it be an all powerful king or the angry mob called democracy.
