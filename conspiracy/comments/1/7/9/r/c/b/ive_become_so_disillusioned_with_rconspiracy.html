        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me start by saying that I gave the idea of it being entirely a hoax a good chance. I watched a couple docs and read a couple articles as well. But as time went on they 1 by 1 seemed to be either be debunked or disinformation. 
The way I see it is this, if it actually happened, it would be one of the worst things to be wrong about. I mean you honestly look like the biggest f8cking asshole if it really happened and you are going around telling everybody that it didn&#39;t and they were all actors. Especially when I hear that some dip shits have gone up to these sandy hook &quot;actors&quot; and called them frauds. It makes me embarrassed to even have been associated with conspiracy theories.
There just doesn&#39;t seem to be enough evidence to conclude that it was all made up. I do however feel that its rather bizarre that we&#39;ve had so many horrific GUN crimes in such a small amount of time. There certainly could be an agenda behind it but for now there doesn&#39;t seem to be enough evidence.
Things like the Kennedy Assassination and 9/11 I believe are legit conspiracies, but for this I do not.
Just had to get it off my chest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a venting subreddit.  The delusional nature of the conspiracy community, the logical fallacies, the repetition of &quot;facts&quot; that have been shown untrue time and time again make any type of cogent, rational conversation with conspiracy hypothesizers (not theorists since theories take evidence not conjecture) fairly difficult.  Sometimes we can be patient when we debate, other times its a real struggle and gets frustrating.  Conspiratard is where we can vent about the extremely illogical nature of this strange world conspiracy hypothesizers have built for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well our goal is to break up the group think over here so we aren&#39;t going to go away.  Most of us realize that conspiracies with no basis in fact are not good for our society.  It distracts from the real issues and solutions, people who were involved in a tragedy or were just doing their job get harrassed (sandy hook, 9/11), and people get killed (guy who shot officers in the head due to them being in on the &quot;Zionist conspiracy&quot;).  </p>

<p>IOW: A large conspiracy culture is dangerous and gets us nowhere as a society.  We are trying to fight it.  Some of us do it with mockery, others use debate and logic, others use both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really dont see it as any more dangerous than the normal nut jobs in every facet of society. It may be dangerous to the status quo. The government has created that culture by lying to its people over and over again, so unless that changes, and I&#39;m not holding my breath on that one, I don&#39;t see the conspiracy people going away anytime soon. So I guess both sides are banging there head against the wall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is this, in any way, the best option to do that? The Supreme Court has already ruled, twice, that keeping handguns is protected by the US Constitution. Additionally, the vast, vast majority of Americans agree that long guns are needed for hunting.</p>

<p>The only think that is likely to come out of this legislation wise is the limit to 10 round <del>clips</del> magazines and maybe an &quot;assault&quot; weapons ban (exactly like the previous one). But that is actually a pretty sensible limit, which already exists in a few states so  if the Government wanted to implement that federally they probably could have without this.</p>

<p>Americans agree that handguns need to be allowed for personal protection, and long guns need to be allowed for hunting/sport shooting. So there is no amount of mass shooting (no matter how tragic) that will change this. Additionally, the murder rate in the States (while still insanely high compared to other industrialized nations) is declining and has been for over 20 years.</p>

<p>There is absolutely 0 chance that anybody looking to dream up a &quot;false flag&quot; attack which would justify disarming the population would choose this method. There probably will be a ban on AR-15 rifles and other &quot;assault&quot; weapons, as well as a limit on <del>clip</del> magazine size to 10 rounds. But if you asked anybody what it would take to get that passed before December 14, percisley nobody would have said &quot;about 20 6 year-olds being gunned down in their school&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to disagree with you. The media inconsistencies are atrocious. There are so many unanswered questions and issues that are being left silent. To top it off we were all blindly lead into an assault weapons ban even though an assault weapon was not used at Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t a rigged event then at bare minimum it was a very convenient event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how this is the top comment on a forum for conspiracy theories. I think you&#39;re a douchebag, honestly. The ignorance in how you group all of the &quot;truth-seekers&quot; into a collective of sub-human scum is actually, almost humorous, if it wasn&#39;t at the same time depressing to know people like you are out there. That is judging <em>you</em> on the same exact grounds you have just judged me on, and that is no ground at all.  Please, dont reply with some asshole response like I&#39;m a monster for questioning the deaths of small children, by a man who the media is telling us has been &quot;off the grid&quot; for 3 years. NOBODY is off the grid in this day and age and it&#39;s idiotic to think the fucking FBI can&#39;t recover anything from his hard drive. Its fucking moronic for idiots like you to take an overpaid news anchor&#39;s word for it. Christ al-fucking-mighty I wish people would think with their own fucking brain instead of taking another mans word for it. At least the guys with debunked theories have the balls to think for themselves..... much more than you so eloquently displayed in your comment.</p>

When you adopt this system of beliefs, you stop looking for hard evidence and instead just accept everything that helps reinforce that belief system.

    <div class="md"><p>...strawman supposition.</p>

<p>Simply because some dim units believe no planes hit the Twin Towers does not immediately translate that all who harbour questions are equally lacking. The cognitive dissonance you claim to see around you is the same cognitive dissonance that exists inside you if you fail to see the bonified questions that naturally gravitate to the events of that day. Scientists, military personnel, pilots, engineers, demolition experts, firemen (etc. etc.) make a formidible case that the official story is a hoax. </p>

<p>In short, you would be wise to leave the events of 9/11 out of your Sandy Hook narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This particular event has a built-in self defense of &quot;How dare you accuse these poor grieving parents of lying! How dare you trivialize the deaths of these poor innocent little kids! etc etc.&quot; Unlike 9/11 or even the Aurora shooting which were general-public tragedies. </p>

<p>This event couldn&#39;t be any more depraved or evil unless it was a maternity ward massacre. </p>

<p>I think many people asking questions are extremely frustrated by this brick wall of a defense. It makes them believe even more passionately that it was a cover up because the masses will automatically defend little kids. What better way to manipulate the public than by faking a tragedy that people will get so passionate about. A shooting at a college, movie theater, mall, or even a high school won&#39;t have the same effect because the victims stand a better chance for survival.</p>

<p>Just because a tragic event takes place doesn&#39;t mean it was a cover up.</p>

<p>Just because a tragic event takes place doesn&#39;t mean people should not be allowed to ask questions about it.</p>

<p>People on both sides need to be <strong>respectful</strong>. I agree with you that in general the Sandy Hook truth activity has been disrespectful to the victims. But I will also agree with the truthers that the media coverage has been pretty flimsy compared to other events. This is going to take a long time to cool off and clear up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so clear why media coverage was &quot;flimsy.&quot; Because the CSP decided to keep the details of the brutal murders of children out of the news to <em>spare their parents the fucking pain of seeing on Twitter their kid was shot in the face</em>.</p>

<p>Noah Pozner was <em>shot in the face</em>. In the <em>face</em>. Half of his face was gone. Half of it.</p>

<p>It is so obvious that the police went in, saw children who had been <em>shot in the face</em>, and said, &quot;okay, we don&#39;t want their parents to hear this on the internet.</p>

<p>I am all for respecting dissenting opinion, but I don&#39;t respect creationist arguments and I don&#39;t respect aliens as an explanation and I certainly am not giving any credence to the idea that not reporting gruesome details to spare families is irrefutable evidence of a hoax. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did the media handle it irresponsibly?  Yes.  Did the government use it to their advantage to pass shitty legislation?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  But that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the whole thing was faked <em>for</em> that purpose.  </p>

<p>One thing&#39;s for certain:  people get too caught up in mainstream media/current events, even in this so-called alternative news community.  Instead of picking apart the Sandy Hook story, look at the stories that AREN&#39;T getting airtime because of it.  When the media hypes up one thing to the exclusion of all else, you know something shady is going on.  Read between the lines instead of dissecting the lines themselves.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them set the agenda for you.  Stories that never see the light of day are the ones you should worry about.  We never heard a peep about banks laundering billions in drug money on CNN or FOX, right?  Of course not.  They were too busy covering the Royal Wedding and/or Casey Anthony Trial and/or Trayvon Martin shooting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been covering this story since it happened. I was in the first five outlets to even report a shooting, unconfirmed, in CT. (I later realized it remained unconfirmed for so long to enable proper next of kin notification.)</p>

<p>The aftermath was as confusing as you&#39;d expect a scene where 20 dead kids were laying to be, with hundreds of terrified parents milling about.</p>

<p>Eyewitness reports are notoriously shaky. It&#39;s very conceivable witnesses initially believed that SWAT team members or cops were additional shooters, and these were people huddled in closets and under desks.</p>

<p>Many of them six.</p>

<p>It would make less sense if they all perceived the chaos occurring around them clearly.</p>

<p>You ever experience a surreal and traumatic event? Time slows down, it speeds up, you perceive things inaccurately only to later realize they are fight or flight distortions.</p>

<p>I believed in santa for a loooong time. My evidence was I&#39;d seen Santa once, bent over by my fireplace, when I was four. I saw it. With my own eyes!</p>

<p>Obviously now I know there&#39;s no santa. But my mind clearly suggested this occurred to me for another half-decade. </p>

<p>Memory is not a black or white thing. It&#39;s malleable and fluid and influenced, in part, by state of mind. </p>

<p>A person who believes their death is imminent may be likely to see every pair of combat boots as a shooter, until they are later told there was just one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote that up as it was happening. What about him?</p>

<p>It seems clear police are suppressing some of the details because at the time the release of info and names was occurring, parents were still in varying stages of notification.</p>

<p>All knew their child had been killed, but few knew that their child had been wounded in the way they had. </p>

<p>As a parent myself, I can only imagine that the knowledge a child has been shot 11 times is an additional grief, and coroners are aware that condition of a body is a factor in how people react to murders. Of children.</p>

<p>I imagine Carver and the police both were cognizant of the fact many parents had only identified their kids through pictures, ones taken in such a way they are made to be as delicate as possible.</p>

<p>He said this during the press conference. </p>

<p>As for his demeanor, he was probably nervous to begin with as well as coming off a night of autopsying first-graders who&#39;d been massacred and probably 24-48 hours with no sleep.</p>

<p>It may seem unusual out of context, but in the context of the case it makes total sense. </p>

<p>I think that secrecy has been a HUGE part of the investigation, obviously, and it was Vance&#39;s decision to maintain it to spare parents additional pain given the rise of social media and how it has caused the notification chain to be disrupted sometimes recently. </p>

<p>Again, I am viewing this through the lens of having had to write about it daily since the first minutes. In the order I watched, it made horrifying sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting slide on this thread.</p>

<p>I do still accept that it is possible that SH happened as it&#39;s been reported, but it has been reported so consistently inaccurate. All of the &quot;debunking&quot; of theories hold as solid of ground as all the conspiracy theories themselves, which on both sides are a bit weak.</p>

<p>20 kids and 6 adults were killed between two classrooms, but somehow kids from each classroom managed to escape, while the killer still managed to kill every single person reportedly shot. Then the bodies were left in the school, even though there was a &quot;body staging area&quot; set up outside. The police are now allowed to determine that everyone is dead and that the paramedics shouldn&#39;t take anyone away, or even attend to them? </p>

<p>So they leave 26 dead bodies in a school until they can be taken away in the middle of the night, with no footage. Even the Columbine shootings and Aurora massacre had footage and evidence of injured victims as well as people who were dead being taken to local hospitals. A police officer responding to the Aurora shooting even testified that he had taken a girl to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen no blood, no bodies, and a few well placed bullet holes outside the school. The shooter managed to get in a school that had just recently installed the &quot;gold standard&quot; of security systems, and he just walked in armed with enough bullets to systematically kill everyone he wanted to?</p>

<p>I could believe this happened, or didn&#39;t happen, or maybe happened - the only thing I know is there is no definitive proof that can go beyond the shadow of a doubt to prove that this happened as we are &quot;being told&quot; it happened.</p>

<p>Something like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Galpn_Uts6w">this video from Brazil, where there is clear footage of kids escaping, some wounded and even people outside filming the kids leaving</a>. That makes for a believable case, not just &quot;he said, she said&quot; stories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This argument comes up because it is key explanatory factor in the nature of news coverage. The reason that CNN and other broadcasters haven&#39;t flooded the airwaves with the most gruesome footage they could possibly get their hands on is that nobody wants to see it.</p>

<p>In addition to this, elementary schools aren&#39;t regularly surrounded by people taking lots of photos and videos, just because. The violence lasted roughly 30 minutes. Most estimates have Lanza killing himself within 15 minutes of the police arriving on scene.</p>

<p>There are very few photos of kids being evacuated (<a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1220171!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/newtown-school-shooting.jpg">but there are some</a>).</p>

<p>If this was some kind of government/media plot to steal everyone&#39;s guns wouldn&#39;t they want to maximize the amount of photo and video evidence? Remember everyone&#39;s reactions to the Columbine video? The horror and rage everyone felt as these guys killed students and liked it. Imagine what similar footage, involving six year olds, would do for the Illuminati?</p>

<p>Even if there some shitty security came feed showing him in the enter the school or fire a round or two off screen, that would just change the cries from &quot;show me some video&quot; to &quot;look how obviously faked this video is&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the record, I never thought the Columbine footage, nor the Aurora footage, was faked and I haven&#39;t heard anyone claim such.</p>

<p>There are very few photos of kids being evacuated - actually just one that you posted. Isn&#39;t it odd that there is only one picture of 14 kids being evacuated? Clearly someone was there taking pictures, what about the other 400+ kids? Nothing of them? It would make the story much more plausible if there were more photos, and that&#39;s what is weird about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I&#39;m sure those 400 kids and their families are all lying about the attack and evacuation. So bizarre, I can&#39;t tell my friends shit without half the world knowing tomorrow. How these thousands of people involved have remained so tight lipped about the US government murdering children for a political agenda <em>that not all of them would agree with anyway</em> is mind boggling. These actor/shills must be well paid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting that there haven&#39;t been 400 kids or families lying. All the news coverage we&#39;ve seen is just a handful of people at best, and the interviews themselves are suspicious. Nor have we seen mass evacuations, personal testimonies or anything since the week it happened. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=GJ--D5BvJco">Unless you count these testimonies, which are still conflicting with the various &quot;official&quot; stories, but just seem like something someone would say to get an emotional reaction.</a></p>

<p>Some people say it was an AR 15 that killed all the kids, some say there was no AR 15 there, some say it was in the trunk of the car. Some say there were only pistols, sometimes 2, sometimes 4.</p>

<p><a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/2013/01/28/an-inquisitive-couples-visit-to-newtown-connecticut/">Then there was this story from people who actually visited Newtown,</a> but were never able to talk with anyone related to the incident. Weird considering it&#39;s a small town and it shouldn&#39;t be hard to find 1 out of 400 kids/families that will say anything.</p>

<p>All in all there are just so many conflicting stories and as much evidence to support conspiracies as there is evidence to support that it actually happened. 26 people killed? An autistic 120lb kid gets 100% accuracy? With no wounded victims to testify? No ricochets, no over-penetration...yet supposedly some kids in a classroom were murdered, while others hiding in a closet in the same classroom escaped unscathed?</p>

<p>People had the exact same sentiments as yours when people started doubting those events. Yes, if this is all legit, some people are gonna look insensitive and a bit stupid - but honestly, i&#39;d rather keep an open mind and let others do the research, than just take the official story and be led to believe some bullshit yet again.</p>

<p>Even if they weren&#39;t actors, and those children really were killed, would you really put it past a government that is prepared to kill 3000 innocent people on 9/11, to kill a few kids in some nowhere town? I honestly have no idea about what happened, but i really wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was all a setup.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way he could&#39;ve got to the school since the road would&#39;ve been blocked by the police by then so he clearly walked through the woods. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was expected at the school and when he arrived shit was going down</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was expected at the school to help build a gingerbread house. Okay, established.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fearing for his daughters safety he ran around to her classroom window.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did he get there? There&#39;s no way he could&#39;ve came down the road or driven there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He then bolted into the trees because you know, mad gunman on the loose and all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No he didn&#39;t. There was a policeman walking towards him and THEN he started running into the woods. So, you&#39;re saying he knew there was a &quot;mad gunman&quot; and decides to walk through the woods to get around the police, but then when he spots them, he just runs away. Totally logical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re missing the point and you haven&#39;t &quot;debunked&quot; anything. The point was that he tells different stories depending on the interview and that there are discrepancies. And hey guess what, they still don&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=6m16s">6:16 - 6:44</a></p>

<p>&quot;I looked down and I saw six children, and I thought it was curious as to why they were on my lawn. I thought they were cub-scouts, or some children from the school doing a play. They were sitting in a regular fashion, and they-something was askew because I saw <strong><em>this man</em></strong> talking in a very loud voice to them saying &quot;it&#39;s alright, it&#39;s alright&quot;. - <strong>Who&#39;s this man? Didn&#39;t mention a female bus driver at all. Didn&#39;t say he was a female bus driver AND this man.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=6m45s">6:45 - 7:06</a></p>

<p>&quot;But then I saw <strong><em>a man</em></strong>, in a very agitated way, say &quot;it&#39;s going to be alright&quot;. And he just kept raising his voice, and he kept raising his voice, and I thought that was so strange.&quot; - <strong>He&#39;s OBVIOUSLY inferring that this man brought them there since he only mentions him, doesn&#39;t mention any one else, certainly no female bus driver.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=7m21s">7:21 - 7:30</a></p>

<p>&quot;...and then I saw <strong>a man</strong>, talking very loudly and harshly to them saying &quot;it&#39;s going to be okay, it&#39;s going to be okay...&quot;&quot; - <strong>Again...</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=8m3s">8:03 - 8:10</a></p>

<p>&quot;...and then I saw a <strong><em>man</em></strong>, talking to them in a loud voice saying &quot;it&#39;s going to be alright, it&#39;s going to be alright&quot; - <strong>Boy, he often forgets this female bus driver.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=9m0s">9:00 - 9:13</a></p>

<p>&quot;...and I <strong><em>saw a man</em></strong> talking to them in a very harsh way, and he seemed agitated he kept saying &quot;it&#39;s going to be alright, it&#39;s going to be alright&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=10m7s">10:07 - 10:20</a></p>

<p>&quot;and the school bus driver who identified <strong>herself</strong> said &quot;oh there&#39;s been an incident at the school&quot;. - 
<strong>Oh, now it&#39;s a female. What happened to the man yelling harshly? How did he know it was a bus driver unless she had driven there in a bus? They don&#39;t wear uniforms, none I&#39;ve ever heard of.</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would a female bus driver or a &quot;man yelling harshly&quot; lead the kids to a random persons driveway instead of the firehouse which was 50 feet away? Or I don&#39;t know. CALL THE POLICE? He claims the driver said &quot;there&#39;s been an incident&quot;. I assume the driver would know a shooting just took place.</p></li>
<li><p>The kids were there for around a half hour to an hour. That would put the time at around 10:10 or past. This is after you said they evacuating and that evacuation photo took place. Surely he would be seeing commotion at the firehouse by then.</p></li>
<li><p>Where&#39;s this bus driver? She just dropped the kids off and never came back to town, never came back to her job? Never heard of her name, never saw an interview with her. You would think such a hero would get any credit at all.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s also funny that nobody in the media ever asked a question about his story. Nobody ever said &quot;Why not call the police immediately?&quot; or &quot;Why did the bus driver choose your house instead of the FIRESTATION BEFORE IT, or call the police after receiving the children like any responsible adult would?&quot;</p>

<p>You can&#39;t debunk any of this because it doesn&#39;t add up. Why doesn&#39;t it add up? Because it didn&#39;t fucking happen. Congratulations on trying to defend a story made of whole cloth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the story you&#39;ve concocted in your mind?</p>

<p><strong>A man yelling</strong> must be a bus driver and she must have dropped them off since she&#39;s a bus driver. Well she&#39;s actually a former bus driver and doesn&#39;t even own a bus anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Please explain how someone seeing a man yelling equates to I saw a man he was a bus driver and he was yelling.</strong> If he had said I saw a cat meowing would you be here claiming the bus driver was a cat? He saw a man yelling. He didn&#39;t say he saw a bus driver yelling. How is this a hard concept for you to understand?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That just isn&#39;t the case. And if you cared enough to mention specifics I could probably give a rebuttal.</p>

<p>For example: Gene Rosen&#39;s testimony is hokum. He claims a man/woman bus driver rescued children when it happened and took them to Gene&#39;s house. What they don&#39;t mention is that the firehouse is BEFORE Gene&#39;s house and literally right next to it. Gene would&#39;ve been able to see commotion at the firehouse. He could literally see it from his lawn or taken the kids to it. Yet he sits with kids for a half an hour before doing anything. Oh and the &quot;bus driver&quot;, felt it was more appropriate to deliver the kids to a random stranger instead of a firehouse or the police, and this man/woman was never heard from again after that day. </p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s no footage of anything close to 500-600 kids on that day that went to that school. More specifically, there&#39;s no footage of ANY child leaving the school even though there was media helicopters on scene before they evacuated from lockdown. </p>

<p>I challenge you to find me one other shooting that had no blood, no screaming children, and no eyewitness accounts of the shooter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gene Rosen was at home when he saw the 6 children who escaped the shooting were sitting on his lawn.  There was a female bus driver, she was on foot and not driving, she did not leave the children, she went inside and called parents. There were no police or any emergency even on the scene at this time, so there was no commotion. </p>

<p>It was already established that the children left before any helicopter. We have photos of children being evacuated at 10am and the earliest report of a helicopter is at 10:30am.</p>

<p>We have at least 7 eye witnesses.</p>

<p>He went to her classroom, saw she wasn&#39;t in there and ran back into the woods. The police saw a man running and obviously that got their attention. They ran after him, detained him, found out who he was and brought him to his daughter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you expect that this should have played out? Do you think the police should have just let him run off without finding out who he was? Boy, that wouldn&#39;t be odd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right - no one has special knowledge and the media often and repeatedly report incorrect information. Why this is a point of contention is because it is some of the only footage that has been released of this incident that has any action at all, and it is highly odd on its own.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92m0FwCOmbA">Disregard what the new report was and look at the video with no audio</a>- <strong>no one</strong> who is innocent has ever ran from the cops. He gave a decent foot pursuit before the police caught up with him, and you can be sure that they were yelling after him. Do you honestly find that to be normal human behavior?</p>

<p>Why, if he had &quot;smelled sulphur and heard noises&quot;, would he check on his daughter, see that she is not in her classroom, and then decide run into the woods? That is the most illogical set of actions I could imagine in that situation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not questioning the police motive, I&#39;m questioning why someone would run away in that situation. And due to the timing, why nothing else notable has been shown on video? No kids leaving the school, no kids at the firehouse, no dead bodies, no blood...but some &quot;dad&quot; who was running into the woods because his daughter wasn&#39;t at school?</p>

<p>Wow, that&#39;s pretty much what I would expect. Did the guy hear the police? There was a helicopter overhead. We don&#39;t know. Did the guy do anything wrong? Not as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>The helicopter never recorded footage of dead people inside the building because they were inside the building. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t record the school evacuation because it happened before the helicopter arrived. This has been confirmed by the photos the Newton reporter took of children evacuating at 10am and the account of the guy flying the helicopter said 10:30am they arrived.</p>

<p>Do we have helicopter footage of children being picked up at the firehall? I don&#39;t think the helicopter even went over to the firehall since they were trying to film the location of the shooting.</p>

<p>We do have pictures and videos on the ground of parents picking up their children though.</p>

<p>If seeing dead bodies and blood is the only way to convince you, then you&#39;re going to be SOL unless the pictures get leaked like the Columbine ones did. I bet after that shitstorm though that any cop would risk leaking them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Living in a major metropolitan area, I hear helicopters overhead constantly. Media, police, and even the black unmarked helicopters that people are always suspicious of. I&#39;ve had people running through my apartment complex and helicopter spotlights blaze brightly through my windows in the middle of the night, and I&#39;m fairly certain I would be able to hear police over a media helicopter much farther away than that was.</p>

<p>The dead people were inside the building, but who declared them dead? There are hours of heli footage an not one person is taken into an ambulance, or to the EMS station that was set up. &#39;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hktGPQU5Vo8">We have footage like this, of the August 2012 NYC shooting that was released almost immediately.</a> This shows the capability of footage to be released in a short period of time, both from CCTVs as well as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=august%20nyc%20shooting&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=og&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi&amp;amp;ei=e3gDUa_gOcnriQLn8IH4Bw&amp;amp;biw=1081&amp;amp;bih=702&amp;amp;sei=fXgDUd2jE6bliwK51ICgCg">other photos being released</a> from citizens. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7sIiqq66rk">Even in the Aurora shootings we see injured victims being escorted to ambulances</a>. But there is nothing like this seen from SH. At best there were reports of 3 people being taken to local hospitals, but not a single shot of ambulances even coming or going.</p>

<p>The helicopter spent a ton of time video-ing the shooting scene while nothing was happening. The firehall must not have been far away since that was the nearest place that these few children were evacuated to. Wouldn&#39;t that make better media footage? Showing the amazing luck of the children who had escaped from this horrible tragedy instead of shooting a bunch of cops aimlessly wandering outside a school for hours?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to see dead bodies, but I need to see more than the undamaged outside of a school where a massacre supposedly occurred. According to recently released information, the school doors were all locked at 9:15, and the only way visitors could get it was to be buzzed in through a video system. How did a fully armed kid get through that &quot;gold standard&quot; system without breaking and entering? How did he walk past the front office, past the school nurse, and down to two classrooms where he murdered everyone and killed himself, without any other injuries? That&#39;s the footage I want to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a tiny town, not a sprawling metropolis where helicopters are on scene for every minor traffic accident.</p>

<p>These children weren&#39;t injured, they were shot 11 times in the head. Should we drag a 5 year olds body outside to satisfy you? The demands are getting more and more ridiculous. I don&#39;t care what happened once at some other shooting, it has no bearing at all on this tragedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What reports showed they were shot in the head 11 times? All I&#39;ve read was that each victim was shot between 3 and 11 times, and no physical locations were noted yet. Also, 11 headshots on 26 victims? Seriously? That itself is unbelievable. Have you ever shot a gun?</p>

<p>The demands are geeting &quot;more ridiculous&quot; because that is how the burden of truth works. There are too many unanswered questions, and that is what my problem is. The only &quot;proof&quot; that has been offered that anyone has even died was testimony from two paid government officials - a sheriff and a coroner who couldn&#39;t even tell us how many of the dead were female, and how many were male.</p>

<p>As I mentioned previously, the conspiracy theories may not have much weight, but none of the official theories have any evidence to prove them either. All I know is what I&#39;ve seen, the backwards reporting, the odd human behavior, and the massive uproar in gun control that has happened since.</p>

<p>I agree. You can just aim for the extremities and shoot them dozens of times in the wrist or whatever. As long as you use a small enough gun and avoid hitting the head, vital organs or major arteries the the kid will come out of it a little gimpy but otherwise ok.</p>

Then some 7 year-olds were kidnapped while the media claimed they were shot in the head by Lanza. But in fact Lanza was already dead or something at that point, and the real killer was some guy the local cops picked up in the woods. </p>

<p>Also, no kids were actually killed by the guy in the woods., He was just there. And the cops who found the guy in the woods were part of the coverup even though they screwed up and admitted they found the guy in the woods.</p>

<p>The medical examiner was also in on the coverup, and the government recruited a professional actor to claim he helped some kids on a schoolbus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Amazing how dense people in here are, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>From the Joe Viallis article on Port Arthur:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoever was on the trigger that fateful day demonstrated professional skills equal to some of the best special forces shooters in the world. His critical error lay in killing too many people too quickly while injuring far too few, thereby exposing himself for what he was: a highly trained combat shooter probably ranked among the top twenty such specialists in the western world. ...Special forces train continuously for months on end to achieve a ratio as high as this, which lies far beyond the abilities of regular soldiers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ratio he speaks of is 90% and Lanza shoots a 93%??</p>

<p>Yeah right. </p>

<p>Well, this shows us there sure is no shortage of critical thinkers in this SR!</p>

<p>No, you&#39;re missing the point and you haven&#39;t &quot;debunked&quot; anything. The point was that he tells different stories depending on the interview and that there are discrepancies. And hey guess what, they still don&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=6m16s">6:16 - 6:44</a></p>

<p>&quot;I looked down and I saw six children, and I thought it was curious as to why they were on my lawn. I thought they were cub-scouts, or some children from the school doing a play. They were sitting in a regular fashion, and they-something was askew because I saw <strong><em>this man</em></strong> talking in a very loud voice to them saying &quot;it&#39;s alright, it&#39;s alright&quot;. - <strong>Who&#39;s this man? Didn&#39;t mention a female bus driver at all. Didn&#39;t say he was a female bus driver AND this man.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=6m45s">6:45 - 7:06</a></p>

<p>&quot;But then I saw <strong><em>a man</em></strong>, in a very agitated way, say &quot;it&#39;s going to be alright&quot;. And he just kept raising his voice, and he kept raising his voice, and I thought that was so strange.&quot; - <strong>He&#39;s OBVIOUSLY inferring that this man brought them there since he only mentions him, doesn&#39;t mention any one else, certainly no female bus driver.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=7m21s">7:21 - 7:30</a></p>

<p>&quot;...and then I saw <strong>a man</strong>, talking very loudly and harshly to them saying &quot;it&#39;s going to be okay, it&#39;s going to be okay...&quot;&quot; - <strong>Again...</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=8m3s">8:03 - 8:10</a></p>

<p>&quot;...and then I saw a <strong><em>man</em></strong>, talking to them in a loud voice saying &quot;it&#39;s going to be alright, it&#39;s going to be alright&quot; - <strong>Boy, he often forgets this female bus driver.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=9m0s">9:00 - 9:13</a></p>

<p>&quot;...and I <strong><em>saw a man</em></strong> talking to them in a very harsh way, and he seemed agitated he kept saying &quot;it&#39;s going to be alright, it&#39;s going to be alright&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNfesyWUeZk&amp;amp;t=10m7s">10:07 - 10:20</a></p>

<p>&quot;and the school bus driver who identified <strong>herself</strong> said &quot;oh there&#39;s been an incident at the school&quot;. - 
<strong>Oh, now it&#39;s a female. What happened to the man yelling harshly? How did he know it was a bus driver unless she had driven there in a bus? They don&#39;t wear uniforms, none I&#39;ve ever heard of.</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would a female bus driver or a &quot;man yelling harshly&quot; lead the kids to a random persons driveway instead of the firehouse which was 50 feet away? Or I don&#39;t know. CALL THE POLICE? He claims the driver said &quot;there&#39;s been an incident&quot;. I assume the driver would know a shooting just took place.</p></li>
<li><p>The kids were there for around a half hour to an hour. That would put the time at around 10:10 or past. This is after you said they evacuating and that evacuation photo took place. Surely he would be seeing commotion at the firehouse by then.</p></li>
<li><p>Where&#39;s this bus driver? She just dropped the kids off and never came back to town, never came back to her job? Never heard of her name, never saw an interview with her. You would think such a hero would get any credit at all.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s also funny that nobody in the media ever asked a question about his story. Nobody ever said &quot;Why not call the police immediately?&quot; or &quot;Why did the bus driver choose your house instead of the FIRESTATION BEFORE IT, or call the police after receiving the children like any responsible adult would?&quot;</p>

<p>You can&#39;t debunk any of this because it doesn&#39;t add up. Why doesn&#39;t it add up? Because it didn&#39;t fucking happen. Congratulations on trying to defend a story made of whole cloth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, my history is a bit blue and I am not taking the risk.</p>

<p>I did separate pieces about that aspect, never using the phrase &quot;four mental health experts.&quot; Credentials <em>do</em> mean something when it comes to medicine, as I&#39;d be terrible, for instance, at diagnosing cardiomyopathy. </p>

<p>My point is not that you can Google and find me, it is that I am preventing you from doing so. Otherwise, my co-workers will learn of my penchant for certain sex positions, and that would be embarrassing for everyone. </p>

<p>My job is not so glamorous that I&#39;d lie about it, and I&#39;m not claiming extraordinary powers. I am merely saying I have happened to have been there since the first five minutes, and spent a lot of man hours covering this story.</p>

<p>You can be of the layperson&#39;s opinion Robbie Parker is a liar, but it&#39;s just that- an opinion, based on uneducated observation. That&#39;s fine, we all have those, but it&#39;s certainly not compelling evidence. </p>

<p>You assume it&#39;s fake and wrong.  Close enough for the point I was making.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I put quotation marks to emphasize sarcasm in &quot;official&quot; because I laugh at any media networks version of any given story.</p>

<p>So you laugh at the story that the Ravens and 49ers are in the Super Bowl?  That was reported on CNN.  You laugh at the story that Barack Obama was re-elected President, and sworn in last week?  You laugh at the story that a hurricane named Sandy struck the east coast last fall?  You laugh at the story that the NHL lockout ended, allowing play to resume?  All of these were reported in &quot;media networks.&quot;</p>

<p>No, of course you don&#39;t.  Because you don&#39;t &quot;laugh at any media networks version of any story.&quot;  You selectively accept their information, and discard their information, wherever it fits into your predetermined reality.  That&#39;s called confirmation bias - it&#39;s a mental dysfunction that you won&#39;t be able to get over until you acknowledge that it has occurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing-  Sandy Hook was/is clearly a fat hoax, and now everyone who agrees is being downvoted to hell. </p>

<p>I agree- there is organized vote rigging going on here. </p>

<p>The story has literally changed over and over again.</p>

<p>Adam Lanza supposedly shot his mom (with a gun he left at that house)  then drives to the shool with 4 other guns-  one left in the trunk of the car (that is never mentioned) and a Bushmaster and 2 handguns-  This kid has a huge arsenal.</p>

<p>There is no record of Adam since 2009-  </p>

<p>Sally Cox claimed in the 60 Minutes interview that the new security system was installed 4-5 years ago, when it was installed just a few months before the shooting by Dawn Hochsprung. - How could her memory she be off by so long?</p>

<p>Sally Cox of course also claimed both Adam Lanza and his mother were involved at Sandy Hook school and that turns out to be a lie.</p>

<p>The Medical examiner claims he doesn&#39;t know how many of the people were boys and how many were girls..  nobody finds this odd?</p>

<p>Gene Rosen-  kids dropped off at his house and he takes them inside for 30 minutes, but never writes their names and phone numbers down?  Why not take them to the firehouse?</p>

<p>Where&#39;s Gene Rosen&#39;s wife the entire time? She&#39;s never mentioned once.</p>

<p>Kids in the school when asked if they heared any of the 100 rounds fired by the deafening gunshots respond-  &quot;we thought the janitor was banging on the wall&quot;</p>

<p>Kid saw a man &quot;on the ground with handcuffs on&quot; and other eyewitness saw &quot;man with cammo pants and dark jacket in the front seat of a police car with handcuffs on&quot;.</p>

<p>All the people were told to &quot;close their eyes as they leave the school.&quot;</p>

<p>The security camera footage is missing.</p>

<p>There are no bodies show in any of the helicopter footage and no commotion. </p>

<p>The roads are all blocked leading to the crime scene.</p>

<p>The Danbury hospital says only 3 people were brought there, and won&#39;t name who the teacher was who was released.</p>

<p>Not ONE diagram has been released of where the bodies were allegedly found inside the school.</p>

<p>The story STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN THIS SUBREDDIT HAS BEEN INFILTRATED ITS OBVIOUS.</p>

<p>In fact, it&#39;s all covered here in his blog: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/175yw2/mars_hoax_iss_hoax_newtown_aurora_tucson_all/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/175yw2/mars_hoax_iss_hoax_newtown_aurora_tucson_all/</a></p>

<p>And please, his &quot;really great points&quot; amount to nothing more than taking matters out of context to fit his own agenda. Any sources of information that don&#39;t fit his (and your) agenda are dismissed, and accused of being shills. </p>

<p>After all, we&#39;ve been <em>legit</em> infiltrated, right mate?</p>

<p>I agree. History is replete with cases where children were shot multiple times at close  range with a rifle and bounced back. Only someone with very specialized training  would think to aim for the vital organs or the head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>News reporters don&#39;t have special knowledge, they wanted a story and so they filmed the guy and said suspect. Well ya, I guess everyone is a suspect until you find out.</p>

<p>He went to her classroom, saw she wasn&#39;t in there and ran back into the woods. The police saw a man running and obviously that got their attention. They ran after him, detained him, found out who he was and brought him to his daughter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you expect that this should have played out? Do you think the police should have just let him run off without finding out who he was? Boy, that wouldn&#39;t be odd.</p>

<p>I imagine there was a shit ton of confusion at the time, panicking parents. He believed his daughters life was in danger and you want to fault him for looking for her.</p>

<p>Do you think he&#39;s a shooter or something? I can&#39;t understand why you guys latch on to this dearly. What do you think it shows?</p>
