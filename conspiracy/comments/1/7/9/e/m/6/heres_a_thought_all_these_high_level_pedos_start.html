        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just saying. </p>

<p>A lot of these Sandy Hook parents say they didn&#39;t want to/get to see their kids after the alleged event. One said they saw their kid but her entire face was blown off. Can&#39;t really ID the body then. </p>

<p>I just feel like with all the increased visibility from the Jimmy Saville story, these sickos might not be able to go through their (ugh) normal channels to get their fix of children for... whatever it is they do. And the prevailing ideology is to never let a good tragedy go to waste. </p>

<p>So why not cover a few bases at once?</p>

<p>And that the world has a more active and pervasive slave trade now than in the entirety of human history. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any evidence to back this up. I&#39;m just discussing trends. I was remembering the strange victim phone calls from the hijacked planes of 9/11 and how it sounded like there were handlers in the background coaching them.</p>

<p>If those people were off the plane and being stage managed at a base somewhere, then what? Well, the world is a Capitalist&#39;s playground, and Capitalism considers humanity to be a fungible resource. So why would you waste perfectly capable resources by killing them off and then having to figure out what to do with the meat? Sell or trade them, get some ROI for your trouble, and wash your hands of the whole thing.</p>

<p>Barring that, throw them in a black site and let them rot with no oversight. It&#39;s dark, but I&#39;m approaching it like a psychopath; from a purely logical standpoint.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 13 March 1996, Hamilton, armed with <strong>four hand-guns</strong>, opened fire on a junior school class, killing <strong>16 children and one teacher before turning the gun on himself</strong>, shattering forever the idyllic 13th century Scottish town of Dunblane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intriguing. There&#39;s more:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some commentators, mindful that one of Tony Blair&#39;s closest confidante&#39;s is a practising paedophile, are even suggesting that this particular scandal, and not Blair&#39;s repeated lies and fabricated reports in regard to Iraq, may well prove the downfall of a government mired in sleaze and corruption. The Sunday Times is reported to have obtained an FBI list of Labour MPs who have used credit cards to pay for internet child pornography, and Blair has responded by imposing a massive news blackout, failing however to stop the arrest of one of his most important aides, Phillip Lyon.</p>

<p>The latest allegations came to light following a campaign to lift the secrecy on the Dunblane massacre. Large sections of the police report were banned from the public domain under a <strong>100-year secrecy order</strong>. Lord Cullen, an establishment insider, also omitted and censored references to the documents in his final report. <strong>Parents and teachers were advised to concentrate their efforts on a campaign to outlaw handguns</strong> instead of focusing on how the mentally unstable Freemason, already known by the police to be a paedophile, had obtained a firearms licence for six handguns. Hamilton allegedly enjoyed good relations with both local Labour luminary George Robertson and Michael Forsyth, the then Scottish Secretary of State and MP for Stirling. Forsyth congratulated and encouraged Hamilton for running a boy&#39;s club. Hamilton was also found to have exchanged letters with the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to do that even if you didn&#39;t kill any kids though. Whatever you do with the kids, you have to do it in a way that&#39;s untraceable. Plus if you don&#39;t kill them you always have to worry about some hospital janitor or someone telling people there weren&#39;t any dead bodies there.</p>

<p>Seems like it makes much more sense to just shoot the kids and claim Adam Lanza shot them. That way you leave far fewer loose ends.</p>

<p>Obviously. And you never will because your theory is so implausible it defies belief.</p>

<p>There is a thriving black market for children, kids disappear and are never found, there are millions of poor kids scattered all around that can disappear without anyone noticing, so <em>naturally</em> the logical plan is to stage an absurdly high-profile event that will come under intense scrutiny and receive thousands of hours of news coverage, focusing international attention right at the epicenter of your mass kidnapping and drawing a host of investigators, journalists, concerned people and conspiracy theorists. This, for them, seems like a good plan.</p>

<p>And this is ignoring the idea that they&#39;d still have to get some <em>other</em> dead kids to stand in for those who were kidnapped (why they wouldn&#39;t just rape <em>those</em> kids is unclear), blow off their faces, and hope that the parents don&#39;t notice that the corpse isn&#39;t really their kid.</p>

<p>Honest question: Do you even think these things through when you dream them up?</p>

<p>You, your theory that a massive school shooting may have been staged so rich people could steal away a bunch of children, the way your mind works to connect all these disparate dots into an omnipresent global child-stealing spider - <em>that</em> is the train crash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m pulling it out of thin air. There&#39;s a very large investigation going on in the UK that appears to involve very high level officials in the UK regarding systemic pedophilia. </p>

<p>And the Pentagon was found to have 5200 employees purchasing child pornography not too long ago. The subsequent investigation was stopped cold by high level entities left unnamed. </p>

<p>Why Sandy Hook? There... there appear to be rituals practiced in this country that many of us do not understand. And it doesn&#39;t matter if people like you and I understand or believe in them. Logic dictates that it only matters if there are (powerful) people that do believe in and practice these rituals. </p>

<p>This thread is meant to be an open discussion about those things. Not about me. I&#39;ve made that clear. But you persist. I think you&#39;ve made yourselves very clear on your intent here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not concerned with what people reading this think of me personally. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I will reiterate that I don&#39;t believe Sandy Hook was staged specifically to steal kids. </p>

<p>I&#39;m attempting to have a discussion. A discussion that ties together a few theories that have been floating around this sub. Mainly mind control (documented to be initiated by abuse of the young and impressionable), false flags in America, and the high instance of pedophilia in the upper echelons of the power structure. The same power structure that swung into action very quickly and efficiently when this incident happened to bring about all kinds of gun control legislation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I don&#39;t feel that what the public has been shown about Sandy Hook adds up completely.  There&#39;s a bigger story there. And when you have a guy with fresh toys in his den talking about how a school bus of traumatized kids were just dropped of on his lawn and left there, well... it struck a chord with me. And I thought I&#39;d pose a what if to get a reaction.</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting about the reaction I expected. Interesting responses all around. Thanks for participating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To extrapolate from your thesis, I think you should consider that the children who were allegedly &quot;dropped off&quot; at creepy Gene Rosen&#39;s house, could be victims of that conspiracy. </p>

<p>These unnamed children were taken to his &quot;safe house&quot; just after the shooting, to get them out of public view. They were then secreted out of the area by a satanic/paedophile network. </p>

<p>The unfortunate &quot;Rosen children&quot; were then conveniently listed amongst the 20 child victims of Sandy Hook. Of course, they were later murdered, but they were ritualistically killed by paedophiles, not a crazed gunman, and they didn&#39;t die inside the school building at Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>Edit: We need to find out the identities of the children who Gene Rosen locked in his house without bothering to tell anyone who might be looking for them (the parents, the police, the school etc). If those children are amongst the listed survivors of Sandy Hook, then my little hypothesis collapses.</p>

<p>It is about you because these our your thoughts. All that I know of you is what you have presented in this post and replies. I have not expressed any personal opinions about you as a person.
