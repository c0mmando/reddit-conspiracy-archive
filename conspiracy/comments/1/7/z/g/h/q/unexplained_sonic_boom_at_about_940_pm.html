        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was a sonic boom tonight that was heard in a 40 mile area. Reports say people were woken from their sleep, dishes were rattling, houses were shaking, kids were scared and what not. The local news wont respond to the flood of calls. The various police stations and sheriffs departments say they have received no reports of such a boom, yet many of us have called asking about it. No one can seem to figure out what it could have been. Has anyone else experienced something similar?</p>

<p>EDIT: The local news has released a half assed story of a late night training exercise at a base not usually known for &quot;shaking the neighborhood&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the recent increase in cosmic activity, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was a meteor. What does bother me is that it took the local news almost 36 hours to post a lame 4-5 sentence story on it that you could only find if you knew what pages and what links to click on. I couldn&#39;t even find it with their search bar. I had to go back through my browser history and refresh the page. Another fishy fact is that they claim it was just a late night training exercise at Hurlburt Field. This base is just a basic airfield no bigger than your local airport. It&#39;s not surrounded by neighborhoods but it&#39;s not out in the boondocks either. I don&#39;t understand why they would be doing late night ordinance exercises at this particular base when they have Eglin AFB just 11 miles to the east. Eglin is well known for ordinance testing, ask anyone that has lived in NW Florida for any extended amount of time and they will tell you about the booms you can hear coming from there from time to time. The thing is, with Eglin being just over 40 miles to the east from my house, the ordinance tests are no louder than a transformer blowing several blocks down the road. It&#39;s not house rattling loud, on occasion only a trained ear can hear it (I don&#39;t mean trained as in military training, I mean trained as in someone who is in tune with their surroundings and knows what is normal and what is not), but you can tell it&#39;s a serious explosion and not a firework. I doubt ten miles closer (Hurlburt) is enough of a difference to rattle my dishes and have people calling it in in Perdido Key, about 10 miles to my west. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> The news claims it&#39;s a training exercise but I&#39;m not dumb enough to take their word for it on blind faith.</p>
