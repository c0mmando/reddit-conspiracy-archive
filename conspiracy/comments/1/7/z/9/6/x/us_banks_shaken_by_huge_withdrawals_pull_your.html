        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>US Federal Reserve is reporting a major deposit withdrawal from the nation’s bank accounts. The financial system has not seen such a massive fund outflow since 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>­The first week of January 2013 has seen $114 billion withdrawn from 25 of the US’ biggest banks, pushing deposits down to $5.37 trillion, according to the US Fed. Financial analysts suggest it could be down to the Transaction Account Guarantee insurance program coming to an end on December 31 last year and clients moving their money that is no longer insured by the government.</p>

<p>The program was introduced in the wake of the 2008 crisis in order to support the banking system. It provided insurance for around $1.5 trillion in non-interest-bearing accounts with a limit of $250,000. It was aimed at medium and small banks as the creators of the program believed bigger banks would cope with the crisis themselves.</p>

<p>So the current “fast pace” of withdrawal comes as a surprise to financial analysts because the deposits are slipping away from those banks which supposedly were safe. Experts expected savers in small and medium banks would turn to bigger players come December 31. </p>

<p>There are a number of reasons behind this unpredicted fund outflow. Some experts believe it has to do with the beginning of the year when the money is randomly needed here and there. Others have concluded the funds are getting down to business and being invested.</p>

<p>Another set of data from the US Federal Reserve shows some deposits may have moved within the banking system from one type of account to another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My credit union offers me a Mastercard debit/credit card that works everywhere. They are also part of a co-op network where I can use other credit union&#39;s ATM&#39;s with no fees. This gives me access to over 75,000 ATMs across the US. They also have a great web site where I can pay bills, check my balance, transfer funds, etc. The only thing that I&#39;m missing is the exorbitant fees that Wells Fargo used to charge me every month. (Oh, and also the rude  and terrible customer service which I don&#39;t miss.)</p>

<p>My suggestion: open a new credit union account but still keep your old bank for a few months. Get your direct deposits, bill pay, and transfers set up and working correctly. Once you&#39;re happy that everything is working as expected -- then shut down the old bank account. This is what I did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My credit union&#39;s online banking and billpay is awesome.</p>

<p>They have a huge list of companies that they have streamlined the process with, so if I pay a bill today, the funds will be electronically transferred and credited to my account by tomorrow.</p>

<p>On top of that, you can pay other people or companies, it will just take a few days.  I had to send my dad some money, and I paid him with online bill pay.  Since he wasn&#39;t a company that he had a relationship with, they mailed him a check that he had to cash.  With that check came instructions for how to enable the streamlined electronic payment that the other popular companies enjoy.  He did that, and now if I send him some money, it is electronically transferred into his account (at a completely different bank) by the next day, free of charge.</p>

<p>My credit and debit cards are Visa cards, so they are accepted everywhere Visa is accepted.  Most credit unions are also part of some national ATM networks.  Mine is part of the Star and Cirrus networks, so I can use any ATM that has either of those logos, and the fee is waived.  Additionally, they are part of a credit union co-op so I can use the ATMs of basically any other credit union without any fees, as well.</p>

<p>Middle class families in Weimar Germany sold every heirloom, everything of value to pay for food and fuel, but Weimar hyperinflationary crisis lasted 5 years!</p>

<p>Look at this chart which gives a chronology of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Img-Z121706-0001.jpg">how paper Reichs marks lost value against Gold marks from 1918-1923</a>. At the end, no amount of paper could buy a single gold mark - gold was infinitely valuable in paper terms!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the history of currency collapses - it always takes months or years before paper money becomes toilet paper - it is NEVER an overnight phenomenon. </p>

<p>When the banks close initially for a few days/weeks, it will be because there isn&#39;t enough paper money to meet demand - only about 5% of the money which exists is in paper form - the rest is in digits in peoples&#39; accounts.  </p>

<p>When there is a bank run, banks quickly run out of paper money, and until the government printing presses can produce enough paper notes to get the economy moving again, the banks stay closed. </p>

<p>But when they reopen, your savings might have lost 30% or more due to a sudden surge in inflation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, what? </p>

<p>First of all, Weimar is a poor analogy.  Reparations and the Treaty of Versailles, not to mention the idiot Germans&#39; decision to fund their WWI military escapade on credit were all contributing factors, as well as the idea of printing paper money to buy up foreign currency to pay those reparations, since the Papiermark was not valid for payment under Germany&#39;s terms.  That&#39;s quite a bit more complicated than the scenario we are discussing.</p>

<p>Also, nine years?  By 1923, the Reichsbank Mark was replaced by the Rentenmark at the rate of 1RM to 10<sup>12</sup> Reichsbank Marks.  That&#39;s trillion to one.  That sounds like toilet paper to me.</p>

<p>Would a run on the banks contribute to hyperinflation <strong>OVERNIGHT</strong>?  No, it won&#39;t.  But that doesn&#39;t make it any less stupid advice for all citizens to remove their funds from banks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you just looking for something to get cross about?</p>

<p>You said &quot;Any scenario where all banks stop functioning will be quickly followed by the collapse of our currency.&quot; This is only true insofar that the collapse may start quickly, but the collapse could be a long, drawn out process.</p>

<p>I used Weimar as an example, rather than as an analogy, but the hyperinflationary episode lasted 5 years. It took a long time for Reichsmarks to become toilet paper, and there is no reason to envisage that a collapse of the US dollar and other currencies will be an instantaneous phenomenon either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;m trying to get you to see the reality of the matter.</p>

<p>As it took a little over 4 months for the Reichsmark to go from a relatively stable $60 RM per U.S. dollar in August 1921 to $320 RM per U.S. dollar in November 1921.  And by December of the following year, it had reached $8,000 RM per dollar.  That&#39;s not overnight - as I said.  But you can safely assume that the drop during the second half of 1921 was enough for people to lose their homes and to starve.</p>

<p>The Reichsmark was worthless long before it hit a trillionth, billionth, or even millionth of its previous value.  And that didn&#39;t take 5 years.  I&#39;m not looking for something to be cross about - I&#39;m trying to tell you that your 1,000 dollar savings advice is worthless in light of most currency collapses, and definitely in the case of the Weimar Republic&#39;s escapade.  In that case, your $1,000 becomes $100 dollars in less than 6 months and becomes worth $1 in less than a year.  You&#39;d have spent that grand, long before that second year rolled around.</p>

<p>I&#39;m simply speaking out against the headline&#39;s advice that all citizens should immediately withdraw their funds from the banking system.  It would certainly lead to a devaluation of their savings and likely economic turmoil.  And as well, to your stop-gap measure of $1,000 paper currency on hand, which will afford little security in a rapidly declining economy.</p>

<p>A run on the banks would be cool, but the Fed being the assholes they are would just print a bunch of money and give it to the banks to keep them in business.  That loan earns interest, meaning more money must be created.  In theory, you could speed up the collapse by increasing inflation and the amount of debt in the world that couldn&#39;t be paid back.</p>

<p>Know what happens when everyone takes there money out at the same time?</p>

<p>The economy collapses.</p>

<p>There are still reputable savings institutions and credit unions. Find them and use them.  Or not.  But advising everyone to destroy the economy is pure idiocy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Somni-452, the the true definition of idiocy is to keep funding tyrants and thieves who use your gullibility to rip you off at every turn. YOU put YOUR money in THEIR banks and they make money off of it and put YOU in escalating debt. The money in their banks fills their war chests, funds your enslavement and fills their personal coffers. Fuck the system, let it crash and burn. Make no bones about it, there will be a financial crash as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow. Your words will return to haunt you when you&#39;re screaming at the ATM, and begging the police to let you in your bank to get at your disappeared money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you sad little person.</p>

<p>If you took the time to read my comments here, you would see that I recommend putting money into small banks and credit unions that can be trusted.  Does that make it entirely secure?  No, it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>As to your idiotic idea that I would ever be crying to police about getting my money from a bank in the event of an economic collapse - sorry, but that day will never come.  The majority of my wealth has been recently converted to gold.  AND, my family happens to have a very well-stocked bunker with a 9-12 months supply of food, as well as weapons, and a solar power supply.  </p>

<p>So, thanks for your concern, but I&#39;ll be fine when utterly retarded children such as yourself start a bank run based on your complete lack of economics understanding and destroy the economy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here defending large banking corporations like Chase, BOA, Citigroup, or any of the others.  Personally, I&#39;d like to see them all strung up by their balls and their personal fortunes distributed to low income families who lost their homes in the crisis.  But since I&#39;m not a fucking rube like you, I understand the difference between those companies and the small-time banks and credit unions where bankers (OMG!) actually do their fucking jobs and aren&#39;t ass-raping their communities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey stupid, who do you think underwrites credit unions and small time banks? You don&#39;t think they have to play by the same rules as the big banks behind the scenes? You&#39;re also an arrogant hypocrite bemoaning how everyone removing their money from the bank would collapse the economy. Yet you&#39;ve admittedly taken a large amount of your money out and converted it to gold. So which is it? Are YOU the only one permitted remove their cash and no one else? And everyone else has to keep their cash in to prop up a criminal enterprise to keep the crooked system afloat?</p>

<p>You could have originally discussed this civilly with me, without resorting to calling me names straight from the outset. However, since you clearly lack that level of sophistication I&#39;ve had to lower myself to a level that you can clearly comprehend. Spoiling for a fight with someone you perceive as weak to bolster your insecurity? Looking for someone to denigrate, then go to a bar and fat mouth that shit and wait for your lesson. Don&#39;t swagger in here like you&#39;re something special, because guess what? You&#39;re not. People who have something to share and discuss of value, don&#39;t troll in with insults straight away. If you are truly sincere about what you claim to believe, you&#39;d see we are on the same team, fighting the same enemy. So who do you want to waste your time fighting with? Me or them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think a credit union or a small commercial bank and an investment bank play by the same rules, then you really are retarded. I don&#39;t see my local credit union bundling credit default swaps. </p>

<p>As to my financials, yes, I moved money into precious metals. But I certainly didn&#39;t do it in one go, as your headline suggests. I also have sums at several credit unions - because these major banks can&#39;t behave ethically.  But the money I lost in the crisis wasn&#39;t some savings account backed by FDIC was it? No, it was investments in risky ventures that turned out to be essentially bogus (though sadly legal.) Lesson learned. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a HUGE difference from FDIC insured deposits, up to $100,000 per person, per account. And the FDIC has <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/banking/facts/index.html">never failed to pay back the funds it insures.</a>
You are free to do whatever you like with your money. But saying pithy little things like &quot;fuck the system, let it burn&quot; isn&#39;t what I would call sound financial advice.</p>
