        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A few things I noticed as to why I think this. My friend an I have named this conspiracy &quot;Protocol 205 of the NFL rule book.&quot;</p>

<p>1 - They say power from outside caused an entire outage to the stadium yet when the power did go, half the stadium went first. If it was an outside power source the whole stadium would have dropped and emergency power would have come one. Power went out, THEN emergency lights came on about 1 minute afterwards. An electrician friend of mine pointed that factor out.</p>

<p>2 - Que the advertisers online having instant Ads ready at 7:45 Pm at night. Who is working at Oreo that late on a Sunday? Fresh unseen Ads played during commercials while playing catch up.</p>

<p>EDIT - Certain local areas saw game footage, some areas saw local ads and some areas saw national ads.</p>

<p><del>3 - Shannon Sharp&#39;s comments had him slipping on his own words when he said &quot;they turned out the power&quot; because he wasn&#39;t smart enough to keep his trap shut, he will also be replaced by Hines Ward next year due to this flap. That&#39;s a whole other conspiracy theory.</del></p>

<p>EDIT  - We have determined that Shannon Sharp is just stupid. WTF does he know.</p>

<p><del>4 - The game was nearly 30 minutes ahead of schedule by third quarter. It was on pace to be one of the fastest NFL super bowls ever played.</del></p>

<p>EDIT The game was only ahead by a few minutes.</p>

<p>5 - It&#39;s the Super Bowl, BILLIONS of dollars at stake, and they have a &quot;unknown&quot; power outage in which they still refuse to identify. You would think with so much money on the line, 40+ million people gathered around watching, that the NFL would have triple and quadruple redundant power sources for their venue. </p>

<p>6 - You would also think they would know the EXACT source of the problem, because it&#39;s electricity, power outages are not that hard to identify (electrician friend talking there).</p>

<p>EDIT : Searching for the missing stat table. Past average Game time to real time correlations to last night&#39;s game, which would help make or break this theory. I will begin the search tomorrow.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_records#Time">Someone put it on the wiki today as the longest game ever.</a></p>

<p>EDIT to this entire conspiracy theory. Billions of dollars at stake in Vegas needed this game to be closer to avoid huge pay outs. Maybe it wasn&#39;t to make Ad revenue, but to make vegas kick back dollars for big wigs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beyond this being complete speculation and you making assumptions, here are a few notes with my .02 on each point.</p>

<p>1- Interesting that only half the stadiums power went out yes, but stadiums are massive power consumers. Add in the extra screens, displays, lights etc of the super bowl and you have a massive power suck. The stadium isn&#39;t drawing all it&#39;s power from &quot;one outlet&quot; and it is definitely feasible that parts of the stadium were pulling from multiple grids. Also, its possible they flipped the emerg. lights on manually, realizing that it was dim and they didn&#39;t want a lawsuit on their hands with drunk joe falling down the stairs when he goes to get his 6th coors light.</p>

<p>2 - Ad agencies and prod companies never stop working, especially on super bowl sunday. The commercials that aired during the gap were probably going to air during the game anyways, thats how media buys work.</p>

<p>3- Shannon Sharpe and the other announcers are former players who are probably dumber than piss. You really think if this was a massive conspiracy they would have told these idiot players? By listening to their commentary, they clearly were caught off guard and improvising and to be honest, they did a terrible job of handling the situation, as far as broadcasters go. Those guys were clueless.</p>

<p>4 - Can you source this time comparison to previous super bowls please?</p>

<p>5 - Power grids are delicate, get overloaded sometimes due to weather, usage, human error etc. The stadium was no doubt plugged into multiple grids, and likely had generators. The TV trucks all operate on generators, for example. Thats why we didn&#39;t lose the tv signal. There were backups in place I&#39;m sure and the fact that they didn&#39;t lose everything goes to show that, I think.</p>

<p>6 - I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve released an official statement yet have they? Regardless, why would they during the game? What if some guy fucked up and flipped a switch? What if the nfl fucked up and wired something wrong? This isn&#39;t something you want to admit from a PR standpoint on live tv with a captive audience, you do it in a press release a day or two after the game so that people don&#39;t care anymore.</p>

<p>Long story shot, the power outage was not a conspiracy, at least none I have seen.</p>

<p>A co-worker did raise an interesting point to me though, that there are all kinds of strange &quot;bets&quot; that happen on things like &quot;odds the power will go out at the super bowl&quot; etc. Maybe you can speculate on that for a minute.</p>

<p>You makes very good counter points. </p>

<p>My game speed comparison just comes from my own 20 some odd years of watching the super bowl. it seemed that we were way ahead of schedule at 7:45, time running off the clock in the third quarter and no help in site for the 49ers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your assertion that the game &quot;on pace to be one of the fastest NFL super bowls ever played&quot; is based on nothing more than how it <em>felt</em> to you? You make a statement that suggests actual, factual data, when it fact it was based on nothing more than something you <em>felt</em>.</p>

<p>At 4:14, this Super Bowl turned out to be <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/super-bowl-xlvii-records-set-tied-baltimore-ravens-san-francisco-49ers-jacoby-jones-colin-kaepernick-power-outage-020313">the longest of all time</a>.

<p>Official explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Entergy and SMG, the company that manages the Superdome, issued a joint statement explaining the power loss:</p>

<p>“A piece of equipment that is designed to monitor electrical load sensed an abnormality in the system. Once the issue was detected, the sensing equipment operated as designed and opened a breaker, causing power to be partially cut to the Superdome in order to isolate the issue. Backup generators kicked in immediately as designed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something of interest:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Michael Burns, a spokesman for Entergy Services, the local utility, said that his company’s distribution and transmission feeders that serve the Superdome were never interrupted. Power did not go out elsewhere in the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe there&#39;s at least a good chance that the power was cut for one reason or another. The movie enthusiast in me would like to believe it was part of some fantastical Hollywood plot by a black ops team to thwart a terrorist attack, but I&#39;m sure the real explanation is probably much more mundane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is good info. I think before making any kind of guess I&#39;d want to learn more about the specific &quot;piece of equipment&quot; that sensed the &quot;abnormality&quot; to rule out means of interfering with it intentionally. I wouldn&#39;t expect that or want it from a utility company press release, and it&#39;s probably not easy to get. Hopefully someone in the media will dig a little deeper and ask the right questions about if/how a failure of the specific equipment is able to be influenced.</p>

<p>I was incredibly skeptical about this whole thing until seeing that the feeders never went down. A failure <em>inside</em> the stadium , I think, necessitates more thorough reporting on the specifics.</p>

<h1>7 Mercedes Benz was set to run a huge ad in the fourth quarter (i believe they ran a commercial in the 1st quarter stating stick around for the fourth quarter special ad)</h1>

<p>~Who Owns the rights to the Superdome stadium Mercedes Benz.  They most likely have some sway in and around the stadium.</p>

<p>Well after that kick return and 49ers looking like it was all but over very in early in third (28-3), i too was like ahh, time to start clicking around and seeing what else is on, when i come back from flipping around, boom lights out, 35 minutes later, ah the game is back on, touchdown, field goal, touchdown, shit its a game and just in time with 3 minutes left in the 3rd.</p>

<p>All things considered, lights go out, a new game has started in the 3rd, Mercedes gets their ad seen by much more people with the game being closer.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents and for fun.</p>

That&#39;s why when two time outs are called back to back they go to commercial each time. They actually spent all thirty minutes talking about the power and how &quot;cool&quot; Joe Flacco was.</p>

The NFL is intertwined with the goverment and television networks which means only the guys who have connections to those groups would be free to fix the game.  The teams and probably most owners are sucked in to the illusion like everyone else is and think there is no fixing going on.  They think sports are genuine and are the most important thing in the world.  The top execs of the NFL have to  answer to companies who overpay millions for 30 second spots if veiwership is down and they don&#39;t get  their moneys worth.  Very simply, close games are fun for everyone, blowouts make people lose interest.  </p>

<p>1) the halftime show was a mass demonic ritual that (intentionally or not) raised some spirits of those who died/were dumped there during Katrina.   Maybe those spirits had something to do with it?  If it were mine, then I&#39;d have been pissed enough to fuck with half the lights, and I&#39;d pick 13:22 and come back on at 9:11(?)</p>

<p>2) an EMP directed at the power in from outside the stadium and those in the know could clean up on the bets.  &quot;&quot;Everything shut down,&quot; said Carl Trinchero, a 49ers fan from Napa, Calif., who was in the Superdome. &quot;No credit cards, vending machines shut down, everything shut down.&quot;&quot;   </p>

<p>3) EMP as threat/demonstration of power to coerce authority.  </p>

<p>4) the advertisers and TV felt that a 30 minute delay would be good for business</p>

<p>5) the power and backup just fucked up, on the most important night for the venue.  murphy&#39;s law.</p>

<p>I sat in my office all of Superbowl Sunday night waiting on calls for people to tell me their internet was down for whatever random reason and that I <strong>had</strong> to fix it right then, for they were streaming the game.</p>

When you pay top dollar for a superbowl commercial you are guaranteed a certain number a viewers and ratings.  So not only does the 35 minutes of mostly commercials promote ad revenue, but &quot;The power went out at the superbowl!&quot; is reason enough to turn your channel back to the game out of interest.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever been to a live game, you will see the players lined up waiting, waiting, waiting, for the ref to blow the whistle to start the clock - the ref is waiting to be told that they are back from commercial.</p>

<p>B) It was Israel. They caused the power outage to buy themselves more time to bomb Lebanon. Supposedly, they detonated an EMP bomb in Lebanon so more than likely, they did the same in New Orleans probably timed to go off at the same time so that the people of Lebanon will be confused when they&#39;re watching the Superbowl (Everyone loves NFL Football) and their power goes off too. (Just trying to tie together a couple of different conspiracy theories here on Reddit to make room for more Sandy Hook Theories)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Downvoted? Wow. There&#39;s a first time for everything I guess. So what was it? Because I said New Orleans still looks like shit? Seriously, there were skyscrapers with the windows still blown out and a section of downtown, under the freeway overpass, there were homeless people as far as the eye could see. Sleeping in tents, cardboard boxes or just passed out on the ground. I was at the Antrak Station and got off the train to smoke a cigarette and I was hit up for change, cigarettes, food 4 or 5 times in 15 minutes. This woman even asked to use my cel phone (as I was talking on it, she walked up and started talking to me and asked if she could use it when I got done. Wtf?)</p>

<p>And I guess whoever downvoted me missed the other post on this subreddit about Israel using the Superbowl as cover to bomb Lebanon. Like anyone in the Middle East watches American Football. They don&#39;t have to worry about Americans being distracted, no one here cares and the Government isn&#39;t going to go against Israel.</p>
