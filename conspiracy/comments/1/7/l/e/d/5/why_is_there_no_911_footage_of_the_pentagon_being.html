    <div class="md"><p>the wings are mostly aluminum, hollow and full of fuel, hitting a building at 600 MPH would vaporize them, since the pentagon was re-enforced concrete you can see why only the windows blew out at the wings (little mass of wings) while where the fuselage hit there was a hole, as most of the planes mass hit the center and blasted through.</p>

<p>Also, check the photographic record. The pre-collapse entry hole was 20 ft. In diameter at most. Rework your theory so a 757 fits through a hole that size. This is such tired old news as to hardly warrant the typing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its the hook to discredit conspiracy theorists. Lets say (just making up numbers) 20% think there was some sort of conspiracy. As of right now the other 80% could care less about the video they believe the official story. Now lets say years pass and now 80% believe in the conspiracy and demand to see the video, reasoning that the fact that it has not been fully released is suspicious. Now the government can release the full video of a plane hitting the Pentagon and in doing so make many believe the official story again and making conspiracy theorists look foolish by proving them wrong on that one case, they could make people believe that the whole conspiracy case was false. So basically it is a setup fail safe in case they need it, otherwise we will never see the full video.</p>

The idea is that there was a plane present but it flew just <em>over</em> the Pentagon while something else caused the explosion. Indeed two cops (among others) are giving quite clear testimonies about when and where they saw the plane come over while at a gasstation across from the Pentagon. It also touches on possible false evidence and staged foto-ops. Quite an interesting doc.</p>

<p>Since you are not, and they have all the videos from around the Pentagon and refuse to release them.......they would obviously NOT show a plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is that is hard to believe? The building was built in the 1940s. Guess what? It isn&#39;t like the movies. It is just an office building. It isn&#39;t some ultra modern space age control room with 2000 inch monitors like the movies have led you to believe. You are far more likely to be surrounded by puke green carpet that hasn&#39;t been updated since the 70s.</p>

<p>The number one reason why it didn&#39;t need a huge camera system is because there is a full time army in and around it. An army is really good at stopping things like car bombs and random lone nuts with guns. It is really bad at stopping planes. The Pentagon has a lot of people around it. They can afford it. Your local walmart has a lot of cameras because they don&#39;t want to pay a lot of people.</p>

<p>Every camera that truthers have pointed out has had their footage released. </p>

<p>I mean compare it to the first plane strike in New York. How many videos of that exist? TWO. The largest city in America and there was only two videos. (There was also a webcam that took photos of the skyline that captured it too)</p>

<p>There just isn&#39;t a whole lot of reason to point a camera at the sky on a boring tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Anyway, why do you discount the over 75 eywitnesses reported in the media as seeing a large plane? There was only 75 reported in the media, far more people witnessed the event then actually got a write up. How many of those people reported seeing a missile? None. Zero. Ziltch. Nada. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no good enough argument why the FBI would confiscate tapes from surrounding business&#39;s and keep them a national secret. Release the tapes after the investigation or include them and it would quell distrust. When there is little transparency you expect questions to arise, and they are legitimate questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any footage/evidence that proved the official story true would&#39;ve long been in the public domain.  It would be an easy way to shut all of &quot;these conspiracy people&quot; up in one fell swoop.  So where is it?  Wouldn&#39;t the Pentagon of all places be covered in surveillance equipment?  </p>

<p>Even if the official version is 100% true, they&#39;ve lost all credibility because of how they handled it.  (Lying about WMD&#39;s, torture, etc.)  Using one single event to wage war with a country that had NOTHING to do with it (Iraq) is as shady as it gets.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an assumption that could easily be proven.  The layout of the Pentagon is very precise; security is tight.  Someone--probably more than one person--knows how many cameras there were and exactly where they were placed.  Unless they were broken, there would be footage of a plane hitting the building.  It&#39;s a fucking plane flying at ground level and smashing into our country&#39;s military headquarters.  That something so unreal would happen at all is unlikely enough; that none of it was captured on camera is crazy talk.  </p>

<p>Even assuming there were NO security cams at the Pentagon (there were), it&#39;s likely that someone would&#39;ve captured a picture or video of a plane at the site.  (<em>That&#39;s</em> an assumption).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you back up the assertion that there <em>weren&#39;t</em>?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not fully aware of the Big Brother state we live in.  As we speak, the largest <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/">data center</a> in the history of the world is being constructed in the Utah desert.  It has one purpose: to decrypt and interpret the electronic communications of every citizen in every country, including the U.S.  Police are flying drone helicopters to spy on people in their own backyards; surveillance cams are on every corner and at every stop light.  Do you honestly believe there were no working cameras at the nation&#39;s military headquarters on 9/11?  </p>

<p>If there weren&#39;t, it would be the biggest security fail in the last 100 years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my two cents, because I know everyone was wondering what I thought. I used to really harp on the plane/pentagon mystery but have recently come to the conclusion that it doesn&#39;t really matter. Either a plane hit, and they let it. Or they made it look like a plane hit and blew it up some other way. </p>

<p>All you really need to put two and two together is that there is something fishy going on when a freaking plane hits the most secure building in the world on a day when we should be on high alert because of the planes in New York. </p>

<p>Either way, missile, plane, bomb - to quote Jay Sherman - &quot;It Stinks!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been wondering about the security footage as well.  I am unsure about the frame rate at which it was recording, however my guess is 1 fps.  According to official reports the plane was traveling at 530 mph when it struck the Pentagon.  This comes out to 777 feet per second. The plane is 155 feet long so theoretically we might not see it pass through the frame.  But I would like to think that something so massive would cause some motion blur in the image, or as it encounters resistance it would slow down and we&#39;d then perhaps see the tail of the plane going in to the Pentagon. Anyone have thoughts on this?</p>
