       Ok, I'll bite.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is stupid, like really really stupid, in fact I cant tell if you're a troll or not, but i'll just assume you aren't and continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       First:
       <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html">
        http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice at a mere 500c structural steel loses 80% of it's strength, the steel does not have to melt to cause a failure in the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second jet engines are NOT made of steel, they are made of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalloy">
        superalloys
       </a>
       which are specifically designed to have extreme high heat strength. Many super alloys retain 100% of their yield strength at 1000c, twice the temperature where our structural steel was reduced to the yield strength of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength">
        PLASTIC
       </a>
       (quite literally, look at 20% of structral steels yield strength, it matches perfectly with nylon/polyester)
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, turbine blades now days typically have internal
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine_blade#Cooling">
        cooling passages
       </a>
       through which cooling air is passed in order to allow the engine to operate at higher temperatures than even super alloys are capable of unassisted.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR This is dumb, Steel loses enough strength to fail at low temperatures, No jet engines are not made of steel as the temperatures they run at would outright melt steel.

       The turbine blades are made out of Nickel are they not?  If i remember correctly they are made of nickel because it can maintain its structural strength under the extreme heat.

       The melting point of the steel used in the WTC had a melting point of ~1400°C and 1540°C. The melting point of nickel is ~1,455°C. Why would the steel used in the WTC literally crumble to dust?

       I said nickel in haste... The turbines are actually a Nickel-Titanium-Aluminum Alloy. The other portions of the Jet engine that undergo extreme heat and stress are also Alloys designed for extreme heat and have special coatings to make them even more resilient.

       wut?  what does that have to do with jet engines being made of steel?  I'm not claiming jet fuel brought down the towers... I'm trying to stop someone from discrediting themselves with an argument that isn't valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nickel Alloys don't begin to weaken until they are almost to their melting temp. Steel weakens significantly before it gets to its melting temp. Yes, a jet engine made of steel would fail... that is why they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are better arguments to be made about 911 being fuckery then the argument OP is trying to make.

       Your logic is pretty flawed. In the case of an engine we are talking about a smallish appropriately sized and controlled combustion of fuel, which is what the engine was designed to do. In the wtc.we are talking about structural steel, not designed for combustion with a very large uncontrolled blaze. Very different.  Essentially those steel girders acted like wicks for the jet fuel, they were coated which caused them to heat very quickly and weaken. They don't have to reach melting point, they just had to weaken sufficiently for the 1000s of tons they supported to be too much for them.

       That's what I was thinking of then.  Were there some thermal images of that as well?  Let's look for some of the videos and images of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear a lot more from the argument that the fires didn't melt the steel but weakened it.  If this is true, then we might have other examples of steel frame buildings falling like this (the bad news is we don't have examples of other buildings who also got hit by a plane).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, even if it was weakened and fell, we still have to contend with the fact there was indeed molten metals on the site.  Where did those come from in this case?  Seems we need some intense heat from that...something which office supplies and jet fuel just don't seem capable of?

       Just a question, not being facetious: if the surface temperatures around these areas were in to the 1000s, how did search and rescue missions take place? I'd think anyone nearby would have been incinerated. I'd buy that the internal temperatures of these fire zones may have been that hot, but it doesn't make sense to me that the surface was as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, to add to that, I would think the adjacent areas would have been much hotter than the pictures show. Those areas are relatively small to be as hot as the image claims, what about residual heat?

       I'm not sure what you are trying to say or what point you're arguing.  Are you making the point that eyewitness testimony is worthless?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some thermal images of the rubble that show the temperatures as well of videos of what is most likely liquid metal dripping out of the towers before they fell.  However, what exactly is melting in those videos is of course up for debate.

      <p>
       Yes.  In fact, I consider eyewitness testimony to be more than worthless. It's too unreliable to be evidence toward reality, but people tend to believe it readily and strongly.  That can make them distrust better, more reliable forms of evidence that disprove the incorrect eyewitness testimony.

       Thanks for clarifying man, I get where you're coming from now.

      <p>
       Yeah, I don't think eyewitness testimony should be used
       <em>
        by itself
       </em>
       to come to a conclusion.  But I think it can be useful, maybe to guide the line of questioning and find some solid evidence.  Especially if a lot of people are saying the same thing.  But yeah, it should cause a deeper look, a direction, instead of just concluding it at that.

      <p>
       It can certainly be useful to add some consensus to actual evidence.  However, eyewitness testimony in and of itself should not be considered evidence.  It should not even be used as a guide about where to look for real evidence, because it is just as likely (if not more so) to get you looking in the wrong direction than in the right one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       not evidence when it is what someone claims to have seen as they're running out of the fucking World Trade Center before it comes crashing on top of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People trusting this type of false evidence is a major problem in the criminal justice system, and what leads to most false convictions.

       The building pulverized AND fell at near free fall speeds. The FORCE needed to pulverize would have had to encounter resistance in order to pulverize. No resistance = no pulverizing. BUT the resistance required to pulverize would have required more time... resistance = delayed fall time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The towers could not have pulverized as they fell AND fell at near free fall speeds.

       Not many steel supported buildings have planes fly into them, which sets them into an uncontrolled blaze. That was a huge fire. Large Fires in giant sky scrapers like that are very rare, so there isn't much to compare it to. I did a search and all i can find are very small fires in large building s or very large fires in small buildings. Other than the wtc.

       This is categorically untrue. Compared to to the 20 hour inferno at the Hotel Windsor in Madrid, the WT fires were like brief flares.

       Despite the very top of the Windsor tower crumbling, the integrity of the steel core was not affected.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the planes affecting the structure of the towers, there is zero evidence for this. Those planes, (at circa 100-150 tonnes) represented 0.02% of the mass of either of the twin towers (at 500,000 tonnes).

       The blades of the jet that are in the hottest part are grown from a single metallic crystal, have internal cooling, and are strong enough to suspend a double-decker bus from a single unit. Because of this they operate in an environment that is higher than their melting point and they do so safely. I have spoken to a (rightly proud) Rolls Royce engine engineer on this subject.

       The steel in the WTC was not vacuum-grown crystalline steel that was fitted with an active cooling system so, naturally, it softened enough to disrupt the overall structural integrity of the building and gravity took care of the rest.

       All the fires had to do was weaken one spot of the steel enough that the thousands of pounds above it cause the steel to buckle.  Which would cause friction and further heat the steel, a chain reaction.

       At a little over 800 degrees steel reaches its critical temperature (The temperature at which it can no longer support a significant load) At this temperature it is at 60% strength. Jet fuel burns at 980 degrees. Structural steel at 980 degrees is at roughly 45% strength. Sure it is not hot enough to melt steel but it does not have to be. Also take into consideration that the steel was likely deformed from the massive impact weakening it further. I know I am basically talking to a brick wall here, but please consider what I said and look over this graph.

       This information I have provided is not disinfo. It is not lies perpetrated by some conspiracy. These are facts that structural engineers have been using for decades. If you don't believe what I have just told you then you shouldn't trust any building or structural engineer because these are standards that everyone uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. I am not denying a conspiracy here. There is a lot of fishy shit in the official story, but those planes could have feasibly taken down the towers. When you focus on things like this, you are only helping keep the important questions out of everyone's mind.

       How do we know there was "rivers" of molten stuff? The only thing I can find is eye witness testimony and if this is the only source there no way to tell if these people seen actual molten rivers of metal or something else like fire that happened to look like molten metal from their perspective. Anyways when you say that would not be enough, how do you know?  There would of been multiple sources of low grade metals other then office furniture. All the conduit pipes for the wiring, all the framing inside the interior walls ( in large commercial building they use thin metal studs to hang drywall and other wall materials on)  etc.

       So you're telling me that the explosion was able to melt all the metal conduits, writing, framing and other miscellaneous metal objects, but not incinerate the people that were on that level at the time (there are photos of people standing where the hole the plane created)? If we can sentence people to death based on witness testimony, why would witness testimony suddenly be invalid when they say they saw rivers of molten steel?

 it is very rare for someone to get the death penalty based solely on eyewitness accounts.

       As stated above eyewitness testimony is the lowest form of evidence, and given the situation these people were in and their probable emotion state it is not far fetched to come to the conclusion that these people were mistaken given the lack of any other evidence to back there claims.

       Commercial jet fuel is made of specially treated kerosene. It is given additives that protect it from ignition by unintended sources, such as static electricity, extreme cold and trace metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flash Point
A compound's flash point is the temperature required for it to produce the vapors needed for ignition. Commercial jet fuel has a relatively high flash point of 100 degrees F, allowing for safe handling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto-Ignition Temperature
After the jet fuel reaches its flash point, it must then be heated to its auto-ignition temperature, where it will automatically combust without the need of an outside ignition source. The auto-ignition temperature of jet fuel is 410 degrees F.
      </p>

       How do blacksmiths bend metal without breaking it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer to that question may literally blow your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Just to add a video, watch how easy the heated iron/steel rod bends because it's heated, and notice how it bends where it's weakest, e.g. where it's been heated.

       Not melt, but it would weaken the steel. Steel weakens under heat far below it's melting point.

       This is very typical of the truther mindset.  Take a simple argument, that only make sense when you make several incorrect assumptions, then take it as 100% proof of your existing beliefs.   Finally, repeat it over and over again on the internet until you've convinced enough equally ignorant people of your beliefs.

       meh, its just that the pattern matching quality in those brains runs in overdrive and autocorrects details that do not fit. This happens to religious people too. In the end, all input is straight, language decides on ontological qualities and output is black and white. Steel is hard, ergo it can't just bend. This kind of problem caused by bad discussion skills is viral today.

       It doesn't melt steel. Nobody ever said it can melt steel. That would be mad. Steel does, however, become exponentially weaker when hot.

       This is wrong - the reduction in strength is logarithmic.  To be accurate, as the temperature rises exponentially, the strength would decrease linearly.

       Actually the official story was initially that the steel did melt.  There is ample evidence of this.
       <strong>
        So what did melt the steel?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/02/nyregion/search-for-clues-towers-collapse-engineers-volunteer-examine-steel-debris-taken.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;src=pm">
        Another crumpled steel member set aside at a Keasbey, N.J., scrapyard has markings clearly showing that it ran on the east face of the north tower from the 92nd to the 95th floor, in the center of one impact zone. Pieces of steel have also been found that were apparently melted and vaporized not solely because of the heat of fires, but also because of a corrosive contaminant that was somehow released in the conflagrations. And unexpectedly cracked washers in crucial connections in the towers are being closely scrutinized.

       Um, no.  The official story was initially that the steel melted.  It was only after people started pointing out that jet fuel can't melt steel that the official story changed.  The reason the official story was initially that the steel melted is because it did.  See evidence above.

       Why the fuck did you ask for the evidence of molten steel since you already admitted its presence?  Its you going in circles - but bottom line is you admit there was molten steel so don't ask for evidence again mmkay.  Anyways, what exactly do you think this corrosive contaminant was?  You make it sound like it is perfectly natural that there was something in an office building that could melt steel.  So what was this mystery substance?

      <p>
       I've read it several times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there sufficient sulphur in the gypsum wall board to help cause such a reaction?
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has ever once demonstrated even under controlled conditions that gypsum from wall board can magically form with other office materials to form a eutectic mixture.  In fact, the originator of this hypothesis, Dr. Greening, has since admitted that the hypothesis is not possible:
       <br/>
       "I am prepared to admit that my initial proposal as to how steel was sulfided during the 911 events needs to be modified. Certainly it looks like diesel fuel, gypsum, concrete and aluminum alone are not going to do it ....."
-Dr. Frank Greening
      </p>
      <p>
       So really what we have in simplest terms is something that was added to the steel which made it melt, and at the same time there are no good hypotheses about how this could have come about from normal office materials.  So again, what is this mysterious corrosive substance?
      </p>
      <p>
       So far we've ruled out:
1.  Sulphur
2.  Normal office materials

        Well no neither hypothesis of gypsum or PVC has been conclusively proven or dis-proven but both hypothesis are rooted in real science ie: sulphur/chlorine can be part of an eutectic reaction.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The hypothesis is that normal materials found in an office can form a eutectic mixture.  This has never been demonstrated which means there is no evidence this can actually occur.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The eutectic reaction has still been proven through metallurgy regardless of what material caused it.

       Yes, but your claim is that it came from ordinary office materials.  This claim is completely unsupported.  In other words you can't account for where the eutectic came from.

       Bottom line:  unless you can provide a shred of evidence to support your hypothesis you have nothing.  Either produce it or shut your little bitch mouth.

       Remember high school physics class, specifically newton's laws and potential energy?  Well, when the buildings fell, a massive fucking amount of mass crashed into the ground at high speed.  That energy can't just disappear - it has to go somewhere.  In this case, most of it, about 600 GJ (equivalent to about 250 tons of TNT), was converted to heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is definitely enough to melt a sizable amount of steel.

       I have often wondered why it is that they don't implode buildings these days by simply putting office furniture on one floor, pouring a little jet fuel on the furniture, igniting it and just letting the whole building collapse on itself with near perfection.  I mean - who needs timed explosions everywhere?

       The towers were hit at the top, so I don't understand how the tip of the buildings weight caused the entire structure to free fall.  wouldnt the 50 or so floors beneath the damaged area, have been able to support the weight of the damaged floor above?

       My god. That's one of the most ludicrous thought experiments I've ever read. A building gets its stability from its foundation and by extension the earth. It's therefore nonsensical to imagine a building being thrown into a plane.

       You can't throw a building into a 757 for a start, that's a stupid analogy. Plus, you get expect things to work if you switch them around. If you throw a brick into a stack of cards the cards will collapse, it doesn't work the other way around. Your point is totally irrelevant and if that's your idea of evidence then you may as well Gove the fuck up.

       Not many steel supported buildings have planes fly into them, which sets them into an uncontrolled blaze. That was a huge fire. Large Fires in giant sky scrapers like that are very rare, so there isn't much to compare it to. I did a search and all i can find are very small fires in large building s or very large fires in small buildings. Other than the wtc.

       If you want to point out unsubstatiated psuedo science claims, point right back at the op. While there are facts there, the physics and chemistry of the situation are not taken into account which are very important.

      <p>
       It can certainly be useful to add some consensus to actual evidence.  However, eyewitness testimony in and of itself should not be considered evidence.  It should not even be used as a guide about where to look for real evidence, because it is just as likely (if not more so) to get you looking in the wrong direction than in the right one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       not evidence when it is what someone claims to have seen as they're running out of the fucking World Trade Center before it comes crashing on top of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People trusting this type of false evidence is a major problem in the criminal justice system, and what leads to most false convictions.

       Not melt, but it would weaken the steel. Steel weakens under heat far below it's melting point.

       How do blacksmiths bend metal without breaking it?

      <p>
       The answer to that question may literally blow your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Just to add a video, watch how easy the heated iron/steel rod bends because it's heated, and notice how it bends where it's weakest, e.g. where it's been heated.
