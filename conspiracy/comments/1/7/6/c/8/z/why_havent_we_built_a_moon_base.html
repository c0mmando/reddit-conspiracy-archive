       If we landed on the moon in 1969 and 5 more times in the 70's, why did we decide not to build a base there? How come Russia never went to the moon and/or build a moon base? The Russians definitely had plans to send their Cosmonauts to the moon. Invested time, money and resources. Why did they just scrap their plans? Whether you believe that we actually landed on the moon or not, it doesn't make sense to me that we are talking about going to Mars and building a base there. It seems like we should build a moon base before we move on to Mars. Both the US and Russia have over 20 years of experience with Space Stations and keeping men alive for extended stays in outer space. I seem to remember some General saying how important it is for America to have the high ground by building a base on the moon. It would be the ultimate military advantage. (which now that we have advanced hunter/killer satellites and other "Star Wars" platforms (lasers, rods from god, HAARP, etc.) maybe we don't need the moon for military purposes) But there are still significant scientific benefits as well as mining resources such as platinum, uranium, plutonium and thorium. It seems like not only could we bring the materials to build the base from Earth but with advances in 3D Printers, maybe we could use resources found on the moon to construct the base.

       The Moon is the closest large body in the solar system to Earth. While some Earth-crosser asteroids occasionally pass closer, the Moon's distance is consistently within a small range close to 384,400 km. This proximity has several benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         A lunar base could be a site for launching rockets with locally-manufactured fuel to distant planets such as Mars. Launching rockets from the Moon would be easier than from Earth because the Moon's gravity is lower, requiring a lower escape velocity. A lower escape velocity would require less propellant, but there is no guarantee that less propellant would cost less money than that required to launch from Earth.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The energy required to send objects from Earth to the Moon is lower than for most other bodies.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

         Transit time is short. The Apollo astronauts made the trip in three days and future technologies could improve on this time.
The short transit time would also allow emergency supplies to quickly reach a Moon colony from Earth, or allow a human crew to evacuate relatively quickly from the Moon to Earth in case of emergency. This could be an important consideration when establishing the first human colony.

         Wikiversity has learning materials about Lunar Boom Town
If the Moon were colonized then it could be tested if humans can survive in low gravity. Those results could be utilized for a viable Mars colony as well.

         The round trip communication delay to Earth is less than three seconds, allowing near-normal voice and video conversation, and allowing some kinds of remote control of machines from Earth that are not possible for any other celestial body. The delay for other solar system bodies is minutes or hours; for example, round trip communication time between Earth and Mars ranges from about eight minutes to about forty minutes. This again would be of particular value in an early colony, where life-threatening problems requiring Earth's assistance could occur.

         On the Lunar near side, the Earth appears large and is always visible as an object 60 times brighter than the Moon appears from Earth, unlike more distant locations where the Earth would be seen merely as a star-like object, much as the planets appear from Earth. As a result, a Lunar colony might feel less remote to humans living there.

         A Lunar base would provide an excellent site for any kind of observatory.[4] In the near-vacuum of the Moon's atmosphere, there is practically no atmospheric diffraction. Observations could be made continuously, provided that during the lunar day an optical telescope would be shaded from the Sun and from surrounding glare, and that it would not be pointed too close to the Sun or to the horizon. It would be possible to maintain constant observations on a specific target with a few such observatories at different longitudes. The Moon's geological inactivity and its infrastructural remoteness bring about an unusual mechanical calmness, which would be advantageous particularly regarding the erection of interferometric telescopes, even at relatively high frequencies such as visible light.[40] NASA scientists have done developmental work toward manufacturing telescope mirrors using lunar material.[41] Building observatory facilities on the Moon from lunar materials allows many of the benefits of space based facilities without the need to launch these into space.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A farm at the Lunar North Pole could provide eight hours of sunlight per day during the local summer by rotating crops in and out of the sunlight which is continuous for the entire summer. A beneficial temperature, radiation protection, insects for pollination, and all other plant needs could be artificially provided during the local summer for a cost. One estimate suggested a 0.5 hectare space farm could feed 100 people.[42]

       There are several disadvantages to the Moon as a colony site:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The long lunar night would impede reliance on solar power and require a colony to be designed that could withstand large temperature extremes. An exception to this restriction are the so-called "peaks of eternal light" located at the Lunar north pole that are constantly bathed in sunlight. The rim of Shackleton Crater, towards the Lunar south pole, also has a near-constant solar illumination. Other areas near the poles that get light most of the time could be linked in a power grid.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Moon is highly depleted in volatile elements, such as nitrogen and hydrogen. Carbon, which forms volatile oxides, is also depleted. A number of robot probes including Lunar Prospector gathered evidence of hydrogen generally in the Moon's crust consistent with what would be expected from solar wind, and higher concentrations near the poles.[43] There had been some disagreement whether the hydrogen must necessarily be in the form of water. The mission of the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) proved in 2009 that there is water on the Moon.[44] This water exists in ice form perhaps mixed in small crystals in the regolith in a colder landscape than people have ever mined. Other volatiles containing carbon and nitrogen were found in the same cold trap as ice.[45] If no sufficient means is found for recovering these volatiles on the Moon, they would need to be imported from some other source to support life and industrial processes. Volatiles would need to be stringently recycled. This would limit the colony's rate of growth and keep it dependent on imports. The transportation cost of importing volatiles from Earth could be reduced by constructing the upper stage of supply ships using materials high in volatiles, such as carbon fiber and plastics. The 2006 announcement by the Keck Observatory that the binary Trojan asteroid 617 Patroclus,[46] and possibly large numbers of other Trojan objects in Jupiter's orbit, are likely composed of water ice, with a layer of dust, and the hypothesized large amounts of water ice on the closer, main-belt asteroid 1 Ceres, suggest that importing volatiles from this region via the Interplanetary Transport Network may be practical in the not-so-distant future. However, these possibilities are dependent on complicated and expensive resource utilization from the mid to outer solar system, which is not likely to become available to a Moon colony for a significant period of time.

         It is uncertain whether the low (one-sixth g) gravity on the Moon is strong enough to prevent detrimental effects to human health in the long term. Exposure to weightlessness over month-long periods has been demonstrated to cause deterioration of physiological systems, such as loss of bone and muscle mass and a depressed immune system. Similar effects could occur in a low-gravity environment, although virtually all research into the health effects of low gravity has been limited to zero gravity.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The lack of an atmosphere increases the chances of the colony being hit by meteor. Even small pebbles and dust (micrometeoroids) have the potential to damage or destroy insufficiently protected structures.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Moon dust is an extremely abrasive glassy substance formed by micrometeorites and unrounded due to the lack of weathering. It sticks to everything and can damage equipment, and it may be toxic.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Growing crops on the Moon faces many difficult challenges due to the long lunar night (354 hours), extreme variation in surface temperature, exposure to solar flares, nitrogen-poor soil, and lack of insects for pollination. Due to the lack of any atmosphere on the Moon, plants would need to be grown in sealed chambers, though experiments have shown that plants can thrive at pressures much lower than those on Earth.[50] The use of electric lighting to compensate for the 354-hour night might be difficult: a single acre of plants on Earth enjoys a peak 4 megawatts of sunlight power at noon. Experiments conducted by the Soviet space program in the 1970s suggest it is possible to grow conventional crops with the 354-hour light, 354-hour dark cycle.[51] A variety of concepts for lunar agriculture have been proposed,[52] including the use of minimal artificial light to maintain plants during the night and the use of fast growing crops that might be started as seedlings with artificial light and be harvestable at the end of one Lunar day.

         One of the less obvious difficulties lies not with the Moon itself but rather with the political and national interests of the nations engaged in colonization. Assuming that colonization efforts were able to overcome the difficulties outlined above – there would likely be issues regarding the rights of nations and their colonies to exploit resources on the lunar surface, to stake territorial claims and other issues of sovereignty which would have to be agreed upon before one or more nations established a permanent presence on the moon. The ongoing negotiations and debate regarding the Antarctic is a good case study for prospective lunar colonization efforts in that it highlights the numerous pitfalls of developing/inhabiting a location that is subject to the claims of more than one sovereign nation.

       The surface of the moon is a vacuum, and in the shade is extremely cold. This should enable practical superconduction, which might be used to transmit solar energy from the far side of the moon to the near side during the long lunar nights on the near side. Solar energy is the obvious energy source -- there are no clouds, no atmosphere to veil the sunlight, and the lunar day is a couple of weeks long. All that is needed is a way to conduct solar power around the moon from whatever side the sun is shining on. And remember, the moon is a lot smaller than the Earth.

       Soviets stopped work on the moon stuff because the only reason the space race happened was because it was a pissing contest about who has the more advanced technology, USSR, or USA.  Reason we don't have a moonbase, is because: 1.)NASA is underfunded 2.) Advanced Research on moon colonization has not happened because money hasn't been put into it.3.) The USA is in over 17 trillion in debt. Spending money into Research and development of a moon base would send the debt plunging even more, and probably causing another depression.

       I also believe that a reason we would rather build on mars than on the moon is due to gravity, the possiblity of geothermal energy sources, water, and the partial atmosphere provided by mars. Mars has more available resources that could be used in such an endeavor. There is nothing on the moon. Also Mars has more gravity so construction and living would be easier. There are lots of practical reasons to make Mars the goal for a base and not the moon.

       1.)NASA is underfunded
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA hasn't always been underfunded. I mean it's been 40+ years since Apollo and they could easily put together a public+private venture.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Advanced Research on moon colonization has not happened because money hasn't been put into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure money has been put towards this research. At one point, they had a plan to build bases. Here's a few of them

      </p>
      <p>
       The percentage of the budget that NASA receives is pretty nominal and has continued to fall pretty much every year.

       </a>
       . Like I said with number 1., a case could be made for a public/private venture to offset the cost and if a functioning moon base could be set up, perhaps through mining or selling space to Universities or other interested parties, we could further offset the cost. Through mining, perhaps money could be made.

       Mining and space privitization is happening.(a space mining company was founded recently, plans are being made, and search up SpaceX.) Reason it wasn't done before is because we didn't have the needed tech. And, another reason why it hasn't been put into full gear, is because its a venture into the unknown. Nobody likes to step foot in the unknown, until the few brave ones do, than everyone follows.

       I'm well aware of SpaceX. They're a client of a company that I used to work for called 2Advanced. They designed and hosted their website. I was the marketing Director at the time and met with Elon and his team at their offices down in Hawthorne. It was pretty cool touring the facility and meeting with actually rocket scientists. I'm a big fan of Elon.

       They don't tell us everything, obviously...so who is to say they don't already have a base?

       Who is to say there wasn't a civilization already on Mars hundreds of thousands of years ago? Only going by what appear to be remnants of pyramids on Mars for that question btw..

       I attempted to ask one of the researches at JPL at their open house and his reply was "no comment"

      <p>
       I think possibly the only reason NASA wants to skip ahead to Mars instead of the moon is because they know more than they are telling us.

       Well, for a while now, you hear about tidbits from insiders that used to work in NASA about what really goes on, but of course those people are never heard from again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have people in my life that have had their relatives speak to us about what went on back in the 60-80s era. Pretty deep stuff I have been told that they have witnessed or had their friends tell them what they saw back in the day. I know that isn't very reliable but still, these are people that I trust.

       Yes well that's the other theory which I am equally invested in.
      </p>
      <p>
       A) We never went to the moon. It was all a hoax. Although I'm listening to the Joe Rogan Experience right now and Neil DeGrasse Tyson is on and he's explaining how impossible it would be to fake the moon missions. Something about the way this man explains things gives me confidence. He already talked me off the ledge regarding the Mayan 2012 Doomsday.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Which I am now going to have to go with. We found aliens on the moon. Numerous witnesses have stated that NASA airbrushes out UFOs, Artificial Structures and Alien Bases from the Moon Photos. Scientists and Astronomers have been keeping a record of "moon anomalies" since the 1800s. Supposedly we landed on the moon and the Aliens did us Superman II Style, letting us know that something very bad could happen to our astronauts if we continue to send them to the moon. Blast a hole in the side of the LEM with their Ray Guns or even throw a rock at the thing and we're toast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, and then there's Theory C) which kind of goes along with B) and that is that the Moon itself is a Death Star in disguise. The Aliens put the moon in orbit around Earth Billions of Years ago so they could keep an eye on us.

       I don't watch the MSM. I can also joke about it because I'm on a subreddit, not broadcasting to the population at large. If given a chance, I would produce a show that took the subject matter seriously. No X-Files theme music, No narrater with a spooky voice, no hyped up bullshit like Chasing UFOs, No trying to tie Einstein in to "Ancient Astronaut Theorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       If my statement said anything, it was a slight against humanity. I do believe that they are watching us, including our television programming and considering the vast majority of what we watch is garbage reality programming (including most of the UFO/Paranormal Shows), Spongebob is atleast positive.

       didn't get that you were being sarcastic with that initial statement.  In one sense, I feel I should apologize, but in another sense, you have to realize that sarcasm isn't really very easy to inflect via the written text.  Next time, put a "/s" by what you type to let me (or whoever) know you were being sarcastic.

       One of the less obvious difficulties lies not with the Moon itself but rather with the political and national interests of the nations engaged in colonization. Assuming that colonization efforts were able to overcome the difficulties outlined above – there would likely be issues regarding the rights of nations and their colonies to exploit resources on the lunar surface, to stake territorial claims and other issues of sovereignty which would have to be agreed upon before one or more nations established a permanent presence on the moon. The ongoing negotiations and debate regarding the Antarctic is a good case study for prospective lunar colonization efforts in that it highlights the numerous pitfalls of developing/inhabiting a location that is subject to the claims of more than one sovereign nation.

       hmmm.. not bad, not bad at all. Would still be expensive as shit. the current projection is that moon based mining shenanigans wont be economically doable till about 2060 or so

       Uh, for one, the Russians stopped because they didn't care anymore. The N1 rocket blew up four times in a row, and they were sick of paying for it.

       Two, NASA IS planning on going to the moon before Mars. Can't you google?
      </p>
      <p>
       Three, we haven't gone back to the moon yet because it's both extremely expensive and extremely pointless for the time being. Why bother going to the moon? Mining is cheaper here on earth than on the moon. Just think about it for a second. It would only really be a waste of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool as the Apollo missions were, there is no reason to go back except for testing and preparations for a later Mars mission, which is being planned.

       Until the relatively recent discovery of ice on the moon one of the biggest obstacles was the lack of water - it would cost far too much money to lug water (which is very heavy) from earth in sufficient quantities to do anything of value.

       Didn't you watch Moonraker, it was a disaster.  Seriously, as an avid skywatcher I too wonder why we never populated the moon.  As a boy I believed a moon base would be a great platform to launch a Mars mission.  The moon could serve as the "base of operations" for all future missions to the galaxy.  Too bad we are to busy killing each other across the globe instead of exporing the heavens.

       Moonraker didn't go to the Moon, It was a Space Station. I did watch Space 1999 though an they had a Moon Base. 1999 came and went. No Moon Base. No Shape Changing Chick with hairy eyebrows either. Moonraker was a disaster because of that meddling James Bond and that traitor Jaws.

       Because it proved to be too difficult and expensive.  The Space Shuttle and Space Station were supposed to be part of a system that would eventually include a lunar base.  The Space Shuttle wore out by the time the Space Station was built and it was all way more expensive and impractical than anyone thought it would be.  By then, there was no money, commitment, or resolve to build a moon base.

       If you're just asking "why Mars and not the moon," the answer is simple.  Mars is large enough to hold an atmosphere.  Temperatures are not quite as extreme.  There is a reasonable chance that we can eventually terraform Mars.

       Mars is not large enough to hold a significant atmosphere.  Temperatures there are quite extreme.  Terraforming Mars is a fantasy not based in reality.  That was not even the OP's question.

       Well that's your answer, isn't it? We didn't build a base on the moon because we lack the (public) capability to get there.

       But with current NASA tech (and/or Russian/Chinese tech) that's been declared to the public, there's no way to get there. Hence, no moon base.
