<p>Same vein as night vision, better bulletproof material, silent helicopter blades, and other tools that aid whatever troops do to reduce the number of casualties. </p>

<p>Can we really expect them to use robots to disarm bombs but not to fly? What&#39;s the difference between a NORAD F15 patrolling the west coast with the capability of dropping a bom or a drone?</p>

<p>I understand the risk facing pilots who are removed from the literal face and threat of battle, but hasn&#39;t that been the same mentality of every advancement in battlefield technology?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about that to say. But I will say that with such technology, the killing being done overseas becomes ten times more trivial. </p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, those fellas look like terrorists.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take them out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shit, look at those first responders coming.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kill them too.&quot;</p>

<p>^ Our current usage of drones.</p>

<p>Honestly, think about how trivial the wars overseas, in general, has been to most americans since we&#39;ve been there. How much does it affect my daily life? None. What about yours? I&#39;d wager nothing changed as well. Why is that? Because it&#39;s an undeclared war, nobody knows why we&#39;re there because there&#39;s not good enough reason to be there for over a decade.</p>

<p>War is trivial now. Imagine living in the 40s when our nation was at war, imagine what that felt like, how peoples mindset would change, what it would be like to really have an enemy worth losing thousands of lives over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Added a lot to my post if you haven&#39;t refreshed your page by the way. </p>

<p>The difference would be that it adds potential risk, possibly an additional cost of human life, and it would take greater investment as a military force to put themselves in that position. </p>

<p>Drones, as being used now, are a tool of endless war. What does it really cost to have that killing done? The military risks no life when tasked with using a drone. So it means nothing to them to have this killing be done. There&#39;s no incentive for change at any time if they can just kill at whim, non-nonchalantly. </p>

<p>What if we had a real threat to our country and our congress declared war? Everything would be different. Drones would serve their purpose and be wonderful tools of war at least possible cost of human life. But as our current circumstances go, they&#39;re nothing but tools for endless war (10+ years and going strong).</p>

<p>See...I hear this, but it could be the same case for using robots to disarm bombs. You could just as well argue that we should use humans to disarm them at all times. </p>

<p>I agree with you that drones remove the human component of direct accountability, but they do the same as every other piece of technology when it comes to minimizing risk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. There&#39;s a fine line between killing somebody with a robot and using a different robot to save one. A drone would be a tool of aggression, a bomb disarming robot is not. Like I said, the problem is how and why they&#39;re being used. Currently they&#39;re nothing more than a tool for never ending war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I should have maybe worded my first sentence differently. 
However I personally feel it is wrong to just send machines in to do the job. We could roll over smaller countries and people here wouldn&#39;t care because their loved ones were safely in a bunker somewhere. This makes war seem less devastating than it really is and only serves to distance people from the death and violence we have brought upon other countries and makes it more... acceptable?</p>

<p>Edit: And although not fully autonomous there will be a day when they are. There will also be a day we send fully functioning cyborgs out to do the dirty work for us. Then what? Will this help curb war or will war increase because humans are no longer on the front lines being killed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Vietnam war was televised. While watching our own people get killed on a regular basis it made the public aware of how terrible war is and made them want to put an end to it. By using autonomous machines it&#39;ll just be easier  to get the public to agree with going to a war whether it is necessary or not. I&#39;m not saying we shouldn&#39;t use the technology available to us, especially when it comes to protection, but we shouldn&#39;t be removing the human factor as much as we have and will continue to do. Again, I just see it as unethical. When you can take a life while sitting safely in front of a computer screen, that is just wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know the missiles the drones carry are the same as whatever our fighter jets and helicopters have. The only controversy is where and who those missiles are being fired at. If tomorrow a story comes out that an Apache helicopter killed a suspected terrorist and 5 innocent bystanders in Turkey, no one will care that it was a helicopter. They will care that we are in Turkey for some reason and that innocent people died. Like maxp0wah said, undeclared, unconstitutional wars and killing people not convicted of a crime is the problem. It just so happens that drones are doing a lot of that controversial killing.</p>

<p>I think some people get upset because maybe it seems like well technically we&#39;re not at war with anyone because it was a drone. Drones aren&#39;t constrained by laws or borders because the person isn&#39;t actually there crossing the border in it. Like if we used a laser on a satellite to kill people. It <em>seems</em> okay on the news or in the paper because the blood isn&#39;t physically on our hands.</p>

<p>From a tactical and technological standpoint I think drones are great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only possible opposition I have would be if, sometime in the future, we make drones for carrying our troops. I just wouldn&#39;t want to trust my life to an RC car. But for any other role, like attack, patrolling, and surveillance, they are great.</p>

<p>If we were at war with a real country, with an airforce and anti aircraft capabilities, I would never think our pilots were somehow less brave, or less noble, by using drones. There is no real, measurable, reward to seeing your enemy face to face. The real reward to avoiding direct fighting is the lives that it saves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Added a lot to my post if you haven&#39;t refreshed your page by the way. </p>

<p>The difference would be that it adds potential risk, possibly an additional cost of human life, and it would take greater investment as a military force to put themselves in that position. </p>

<p>Drones, as being used now, are a tool of endless war. What does it really cost to have that killing done? The military risks no life when tasked with using a drone. So it means nothing to them to have this killing be done. There&#39;s no incentive for change at any time if they can just kill at whim, non-nonchalantly. </p>

<p>What if we had a real threat to our country and our congress declared war? Everything would be different. Drones would serve their purpose and be wonderful tools of war at least possible cost of human life. But as our current circumstances go, they&#39;re nothing but tools for endless war (10+ years and going strong).</p>
