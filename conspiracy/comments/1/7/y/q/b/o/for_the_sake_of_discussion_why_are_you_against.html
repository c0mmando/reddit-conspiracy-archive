       I can't help but see drones as the natural extension of battlefield surveillance and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same vein as night vision, better bulletproof material, silent helicopter blades, and other tools that aid whatever troops do to reduce the number of casualties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we really expect them to use robots to disarm bombs but not to fly? What's the difference between a NORAD F15 patrolling the west coast with the capability of dropping a bom or a drone?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the risk facing pilots who are removed from the literal face and threat of battle, but hasn't that been the same mentality of every advancement in battlefield technology?

       I don't know enough about that to say. But I will say that with such technology, the killing being done overseas becomes ten times more trivial.

       "Hmm, those fellas look like terrorists."

       "Shit, look at those first responders coming."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Kill them too."
      </p>
      <p>
       ^ Our current usage of drones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, think about how trivial the wars overseas, in general, has been to most americans since we've been there. How much does it affect my daily life? None. What about yours? I'd wager nothing changed as well. Why is that? Because it's an undeclared war, nobody knows why we're there because there's not good enough reason to be there for over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       War is trivial now. Imagine living in the 40s when our nation was at war, imagine what that felt like, how peoples mindset would change, what it would be like to really have an enemy worth losing thousands of lives over.

       The difference would be that it adds potential risk, possibly an additional cost of human life, and it would take greater investment as a military force to put themselves in that position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drones, as being used now, are a tool of endless war. What does it really cost to have that killing done? The military risks no life when tasked with using a drone. So it means nothing to them to have this killing be done. There's no incentive for change at any time if they can just kill at whim, non-nonchalantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if we had a real threat to our country and our congress declared war? Everything would be different. Drones would serve their purpose and be wonderful tools of war at least possible cost of human life. But as our current circumstances go, they're nothing but tools for endless war (10+ years and going strong).

       See...I hear this, but it could be the same case for using robots to disarm bombs. You could just as well argue that we should use humans to disarm them at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you that drones remove the human component of direct accountability, but they do the same as every other piece of technology when it comes to minimizing risk.

       Not true. There's a fine line between killing somebody with a robot and using a different robot to save one. A drone would be a tool of aggression, a bomb disarming robot is not. Like I said, the problem is how and why they're being used. Currently they're nothing more than a tool for never ending war.

       I just don't see the difference if they're both tools used by humans.

       I'm against extrajudicial drone strikes...but to say that theres a difference between a robot dropping one and a human being in the cockpit makes it seem like the end result is any different.

       Its not that theres a difference. I think if actual pilots were doing what the drones were, we would still have a problem. The fact is, at least this is the one that makes me mad, is that as an american tax payer I pretty much just payed the government my hard earned money to learn how to bomb me. I didnt give you my money to spy on me, fuck you....

       I stated it would not make a difference if it was a human on target or in a cubicle that was doing the bomb run, it would matter because either way its wrong. And no, im not confounding anything. I dont like the fact that im paying civil servants to fly robots around the place to spy on me. Thats what the government does, im not mad at technology, im mad at the ppl in power that thinks this shit is ok

       I feel if two countries want to go to war, then they should be prepared to suffer the casualties to remind them of what they are fighting for.
By using drones they remove the human element and make the loss of life seem trivial. I think it is unethical. It is no different then slaughtering animals who have no ability to defend themselves.

       Alright, I should have maybe worded my first sentence differently. 
However I personally feel it is wrong to just send machines in to do the job. We could roll over smaller countries and people here wouldn't care because their loved ones were safely in a bunker somewhere. This makes war seem less devastating than it really is and only serves to distance people from the death and violence we have brought upon other countries and makes it more... acceptable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: And although not fully autonomous there will be a day when they are. There will also be a day we send fully functioning cyborgs out to do the dirty work for us. Then what? Will this help curb war or will war increase because humans are no longer on the front lines being killed?

       The Vietnam war was televised. While watching our own people get killed on a regular basis it made the public aware of how terrible war is and made them want to put an end to it. By using autonomous machines it'll just be easier  to get the public to agree with going to a war whether it is necessary or not. I'm not saying we shouldn't use the technology available to us, especially when it comes to protection, but we shouldn't be removing the human factor as much as we have and will continue to do. Again, I just see it as unethical. When you can take a life while sitting safely in front of a computer screen, that is just wrong.

       As far as I know the missiles the drones carry are the same as whatever our fighter jets and helicopters have. The only controversy is where and who those missiles are being fired at. If tomorrow a story comes out that an Apache helicopter killed a suspected terrorist and 5 innocent bystanders in Turkey, no one will care that it was a helicopter. They will care that we are in Turkey for some reason and that innocent people died. Like maxp0wah said, undeclared, unconstitutional wars and killing people not convicted of a crime is the problem. It just so happens that drones are doing a lot of that controversial killing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think some people get upset because maybe it seems like well technically we're not at war with anyone because it was a drone. Drones aren't constrained by laws or borders because the person isn't actually there crossing the border in it. Like if we used a laser on a satellite to kill people. It
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       okay on the news or in the paper because the blood isn't physically on our hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a tactical and technological standpoint I think drones are great.

       The only possible opposition I have would be if, sometime in the future, we make drones for carrying our troops. I just wouldn't want to trust my life to an RC car. But for any other role, like attack, patrolling, and surveillance, they are great.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we were at war with a real country, with an airforce and anti aircraft capabilities, I would never think our pilots were somehow less brave, or less noble, by using drones. There is no real, measurable, reward to seeing your enemy face to face. The real reward to avoiding direct fighting is the lives that it saves.

       What's the difference? Both are needlessly invasive artifacts of the constant fear fugue state the federally controlled media has this nation in the grips of and a direct violation of our inalienable rights.

       You should stop learning about what a strawman is from the internet and start learning how to have an actual discussion instead of pretending you want one to insult others.

       when there is zero consequence of war such as dead sons and daughters, will we ever learn to stop? if the point was to stop all wars and only engage in minimalistic efforts, then where is that plan being formulated? it has only been an increase in killing efficiency not a deterrent of evil. the efficiency of killing an enemy without losing a soldier is not as honorable as you think, for instance put the shoe on the other foot and you are being murdered by a man who is too afraid to look you in the eye while he takes your life.

       Added a lot to my post if you haven't refreshed your page by the way.

       The difference would be that it adds potential risk, possibly an additional cost of human life, and it would take greater investment as a military force to put themselves in that position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drones, as being used now, are a tool of endless war. What does it really cost to have that killing done? The military risks no life when tasked with using a drone. So it means nothing to them to have this killing be done. There's no incentive for change at any time if they can just kill at whim, non-nonchalantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if we had a real threat to our country and our congress declared war? Everything would be different. Drones would serve their purpose and be wonderful tools of war at least possible cost of human life. But as our current circumstances go, they're nothing but tools for endless war (10+ years and going strong).
