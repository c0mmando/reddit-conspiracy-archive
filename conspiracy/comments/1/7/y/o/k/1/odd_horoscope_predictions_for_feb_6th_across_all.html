       My point would be that someone could be warning us, or simply playing a joke, it has nothing to do with the legitimacy of horoscopes. But it's rather odd that all of those point to a similar situation regarding failing machines/computers.

       Aries - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com]
       <strong>
        <em>
         Computers
        </em>
       </strong>
       and other equipment could go
       <strong>
        <em>
         haywire
        </em>
       </strong>
       today, limiting your abilities to work at maximum efficiency. Even though you're usually calm and laid back, Aries, today the ogre in you may be tempted to emerge. Don't let it. It will only cause tension between you and those around you. Stay calm and focused, call in a technician, and enjoy the break from your routine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taurus - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Taurus, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel - delays are likely whether you fly or drive. If you've been planning a trip, don't finalize the arrangements now. Wait a few days, as
       <strong>
        <em>
         computers
        </em>
       </strong>
       and other
       <strong>
        <em>
         equipment
        </em>
       </strong>
       used in such arrangements are likely to
       <strong>
        <em>
         malfunction
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and you could end up frustrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gemini - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
No matter what friends tell you, Gemini, this isn't the day to make an investment of any kind, from buying a house to starting a savings account. And this isn't a good day to invest online. The planetary energies don't favor
       <strong>
        <em>
         computers
        </em>
       </strong>
       or other forms of modern
       <strong>
        <em>
         technology
        </em>
       </strong>
       used in such transactions, so wait a day or two. Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancer - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Cancer.
       <strong>
        <em>
         Computers
        </em>
       </strong>
       could
       <strong>
        <em>
         malfunction
        </em>
       </strong>
       , crash, or be maddeningly slow. You might also have a hard time reaching people you need to talk to. Don't be tempted to blow your top. That won't accomplish anything. Just call the technicians and get it handled. Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leo - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as
       <strong>
        <em>
         computers
        </em>
       </strong>
       and other
       <strong>
        <em>
         technology
        </em>
       </strong>
       involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Leo, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Virgo - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
Some upsetting dreams might haunt you today, Virgo. They might evoke some uncomfortable emotional issues. You might be a bit edgy emotionally and more likely to overreact when other people quarrel or
       <strong>
        <em>
         machines break down
        </em>
       </strong>
       . It might be a good idea to analyze your dreams first thing in the morning so you can learn from and release them. That way you will be more balanced throughout your day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libra - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com]
       <strong>
        <em>
         Machines
        </em>
       </strong>
       are likely to pose a few
       <strong>
        <em>
         problems
        </em>
       </strong>
       today, Libra, particularly where work and money are concerned. An unforeseen problem might interfere with your social life, perhaps forcing you to cancel a get-together you've been anticipating. If the person you were supposed to meet protests, avoid taking out your frustrations on him or her. Make new arrangements. It's only a temporary situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scorpio - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
Obstacles may arise in the course of your chores when
       <strong>
        <em>
         machines break down
        </em>
       </strong>
       and interfere with your efficiency. Your frustrations may cause you to want to yell and throw things. If you must blow your top, Scorpio, do it in such a way as to avoid causing upset to others. Go for a workout or jog. The machines will be fixed and the situation will pass. Hang in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sagittarius - Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Sagittarius, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of
       <strong>
        <em>
         computers
        </em>
       </strong>
       or other
       <strong>
        <em>
         machines
        </em>
       </strong>
       . This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capricorn - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Capricorn.
       <strong>
        <em>
         Frustration with machines
        </em>
       </strong>
       or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aquarius - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
Problems in your community may result from
       <strong>
        <em>
         malfunctioning machines
        </em>
       </strong>
       . Be prepared, Aquarius. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading
      </p>
      <p>
       Pisces - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013
[link to my.horoscope.com] 
Temporary upsets regarding money might result from a
       <strong>
        <em>
         computer failure
        </em>
       </strong>
       of some sort. Take care not to lose your temper over it, Pisces. Instead, remain calm, focused, and polite until everything is worked out. Your financial condition itself still looks very promising. It's just that the planetary energies don't favor machines today, so they may all go out of whack. Hang in there.

       Is it really? Obviously you do not turn it on, but it would make sense, because, you know, you dont get cooked standing next to it while it is cooking.

       You don't get cooked because the microwave isn't that powerful. But if you think your exposure rate is zero... you're gonna have a bad time.

        Leo - Wednesday, Feb 6, 2013 [link to my.horoscope.com] A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Leo, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.

       Well that's unsettling. I'm a Leo, about to take a trip to Norway on the 21st (waiting for my tax return to come on the 8th to buy the tickets), and overall things ARE going well for me this year, a lot better than last year that's for sure...I wonder if this is someone warning us of the "cyber 9/11" they've been constantly hinting at.

       Or it could just be that each one is from my.horoscope.com and this writer recycles all his material throughout the zodiacs. I guess we'll see tomorrow.

       It's probably referring to a mercury retrograde, that screws up communication generally. I wouldn't be too worried. I've been spending a hour hour trying this stupid .EPS file to import correctly, so there you go :(

       Saw this post this morning but didn't read it til' my machine just started fucking up when I was in the middle of editting a website. I was using Chrome and it started acting weird so I opened Firefox but as soon as I start to type in a web address, it just closes. Same with Explorer (my last resort).

       I find it odd that last weeks Person of Interest high lights a cyber attack taking place,  the weirdest thing is that show was probably written and shot in nov/dec.

       What really gets me is that astrology far predates technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is all well and good for horoscopes to predict universals, like love or conflict or misfortune.  This is a little too specific not only temporally, but geographically and based on lifestyle (I suppose their target audience obviously has access to technology though)
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, they aren't even trying anymore.
