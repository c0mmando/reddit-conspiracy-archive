    <div class="md"><p>I switch between &quot;serious&quot; post mode, and sarcasm too often.  It comes across a lot better when you can hear the inflection I use vocally.  Most unions I meant.  I&#39;ve seen a few unions in specialized industries like yours that still do function, but the trade union can never be broken these trace back to the guilds of old.   What has been broken is the support of the trade union for the labor unions.  There is no solidarity anymore.  Don&#39;t get me started on the &quot;business unions&quot; these are just an external HR department for the company they aren&#39;t a fucking union.  I wish we could unionize.  In-fact we&#39;ve talked of it in the office before, but we all came to the conclusion we&#39;d be fired en mass if we attempted, which would not violate the law of the state we are in.  Granted they can&#39;t openly fire you for starting a union, but they can for any other reason under the sun including no reason.  Oh &quot;right to work.&quot;  On an unrelated note I love the word games they play oh it&#39;s your right to be a cog in the corporate system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The unions I&#39;ve been apart of we&#39;re the Safeway union (for a few months when I was 18) and the AUPE (the Alberta Union of Public Employees). Nothing much to say about the Safeway union but the AUPE was a joke. I would waste an hour going back to the shop for a 15 minute coffee break. Lots of little things like that drove me nuts. They would not let me just radio in and kick my feet up in a park for my break. </p>

<p>We get a lot of power engineers from Ontario coming out here to work and once they experience our work culture they hate how it was run in out east. No bullshit. Just go to work and get paid. No one is taking a cut except for the government. </p>

<p>I can only speak to my experience and what I hear from my coworkers. I&#39;m sure unions have a place, but they don&#39;t have much of a presence in Alberta. I believe it is around 23%, a good portion of those being public workers. </p>

( mainly only if you have a sexual or violent felony will it cause serious issues).  Even with one of these if you make your asylums case well enough they can&#39;t use them to deny your claim.

<p>being a white drug dealer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You were violating the law, as much as I disagree with drug laws you can&#39;t complain when you knowingly engaged in criminal activity.  It&#39;s an illegal business and you got caught.  They were doing their chosen job you were doing your chosen job.  It&#39;s a sad state of affairs, but I wouldn&#39;t blame the cops rather the law makers for pass such unamerican legislation.  Also NARC units are very corrupt (I&#39;ve had them attempt to plant drug in my car trust me I understand) probably only went after you for cutting into their business, as NARC units get caught over and over running drugs.</p>

<p>I understand that change happens from the bottom, and don&#39;t you chastise me talking about rights.  I understand the inherent fascism in the drug war.

<p>Bullshit I&#39;ve heard this over and over that fascism has never happened in America.  What about the coal strikes in the 1800s?  The government literally called up the national guard to gundown striking miners.  Tyranny is nothing new we&#39;ve dealt with it since we began forming societies.   Unenforceable is the wrong word.  Rather they are unconstitutional laws passed by an out of control sociopathic congress.</p>

All the admission to congress and in federal courts about running drug etc.  So yes the intelligence agency run drugs to fund black ops.  That&#39;s fairly common knowledge in &quot;conspiracy&quot; circles.  I wasn&#39;t denying that.

    <div class="md"><p>Control of public information and opinion</p>

<p>It begins with withholding information, and leads to putting out false or misleading information. A government can develop ministries of propaganda under many guises. They typically call it &quot;public information&quot; or &quot;marketing&quot;.</p>

<p>Vote fraud used to prevent the election of reformers</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter which of the two major party candidates are elected if no real reformer can get nominated, and when news services start knowing the outcomes of elections before it is possible for them to know, then the votes are not being honestly counted.
Undue official influence on trials and juries
Nonrandom selection of jury panels, exclusion of those opposed to the law, exclusion of the jury from hearing argument on the law, exclusion of private prosecutors from access to the grand jury, and prevention of parties and their counsels from making effective arguments or challenging the government.</p>

<p>Usurpation of undelegated powers</p>

<p>This is usually done with popular support for solving some problem, or to redistribute wealth to the advantage of the supporters of the dominant faction, but it soon leads to the deprivation of rights of minorities and individuals.</p>

<p>Seeking a government monopoly on the capability and use of armed force</p>

<p>The first signs are efforts to register or restrict the possession and use of firearms, initially under the guise of &quot;protecting&quot; the public, which, when it actually results in increased crime, provides a basis for further disarmament efforts affecting more people and more weapons.</p>

<p>Militarization of law enforcement</p>

<p>Declaring a &quot;war on crime&quot; that becomes a war on civil liberties. Preparation of military forces for internal policing duties.
Infiltration and subversion of citizen groups that could be forces for reform
Internal spying and surveillance is the beginning. A sign is false prosecutions of their leaders.</p>

<p>Suppression of investigators and whistleblowers</p>

<p>When people who try to uncover high level wrongdoing are threatened, that is a sign the system is not only riddled with corruption, but that the corruption has passed the threshold into active tyranny.
Use of the law for competition suppression
It begins with the dominant faction winning support by paying off their supporters and suppressing their supporters&#39; competitors, but leads to public officials themselves engaging in illegal activities and using the law to suppress independent competitors. A good example of this is narcotics trafficking.
Subversion of internal checks and balances
This involves the appointment to key positions of persons who can be controlled by their sponsors, and who are then induced to do illegal things. The worst way in which this occurs is in the appointment of judges that will go along with unconstitutional acts by the other branches.</p>

<p>Creation of a class of officials who are above the law</p>

<p>This is indicated by dismissal of charges for wrongdoing against persons who are &quot;following orders&quot;.</p>

<p>Increasing dependency of the people on government</p>

<p>The classic approach to domination of the people is to first take everything they have away from them, then make them compliant with the demands of the rulers to get anything back again.
Increasing public ignorance of their civic duties and reluctance to perform them
When the people avoid doing things like voting and serving in militias and juries, tyranny is not far behind.</p>

<p>Use of staged events to produce popular support</p>

<p>Acts of terrorism, blamed on political opponents, followed immediately with well-prepared proposals for increased powers and budgets for suppressive agencies. Sometimes called a Reichstag plot.
Conversion of rights into privileges
Requiring licenses and permits for doing things that the government does not have the delegated power to restrict, except by due process in which the burden of proof is on the petitioner.</p>

<p>Political correctness</p>

<p>Many if not most people are susceptible to being recruited to engage in repressive actions against disfavored views or behaviors, and led to pave the way for the dominance of tyrannical government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. yes. YES! Sadly very few people stare your level of clarity when assessing the situation.  They are doing it right in front of our face.  Our government hasn&#39;t yet converted to the degree required to secretly carry out these actions.  They are trying desperately to punish whistle-blowers. To stop the leaks and keep the illusion of just free government going as long as possible.  They know if the illusion dies they die.  Even with all their thugs, goons, assault rifles, drones, and tanks they can&#39;t keep hold of power with might alone.  Might no longer makes right.  Might may result in power, but not legitimate power as it did in the past.  this fact alone gives me hope that maybe just maybe as a whole humanity can transcend the cycle of violence that is top-down governance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot be abrupt when passing laws, it&#39;s a long game. Laws spread out over a longer period of time brings less attention than it would if laws were all passed on the same day. Connect the dots and see what laws have been passed, what they comprise of and what potential they have when put together. They are a chain of events with an intended goal that <em>must</em> not bring too much attention and that is why it is done over many years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a different between writing it on paper, and what is happening.  I will paraphrase a famous German general &quot;Studying the Americans manuals and regulations seem to be pointless as they don&#39;t appear to follow or even read them.&quot;  If they truly attempted to enforce the draconian regulations and laws they have passed there would be a revolt this is well understood.  What is happening is they pass these horrific laws, and selective enforce them against small  groups that act against the state interests.  It&#39;s the prelude to any conversion to an openly fascist state.  First you have to slowly erode the rule of law this took decades in Germany and I think will take much longer in the USA.  Granted they&#39;ve been at it for a few decades already.</p>

I&#39;ve seen a few unions in specialized industries like yours that still do function, but the trade union can never be broken these trace back to the guilds of old.   What has been broken is the support of the trade union for the labor unions.  There is no solidarity anymore.  Don&#39;t get me started on the &quot;business unions&quot; these are just an external HR department for the company they aren&#39;t a fucking union.  I wish we could unionize.
