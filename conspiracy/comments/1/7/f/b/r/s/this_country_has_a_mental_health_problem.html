       Both are different, but both are correct. I have 1 friend who is literally jobless by choice and collecting unemployment for no reason other than he doesnt want to work and wants a hand out.

      <p>
       Thats lazy.

       On the other hand I have friends working their asses off everyday trying to find a job, but cant.

       That's anecdotal evidence, and it's useless. Yes, lazy people exist. We don't know if they exist in statistically significant numbers, or whether there are more of them than should be expected. Those are also two equally valid responses to the same larger problem.

       We can actually define those people, so despite the fact he is using an anecdote, you can generally state it as common knowledge.  How, you ask?  Look at the increase in disability claims, from 7.2 million to 8.5 million in less than two years.  The increase is four times greater than any other period of time.

      <pre><code>The economy created just 80,000 jobs in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. But that same month, 85,000 workers left the workforce entirely to enroll in the Social Security Disability Insurance program, according to the Social Security Administration.

The disability ranks have outpaced job growth throughout President Obama's recovery. While the economy has created 2.6 million jobs since June 2009, fully 3.1 million workers signed up for disability benefits.

In other words, the number of new disability enrollees has climbed 19% faster than the number of jobs created during the sluggish recovery. (Even after accounting for people who left the disability program because they died or aged into retirement, disability ranks have climbed more than 1.1 million in the past three years.)

And the disability ranks will continue to swell. In just the last month, almost 275,000 put in applications for disability benefits. Experts say that more people try to get on disability when jobs are scarce, and changes to eligibility rules enacted back in 1984 have made it far easier to qualify.

       What would you equate the sudden increase in disability claims?  Purely job market?  Or did the lax change in requirements provide an opportunity for those less equipped for the

       I think what he is saying in the form of a questions is, how do claims on disability relate to claims for unemployment? The only relation I see is that unemployed people don't have jobs, and that people claiming disability
       <strong>
        sometimes
       </strong>
       don't have jobs.

       No, it's useless because it's statistically insignificant. You're providing absolutely no information I didn't already have. I know the system isn't 100% efficient and not every person is motivated and capable. I disagree with your black and white analysis of the "lazy" people's motivations. Being unmotivated is a completely rational result of a system that doesn't reward hard work proportionately. I do not believe the people who choose not to participate fully in what is clearly a dysfunctional system are "lazy."

       They can't both be true, because they both use the word "disguise," implying that in each respective statement, one of the "problems" is only a disguise, while the other one is the genuine problem.

       He didn't pay for unemployment, the employer pays for unemployment.  I don't think there is anything in the breakdown of my check that says "unemployment insurance" because I don't pay a damn thing, my employer does.  You can claim that's part of my compensation I guess but I think that's missing the point.  Beyond that, the extended unemployment benefits that came from federal money after the recent recession was not from a fund that was paid into.  The federal government supplemented people's unemployment insurance for an extra 18 months iirc?  That came straight out of our tax dollars.  Now I'm not saying that it was a bad program as there were people out there who were definitely hurting.  I also know people first hand who used that extension to take an extended holiday.

       How old is your one friend? How much of an education does he have? How much alcohol does he drink? How much weed does he smoke? I think it's safe to assume he's a young (less than 35?) and uneducated, even if he doesn't drink or smoke, though that's not a requirement. Hardly a cross section of American society. We call this a

       Technically your lazy friend is not unemployed and does not count towards unemployment.

       Econ 101 will teach you that "unemployed" people are those who are able and willing to work but can not find a job.

       Your lazy friend is not part of the work force (not looking for work) therefore is only lazy.  Not unemployed.

       No. This is public belief, it's not true. There are lots of jobs out there. Look around and see all that needs to be done. There is no paid work available. See the difference? Jobs for stuff that doesn't need doing, no work for things that do. Why? Because what is in the interest of those paying for labor and that of the people differs.

       Exactly. Ensuring job security should be everyone's primary goal. It may sound harsh, or dismissive, but if you are out of work, you need to get creative and resourceful. Might mean going back to school, or taking a job you don't want, temporarily. It's either that, or give up.

       Drove me crazy. I used to be a part of this forum and I got in an argument with a guy who was saying the rash of unemployment was just freeloaders, looking for a handout.
      </p>
      <p>
       He just couldn't grasp that if there were 100 jobs and 150 people that 50 people would be unemployed, no matter how hard they looked for jobs.

       The problem is that there have been an unprecedented number of skilled and white collar-type layoffs through our recent depression, and most of the people consider themselves "too good" to take up a job for half of their previous pay.  They'd rather file for unemployment then bankruptcy and lose their house before having to tell their friends that they are a produce clerk at Kroger to make ends meet until another career type job comes along.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd call it a laziness and pride problem disguised as an unemployment problem.

       This is what is referred to as under-employment.  And taking that produce clerk job comes with a large cost, too.  For example, I can earn ~80% of my previous wage on an unemployment claim, while remaining free enough from obligations during the day to continue to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I take the kroger job, then I'm earning 50% of my previous wage, don't have the opportunity to regain the missing portion of unemployment wage from unemployment (because I'm now employed), and also need to wait for a job to 'come along' rather than being free enough with my time to go out and look for that job.

       Yep, your experience illustrates my point very well.  The vast majority of those people who applied for your job opening were probably completely unemployed, even though most of them could have found a lower wage job to work until they were employed again in their career field-- that is, they were unemployed by choice.  While some probably were working temp jobs, I bet most of them preferred to not work and hang their hopes on 750:1 odds while complaining about the "evil banks stealing their home" instead of swallowing their pride and getting a job "beneath them" until they were hired elsewhere.

       Being able to find a minimum wage job is irrelevant.  Depending on your previous wage, unemployment can pay far greater than a minimum wage job.  Who in their right mind is going to take less money to work and miss out on a huge block of time that could be spent on finding new employment of a higher caliber?
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, underemployment is also a problem, and not a problem of the lazy.  If you have student loans because you got a degree a minimum wage job is not going to pay for them, you need to find an adequate level of employment.

       Hi. retired, so not looking for a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been times in my past when I had a contract end and I could not find a
       <em>
        appropriate
       </em>
       job, and I'm a jack-of-all-trades; Computers, Electronics, graphics, communications &amp; etc. when those times came along if it was at all possible I would try to self-employ myself, because once you take a job an unskilled person could do, it lowers your future employability. I've got a family so I've had to take the minimum wage route once and I can assure you that coming back from it was very difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I see it as a valid problem; once you hit the "losing all your possessions and your kids are hungry" point you can't wait any longer, but waiting until just before that point so that you can try and make use of your skill set to make as much in a phreaking day as you would in a month of unskilled labor makes sense.

       That doesn't guarantee a job that equals your academic skills or learned profession. I know many people that have university degrees that work in bars and nightclubs and feel sick they have an £18,000 debt and have nothing to show from it. The fact is, the economy in large parts has been destroyed by banks and financial instruments and those people are above and beyond the law. An entire generation of people have been lost and the employment figured are always understated from official sources.

       Read the Daily Mail, its a Tory mouthpiece doing exposés on benefit cheats whipping up people in to a frenzy while absolutely massive financial fraud and tax evasion is still ongoing with calls to arms by the government and very little meaningful action. Sure they have closed a few loop holes but the real big fish slip through the net.

       It's the time old fashion of divide and conquer while appeasing the public waving carrots on a stick. One of the most disgusting things in the UK at the moment is Atos. Atos is a private company that won a multi million pound contract to assess disabled people to see whether they can work or not. The problem is that since it has been paid by the government, certain criteria has been set and certain numbers have been give so less people can claim benefit and less people appear in the employment statistics.

       This women DIED of cancer after she was deemed fit to work by Atos. If that was my family member I would go fucking ape shit and I'd want revenge for that absolutely and would probably get my self into a lot of trouble. There is many more instances of real people who really can't work and cannot survive without that money.

       They are forcing people on deaths door to work their last time on this earth to work a shitty job so the government statistics look better in the employment statistics quarter. This is utterly depraved and truly sickening and a prime example of how truly psychopathic our leaders are showing no remorse or empathy. The people that decide these things deserve the firing squad.

       A lot of folks also don't grasp that sending jobs overseas is beneficial for the economy in the long run. Most people seem to think that corporations find cheaper labor overseas, and then just pocket the extra cash that they save.
      </p>
      <p>
       What actually happens is that money saved is used to grow the business. Business growth creates new, local jobs - and they're usually higher paid jobs that are created. The bottom % of the unskilled labor force is hurt, but higher-paying, higher-skill jobs are created as a result.

       Anyone who is willing to work and is serious about it will certainly find a job. Only you must not go to the man who tells you this, for he has no job to offer and doesn't know anyone who knows of a vacancy. This is exactly the reason why he gives you such generous advice, out of brotherly love, and to demonstrate how little he knows the world. - B. Traven

       It's not even profit. It's absurdly huge compensations for the top end. If execs were willing to cut their pay as much as they're willing to cut everyone else's pay, there may some kind of balance but that's not the way it goes. I'm paid less today for the same job I did 5 years ago. What's worse is the job is more specialized and complicated today than 5 years ago and I have less job security! Fucking absurd. (btw, I kick ass at the job now better than then...my skills have improved but my pay diminished :( )

       We have infrastructure all over the place that needs work, and tons of people that can't find work, but we can't put two and two together because our banking and monetary system is based on debt-to-banks-as-money and they've decided that they like things as they are so they're not loaning out enough money - not that more debt is really a good thing...

       actually, every participant in modern economics is capable of producing jobs, and finding jobs; sacrifices must be made; choosing not to sacrifice may, to some people, better be understood as "laziness". The claim that there are "not enough jobs" may better be defended by saying that the general barriers to such activities are too high a sacrifice for some people; whether it be family, or moral values that discourage you from say, moving to a new location for a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       your entire model of viewing "jobs" as some tangible quantity that can be exchanged between countries does not work; economics does not operate like this at all. The phenomenon you're describing would be more accurately modeled as a function of varying degrees of economic participation; or laziness, because joe rogan is cool like that.

       Except it ain't so, Joe. The way the current economic system is constructed, all people could be provided for at a decent level with a minimum of work. But those with the power don't want it to be that way.

       Science has liberated us from work (relatively speaking... of course there will always be work), but it has not liberated us from those who rule and control us.

       ok, and if we all "live at the minimum" then life would be shitty; the capitalistic market would not have discovered the vaccines and cures that its discovered; society would be shitty; everything would suck.. sorry, but we need competition; and when theres only 10 bananas on the tree but 11 people who are hungry then all of a sudden your ideal model falls to shit;

       Im living in a fantasy? You say there are invisible monsters controlling my life; sounds like you're scared of ghosts; nobody has ever told me what to do, for one second of my existence, without my consent; nobody "controls me"; perhaps you meant to say INFLUENCE? ah, but influence is quite a bit less extreme, and when somebody says economics is rape, im sure they would also say influence is control; you sir, are a sensationalist; and a liar, and somebody who doesn't know the meaning of certain words...

       actually, a troll's purpose is to distract and confuse; I have stayed on topic and brought up relevant points; relevant points that you are unable or unwilling to address and thus you use the primest logical fallacy of them all; attack the character instead of the argument. Go ahead and live the rest of your life scared to death of the invisible spaghetti monster thats trying to eat you; little do you know that YOU are that spaghetti monster; the same greed that drives economic progress is the same greed you feel, as a human being, we all experience these emotions; but to exclude them from yourself, to act as if the problem is "out there, with other people" is wrong, the problems you fear so much are moreso a product of your own internal dialogue with yourself, not so much based on facts or evidence or real-world observations. Economic's purpose is not to rape; the governments purpose is not to rape; yet you preach these things with fearful undertones.
      </p>
      <p>
       and for future reference; I dont troll; I rage; usually triggered by disgracefully stupid comments that people make online; like your whole BS rant on economics is meant to rape us; like wtf, you dont understand economics, or anything else probably

       keep holding hands at your full-moon drum circles, hippifag; I'll be waiting to see how your proposal "let's just figure out the bare minimum to survive then give people that, instead of giving them opportunities for growth in a capitalistic system"; yeah, let's see how that civilization would pan out; my guess would be aids from all the gay butt sex and the lack of funded aids research.
      </p>
      <p>
       call me whatever you want, you're just another loud blind idiot and those whose opinions I would value would see that just as clearly as I do. You're ideas are bad, your ideas would not work, your ideas about how the world operates are wrong, your ideas for future civilization are disgusting, and once again in a conversation where relevant information is being provided on ONE SIDE, you continue to provide nothing but attacks on the character of a dissenting voice, because you have not the ability to defend your ideas, because they are weak, like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life hates me? "life" is not a living thing and does not experience emotion; life is an abstract, intangible CONCEPT, not an actual thing; but an idiot like you would say meaningless shit like that; because you dont think about the words that come out of your mouth, because if you did you would stop speaking like such a loud blind idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hatred for you will, at a later point, justify my mercilessness in our capitalistic system; I'll make sure to turn on the sprinklers during the next one of your faggot drum circles; just because of you and the poor-quality ideas you represent; childscum.

       Economically, moving jobs overseas actually benefits the US economy in the long run - cheaper labor allows for business growth in the US - business growth in the US creates more jobs. Higher paying, higher skilled jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It hurts the unskilled labor force in the short term, but it boosts overall economic growth in the long term. it's a common misconception because most people cannot see past the short term job losses.

       Your example for jobs that are going unfilled require the person wanting the job to invest $6k of their own money before they can get hired.  No fucking wonder why they're having a tough time getting filled.

       the lack of jobs problem can be described as an entitlement epidemic whereby everyone feels they are owed a 6 figure managerial salary. Beggars can't be choosers, there are plenty of jobs, they may not classify as careers, but there are jobs. Also, they may not be 10 minutes from where you live, move to survive...

       You're wrong. Americans are more productive than ever, more educated than ever, smarter than ever, and poorer than ever. Young people simply want middle class jobs and participation in the American economy. That's not entitlement, that's the core of the American Dream. It's very un-American to denigrate your fellow citizens as such, and it shows your profound anti-American values.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that there is increasing automation and competition from overseas markets. The wealth and opportunities available to previous generations no longer exist to the same degree for younger Americans. I.e. no longer is it possible to graduate with a GED, work only 40 hours a week, and receive 50K plus benefits with job security.

       yes i'm anti american because i have issue with a system that keeps people addicted to welfare and social services... i have an issue with the fact that we are giving certain demographics an incentive to stay on welfare and stay a slave of the system. yes that's so anti american of me... and i stated above "there are plenty of jobs, they may not classify as careers, but there are jobs. Also, they may not be 10 minutes from where you live, move to survive..." you proved my point, how bout get a shitty job while you're holding out for a good one? I know its not easy especially when a lot of people conceivably make more on welfare then they can on a minimum wage job.

       We share concern with the economy. The difference is that you are blaming the values and the work ethic of Americans, while I am looking at the social system, and identifying automation and outsourcing of our occupations to third-world slave camps. Our elites created an economy where there are no jobs, where the American Dream is gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to you, I believe in the resilience and virtue of the American people, who have built this country, and who continue to fight for their survival. In contrast to you, I believe the American Dream should not be downsized to working day-by-day in shitty McJobs. I think Americans deserve better than work in poverty wages with no chance of career advancement, despite, as I pointed out, the fact that Americans are more productive and more educated than ever in history. I believe Americans deserve the American Dream our forebears sought and fought and died for.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find it acceptable that the majority of Americans work in a "shitty job" that makes less than people do on welfare, then I know of many third world, banana republics where you would fit right in. They would welcome your lowered expectations for your countrymen and women.

       And you're right, the job market here in Ohio is and has been pretty soft. There are trade offs, of course. Sloppy miserable winters, toothless redneck types, less tolerance for personal lifestyles than on the coast, etc...but if you know where to be, it's as cosmopolitan and progressive as any coastal state (except California...you guys are from another planet ;)_)

        Yeah, the winter sucks in S. Dak as well, but I'm willing to put up with it. In SD, there's a pretty good libertarian mindset, for the most part. There's still the fact that the hardcore Christians ramroded the Abortion Ban bill through, which will get struck down anyways. I'd like it to be more tolerant, but in all honesty, the average age of a large portion of the state is quite old. Once they die, the tolerance level will skyrocket. It's a morbid way to think about it, but it's true.

       I don't find anything morbid about reality. A generation (or five) had to die before we could abolish slavery; the day will come when the next generation will be waiting for us to die, too.

       I tolerate conservatism as a safeguard against changing too fast. While change must occur in order to advance as a people, easing those resistant to it into the new paradigms is the best way. Otherwise, you have uprisings, radical sects, etc...

       Most of my more progressive friends have no patience for this, and they hate to hear it. They want everything right now. But the old and intolerant are people, too. They helped build our country, and they need more time to come around (or, as previously mentioned, die.)

       On a side note, yes, we do seem to have a similar musical taste. I wish Maynard would get up off his ass and get back to tool/apc. This Puscifer project was fun, and a great divergence, but I want my symphony back.

       Yes. This. It's pretty cliche, but Schism and Forty Six and Two are still my favorite two songs from them.

       Yep. It sucks that his rep lies (almost) solely in his time spent with Fear Factor / UFC. The guy is incredibly intelligent in many, many realms of study. Politics, religion, consciousness-expansion, physics, metaphysics, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       He may not know as MUCH as some people do in those fields, but he brings a very refreshing change of perspective, and its utterly foolish to disregard his opinions and ideas because of Fear Factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: To be honest, that was the smartest move of his career. He got paid to urge a bunch of morons into eating reindeer testicles. He just took advantage of the system, man!

       He also said that he was stoned almost the entire time. I think he said starting around the start of the second season, until he stopped doing the job. He commented on how the lollipops he used to eat during the show, weren't just your average candy.

       Haha, you'd have to be stoned to deal with people chugging maggots.  What does that prove about conquering fear?  Just means I would never want to make out with a former Fear Factor contestant because I know what they've had in their mouth and no amount of mouthwash is going to stop me from mentally picturing that.

       in my experience, that's bullshit, and we're the best skeptics on this whole site.

       the people that come in here with that "you all have confirmation bias" bullshit are the ones who seem gullible.  especially when we're supposed to believe we're just validating whatever beliefs we already had, after we started believing something when figuring it out it was the only theory that made any damn sense.

       I agree with that to a point - I try to be open to anything said, and if someone makes a good point and calls me out on something, I'll admit it. But the thing is,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Stanhope is even MORE of a legend, as far as comedy he's the closest thing we have to Bill Hicks or a George Carlin anymore, or a Hunter S. Thompson for that matter. Stanhope is also Joe's favorite comedian besides Joey Diaz. I think Doug has had a HUGE influence on Joe's standup and his overall thought process, that's why they get along so well. This is worth the read.

       Yeah, for some reason I don't think the guy with a bit about a woman having vaginas all over her body and fucking a two headed girl is of the same caliber as George Carlin or motherfucking Hunter S. Thompson.  Don't get me wrong, Stanhope is cool, but those motherfuckers are some next level shit.

       Carlin and Thompson both would say some things for pure reaction tho, like Doug, and i wouldn't be surprised if Carlin or Thompson talked about how we SHOULD be looking into mutations because "maybe that's where we get the answer"-Doug...My point is that all 4 of these men are/were extremely anti-establishment and there are very few of those people left that are actively fucking with the system and yelling at theaterfulls of ppl, making them think outside their comfortzone, and making sense while doing it (AND GETTING LAUGHS!!!). What Stanhope represents is definitely similar to that of HST considering his political stances and his VERY gonzo approach to writing, read his website archives, it's all Doug, (SERIOUSLY READ HIS ARCHIVES...if you like HST you can appreciate this guy!

       ) I wouldn't say he "IS GREATER THAN" Carlin or HST, maybe a more degenerate version, but they're in the same brilliant and brutally honest ballpark.

       And he's actually a purple belt in BJJ, so he really does know what he's talking about.  I don't know if you know how BJJ belts work, but purple belt, that is a fuck ton of hard work.  At the school I used to go to they called the purples, Jedi Knights.  :p
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Guess he's a 2nd degree black belt.  Damn.  My B, Joe

       He's a smart dude and one of few celebs with a clue and a voice.  You should check out his podcast (iTunes) or his new youtube channel:

       I also thought he was just the Fear Factor / UFC guy until a few months ago.  He's also an extremely funny comedian and overall good logical dude.  I haven't been able to stop listening to his shit since.  He's live streaming tonight with a free solo climber (ustream.tv/joerogan for the live stream whenever they start).

       His podcast with Neil DeGrasse Tyson was great. Tyson debunked all the moon landing shit and then they had an amazing and profound conversation on space exploration and stuff.

       When you say Tyson debunked all the moon landing stuff, does that mean Rogan believed it was a hoax before hand, or just that he debunked it on the show for all to hear?

       Rogan seems to have doubts about it, at least it's what transpired in the interview. He shows Tyson some (he thinks) strange videos, and things like the no stars on the sky, waving flag, astronauts falling strangely, etc, the usual crap. I don't know if Rogan believes it or not, only that he really was forcing the issue with Tyson.

       Thanks for the reply. I'll give it a watch tonight. I really like Rogan, but I really hope he doesn't/didn't believe the moon landing was a hoax. Especially if he uses such easily explained 'errors' as you pointed out.

       I actually did enjoy the stand up he has on Netflix. The one where he opens up about how the earth is an organism and people are bacteria. He had some really funny stuff in that. What was the stand up you are referring too?

       It's called Joe Rogan: Live from the Tabernacle.  It came out this last December.  He did a Louis CK style release where he just put it online for 5 bucks.  It's and hour long and well worth the pocket change.  Also you can download or stream it like 6-7 times, so if you want to watch it at a friends house, or if something happened to your original, you get a couple backups.  As for the content, I would sum it up at thought provoking comedy.  It's close to Bill Hicks but a little toned down on the serious side.  He still has a lot of silly shit thrown in, but it all melds good.

       he's just a fuckin goofball space cadet, however, he is pretty smart and I love his podcast and general view on things. He just is a little
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       involved in the psychedelic community. Thinks it's a cure for everything. I can't say I know anything either way but that, and when he starts rambling about MMA I tune out, not that i don't like the sport, but I can only hear him compare EVERY fighter to Ovareem and Silva so many times before I get tired of it.

       That's part of the mental health problem, not a different shade of it. It's a bunch of shitbags trying to make a buck off what could hardly even be classified as alternative medicine in most cases.

       The problem is that some of Big Pharma's med DO work.  I'm not saying they get them the right way or distribute them the right way, I'm just saying I work with people who seriously need meds.  Some don't, and some it is nearly impossible to tell.  I don't condone any business practices here, just stating that sometimes pills are the answer.

       It's actually both. drug companies have to keep making new stuff to keep patents and income flow so they can fund actual research that does help everyone. So for every good drug that actually works we get 10 that stop your leg from moving when you are sitting there(side effects include: massive lung, dissociative liver complexes and inverted penis.) On the flip side we a large portion of mentally ill people who rather then seek help will self medicate or straight up ignore the problem . They also, a lot of the time, lack resources to spend on the help they might need so a cheap pill that promises to fix it seems like a better alternative then going broke trying to afford proper care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't ever let your family doctor prescribe you anti depressants, ask for a referral to a psychologist or even just a therapist. You wouldn't go to a oncologist for a tooth ache, so why go to a GP when you have a mental issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, its not just big pharma trying to rape you dry. look at the dumb ass homeopathic doctors running around charging way to much to fix your junk with their snake oil or crush mint leaf. Capitalism is the real bitch here.

       No, I think that presidents have nothing to do with it.  Think of it like a ballclub.  You got your players, the congress and house and politicians and what not, the manager which is the potus, the general managers such as the banks and companies with the money, and then you got your owners, the religions.  The only thing that comes before country is God.  Ever wonder why it's always God &amp; country, and not the other way around?

       The problem with this statement is that, while there are certainly major problems with mental health treatment and treatment availability in this country, it's just another scapegoat. The percentage of people with mental health problems who go on killing sprees is comparable to the percentage of people who listen to heavy metal and go on killing sprees, or who play Call of Duty and go on killing sprees. Mental health care has enough negative stereotypes and mainstream disapproval that causes many people to forego treatment that will help them without this being heaped on top.

       That's not the point I was making. Most people with mental health problems don't hurt anyone. Most white men don't hurt anyone. Most drug addicts don't hurt anyone. None of these groups should be vilified because of the actions of a very small minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that people who go on killing sprees don't have mental problems. I'm saying that so many more people have mental problems than go on killing sprees that it's unjust to treat the two as if they are equal, as has been going on of late.

       You seem to be making the opposite mistake most people do with the correlation/causation problem. You're treating this like there's only a correlation between the two when in fact, mental health problems are causing the killing sprees. The simple fact is that if we handle the mental health problems better, less people would die. I think the point I this post was to also state it would reduce more deaths than any assault rifle ban.

       I think you're misunderstanding. He's not attacking mental health care, but rather saying that there is not enough support behind it and that the media just jumps right to gun control because that brings more ratings. If the media would focus on how hard it is to get mental health care and if the government would support that more, rather than focus on throwing the blame on objects, things might really improve.

       Let's all be very careful with the mental health meme.  I'm pretty sure what joe rogan means is that the country is not mentally healthy and that our goals and ideals and ambitions are off.  But the way "mental health" is being pushed in the media right now, the goal is on more restriction and more prescriptions.  There's a lot of potential for abuse here.  I think rogan needs to find another term to make his point.

       I also want to point out, since this is an
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       thread, that Rogan's interview with Neil Degrasse Tyson was really hard to listen to.  Tyson's argument (like every pop-scientist) is that there is no such thing as a conspiracy because nobody can keep their mouth shut.  That is the most unscientific load of bs I've ever heard.  Rogan really shouldve called him on it instead of just pushing moonlanding videos.

       More of a cross between Opie &amp; Anthony and Alex Jones. As far as I can tell, all Stern does during the 2-3 days per week that he works is talk to strippers (which is incredibly boring) or talk about about Americas Got Talent (which is also incredibly boring.  Rogan is good friends with Opie &amp; Anthony and has said many times that their show was the inspiration for his podcast, because it is laid back and feels more like a few friends hanging out than it does a radio show.

       Rogan, while meat-head-ish, can be a really articulate guy when he chooses to be and a lot of the time is open minded enough to aee through all the bullshit and talk to the reality of a situation.

       Adding to the lazy vs. unemployed debate, I think numerous people believe they are above certain types of jobs. I for example have a college degree, and am now just starting to look for "corporate" jobs that not too long ago were a guarantee to recent college grads. I could work at McDonalds tomorrow if I wanted to, but I feel overqualified to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest change for the Generations Y'ers is to realize many Blue Collar jobs are no longer needed or that several jobs from 10-20 years ago can be done by one person. Having a business degree nowadays wont do you too much good, you must have a concrete skill such as programming, engineering or something else along with you business knowledge.

       I listen for the guests.  Rogan is a statist, who just parrots the ideas and philosophies of other people.  It is amusing to hear him argue with people who are actually pioneering and actively participating in their philosophies; the Kokesh interview, for example.

       Completely ignoring the Israeli connection to 9/11, while advocating "Time Wave Zero"... Okay, Joe.

       I don't get it, does this mean he's against gun control?

       Does this mean he agrees with people that think their guns are the only barrier between Obama becoming Hitler and that's why gun control shouldn't be harsher?

       Seriously?  Come on man get with the conscience collective here and move past that crude and demeaning monicker. A doper is someone associated with hard drug use like Heroin, Crystal Meth, Crack Cocaine, etc.  What Joe and many new people everyday are discovering are consciousness expanding substances, all of them natural and long forgotten gateways to recognizing our spiritual connection to all and everything.  I'm not referring to cannabis here either, I am talking about psilocybin mushrooms and DMT. And it's my personal opinion that you shouldn't open your mouth with an opinion on something if you have zero experience with it.  Just sayin.

       Still on the fence on Rogan. Sometimes he says stuff I'm like "wow, okay, wasn't exactly expecting that from you, but go on..." and then other times he comes off as a total shill (like how hard he rode the "2012" gravy train).
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it hard to hate on anyone who used to be on a show with Phil Hartman, Dave Foley and Stephen Root. Then I just think about his podcast, and his interviews with people like Giorgio Tsoukalos, and it all becomes a wash. Rogan is the definition of "polarizing" (I feel like I'm being slightly nice saying that, too).

       No... I think I'm saying exactly what I said about him. Still on the fence. At the end of the day, he's a CELEBRITY. Whatever good he's bringing to the cause (whatever the cause is), is tainted by the fact that he's profiting off of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know him personally, nor do I know everything about him. Is that him for real in his podcast, or another "personality"? Like I said, I don't know. Thus: I'm on the fence (still) on Joe Rogan.

       The only thing I know for sure: NewsRadio was pretty hilarious (but he had very little to do with the hilarity).

       He does better than that. I'm not denying that someone shouldn't be allowed to make a living, but he profits off the suffering of others. He gets paid to talk about how bullshit other people are (I shouldn't have to list all the causes he takes up, most people here seem to know a lot about him). Just saying.

       He founded Onnit.com, a site selling products for a healthy lifestyle. Nutritious foods, supplements, work out equipment, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a comedian, this occupation is inherently gives people joy. His last comedy special is 5$ for gods sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a UFC commentator, again bringing joy to those who enjoy MMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please explain the part where he "profits off the suffering of others".

      <p>
       If you can't find the conflict of interest between participating and furthering the culture of UFC and the subject matters he covers on his podcast, then that's cool for you. I cannot. Granted, you can skip the commercials, but he still get's paid for them. Thus my statement about him profiting off the skin of others. People work for free, and tirelessly, to try and do something to help benefit the world, often times in the subjects he covers. He just talks about stuff on a podcast, and gets paid from advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as being a comedian, granted this is my opinion, but he's pretty terrible. His biggest claim to fame is calling out people for stealing material from other comedians. Okay, that's cool and a respectable move. But he ruins it by using it as a platform to promote himself, and his career. Don't get me wrong, watching him tear down Carlos Mencia was pretty great, but he did it in such a negative fashion, he's only a few hairs more reputable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, all this being said, I'm still on the fence on him. I can see the positivity he might bring for others, so of course I take that into consideration. I've seen his videos and what not on YT, and yeah, there's a lot of good stuff there. But to give him a full blown pass, like how some of the people I've seen here have given him, is just reflective of selective reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       We ARE talking about the guy that takes Tsoukalos seriously, after all.

All it will do is make the tally for the number of laws broken slightly higher on the chance that this person is actually caught.

       What part of, "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" do you not get?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we stop knee jerk reaction to singular incidents and stop punishing legal owners for the acts of those who were in the majority of cases not legally able to own.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I drive my truck through the buss stop tomorrow killing 21 kids and 15 adults will you be fine with the new laws which restrict the ownership of vehicles, but only big scary vehicles, especially if they are black in color or have flames on them, cause those with flames are so much more dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are wanting everyone to jump through a bunch of BS hoops that do absolutely nothing to stop those who once again, do not follow the law, and as such care little for your happy little scenario there.

       No I don't, I need to be able to reach the wheel and pedals, and maybe a bit of an idea of how it works and what pedal does what, but I am not magically stopped form piloting the vehicle by not having a state issued license.

       Many guns do require a license, if you want to use the car analogy then fine, anyone can shoot a gun once they pass a basic test, and they can own the gun well before they pass the test, they just cannot shoot it. Then all they have to do is pay the fee each 4 years and they are good to go with no more training needed.

       This is a horrible tragedy, but it was one committed by a man with mental issues who illegally used weapons, no amount of laws would have stopped him from stealing the weapons and killing people. So why should those who did not commit these murders have to lose their rights?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is their lives more important than the lives of my family or my self? Why are children's lives more deserving than the life of an adult, we are all humans, we all have the same value of life.

       Even the total amount of gun crime murders in the US is a low number compared to the total population. Now consider the mass shootings. They are isolated incidents but none the less still horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been 62 mass shooting since 1982-2012.

       Well, in all fairness, it's only nonsense if you're technically adept enough in the particular subject (astrophysics and photography/filmography). Layman it seems completely plausible that it would have been faked in spite of how silly such a notion really is.

       Exactly! People who keep their mind open to other possibilities than the ones we are presented with are often look at negatively, when in fact it is the only reasonable way to observe the world.

       I've seen that, but I actually meant Joe Rogan Experience #232 with Giorgio Tsoukalos, where he is agreeing about alien visitations and partaking in stone construction in ancient times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was partly joking though, it's just Joes style throughout the podcast series he doesn't call any of his guests' bullshit, and tends to agree to at least some degree with all of them.

       A little late here, and this is with reference to junkmale's comment, but I think there's a huge difference there because Joe readily admits he's not a historian, as he talks to a historian. So by conceding and asking good questions instead of stroking his own ego he provides an environment where alternative ideas can be expressed freely. If he talked over people with barely any info and espoused his own ideas before others... he'd be just another Piers Morgan.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a long way to go to say we shouldn't "trust" someone because they present themselves as not as informed when they interview scientists and researchers. That's ridiculous.

       Tell that to Jaime Kilstein. Joe tore him a new one. But seriously, you're correct. I like the fact that Joe lets the guest get their point out and then later on brings on another guest to contradict or provide another viewpoint.

       You can look at my user activity, and it's quite clear that after a long while of other activities I found r/conspiracy. That should be evidence enough.

       You and other r/conpiracy users who see shills everywhere instead of debating evidence are a clear indication that dogma is more important to you than finding truth. The exact thing you claim to fight against is actually at the core of your world view.

       your arguments for the official conspiracy theory of sept. 11 say the opposite.   my world view is based on limited perspective naturally.  this is why I entertain discussion and argument, while you shills only parrot the official story, seemingly without question.

       my apologies if you are merely indoctrinated and suffering from Stockholm Syndrome.  I  hope you get well soon.

       You're wrong. Americans are more productive than ever, more educated than ever, smarter than ever, and poorer than ever. Young people simply want middle class jobs and participation in the American economy. That's not entitlement, that's the core of the American Dream. It's very un-American to denigrate your fellow citizens as such, and it shows your profound anti-American values.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that there is increasing automation and competition from overseas markets. The wealth and opportunities available to previous generations no longer exist to the same degree for younger Americans. I.e. no longer is it possible to graduate with a GED, work only 40 hours a week, and receive 50K plus benefits with job security.

      <pre><code>The economy created just 80,000 jobs in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. But that same month, 85,000 workers left the workforce entirely to enroll in the Social Security Disability Insurance program, according to the Social Security Administration.

The disability ranks have outpaced job growth throughout President Obama's recovery. While the economy has created 2.6 million jobs since June 2009, fully 3.1 million workers signed up for disability benefits.

In other words, the number of new disability enrollees has climbed 19% faster than the number of jobs created during the sluggish recovery. (Even after accounting for people who left the disability program because they died or aged into retirement, disability ranks have climbed more than 1.1 million in the past three years.)

And the disability ranks will continue to swell. In just the last month, almost 275,000 put in applications for disability benefits. Experts say that more people try to get on disability when jobs are scarce, and changes to eligibility rules enacted back in 1984 have made it far easier to qualify.

       Stanhope is even MORE of a legend, as far as comedy he's the closest thing we have to Bill Hicks or a George Carlin anymore, or a Hunter S. Thompson for that matter. Stanhope is also Joe's favorite comedian besides Joey Diaz. I think Doug has had a HUGE influence on Joe's standup and his overall thought process, that's why they get along so well. This is worth the read.

       He didn't pay for unemployment, the employer pays for unemployment.  I don't think there is anything in the breakdown of my check that says "unemployment insurance" because I don't pay a damn thing, my employer does.  You can claim that's part of my compensation I guess but I think that's missing the point.  Beyond that, the extended unemployment benefits that came from federal money after the recent recession was not from a fund that was paid into.  The federal government supplemented people's unemployment insurance for an extra 18 months iirc?  That came straight out of our tax dollars.  Now I'm not saying that it was a bad program as there were people out there who were definitely hurting.  I also know people first hand who used that extension to take an extended holiday.

       How about we stop knee jerk reaction to singular incidents and stop punishing legal owners for the acts of those who were in the majority of cases not legally able to own.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I drive my truck through the buss stop tomorrow killing 21 kids and 15 adults will you be fine with the new laws which restrict the ownership of vehicles, but only big scary vehicles, especially if they are black in color or have flames on them, cause those with flames are so much more dangerous.
      </p>

       You are wanting everyone to jump through a bunch of BS hoops that do absolutely nothing to stop those who once again, do not follow the law, and as such care little for your happy little scenario there.

       Economics is a science which, in its current incarnation, exists merely to justify the raping of the weak by the strong.

       Wow, seriously? You're just going to flat out accuse him of not being able to pass a background check because you disagree with his point of view? You should be ashamed of yourself, sir. Bad form.

       actually, a troll's purpose is to distract and confuse; I have stayed on topic and brought up relevant points; relevant points that you are unable or unwilling to address and thus you use the primest logical fallacy of them all; attack the character instead of the argument. Go ahead and live the rest of your life scared to death of the invisible spaghetti monster thats trying to eat you; little do you know that YOU are that spaghetti monster; the same greed that drives economic progress is the same greed you feel, as a human being, we all experience these emotions; but to exclude them from yourself, to act as if the problem is "out there, with other people" is wrong, the problems you fear so much are moreso a product of your own internal dialogue with yourself, not so much based on facts or evidence or real-world observations. Economic's purpose is not to rape; the governments purpose is not to rape; yet you preach these things with fearful undertones.

       and for future reference; I dont troll; I rage; usually triggered by disgracefully stupid comments that people make online; like your whole BS rant on economics is meant to rape us; like wtf, you dont understand economics, or anything else probably
