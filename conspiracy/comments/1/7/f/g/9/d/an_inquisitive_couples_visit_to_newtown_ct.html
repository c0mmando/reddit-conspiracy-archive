       I applaud the attempt but this is pretty worthless info. I'm not sure why this wasn't documented better. When they asked if the town was known for satanism and someone responded "yea I can believe that" why didn't they then ask follow up questions like "what do you mean? Why can you believe that? What have you seen/heard?". No attempt to talk to neighbors. They got the runaround from the bee and the police.

       Yeah, I mean when I went to the projects I asked some shady looking hoods if this area was into guns and drugs, and they said 'yea I can believe that'  So I kept pressing them for more specific info you know.. just to satisfy a troll on a message board.

       I find this to be the most interesting part of the blog.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gene Rosen lives next door to the fire house. Thus Ms. Victoria Soto’s students that landed on Mr. Rosen’s yard had to come down Dickenson Drive and turn right, passing the fire house, to get to Mr. Rosen’s.

       And, for those that don't know, this is James Tracy's blog.  He is the vilified FAU professor.

       Interesting blog. It seems like living in Newtown, CT today is like some kind of daily mindfuck. To continuously run tragedy through the frontal lobe of the brain sounds similar to some questionable experiments I've read about...
      </p>
      <p>
       The banners, the signs, the boarded up building, the constant barrage of legitimate and false media inquiries. At what point does it stop being a source of pride and comfort and become a demoralizing acceptance of victimization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone remember anything like this with other school shootings? Did they board up and tear down the Theatre in Colorado?  Did they cover it with pictures and flags from around the world? Did the Amish allow this type of influence after the Nickel Mines shooting?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fenced in, boarded up school reminded me of Chernobyl.

       You know how the media doesn't show Streakers on TV. At Sports games, the guys that strip and run across the field. Because it would create a Streaker Culture, an identity and fame that streakers everywhere could relate with and value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Streaking is innocent and silly, yet it is not shown. 
Killing children is horrifying, and shown on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the media did not cover these things would they happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm being superficial, I know enough reasons why this town is decorated, and why the media feast is ongoing, and even why the conspiracy is fed by the perps.

       No I personally think the coverage can be handled much differently and more responsibly. But your on the right track IMO.

       And some of the family members of victims are pissed because the first acknowledgment or outreach some of them received from the theatre was an invite to their grand reopening with free movie passes. Can't remember where I heard this unfortunately...

Clark would not address this report and became very agitated with me “interrogating” him. “I don’t intend to discuss this any further with you,” he said. Mr. Clark then referred me to the Newtown Police for any additional questions. As I was walking out of the office I overheard a lady on the phone explaining to a caller that “there is an ongoing investigation,” and referring the caller to Snopes.com.

       WTF?! Why are professional law enforcement personnel referring inquiries to a debunking site with a known agenda? That's irregular, to say the least.

       Masonic Lodges aren't uncommon in moderate size towns. I believe it's rare for a small township to have one of it's own. Even more rare to be sporting the

       As someone from the Dayton Ohio area, I can tell you that we have a large temple downtown as well as small temples in some of the small towns surrounding the city. So I wasn't surprised, but I'm not sure how it works anywhere else in America.

        My partner and I spoke with a couple in their early twenties for an hour or so. They were life long locals.

Later, I mentioned that I had read online where some people had suggested that Newtown might have a lively Satanic community. One of the two locals remarked, “I could believe that.”

       Loads of people in loads of small to moderate sized towns with wooded areas, probably. It's not at all an unusual kind of rumor. I've lived in more than one town where dopes would claim they heard that Satanists hang out in the woods and do rituals. It's silly but common small town scuttlebutt.

       This is a great little read... I suggest reading it... sounds like an interesting day out. There is an eerie quality about it - the way no one will talk about anything openly. Then there is the mention of Satanism, which I honestly never thought of (regarding this case at least) until I read it there... But then I found this (mainstream media reports that Adam Lanza worshipped Satan, according to a classmate):

       Amazing, right? I never knew this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this one really starts smelling of MK Ultra. The fact that the Mother was also a very quiet person, that no one had seen Adam Lanza for three years... the rabbit hole just goes deeper and deeper...

       And check this video out... wow... that's all I can say...

       Oh, please. They have heard that Newton has a lively "Satanic" community and post a picture of the sign of the local mason's lodge to somehow underscore that utterly nonsensical statement. Just about every town in Connecticut has a masonic lodge and none of them are linked to satanism.

       Many towns might have "communities" of Satanists, but I suspect that many of those communities consist of a couple of gothy high school kids acting out against their parents. Spiritual forces, unfortunately, do not have a very good track record as provable phenomena.

       While I fully advocate maintaining a healthy skepticism, there is a point where such skepticism turns unhealthy. And pretty much by definition, those of us who have accepted that the Newton School Shootings were a real thing don't really have a lot of probative questions about what happened there. Most of us are willing to accept the fact that an unbalanced individual perpetrated a monstrous crime.

       Then it would be logical to pursue healthy skepticism, at least until the facts are reconciled.  If there were never any questions, people would assume that the twin towers and Benghazi attacks happening on 9-11 were just random occurrences.

       Or maybe it was CIA mind control lasers, or secret plots by the Federal Reserve to avoid having his dad testify about LIBOR, or the Seal Team Six acting on orders so that Obama can steal our guns, etc, et al. It is increasingly troubling to me that with all of the real nightmarish bullshit going on in the world, that people become so invested in these dark, surrealist fantasies, none of which should hold up to scrutiny by a reasonable person for more than a few minutes. Yet here we are, pretending that these ideas aren't completely divorced from reality and that they somehow deserve a response. I guess I just must be one of the sheeple, who hasn't raised their consciousness enough to -really- see what is going on in the world.

       Yeah, but it is a sufficiently unlikely scenario that it isn't worth spending a lot of time worrying about it, in my opinion. There are actual things going on right now that people should be paying attention and I find it distressing that people who are obviously concerned and dedicated, spend so much time with things like Newton conspiracies.

       I agree with this mostly, and I haven't devoted too much time to it, but I still like looking at alternative viewpoints and I appreciate people who are putting effort into it. No harm there, and yeah there are a lot of bad things that have been perpetrated the last few decades but for every event there is somebody saying looking into it is a waste of time

       No one in this particular article said those things, but that is surely the subtext. That some sinister plot had unfolded in Newton and that if we just pull the right strings, it will all become clear. There have been many many threads in this sub and around the net in general that suggest the very things that I referenced (well, maybe not mind control lasers, but drugs assuredly.) But you are right, I should have instead referenced the satanist/Freemason angle included in the blog post to be fair.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are the one who accused me of sheepledom, and even though you didn't use the term, I heard the dog whistle.

       What, exactly, were the questions being asked by this couple? Were they about firearm safety and how to address our calamitous mental health system? Or were they there to try to find out who was Concealing The Truth from the public (Masonic satanists perhaps.) They may be just asking questions, but they are leading, pointed questions that play to their biases about shadowy manipulators.

       And man, I wish I had a nickle for every time someone trots out Operation Northwoods or uses the term 'False Flag' like they are some sort of intelligence officer with all of the jargon readily at hand.

       Yeah, especially when you prop up your own ridiculous explanations and shoot em down.  That's what shills do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You present alternative explanations in the place of investigation and questions.  You accept the narrative as it was told to you even though there is good reason not to trust the lies based on previous experience.

       All of the things that I mentioned have been discussed posts on this very forum with (drugs taking the place of mind control lasers.) So..what is the theory then? What happened at Newton what accumulation of evidence merits questioning the commonly accepted timeline of events?

       I don't think asking questions that should be asked can hardly be considered harassment.  Besides, the police are the ones that should be answering the tough questions ...its blatantly obvious that the news channels haven't been able to get the story right, and would rather just make up bullshit to fill in the gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the police, and the media were more up front and honest about things, perhaps we wouldn't have a nation full of people questioning what they hear on the news.  Especially when facts don't seem to add up, and the "official story" seems to be ever changing, but only becoming more cloudy instead of becoming more clear.
