       No, I'm serious.  He looks like somebody.  Though even the grouping and his position in it looks vaguely familiar so maybe I'm imagining it.

       Funny how people still look at facebook for the end all be all on social networking sites.  Up to what about 6 years ago people were still using MySpace.  14 years old using MySpace not uncommon.  I know with the change over to Entertainment it's different now.  Didn't they keep all the other information?

       something to consider: i'm in my twenties, lead a pretty active work/social life and, incidentally, i've had my picture taken maybe, oh, four or five times over the past two years, as my facebook profile can attest to. and some of those are just blurry pics of me in the background at a party. some people just don't have much of a photographic record, y'know?

       Well the guy didn't have any friends. There was one girl who said she tried to be friends with him at the college but he made it impossible. His mom probably had all the pics and she's dead. His brother hadn't even spoken to him in a year. I doubt that even if he had a facebook that he would be posting duckface bathroom pictures on it.

       Other pics of him are when he was like 10 years old.

       The only reason someone that age wouldn't keep pictures of themselves for over two years would be government agency intervention.

       No, I'm saying it doesn't have to be a public diary, but when the only two pictures they have of him just happen to look exactly like a mass murderer... you should question the whole story.

       There's not just lack of photos, there's NO TRACE OF HIM for 3 years. It's just impossible unless he has been living in the forest of brazil and traveled there via teleportation. No taxes, no car payments, no insurance payments, no internet history at all, nobody sees him enter or leave his house, nobody saw him buy toilet paper/gum/a drink from the a local store. Nuthin'

       Also I'm not sure about this but I believe they reported that he was a sophomore and then SOMEHOW got accepted to a university...not sure what Uni accepts high school sophomores.

       if he was home schooled then i could see how he was accepted into college as a sophomore because of the usually accelerated courses they take. but there are plenty of programs that take sophomores into college.

      <p>
       look into the Duke TIPS and TAMS programs.

       Also, the FBI is tremendous when it comes to recovering hard drive data. I just seriously doubt he would know precisely how to destroy his hard drive so much so that NOTHING can be recovered from it. Also he would have no motive to hide the information, he clearly didn't plan on living so there's no way whatever found on that could harm him after the fact that he's fucking dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again, it's all a hoax.

       Once you physically stop a hard drive from being able to spin up (ie hammering nails through the platters), nothing can be recovered from it. And a teenager suffering from anxiety and mental illness would have plenty of reason to destroy a drive full of potentially embarrassing data. This could hold true, especially if he wanted to be remembered as an infamous monster and not, for instance, some weirdo who masturbated to furry porn in front of a webcam.

       Thats not true. You can read the data from the platter.

       yea the media wants you to believe that it's because there was incriminating evidence, which if there was then why would he commit a crime with no escape. i heard somewhere that it could have contained evidence that he was innocent/controlled/manipulated into this.
