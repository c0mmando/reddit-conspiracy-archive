It&#39;s just impossible unless he has been living in the forest of brazil and traveled there via teleportation. No taxes, no car payments, no insurance payments, no internet history at all, nobody sees him enter or leave his house, nobody saw him buy toilet paper/gum/a drink from the a local store.

<p>Also I&#39;m not sure about this but I believe they reported that he was a sophomore and then SOMEHOW got accepted to a university...not sure what Uni accepts high school sophomores.</p>
