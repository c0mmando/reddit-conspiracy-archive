       about psychedelic powers behind shrooms and about connection between religions and spiritual experience on ("bad") drugs.
      </p>

       Judaism
      </p>
      <p>
       In Jewish tradition, the Tree of Knowledge and the eating of its fruit represents the beginning of the mixture of good and evil together. Before that time, the two were separate, and evil had only a nebulous existence in potentia. While free choice did exist before eating the fruit, evil existed as an entity separate from the human psyche, and it was not in human nature to desire it. Eating and internalizing the forbidden fruit changed this and thus was born the yeitzer hara, the Evil Inclination.[4][5]
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity
      </p>
      <p>
       In Christian theology, consuming the fruit of the tree of knowledge was the original sin committed by Adam and Eve that subsequently became known as the Fall of man in Genesis 2-3.
In Catholicism, Augustine of Hippo taught that the tree should be understood both symbolically and as a real tree - similarly to Jerusalem being both a real city and a figure of Heavenly Jerusalem.[18] Augustine underlined that the fruits of that tree were not evil by themselves, because everything that God created was good (Gen 1:12). It was disobedience of Adam and Eve, who had been told by God not to eat of the tree (Gen 2:17), that was obnoxious and caused disorder in the creation,[19] thus humanity inherited sin and guilt from Adam and Eve's sin.[20]
In Western Christian art, the fruit of the tree is commonly depicted as the apple, which originated in central Asia. This depiction may have originated as a Latin pun: by eating the malum (apple), Eve contracted mƒÅlum (evil).[21] or simply because of religious artists' poetic licence.

The Qur'an does not name this tree and it is always referred to as "the tree". Muslims believe that when God created Adam and Eve, He told them that they could enjoy everything in the Garden but this tree, and so, Satan appeared to them and told them that the only reason God forbade them to eat from that tree is that they would become Angels or become immortals.
When they ate from this tree their nakedness appeared to them and they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden. As a result of their sin, they were removed from heaven and placed on Earth to live and die. Consequently, they repented to God and asked for his forgiveness and were forgiven. It was decided that those who obey God and follow his path shall be rewarded with everlasting life in Heaven, and those who disobey God and stray away from his path shall be punished in Hell.
God in Quran (Al-A'raf 27) states: "[O] Children of Adam! Let not Satan tempt you as he brought your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their garments to show them their shameful parts. Surely he [Satan] sees you, he and his tribe, from where you see them not. We have made the Satans the friends of those who do not believe."

       I've been saying this for the longest time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manna in the bible is the mushroom. First appearing to the israelites coming out of the ground, out of a frost like hoar, appearing like bdellium and having a pearl like shine. Later on, Jesus said he was the living manna and anyone who ate his flesh would have eternal life. Hence, Jesus lives in the mushroom.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Allegro said that there were some people growing mushrooms in caves, and the name Jesus could have been the name they gave it. Or Jesus was a shaman giving people the experience of the mushroom. Or both. As he became more popular, he didn't have enough of it to give the people, and I believe that is where the 'turning water into wine' story comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Jesus was there to talk about God, he was under the influence of mushrooms.. and he would share them with the people, saying it was his flesh. On the water to wine occasion, the crowd was so large, that he was not able to supply everyone with the flesh, so he made a mushroom tea and spiked the water. This is his blood. Everyone who drank the water had slight effects and understanding of a higher consciousness, belief and faith. They ate much less food that evening, because their appetite was suppressed by the mushroom, allowing a fish and a loaf of bread to feed a large amount of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, eat mushrooms and go to church... I guarantee you it will be a divine experience. Or don't. It's all subjective.

       I know the Bible pretty well, but if you were to just point out one single thing, I could elaborate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some facts may be wrong, but it's not about facts. It's about the story and what I believe to be the manna. I'm not saying you should believe it, or anyone else should for that matter, I'm just saying what I have interpreted through my readings.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Old Testament, in Exodus 16, it talks about manna and gives a description. If you have ever grown mushrooms (I have) or seen them grow, you will understand that it grows from mycelium, which looks very similar to hoar frost.
      </p>
      <p>
       In John 6:51 Jesus makes the reference to Manna, saying that he himself is the living manna. John 6 is where I refer to Jesus turning water into wine. Again, this is my belief on the metaphor of the story. In my opinion, the bible is a metaphor, giving subjective experiences of a greater experience, with hopes that everyone will gain the same knowledge from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you could point me to what you are saying is incorrect, I'd gladly give you what I believe on it. Otherwise, your name calling is unnecessary and added absolutely nothing to the conversation. I'd hope that in the future, you can clarify your argument on a much more 'solid foundation.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  If you would have only pointed on a few things, this would be much easier on me. But I see that I added the water to wine story a little after it had already happened. It happened in John 2, but I still have the same theory on how the water was turned into wine.

       You tied 'jumbled mess' and 'sounding like a babbling crazy person' in the same paragraph and it did offend me. I accept your clarification and consider it an apology.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was young, I was not taught the correct bible in bible study all of the time and some times I get called out on my sources being incorrect. This is one of those situations where everything I say stands as is, but I will add links and clarify my thoughts further and I'd appreciate your input since I'm taking the time to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, I was thinking the feast was part of the wedding, but I do stand corrected. The feast did happen in the same chapter, John, but it was before the distribution of the bread and the fishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the wedding in
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202:3-11&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 2
       </a>
       , they ran out of wine and Jesus asked for the water to be brought out. Back in those days, water was probably boiled to kill any bacteria, so I believe that Jesus saw the opportunity to place mushrooms into the water as soon as it was noticed there was no more wine. He then asked the servants to bring out the water. In my bible, KJV, it says no one knew what it was, but the servants did.
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+2%3A11&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 2:11
       </a>
       'The beginning of miracles did Jesus...' It also basically said that the best wine was saved for last. There is so much more in that passage as well that I would love to discuss if you are interested. (Like Jesus' mom being there, telling him to do something about running out of wine, telling the servants to do anything he asked, the servants really knowing what's in the water, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2016:15&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        Exodus 16:15
       </a>
       the manna was referred to as bread. If you take that same translation of manna and look at
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:48-51&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 6:48-51
       </a>
       , specifically, he said he is the living bread and anyone who eats of this bread lives forever. Right before he said this, he distributed the bread and fish to the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I believe, is that people were unfamiliar with the type of bread that Jesus had carried, so he mixed his bread and the others bread and went around and asked everyone to take a piece. By the time he finished the entire group of people, if my theory is correct, then most people were experiencing the effects. This is when I think the people were not as hungry and that is why he had left-overs, which in
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%206:12-13&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 6:12
       </a>
       he asked that everything be gathered so nothing is lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think it may be possible that this is Jesus being able to transfer his life of the living manna into the barley bread. This could be when Jesus realizes that he is the living bread. He becomes very insistent in
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%206:35-59&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 6:35-59
       </a>
       that he is the living bread and that everyone who partakes will have eternal life. I think it was this sequence of events that led him to understand how powerful he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my personal opinion, it may not have been all magic that led him to find himself, but the magic of the manna. John Hopkins has been doing incredible research that
       <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2011/06/16/magic-mushrooms-can-improve-psychological-health-long-term/">
        connects the magic mushroom to spirituality
       </a>
       and it is known to destroy the ego. I believe that part of the path that God sent Jesus on was finding the secret manna, eating it, destroying his ego and doing the work of God. It is quite possible that manna flowed through his blood as well and he always saw the pureness of the World.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my own personal experiences with 'manna', it has helped me see beyond my way of thinking and definitely helped me connect spiritually to a higher being, which I believe to be God. When I consume the magic mushroom, I do it strictly for spiritual reasons and I have made, what I believe to be, an amazing advancement in my level of consciousness. Which I would define as an increased appreciation for life, existence, feelings, emotions, senses, beauty and best of all

       I didn't get defensive once. I think you should re-read my post as trying to answer your questions. Throughout this entire reply, you have done nothing but scrutinize my theory, but you don't give any reasoning. What do you expect me to reply to?
      </p>
      <p>
       And are you offended that I took your clarification as an apology? If you understand the subjective, you would understand that on your side, it was clarification and on my side, it was an apology. It doesn't mean it has to be an apology for you as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory stands up to scrutiny amongst the people who try to call it a 'bad theory.' Once again, you give absolutely zero evidence that what I am saying is incorrect, yet you continuously tell me I'm wrong? You don't cut the mustard when it comes to being defensive. This is not a 'conspiracy' theory, this is the theory of an individual and the life I live.

       Do you eat mushrooms? Do you read the bible? Do you live the words? As of now, it seems like you are a modern day christian, but nothing like christ.

       And no one knows what you're talking about; it just appears as though you are attacking someone for expressing their opinion. Calm down champ. We are all entitled to believe whatever we want. I think his idea is pretty fucking interesting and cool, even if I don't believe it to be 100% PURE FACTS

       I took a class from Prof. Carl Ruck, while attending Boston University a little over a decade ago.  He coined the term "entheogen."  He has written many interesting books on this topic.  Check out some of his videos on youtube.

       One of the first things he mentions is an extended story of adam and eve.  If his description is anything but complete I would be really interested in reading that.

       Edit: What the fuck?  This guy jumps from relating mushrooms to religious iconography to saying genesis chapter 6 is about the gene manipulation of apes by the annunaki to create man who would be their gold-mining slaves, which it

       The Bible is the definitive end-all source to go to for "things found in the bible," which was the subject at hand.

      <p>
       Can you recommend a better source for determining what is or isn't in the bible than the bible itself?

       Like I said, it's completely subjective. I've lived a life with God and a life without. In my life with, I have been given many things that I would consider gifts of God. Love is one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've grown closer to myself spiritually, I have been able to take a step away from my ego, and see things in a much more loving and accepting way. It was through the words of God, or the bible in this case, that I was led down a path that allowed me to express my love. It's hard to say if all of this would have happened had I not let God into my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, from my subjective place, I believe it is God. From any other individual's subjective place, it could be circumstance, luck, or anything else that is not God. So, really what I think is God is only what I think is God, and what you don't think of as God is exactly that also.

       Good answer. I can't say I agree with your understanding of God and Bible in the context of the universe-at-large, but as long as you're living a life of real love, who am I to judge?

       I read the Bible as a kid because I was forced to, and I read it again as an adult because I wanted to. When I read it as an adult, I realized it's an adult book, talking about experiences that can only be understood as an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point I understood the Bible to be a book of metaphors explaining the same ideas in a number of ways to 'prove the point.' The message of 'love' is always clear and present, yet it gets buried around the words explaining what love is. The way I read the Bible is very different than most Christians read the Bible because I read it as if I am the one it was written for.
      </p>
      <p>
       By reading it like it was meant for me to read, I am able to read the message in a much more direct way, allowing my subjective experience to change the modern day meanings of the Bible into what I believe the original meaning was. It's made a huge difference on my understanding of religion and 'organized' religion. From my perspective, 'organized religion' teaches that there is only one way to interpret the Bible, which is false. The entire World is subjective; even reality.

       How would I go on a better path spiritually? I'm always seeking the truth, so I'm not going to argue with anything you believe subjectively until I can see where you are coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you not think Jesus was important?
      </p>
      <p>
       The God everyone fears in the current religious doctrines is what I assume you are speaking of when you say it is at odds with my peace? To that I say there are people who will live in fear of God and there are those who will live for God. The ones who are living in fear are the ones who are unsure of who they are and the current state of religion takes advantage of that. I disagree with organized religion and I am not a part of it.

       The Bible, metaphorically speaking, is talking about life on a much bigger plane than the human experience. It's a book about the human soul and how it grows from every act of love and peace and how is weakened by acts of judgement or hate.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/17rn02/adam_and_eve_around_the_forbidden_fruit_a_giant/c88bmqs">
        The adam and eve metaphor I talked about on this thread
       </a>
       is an example of one of the many metaphors. I believe the Bible gives details about the most basic elements to life, every human emotion, and answers to life's difficult ethical questions. It's a book about right and wrong.

       Out of 66 books in the bible, Jesus stars in four.  These four are actually just (inconsistent) retellings of the same story.  Reducing repetition, Jesus stars in one book out of 63, hardly a main character.

       I've heard about the amount of time Jesus appears in the Bible, but it's very relative. He wouldn't appear in many other books because he was not alive. Jesus is the climax of the entire story. I will do some more readings about saint paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think God is a terrible role model. I understand all of the behavior he possesses, but he is not limited to that behavior. Through my eyes, God is a great role model and I rarely feel like I am not pleasing him. Most of the negative behavior that is possessed comes when he is not respected. I feel like this is comparable to an ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not respect the ocean and the body of water you are entering when you go playing in the ocean, the waves and water can kill you. Just because it can kill you does not mean that the ocean is something bad, it just means that you have to have the proper knowledge and respect for the ocean before getting into the water. This is how I see God... the knowledge and respect I have for him prevents me the wrath.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that passage is a misinterpretation of the word rape. In hebrew taphas (to catch, handle, lay hold) and shakah (to lie down, to lodge; sexually) were the two words that the word rape was translated from. If our modern day meaning of 'rape' was used, there would be something about a lack of consent and possible struggle. Neither of which are present in the original hebrew text.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the passage relates to a relationship between two people. Young people are not supposed to have sex, but it is known that some will break the rules. If a boy happens to meet a girl who is a virgin and he convinces her to have sex with him, then he is taking something from her that cannot be replaced if they are caught. If they aren't caught, no one will ever know. So if they are caught, the boy must marry the girl and pay the father, because the girl will no longer bring any money into the household. In modern translation, it would be something like, 'Suppose a woman isn't engaged to be married, and a man talks her into sleeping with him. If they are caught...'
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=numbers%205:11-13&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        Number 5:11-13
       </a>
       the word 'shakab' was also translated into the word 'lie' instead of the word 'rape.' Instances like this are exactly why I don't follow modern religion. I believe these mistranslations are purposeful, forcing any outsider who does not believe to point fingers and blame and for the insiders to hold an immoral belief. The Bible is in need of another translation...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we are too off in what we agree on. You've brought up some great points that helped me review my faith, but none of them are strong enough to shake it.  I live a really happy life, full of blessings, in a beautiful home, with a beautiful woman and a magnificent family, so I really don't believe my beliefs are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the book is both right and wrong. It's all subjective. If I was born to pick up a bible first, then it's right, but if I was born to never pick it up, then it's wrong.

       I you have read anything in the new testament that is not directly related to Jesus' activities, you are reading the alleged words and actions of St. Paul.  His perspective and (to a lesser degree) adventures are the focal point of the current scripture.

       That's fantastic.  I don't have issue with your personal spiritual relationship, its the underlying cognitive dissonance about which God you are actually enamored with.  It reminds me of a past self and pains me whenever I come across it.

       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first story Lot, a man of God, offers his daughters as sex slaves to protect visiting angels from gang rape (?).  In the latter, Lot's daughters very plainly plan and execute the incestuous rape of their father.  Is there a metaphorical or semantic excuse for this behavior, and the context in which we are taught it?  What can we understand about how the God of the Bible wants us to act from this passage?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Are women property, or second class citizens?
       </li>
       <li>
        Is hospitality more Godly than protecting your family?
       </li>
       <li>
        Is it even a "bad thing" that Lot's daughters Could have been raped by a large group of men?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That said, given the context of the original passage, it is plain what is meant by rape:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        there would be something about a lack of consent and possible struggle.
       </p>

        previous paragraph
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       While your follow-up explanation is quite well thought out, it fails when placed into the further context of the chapter.  As for your unfortunate reference to Numbers, the context once again casts questionable light on the scripture.  The preamble to your selected passage God demands his children abandon their most sick and weak, a far cry from his usual perceived compassion, as it is lightly implied that the reason for this was his own comfort.  As the passage continues from where your snippet left off, the priests perform and log a voodoo curse on the woman to kill her had she been unfaithful.  This brings up many questions about how God wants us to act, according to his holy book:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Should we abandon our sick and our weak for our own comfort?
       </li>
       <li>
        Does Voodoo work?
       </li>
       <li>
        Do curses work?
       </li>
       <li>
        Should infidelity be punished by death?

      <p>
       Then why would you count it as important?  It, so obviously written and (to your disdain) mistranslated, by imperfect men?  I was brought up to pick up a bible first in times of need or distress.  Eventually I picked it up enough that its contents could no longer fit together in a meaningful way.

       If it truly is as subjective as you indicate, why can't you find God in the leaves of a tree he made rather than a book, allegedly dictated but obviously not read?

       This was a great comment! This philosopher Ken Wilber, talks about how our consciousness of what "God" is evolves all the time. He mentions the differences between the old and new testaments as the evolution of understanding about "God". Speaking in metaphors, the "Christ Consciousness", the Son(children) seen in the New Testament, includes and transcends the view of God from the Old Testament; there was a shift in consciousness that evolved the very concept of God.

       we think we are god. but when you look around does this world look anything like the heaven we are promised? satans job was always to show us the light when we forgot what it looked like. we are living in Revelations or the Revealing. but it does not mean anything is over it means we get to see the light again and move forward or up like the fire...

       You tied 'jumbled mess' and 'sounding like a babbling crazy person' in the same paragraph and it did offend me. I accept your clarification and consider it an apology.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was young, I was not taught the correct bible in bible study all of the time and some times I get called out on my sources being incorrect. This is one of those situations where everything I say stands as is, but I will add links and clarify my thoughts further and I'd appreciate your input since I'm taking the time to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, I was thinking the feast was part of the wedding, but I do stand corrected. The feast did happen in the same chapter, John, but it was before the distribution of the bread and the fishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the wedding in
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202:3-11&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 2
       </a>
       , they ran out of wine and Jesus asked for the water to be brought out. Back in those days, water was probably boiled to kill any bacteria, so I believe that Jesus saw the opportunity to place mushrooms into the water as soon as it was noticed there was no more wine. He then asked the servants to bring out the water. In my bible, KJV, it says no one knew what it was, but the servants did.
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+2%3A11&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 2:11
       </a>
       'The beginning of miracles did Jesus...' It also basically said that the best wine was saved for last. There is so much more in that passage as well that I would love to discuss if you are interested. (Like Jesus' mom being there, telling him to do something about running out of wine, telling the servants to do anything he asked, the servants really knowing what's in the water, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2016:15&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        Exodus 16:15
       </a>
       the manna was referred to as bread. If you take that same translation of manna and look at
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:48-51&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 6:48-51
       </a>
       , specifically, he said he is the living bread and anyone who eats of this bread lives forever. Right before he said this, he distributed the bread and fish to the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I believe, is that people were unfamiliar with the type of bread that Jesus had carried, so he mixed his bread and the others bread and went around and asked everyone to take a piece. By the time he finished the entire group of people, if my theory is correct, then most people were experiencing the effects. This is when I think the people were not as hungry and that is why he had left-overs, which in
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%206:12-13&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 6:12
       </a>
       he asked that everything be gathered so nothing is lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think it may be possible that this is Jesus being able to transfer his life of the living manna into the barley bread. This could be when Jesus realizes that he is the living bread. He becomes very insistent in
       <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%206:35-59&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        John 6:35-59
       </a>
       that he is the living bread and that everyone who partakes will have eternal life. I think it was this sequence of events that led him to understand how powerful he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my personal opinion, it may not have been all magic that led him to find himself, but the magic of the manna. John Hopkins has been doing incredible research that
       <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2011/06/16/magic-mushrooms-can-improve-psychological-health-long-term/">
        connects the magic mushroom to spirituality
       </a>
       and it is known to destroy the ego. I believe that part of the path that God sent Jesus on was finding the secret manna, eating it, destroying his ego and doing the work of God. It is quite possible that manna flowed through his blood as well and he always saw the pureness of the World.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my own personal experiences with 'manna', it has helped me see beyond my way of thinking and definitely helped me connect spiritually to a higher being, which I believe to be God. When I consume the magic mushroom, I do it strictly for spiritual reasons and I have made, what I believe to be, an amazing advancement in my level of consciousness. Which I would define as an increased appreciation for life, existence, feelings, emotions, senses, beauty and best of all
