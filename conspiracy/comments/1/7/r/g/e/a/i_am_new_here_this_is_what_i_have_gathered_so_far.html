       Basically, I see this government to be extremely corrupt. There are talks about the Illuminati being behind all of this. Also stuff about the masons being the Illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am unsure if I believe that the Illuminati exist. I still have yet to explore more into that subject. BUT I fathom the possibility of it existing and the implications of it. If I accept the fact that there is a powerful force behind all the politics here in the US, everything would make so much more sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the evil in America. I see the evil in Politics. I truly know that Satan is lord of this earth. If he didn't have power over this earth, then why did he offer everything to Jesus? He only had to bow down and worship him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see policies being enacted in America and I just think, "Why?".
No sane person would be ok with these. I turn around and look at my colleagues but they aren't looking forward. They are staring at the TV. Entranced in its deception. Superbowl. Hockey. AMERICAN IDOL. They aren't seeing what I am seeing. They could, though,  if they looked away from what they deem to be more pleasurable.  But they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should all strive to be as informed as possible. Learn something new everyday. Keep those who are above us, legit. Keep them on their toes so that they know we are watching them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all seems useless though. I feel, in my heart, that there is something big coming and there is nothing I can do to stop it. No one around me cares about anything but what is happening on TV or there latest comedy show. I am a big fan of Dr. Who, Sherlock, and Star Trek but I don't use those to escape this corrupt world around me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have recently watched a show called "Greatest Magic Secrets Revealed". So much effort to fool the audience amazes me. I feel like the government is the greatest magician of them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going crazy!!
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR   I feel like I am going crazy because I see things that people around me refuse to look at.

       From what I have found, basically, there are some Satanists that are extremely rich and powerful and are doing specific actions to bring forth a one world government and to rule everyone.
      </p>

       I am always the skeptic though. I don't believe most of the stuff I hear but I find the implications of such things entertaining to me.

       It's very apparent you are influenced by the right wing evangelical echo chamber and despite everything they tell you about the evils of outside ideas, reading a few non religious inspired authors' work is not an unforgivable hell worthy offense.  What are you currently reading?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have time to go too into this, but a good deal of the stuff I'm hearing in your post and these comments are echoes from past conspiracies to influence people.  I won't go as far back as the foundations of theism, it's unnecessary in your case.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, can you tell me what is wrong with a one world government?  I'm not asking about a tyrannical one world government brought about by force and trickery to oppress the human crop and milk us of labor and wealth while ending all religion and free thought; nothing like that... just simply what would be wrong if everyone was part of a global community?  Don't give me the often repeated rant about how all utopian experiments of the past were tyrannical failures that caused misery and death; I'm not talking about utopia, I'm just talking about a different way of doing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think satanists are rich and powerful people trying to bring about a one world government?  Why do they want to do this?  Is this something you were told?  Is it some conclusion you think you came to on your own?
      </p>
      <p>
       A good deal of this kind of talk is an echo from the past when religion was used to justify the excesses of this country.  Slavery, exploited labor, robber barons, nationalism, racism, land grabs, genocide, corporate colonialism, consumer capitalism, class division, elitism, greed, and so much more... there is a long tradition of religion being perverted by those in power to rationalize subverting the rest of us.  This intensified during the Cold War propaganda that lasted for over an entire generation; us capitalists blessed by the one true god to defend the world from the godless commies and nuclear annihilation... it was some horrifyingly potent shit, it warped many brains for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not attacking Christianity here, just attacking this simplified version of it that I am seeing in your words.  Step out of the propaganda version of your faith, read some other stuff for awhile and take a step back to see things more broadly, even if briefly.  If you are really seeking to understand worldly affairs, you are not going to do so solely from a cartoonish spiritual vantage point.

       I am still discovering myself and what is around me. I have so many theories in my head and I can't prove or disprove anything. I am on a journey to discover the "why" and "how " on a lot of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a strong faith in God and Jesus. I am in a quest to study as much as early century church as possible. Most of the churches that I 
see have fallen away from Jesus' teachings. In short, treat one another like you want to be treated because there is something after this life on earth. Jesus shows us an example how to act on this planet so that we can show the love for others just like How God loves us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion today is extremely perverted. So much so, that I think there are only a few groups of people that understand this message of love and try their best to show others through their actions. I understand how you might feel that I need to step back from the propaganda of my faith, it what I am saying is that I see it, I know it's there, I see the perversion and understand it. I disagree with it entirely. Don't even get me started on Catholics. But I digress, everyone I see is my brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see two distinct views. One, this life on earth is temporary. There is going to be an afterlife so treat everything and everyone here with love and share. Two, this life on earth is all we got. So get what you can despite how you treat the ones around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love and hate. Good and evil. Why is the love of money the root of all evil? Because it gets you stuff here on earth. Instead of using it as a tool to help those around you, you hoard it and get more to satisfy your hunger and needs. America loves money. No question about it. Look at all the TV shows available to watch these days. It is mostly about either seeing someone achieve their dreams of being rich and famous or laughing at the ones who miserably fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, with my talks with a few Satanists, I have been discussing the possibility that other gods tried their hand at creating humans because they thought they could do it better. Different races co existing with God's race, the Jews. That could be one reason why lineage was so important in scriptures. Could explain how there were different beings on earth before. It could explain a lot of things. Hitler uses religion to kill the Jews, God's chosen people, and try to find that one race that was superior to all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a teacher and I always stress to my students to never take anyone's word for anything, always ask for a source, be able to justify what you believe, always be aware of your surroundings, don't watch tv, and above all, always ask why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always ask questions to my students. Teaching, really, is asking the right questions. I have become pretty good at asking those questions that I began to ask my self questions to see if I can find answers,
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your words. I understand it is easy to get carried away with theories and possibilities so I call on my friends and brothers here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I'd be interested in seeing some sources discussing this. I'm sure you have heard of Jack Parsons and his Babalon Working that he performed with Frater H (L. Ron Hubbard)? That man's life always fascinated me, as does the work of directors like Polanski and Kubrick - their work has been associated with occult orders that are arguably "Satanic" in nature.

       The people who get upset and frightened about this stuff generally know little to nothing about the true nature of the things that they're reading about.

       Polanski and Kubrick. Yum. When things are labeled "satanic" always brings up a red flag for me. I find that Most of the time it is paranoid people desperately trying to find something that fits their views and then declare it Satanic so that they can limit it's distribution.

       Relax, or you might really go crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you "truly know" that "satan is lord of this earth," then that's that, there's your "one conspiracy to rule them all."  You can chill out, you got your answer, everything else is just trickle down corruption from lord satan and you can't do a damned thing about magical beings who are part of a magical plan set in motion by a magical being.  I personally hope you just mean all that stuff metaphorically or symbolically or something, but if not, shit, it's been figured out already and there's nothing left to do but "let go and let god."  Get on with your life; work, play, love, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to be serious, there are many conspirators and groups of conspirators and they are in competition with each other.  There isn't a simple man behind the curtain explanation for anything that once exposed and stopped will fix things.  Do some serious research for awhile, read a VARIETY of material from a variety of perspectives, and triangulate a better perspective of things from multiple viewpoints.  Think for yourself.  Don't go online asking to be fed answers from strangers.  Learn to think critically and understand logic.  Understand logic is only as good as the data you have.  Don't let things get to you too much, and if you notice they are you need to take a break from this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all this, then start figuring out what you can do about the things you learned.  Take my advice with a grain of salt, I have not provided the answers you seek.  It's best you do your homework yourself.  Also, the internet is a supplement, not a replacement for books.

       This has nothing to do with Satan or Jesus. This has everything to do with people. HUMAN BEINGS. People can be evil. People can hate. People can be greedy. It does not mean that something outside of their power is making them act like that. They are making their own choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily for people who are awake, we have a choice to be the exact opposite. We have the choice to love, to be happy, and to help others. Don't let what is happening around the world and in the U.S. affect you. You create the world around you. The change has to be from within before anything. Everyone has things to work through, we just need to learn how to let go.

       The government is the entertainment division of the military industrial complex. Mainstream media is their most powerful indoctrination tool.

       You're not crazy, it's only a matter of time before the people around you will be looking for answers. You can never force someone to change, rather be the change and sooner or later others will notice. Time to look within for you answers.

       It's very apparent you are influenced by the right wing evangelical echo chamber and despite everything they tell you about the evils of outside ideas, reading a few non religious inspired authors' work is not an unforgivable hell worthy offense.  What are you currently reading?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have time to go too into this, but a good deal of the stuff I'm hearing in your post and these comments are echoes from past conspiracies to influence people.  I won't go as far back as the foundations of theism, it's unnecessary in your case.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, can you tell me what is wrong with a one world government?  I'm not asking about a tyrannical one world government brought about by force and trickery to oppress the human crop and milk us of labor and wealth while ending all religion and free thought; nothing like that... just simply what would be wrong if everyone was part of a global community?  Don't give me the often repeated rant about how all utopian experiments of the past were tyrannical failures that caused misery and death; I'm not talking about utopia, I'm just talking about a different way of doing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think satanists are rich and powerful people trying to bring about a one world government?  Why do they want to do this?  Is this something you were told?  Is it some conclusion you think you came to on your own?
      </p>
      <p>
       A good deal of this kind of talk is an echo from the past when religion was used to justify the excesses of this country.  Slavery, exploited labor, robber barons, nationalism, racism, land grabs, genocide, corporate colonialism, consumer capitalism, class division, elitism, greed, and so much more... there is a long tradition of religion being perverted by those in power to rationalize subverting the rest of us.  This intensified during the Cold War propaganda that lasted for over an entire generation; us capitalists blessed by the one true god to defend the world from the godless commies and nuclear annihilation... it was some horrifyingly potent shit, it warped many brains for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not attacking Christianity here, just attacking this simplified version of it that I am seeing in your words.  Step out of the propaganda version of your faith, read some other stuff for awhile and take a step back to see things more broadly, even if briefly.  If you are really seeking to understand worldly affairs, you are not going to do so solely from a cartoonish spiritual vantage point.
