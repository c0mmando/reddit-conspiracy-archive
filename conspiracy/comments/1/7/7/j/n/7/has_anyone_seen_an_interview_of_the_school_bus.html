<p>We don&#39;t know the names of the children he <del>held captive</del> harboured, we don&#39;t know the parents, we don&#39;t know the man and the woman who supposedly left the kids on his lawn, the woman who he sadistically recounted had a &quot;face like stone&quot; when he told her he didn&#39;t have her child. The man is a creepy fucker, and he makes my skin crawl.</p>

<p>And yes, since Rosen&#39;s house is adjacent to the Firehouse, how can he pretend he didn&#39;t know what was going on - there were hundreds of cars  backed up on the road, sirens etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you asking me? Ask the police, they&#39;re the ones with all the disinfo. I haven&#39;t seen any dead people, young or old. The cop at the press conference twice stated that there was 2 people with lower body wounds recovering at the hospital. The hospital however stated they had no sandy hook victims, so now they disappeared without a trace.  Like I said, ask the cops about the two people that were injured, and also how many people actually died. When you get an answer get back to us.</p>

When the kids showed up out of breath and sitting in an orderly circle, he didn&#39;t put 2 and 2 together with the sounds of the shots? The kids escaped, ran part of the way down the road, were picked up by a bus driver, who then dropped them off next door to the firehouse on Gene&#39;s lawn? Where did the driver park the bus while he/she/it was inside Gene&#39;s house for half an hour? They did not hear 100+ emergency vehicles from every available agency in the county or call 911 the entire time the kids were in his house? The police didn&#39;t show up to question the kids? For all Gene&#39;s wailing and crying, not one teardrop or tissue? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. Rosen never mentioned it, but It would stand to reason that the bus driver that left the kids there would make mention of it in the interview you posted.</p>

<p>You need to relax my friend.  All this snide bullshit of yours isn&#39;t going anywhere.  I understand your disdain for misinformation but approaching the subject the way you have been in this thread is outright childish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was that according to Rosens story?  Because in the interview you posted this woman is just &quot;a former bus driver&quot;.  And she never says anything that would lead anyone to believe that she was the bus driver in question.</p>

<p>If my memory serves, you would be correct and I misspoke.  But still she has not been identified, and nothing in that video leads me to believe they are the same bus driver.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, former bus driver for sandy hook elementary. She had just retired after 16 years because as owner/operator of the school bus she only made $15/hr working 6 hours a day 170 days a year and the school couldn&#39;t afford to pay her more.</p>
