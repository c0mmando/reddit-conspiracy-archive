        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Forgive me if this has been covered before, but why doesn&#39;t Adam Lanza have an online footprint AT ALL? No accounts for anything? 
This is very similar to James Holmes as well who had one dating account that was suspiciously and conveniently foreshadowing his &quot;plans&quot;.
Is this part of the profile of someone who would do something like these guys reportedly did? 
I&#39;m just not buying the fact Adam Lanza wasn&#39;t on a message board, forum, dating site, social site, SOMETHING. </p>

<p>Also, this whole not being seen since 2009 is pretty strange as well. Has anyone explained why? </p>

<p>Usually the media are scum sucking bastards who will stop at nothing for exclusive interviews. We saw interviews the week after - but after that, the thing has been shut down media wise. Is it because there is no news? It doesn&#39;t stop CNN, FOX, whoever from reporting on other subjects with no relevance. The James Holmes news has been on lockdown as well. </p>

<p>For the record - most of the conspiracy shit I have seen is complete and utter garbage/misinformation, however, I do think there are still a lot of solid questions and things that don&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: Okay, maybe two things.</p>

<p>TLDR: Why was Adam Lanza missing since 2009? Also, NO internet footprint AT ALL?!</p>

<p>Why, exactly? Just because YOU spend time online doesn&#39;t mean everyone else does, too. I&#39;d say only about half of my friends and family spend time online, if not less. No Facebook profiles or message board postings or anything of the sort, just their email address. And how would you find the email address if you didn&#39;t know it already? You wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Heck, Lanza could have been a major poster on Reddit with thousands of karma, but if he never said who he was no one would know. See, we use these crazy screenname things, and unless we willingly reveal who we are or screw up somehow, you&#39;re posting anonymously. Even if Lanza did actually spent time online, you wouldn&#39;t necessarily know.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Strange, introverted people with deep mental problems tend to not, you know, go out and socialize and make themselves known. Like my loom friend Bobby from high school and college. He &quot;disappeared&quot; years ago. We know where he is and we know he&#39;s alive because we&#39;ve asked his parents, but no one has seen or heard from him in years.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t surprising. He was a weirdo. Even when we all hung out, he was a loner who kept to himself. Spent almost all his life in his room. He seemed to like it that way.</p>

<p>You also can&#39;t find him online. As best as we can tell, he doesn&#39;t Facebook or Linkedin or anything.</p>

<p>On &quot;lockdown?&quot; What would you like them to be reporting, exactly?</p>

It seems like such a hot button, ratings driven subject that new channels would be all over trying to dig and find more information.
I&#39;m not buying that the media is backing off out of respect for the families - when have they EVER done that?
Where are the interviews? Friends? Family? Victims relatives? &quot;Normal&quot; townfolk?
A one hour special on the town of Sandy Hook. Katie Couric parachuting in with mic in hand for an expose on Gene Rosen?!?!

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps there isn&#39;t anything coming out about James Holmes because many people realize the media attention and fame are a reason why people go on killing sprees. By not indulging in stories about him we are showing other potential mass murderers that if you do this you won&#39;t be remembered. Also, in his case it would be pointless because, as far as I know, there is no doubt or conspiracy about his actions/the events that happened.</p>

<p>Right, no one is looking for them except hundreds of conspiracy theorists and journalists eager to find out more about him.</p>

<p>There have <em>already</em> been mainstream reports about how there is very little record of what this guy has been up to, so <em>obviously</em> people <em>are</em> looking for the missing pieces in his life. Any journalist would love to get their hands on his detailed story.</p>

<p>And anyone who thinks for a moment that all the Hook Truthers aren&#39;t hoping to come across some trace of him online (it would have to be online, since the only way they are willing to investigate is with Google) is nuts.</p>

<p>The &quot;missing pieces&quot; are completely normal. Right now, people all around you are leaving no real Internet footprint. There are people I&#39;ve known for years who, as far as the Internet is concerned, don&#39;t exist or who are just names in a residency directory. It&#39;s not odd or unusual or suspicious.</p>

<p>Couple this with the fact that the guy was the crazy son of a prepper mom - you don&#39;t shoot 20 children without being wired wrong in the head, and preppers aren&#39;t exactly big on leaving a big public trace - and the relatively little we have on Lanza is not just explainable, it should be EXPECTED.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are making just as tremendous of leaps as I am buddy by implying the official story is the end all be all explanation of the event. </p>

<p>I would agree that some people online want to know more, including me. Like I said in my original statement, most of the stuff I have seen so far seems like bullshit. BUT - that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I still want more information. 
I want more than 1 evacuation photo. I want photos of the entrance where he got in. Not one photo. Crime scene photos? Not any photos of the carnage, but maybe a bullet hole or just ONE picture of the interior of the school. Survivor interviews? There were two injured (seems low), who are they? A least a name would be nice. 
If you were happy with all the information you received, then good for you I guess. That doesn&#39;t make you wrong. Just like me asking questions isn&#39;t wrong. I appreciate your attempt to try to debunk my questions sentence by sentence, but it&#39;s not really necessary. </p>

<p>The reports about why there is very little record are the problem. And some guy on the internet telling me &quot;DUDE. That should be expected!&quot; isn&#39;t enough for me to just stop asking questions. </p>

<p>Keep in mind I am not making outrageous claims. I&#39;m not saying the Medical Examiner was John Goodman (OMG - IS IT?!!). I&#39;m saying the official story TO ME  and others it seems, doesn&#39;t sit well and doesn&#39;t add up. Why? Because it is missing pieces. That is a fact. </p>

<p>Maybe once all the pieces are released and the case is closed we will have a clearer picture - but right now, the picture sucks.</p>

<p>No. What I am saying - not implying - is that &quot;why doesn&#39;t Adam Lanza have an online footprint AT ALL?&quot; is hardly the question of the year since <em>most</em> people don&#39;t have a significant online footprint.</p>

<p>What I am <em>implying</em> is that asking the question as if it&#39;s a major red flag and something to be suspicious about is <em>really stupid</em> because <em>there is nothing unusual about not leaving a trail of Instagram photos and Facebook posts in your wake</em>.</p>

<p>That he had no friends or acquaintances to speak of IS unusual, but it&#39;s also not surprising, what with him being obviously and undeniably nuts and all.</p>
