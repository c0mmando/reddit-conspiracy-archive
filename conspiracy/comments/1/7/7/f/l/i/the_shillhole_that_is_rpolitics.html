       I don't know if this belongs here, and I'm sure the nature of reddit is already clearly obvious, but I was curious about it, so maybe some of you are too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had multiple conversations with redditors about
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       being chock full of shills and plants in place to sway the opinions and mindsets of millions of people.  I've been told that the overwhelming slant against anything republican/libertarian is just a result of the typical reddit user's political leaning.  I've been laughed at for claiming that the sub is a gigantic front for the Democratic party, have been insulted for calling out users as obvious shills, and have even been called a shill myself for doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the election it became painfully obvious what I was looking at, as it did to many other redditors, so I decided to try something.  Over the course of a month or so, I starting tagging users whose posts made it to the front page.  This wasn't some constant vigil I kept, since I'm hardly on reddit 24/7.  But everyday or two I'd check in and continue tagging.  As I did, certain names started continually coming up.  wang-banger, anutensil, Whitefangs, Liberatea, Blue126, Corporate_ho, among many others.  tens and even hundreds of thousands in link karma, often accumulated within a couple months or so.  And consistently making it to the front page, day after day, with one agenda.  Elevate the left and demonize the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a while I simply un-subbed.  I got sick of seeing the same shit day in and day out.  Sick of seeing the same shills posting their agenda and having their fellow shills quickly upvote them to the top, while immediately burying opposing posts to oblivion.  I didn't come back for a couple months, and when I did recently, I remembered my little experiment.  Or, not so much remembers, but saw it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H62OJ4z.jpg">
        Here is what my front page looked like at 1132 this morning.
       </a>
       Each tag is for a user who made it to the front page during the few weeks I was watching the front page.  I was actually shocked to see so many familiar faces, as I suspected that the majority of the posters I tagged were only in action for the election and would fade away afterwards.  That is not remotely the case.  And lest you think it's just a case of good articles getting to the front page, and not an all out spamfest,
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JfAZeRM.jpg">
        here are the New submissions as of 1135 today.
       </a>
       The same thing happens day in and day out, as you can see by looking at the top posts
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Liyt1Xc.jpg">
        for the week
       </a>
       , or
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Dd6pi8t.jpg">
        for the month
       </a>
       , or even
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/twuM4cQ.jpg">
        for the year
       </a>
       .  Screenshots taken at 1140, 1144, and 1147 today respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I don't care if those who read this are Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Rastafarians, or what-the-fuck-everians.  This is not about having a debate.  It is about reddit brainwashing so many people.  Yeah, we all know that many subs are echo-chamber circlejerks.  But
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is not
       <a href="/r/democrats">
        /r/democrats
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/progressive">
        /r/progressive
       </a>
       .  It is meant to encompass
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       political views and discussion.  Instead, it has become a machine to push a specific ideology, and that machine just so happens to come as a default sub.  As such, anyone new to the site is immediately inundated with posts demonizing republicans and libertarians, while at the same time praising the left and idolizing Obama.  And many of these new users come in the form of teens and even pre-teens who are still trying to find their voice.  What better way to mold these young minds than to present your ideology as the one your favorite website adheres to?  When you're surrounded by people all chanting the same thing, you tend to chant along with them.  And when all dissenting voices are drowned out with hate, ridicule, and downvotes, you have created the perfect propaganda machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, I'm sure this comes as no surprise to anyone.  I thought I'd post the screenshots anyway.  It's one thing to talk about it.  It's another to see it in action.

       The "right" isn't really "conservative", and the "left" isn't really "liberal".  The citizens on both "wings" are decrying their politicians for crossing to the other side.  Meanwhile, the spending (of the money put into the 'community chest') spirals out of control, and so does our confidential debt to U.S. Treasury bond holders, while the media feeds everyone bullshit (see: Sandy Hook, birth certificates) to start fighting each other.

       No, that's not what he said.  George Washington commented on the pros and cons of a party system, he never actually said he was opposed to it.  It's a common misunderstanding.

       Hmmm.  Sounds like a conspiracy.  You've come to the right place friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all honesty though, you're right.  R/politics does, "crank out drones who believe they think for themselves," but the real question at hand is whether or not this is the work of overly passionate liberals, or Federally employed agents.  While both might have the same affect on the masses, there's a huge difference between the two.  I'm interested in the OP's opinion as well as others.

       That's assuming that everyone that reads something in R/politics buys it at first glance. Sometimes this can help push people to investigate for themselves, to seek out multiple sources, and to cross reference stories.

       Ignore them. They are retards, and it is scary that they vote and breed, but they don't really have an impact on your personal life. They make a minority of the population, and the statism in Washington would still exist without them. They are insignificant trolls.

       When i post thoughtful comments to r/politics with a mild libertarian slant my comments are always downvoted in mass (against reddicate), rarely retorted with any reasonable argument, and are usually met with personal attacks that have nothing to do with the opinion at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont really care, but you're right that it does suck how so many unaware people are going to see that and join in the hive mentality of one sided circlejerking that happens on that sub.

       While you are not going to get "top billing", it is not useless.  You can still post comments to the links to convey ideas.  All you need are a few strategically placed ideas that are picked up by people reading comments.  I'm sure there are bloggers looking for ideas to repeat.  I've seen several of my points picked up by Ben Swan and other bloggers.  I often see the same key phrases as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember, a good catch phrase or idea is like wild fire.  The shills can stamp out the majority of the fires, it only takes a few key sparks to start fires elsewhere.

       The mods are a problem over there. Today I posted a link to the video where
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XaTsFjjBpg">
        We Are Change gives $100 bills
       </a>
       out to people attending the Obama's inauguration who can get 3 out 5 questions about him correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       I titled it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We Are Change gives $100 to people attending the President's inauguration who can get 3 out 5 questions about him correct.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The post is spam filtered and because of goldf1sh's brilliant moderationlong bot, I'm notified. Why was I spam filted? Probably because the last video I posted there was this one:
       <br/>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/16t7xl/the_logic_of_still_supporting_obama/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/16t7xl/the_logic_of_still_supporting_obama/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was insta-downvoted like every article, video or whatever which is critical of Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember over Christmas break, we were all amazed that some articles critical of Obama had made it to the top of r/politics. That was because all the shills who guard the new queue were on holiday. If you post anything critical of Obama and I have on numerous occasions, it's insta-downvoted...and the only times I've had success is if I leave his name out and any other 'trigger' words.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I write to the mods and ask them to approve it. They won't. They think the title needs changing. They want me to title it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Obama Supporters Don't Know Obama: "...we hosted a quiz show where we offered $100 to anyone who could correctly answer 3 out of 5 questions about the man they were there supporting."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The post would that title wouldn't last 1 minute, plus it's a spoiler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing is, this has happened to me before. I submitted another video and it was removed (not spam filtered). I write and ask why. Editorialization I was told. Nope. I had to explain to them what 'editoriazed' meant. It means inserting your opinion into titles. When you just describe what happens in a a video, it's not editorialization. They finally saw sense and approved it. So why are they so trigger happy when it comes to criticism of Obama?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever seen the amount of videos that don't exactly match the title of the actual video on youtube? They are numerous. All you have to do is search for the youtube domain on r/politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm reminded of the time they didn't want to let a Libertarian mod join the team. They said something like they didn't want to bias the sub...
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone should head to
       <a href="/r/politic">
        /r/politic
       </a>
       and try and build that sub up. It has loads of posts because it pulls them from everywhere but it needs comments.

       Am I though? I tried searching "YouTube.com" in the
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       specific search filter, and nothing comes up. Just random article that
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       YouTube links, and most of them barely have any comments.

       so the way you would find all the posts which link to youtube would be with this search:
       <br/>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=site%3Ayoutube.com&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">

       That's annoying then, perhaps it's just style of content? But Luke's videos have become

        much

       less aggressive since the beginning of his WAC stuff.

       I've seen mods in modmail state that they removed a youtube link recently. So no, it's not automatic in r/politics. They probably just remove them all because they are problematic for the Obama/war/bank status-quo.

       Well, like you said; this is exactly why I'll never look at this subreddit again. They think inside of the left-right paradigm and anything that opposes a stance on the left is downvoted to oblivion. Anything that has a third or fourth opinion or does not belong to one of the two parties on an issue does not exist in the minds of the users on that subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example Bill Maher always talks about how the right lives in their bubble that no information can get in or out of and yet him and his fans and followers do the same exact fucking thing. I believe it's called cognitive dissonance.

       I think you give way too much credit to a subreddit. People who have their opinions constantly ridiculed find a different group to share their ideas with.  I'm still subscribed to

       I completely agree with you that
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is a biased showcase of Democratic ideals, but all you've proven is that the same small group of users consistently get to the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguing anything beyond this is prescribing to them motivations and intent that's pretty much a guess on your part. It can be explained by a multitude of reasons outside "these people are paid shills." Saying that these people are employed by someone to post propaganda and influence the voting on other submissions/comments is a very specific accusation that requires proof far beyond what you've provided.

       Some great points in here worth considering -- the ease with which a group could suppress certain posts and trend others on the rising page of a particular subreddit is actually a very compelling argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would make a lot of sense political strategists would hire "social media experts" to influence Reddit. I suppose I just chalk it up to more of the power of the hivemind than a grand conspiracy to raise certain things to the front page and bury others. I do buy into the whole "your average Redditor is Democratic" thing because what I see at the top of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       very much reflects what I see on my facebook feed of other 20-somethings' political views.

       This is the more likely explanation of what it is.. Most of the people who actively visit
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       regularly are in the same demographic, so it makes sense that most of the top comments/threads are so similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only proof is anecdotal, just try talking to random people at your work or people who go into your store/office about politics, and see what they have to say. Now imagine those people are Redditors.

       Calling people shills and dismissing their arguments with this ad hominem is not constructive, and typical of groups where dogma and conformity is valued more than than open discussion and new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy seems lately to shift into this direction. Questions are dismissed without thought, and there's shill hunts going on. Because the official r/conspiracy way of thinking has to be accepted without question.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what like minded people do, historically. Critics of religion were dismissed has heretics, critics (or perceived critics) of communism were dismissed as counterrevolutionaries, post 9/11 critics of american policy were dismissed as unpatriotic .. in each case dogma was more important than understanding the truth and constructive discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is too with r/conspiracy. Shills are everywhere, because the dogma of 9/11 and now Sandy Hook, cannot be questioned.

       I'd assume that reddit userbase is very liberal and atheist skewed. That's why liberal ideas get a lot of upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       That one user does post incredibly lot. But don't you think it was a paid shill that they'd spread that shit across several hundred accounts? Now it seems to be just a few karmawhores who're obsessed with reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not kidding, but some people are obsessed with this shit. Given opportunity, some people will go overboard. I know a guy who plays call of duty 12 to 14 hours every day, and he's not getting paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least I'd like some actual evidence before I believe there's a paid leftist mind op on reddit. Additionally it would make little sense since it would be preaching to the choir - considering that it's a liberal/leftist/atheist crowd anyways even if you discount the 'obvious shills' you pointed out.

       To be fair. And its hard, i know. I see a lot of shill calling. However i have only been called a shill once or maybe twice despite the fact that my opinion is often contrary to the herd in here. I think its due partly to the fact that i will supply sorces if i can and my account is almost a year old (but I've only started posting in rcinspiracy in the past month or so).  I don't like shill calling, i hate it you can look at my history and see where I've railed against it many times, but if you make a good argument and your account is more than a month old, they seem to hold off... Just my personal anecdotal experience. I'm sure many privately think i might be a shill, but most have yet to say it.

       It's a small cartel of people, operating with the encouragement of Reddit, who post only liberal material and downvote en masse anything that they have not posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch the /new queue. Anything that isn't from the same few sources and the same few people magically gets up to 12 downvotes within five minutes of being posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way, the admins can claim it's not official censorship. It's censorship with the approval of the admins however.

       r/politics is just like r/lgbt in that only the most sanitized information is allowed to thrive there.  Every post is yanked directly from MSNBC, CNN or some other mainstream source.  It's hivemind to the 100000000000th degree.  They're no better than the Christian conservatards they denounce; they just represent a different side of the same coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're ruthless when it comes to debating their views and will quickly resort to name-calling and other childish tactics.  That's one thing I appreciate about this subreddit--most of us are capable of being civil even if we don't always agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR--r/politics is a losing battle for critical thinkers.  Slowly but surely, more people will defect to this subreddit and other places like it, which is why we should focus on posting quality content
       <em>
        here

       Thank you. It seems more and more like Reddit is being abused to warp the minds of the next generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit isn't making a profit, yet they are commercially supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? The answer must be that they are making up for it from funds from somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The admin actively support certain subreddit, like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , and turn a blind eye at leftist subreddit like SRS while they demonize right wing subreddit like
       <a href="/r/BronyHate">
        /r/BronyHate
       </a>
       for even the slightest of issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that note, we at
       <a href="/r/BronyHate">
        /r/BronyHate
       </a>
       have been realizing how much emasculating influence is directed at white males, the same group persecuted by SRS, and coincidentally the target audience of Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I see here is not a general brainwashing of the public (that's what lame stream media is for), but a systemic attack against an "oppressive majority" .

       Can we please just drop the shill bullshit? It's impossible to fucking prove and I'm tired of hearing about it.  There is another article on here by the Guardian that talks about how none of the bankers who's illicit activities led to the 2008 collapse have been arrested. That's a real fucking conspiracy. But post after post about "shills" is pointless, unsubstantiated and a complete waste of time.

       This is an accurate observation, but it wasn't always that way. For a long time r/politics used to be an 'all-but-GOP' subreddit (Bush and Cheney were god-awful, Obama supporters take note, no foreign policy change). Now it's just DNC/'Obama-is-god' subreddit.

       I feel the same way, that is why I rarely comment. I just read and laugh. I have noticed as of recently there are a large number of Shill's here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       as well. And they all seem to down vote and attack a particular ideology. I troll

       Reddit has been colonized by agents and shills for both parties, the neocons, Israel/Zionist over all, Monsanto, banking, war promotion/State Dept/Pentagon, anti-inquiry, anti-gun via discouraging inquiry into Sandy Hook, Aurora, etc. Any 9/11 debate long ago actively patrolled by big opposition, dare I say funded to patrol.

       is targeted specifically because it has 2 million + users.  With that many users, it is worth paying for shills to troll and manipulate content.

       The reddit system needs to be replaced by some other web site.  It is to easily gamed.  There has to be a way to let the end user decide what bias she/he will follow so that votes don't matter unless someone "follows" your posts.  With the number of visits that reddit gets, I wonder if there is room to compete.

       Yeah.. it's weird.  You really have to have some perspective when dealing with online personas.  I mean looking here you almost get the feeling like the entire US is anti gun, but if you look outside and talk to people you find that isn't the case.

       This week alone I have had lunch with several different groups of people, all of them (without me steering the topic) talked about guns, their guns, and the larger clips / assault riffles they have and are getting.  These are people working in Corporate Companies not "red necks".  It's weird how out of touch with what is actually happening if you believe what you read here or see on main stream media.

       its not if it is left or right or anywhere in between, it is that you stay stuck in the paradigm given to you to be stuck in...all these "leaders" and politicians" are shown to you on tv, tv is what makes it real to "people" the most important thing is that you don't think about systems out side of this system...just talk about the people they want you to talk about, vote in the elections they tell you to, and above all else don't question the validity of any of it....r/politics, like other military/media tools exists simply to keep you believing in their system....because of course once you choose these "leaders" they make sure you use the central banks to make your money

       It's got plenty of shills from all sides, but the general leanings of the reddit community as a whole is leftist with a fair share of libertarian overlap. Though to be honest, i rarely look at anything from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       besides the headlines, because the blogs they link are usually shitty rehashed stories from more thorough and (slightly) more reliable sources. Plus i don't let myself watch news anymore; anger issues.

       No, its just chocked full of liberal high school and college kids. Why is it that so many people subbed to r/conspiracy think that anyone who doesnt agree with them must be paid or part of some larger machine to silence them?  The world is a big place and there are plenty of opinions to go around.   Believe it or not, liberals and conservatives dont need to be "paid shills" to believe what they do.

       The world is more liberal today than 50 years ago. The Republicans and libertarians just need to catch up. It'd be good if they could stop being so socially regressive.

       to sway the mindset of you, one question, does it work? I always listen but once I see evidence , my mind is made up, ask me how I feel about sandy hook, iran contra, EO 11110, Hussein, Gaddaffi, Lincoln, Rothschilds, Balfour Declaration, Zionists, Thermate, WTC7, Susan Lindauer, Dancing Israeli's, and I will be honest I have not a clue about facts/fiction about UFO's, fake moonwalks or whatever, just seems like Bullshit to take your eye off the ball (MONEY/GOLD).

       I don't think it's a group of ultra-loyal liberals, it's just a very large forum for political discussion for people of certain demographics, of which seems to trend towards liberalism (go figure with the youth of today!).

       This is just my opinion, but as a former and lifelong republican (and I seem to be one of many here), the process of "coming out" politically is not only quite an awakening, but what I see is a slow revolt in america, to the degree that people aren't just rejecting the ideology of the fundamental christian conservatives that have taken the party over, but in a tsunami-like effect, some good ideals are getting washed away too by the wave.
      </p>
      <p>
       The opinions here reflect the real world, unless you're in the bible belt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think most of us have a problem with many of their beliefs, but people are no longer accepting these belief systems being forced upon them -- this is where the issue lies for me, and it would seem many others, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure that there is a conservative and liberal rubreddit for all the expected circlejerking, but as I said, the republicans have lost their way:  Their constituency is shrinking, and trends like this are only amplified on a website this huge and this vocal, and this subreddit is just a reflection of that.

       That too. But inexperience and denial play a big role too, especially with the young.

       Did you ever stop to think about how much the right really sucks? The left shift is happening for a reason - people aren't buying the traditionalist viewpoint anymore. So how does the right wing political machine respond? By resorting to dishonest tactics, like gerrymandering, voting I.D. laws targeting minorities, the SuperPACs that poured corporate money into Republican coffers, etc. And the lying! Romney lying his ass off the entire campaign. Ryan getting caught in his words and getting shut down by Biden. The entire Fox and Friends propaganda machine. Rush Limbaugh, need I say more. The list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Redditors, generally being more studious folk, will be quick to reject flawed ideology supported by false claims. This is why Reddit is left-biased.

       To be fair. And its hard, i know. I see a lot of shill calling. However i have only been called a shill once or maybe twice despite the fact that my opinion is often contrary to the herd in here. I think its due partly to the fact that i will supply sorces if i can and my account is almost a year old (but I've only started posting in rcinspiracy in the past month or so).  I don't like shill calling, i hate it you can look at my history and see where I've railed against it many times, but if you make a good argument and your account is more than a month old, they seem to hold off... Just my personal anecdotal experience. I'm sure many privately think i might be a shill, but most have yet to say it.

        r/conspiracy seems lately to shift into this direction. Questions are dismissed without thought, and there's shill hunts going on. Because the official r/conspiracy way of thinking has to be accepted without question.

      <p>
       I don't think it's a group of ultra-loyal liberals, it's just a very large forum for political discussion for people of certain demographics, of which seems to trend towards liberalism (go figure with the youth of today!).

       Obviously there are 'shills' everywhere -
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       included so I don't see why you need to get your panties in a bunch over it. The problem is a lack of critical thinking - not a trend towards liberalism.
