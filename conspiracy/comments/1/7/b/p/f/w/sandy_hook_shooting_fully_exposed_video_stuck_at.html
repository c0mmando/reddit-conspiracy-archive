        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was pleased to see this Sandy Hook video (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx9GxXYKx_8&amp;bpctr=1359225921">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx9GxXYKx_8&amp;bpctr=1359225921</a>) start to go viral a few weeks ago, reaching millions of views within a week.  But the past week, it seems to have stagnated around 11-12 million views.  I doubt that people have just stopped watching the video --I would imagine the view counts would climb higher at an increasing rate. Is youtube purposefully not counting views for this video? After all, if this video&#39;s view count was 25 mil, even 50 mil....a lot of people would start to take notice, and realize that other people are waking up as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It happens a lot with videos that get traffic rapidly. The view count is delayed so the traffic can be analyzed. It does have a censoring effect, but the view counts are frozen pretty indiscriminately for videos of all different kinds, so the censoring has plausible deniability, even if it is happening on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. It took a day or two for Gangnam style to jump from ~990mil views to &gt;1bil views for the same reason. Romney&#39;s 47% video was another example-for the first 24hrs it was stuck at a few hundred views, despite wide broadcast. It&#39;s something they disclose that they do, though it does provide very convenient plausible deniability for censorship efforts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This needs to stop, seriously.</p>

<p>Let me pose this to you - if Sandy Hook <em>were</em> an inside job to take away peoples guns, what evidence would you be looking for? How would you get people to believe you? What irrefutable facts would you have to give someone who thinks otherwise? How would you persuade those who would think it too horrible to believe? </p>

<p>This, even if it is true, can not do anything useful for waking people up to the real problems in America, it will only cement peoples beliefs that conspiracy theorists and critical thinkers are paranoid tin-foil hat loonies and block out anything we say no matter how logical or reasonable it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A) There will be those who remain entrenched in their worldview even if you shove irrefutable facts/evidence in front of their faces</p>

<p>B) But there will be some who are able and willing to reconsider their worldviews in light of irrefutable facts/evidence</p>

<p>C) And still those who can reconsider their worldviews given sufficiently strong arguments but not considered &quot;irrefutable&quot;</p>

<p>C&#39;s are easy to shift, B&#39;s are a hit-or-miss. But the more B&#39;s and C&#39;s shift to a different view, it puts more pressure on the remaining B&#39;s and A&#39;s to shift as well.</p>

<p>This is how the &quot;battle&quot; is won. Not an outright, &quot;i&#39;ve convinced everyone of you&quot; victory but a gradual accumulation of small victories that build momentum</p>
