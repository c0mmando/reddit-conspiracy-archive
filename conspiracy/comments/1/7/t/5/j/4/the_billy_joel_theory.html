        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hear me out here. I will try to make this as simple as possible. </p>

<p>Is it possible that the world has ALWAYS been as fucked up as it is today with lies, conspiracies, cover ups, secret wars, etc...and we just never knew as much because information was filtered to us through a newspaper or tv?  EDIT: Yes, the answer is yes. Rhetorical question. </p>

<p>Is it possible since we have the internet today with constant up to the second information that we are now able to learn about things we never had before as well as see the world&#39;s fucked-upness in REAL TIME? EDIT: Yes, the answer is yes. Rhetorical question. </p>

<p>Is it possible TPTB are regretting the internet? EDIT: Up for debate. </p>

<p>&quot;We didn&#39;t start the fire. It was always burning. Since the world was turning.&quot; - Billy Joel </p>

<p>So, my theory is, what&#39;s going on is nothing new, it&#39;s always been this way. The only difference is we now know more about it. EDIT: Okay, so it&#39;s not my theory - it&#39;s Billy Joel&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My god, the Philistine gleefully proclaims complete and utter banalities as if they were astounding. I don&#39;t accept the telos wrapped up in &quot;supposed.&quot; Essentially things are unfolding in a way that we cannot even be aware of except at varying degrees of removal, so how can we posit a force which guides them, (prime mover, or supposer)?</p>

<p>Now, things ARE somewhat different than before, and it&#39;s not just the rate at which information travels that has changed. We have increasingly constituted our selves as reflections of media images obtained from television, newspapers, magazines, and now the internet, which means we are decreasingly constituted based on the &quot;real&quot; world and divorced from our bodies and those around us. We&#39;re looking at the world through a lens that&#39;s shaped by the media, but the media is simply competing for popularity, and they&#39;ll say anything. We, the people, have set the agenda of Fox News, not the Republican Party. Fish school together into these &quot;brainwashed&quot; states without the imposing nets of Bilderbergers and so on. It&#39;s a collective assertion of ego, typified by Nationalists like Hitler--who really should not be credited with such great evil. He didn&#39;t force people to hate jews, they&#39;d hated them for hundreds of years with extreme venom. He took advantage of it! It doesn&#39;t take much ingenuity to cook up media campaigns that just confirm everything everybody wants to believe, and that was really the driving force behind Nazism. </p>

<p>Social Media, in particular, is the greatest boon for the Bilderberg types imaginable. Why? It seems as if &quot;the people&quot; are finally able to grab the microphone and explain how everything is wrong. That is true, but that message does not often appeal. When you ramp up the flexibility and pace of media, put it in the hands of anyone, that is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>For example, you might believe that the Internet rose up to defend itself from SOPA with the blackouts last year, and that this event was a great victory for &quot;the people.&quot; That may confirm everything you want to believe, so therefore it is reason to become immediately suspicious. Who really did the heavy lifting in transmitting the message of the blackout? Google! A big corporation was able to keep its bottom line safe while disguising a power play as some kind of beneficent grassroots uprising. This is the same thing as Occupy and the Tea Party. The entire Arab Spring was sparked by a video of a man burning himself that went viral. What made it go viral? Certainly thousands of men and women burn themselves each day, even on video, but this man&#39;s self-immolation was special enough to spark a series of revolutions. The appealing narrative which framed the video was the reason for the uprising, not the man himself. It&#39;s propaganda that doesn&#39;t look like propaganda. Don&#39;t believe it? Look at the front page of Reddit each day, and look for corporate advertisements. No, not in the ad-boxes, dummy, in the content people are voting up. It&#39;s easy to design a meme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Increasingly, human beings constitute themselves based on beautiful images provided by our dear friends in the media. These images have been focus grouped, scientifically tweaked, and engineered from the ground up to become more and more alluring than the next image. It’s just capitalism! ‘Ol Papa Tom gets the cheapest possible ingredients and designs a pizza that tastes like pure ambrosia, truly food for the gods. But these gods are so full on this paradoxical emptiness they have ballooned into giant pink freaks of nature. Then, Papa Tom hires on some liars to go on television and tell you they use only the best ingredients. You have walled yourselves inside this fortresses city to block out everything but these beautiful images!”</p>

<p>The crowd trembled, their fat jiggling. A white-haired old woman, dressed all in white wailed. “Save us! Save us! Oh, Lord we have sinned.”</p>

<p>Johnny raised his palms. “No! You have not sinned! You have been seduced by beauty, and you, my dear, should know quite well that beauty is a wonderful thing.”</p>

<p>“It is?” She blushed.</p>

<p>Johnny hugged the woman and smiled. “Yes. And you won’t believe the food people eat outside these ugly pink walls. Incredible!” As he said this, he swept a hand across the crowd, indicating the visible wave of fear. Johnny’s eyes grew wide, almost insane. He lifted the walking stick at his side, an intricate fractal thing of clear plastic topped with a spiraling pine cone of diamond ferns glittering in the sunlight, flowing spider threads leading into a wireframe model of a tree trunk, glowing subtly as each filament filled with light like fiber optic cable, terminating at what looked like a small rubber pad only a sixteenth of an inch thick.</p>

<p>The woman fell on her knees, hands in the air. “How can I leave this godforsaken place? I’ve been here for years, and I’m old, so old. My god! MY GOD!” She blubbered into her hands violently, and the back of her arms bounced like the ass of a booty dancer. Kneeling beside her, Johnny whispered something secret into her ear that seemed to calm her for a moment.</p>

<p>“When I am upset I often take comfort in the words of Jesus. You know what he said? If the camel wants to pass through the eye of the needle, she’s going to have to leave all her baggage behind.”</p>

<p>Her fit of crying became cathartic laughter. She had been healed, but the crowd murmured apprehensively. They backed away from the scene slowly, terrified, as if they had been caught jerking a dog. A whizzing projectile struck Johnny directly in the face, then in the neck, then in the chest, then in the abdomen, and then in the crotch. The blood spattered woman tore her shirt in agony by the bits of his body, gnashing her teeth and beating her breasts, screaming “Jesus! This man was Jesus! Why’d you have to go and kill him, God dammit!”</p>

<p>She clung to the fractal staff, while trails of blackish blood worked their way through its interstices as if forming some unknowable but intentional shape. Service robots coldly dumped Johnny’s body into the sewer systems, where the obese woman knew he would be incorporated into KS. Now that it was not merely a symbol, eating the body of Christ completely lost its appeal. She had to leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this sounds possible, for sure. I&#39;d say the <em>potential</em> for human fucked-upness/conspiracy has probably always been there, but I suspect that the advancements in tech/pharma/science/etc have actually caused some new dirty strategies to emerge. </p>

<p>edit: Also I am disappointed that this post isn&#39;t about some wide reaching illuminati conspiracy Billy Joel is involved in. I mean, look at the guy:</p>

<p>This is something that bothers me about the concept of drones. Though there are still people being ordered to press buttons from afar, they really do distance someone a lot further from their actions than they&#39;ve ever been, and there are fewer opportunities for decent people to say no. </p>

<p>Pretty much no. Even if we ignore the countless revolutions that have happened in countless societies - you generally don&#39;t revolt unless you think the folks in charge suck and you can do better - for nearly as long as people have been writing, there have been accounts of discontent with those in power, philosophical musings about power and the elite and the masses, and so on. Greek philosophers, Roman writers, historical journals. And those are just the written records. Do you <em>really</em> think the people slaving to build the pyramids didn&#39;t think, &quot;Man, the Pharaoh is a fucking <em>asshole</em> for making us do this shit. What a lunatic! He&#39;s a psycho. We&#39;d be better off without him?&quot;</p>

<p>Considering the internet is nothing more than a seemingly never-ending series of echo-chambers where literally everybody is an expert on everything, the answer is largely &#39;false&#39;.</p>

<p>I say <em>largely</em> &#39;false&#39; because your original post and subsequent follow-ups are so vague and purposefully obscure that drawing any solid conclusions on them would be a fool&#39;s errand, there really isn&#39;t anything to &#39;discuss&#39;.</p>

<p>However, to expand a little on my earlier point about echo-chambers; the internet will show you whatever your preconceived notions will demand of it and little else.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with bamshoulddie&#39;s tone but he&#39;s right this post and wider thread are simply vacuous and the result is yet another circle-jerk on the internet - who&#39;da thunk it?</p>

<p>I&#39;d wager his dismay is not because he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s legit, but that it&#39;s embarrassing that what we presume is an adult would even ask such idiotic, self-evident questions and present them as if they are some eye-opening, thought-provoking revelation.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Is it possible that the world has ALWAYS been as fucked up as it is today with lies, conspiracies, cover ups, secret wars, etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is this even a question? Yes, there has been corruption, lies by those in power, wars fought for false purposes, and so on <em>for all of recorded history</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible since we have the internet today with constant up to the second information that we are now able to learn about things we never had before as well as see the world&#39;s fucked-upness in REAL TIME? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gosh, I don&#39;t know. I <em>guess</em> it&#39;s possible that having a global network that allows people to get instant news, instant information, and instant discussion from thousands of media sources and millions of people at any given time might allow people to learn things they&#39;d have had a hard time learning before. It seems far-fetched, but I guess it&#39;s plausible.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Again, how is this even a question?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, my theory is, what&#39;s going on is nothing new, it&#39;s always been this way. The only difference is we now know more about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you 15, by any chance?</p>
