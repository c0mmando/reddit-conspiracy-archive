       Too often do 'intelligent, adjusted' people rain hatred onto those who call into question the official story of 9/11, a day that changed our lives forever. I've written out a simple-to-follow list of the main tenants of the 'Truther' theory, and I implore you to follow the links and confirm their legitimacy. But ultimately I'm wondering why Truthers are so vehemently hated and accused, when solid facts and data have always been provided by them. That's not to say this data should be enough to convince anyone, but it also means Truthers are basing their ideas on a lot more than sensationalist heresy; quite the opposite in fact. So take a look at this list and tell me how it effects you, or if you can debunk any of it. And can we be civilized about it?? If I get nothing but hate messages, my point will have been proven.

        the BBC accidentally reported the collapse of Building 7 30min. too early
       </a>

        that World Trade Center 7 collapsed at all,
       </a>
       since it is scientifically unprecedented that a 42-story steel-framed high-rise building would collapse at the rate of gravity, due to two isolated 'office-fires' (as reported on the news), into its own structural footprint. It was not hit by a plane and was a football field away from the Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>

       (one of the hijackers) passport on Vesey Street following the planes crashing into the Twin Towers. How could a paper passport have survived the impact and subsequent blast, when the Black Boxes were allegedly destroyed? How did it come to be just laying on the sidewalk?
      </p>

       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/bin-laden-family-members-evacuated-from-us-in-wake-of-the-9-11-attacks/15186">
        Why were all members of the Bin Laden family living in the U.S. flown out of the country on chartered planes on the morning of 9/11, before they could be questioned by Federal Authorities?
       </a>
       . It's simply against protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        5.
       </strong>
       Why did so many of the eyewitness that day, including professional news teams and rescue workers, consistently report
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLJ1c9VVSH0">
        'secondary explosions'
       </a>
       coming from the base of the towers, and why doesn't the 9/11 Commission Report mention this at all? Not once?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        6.
       </strong>
       Firemen and rescue workers consistently reported finding
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCdRA09pztM">
        pools of molten metal
       </a>
       at the bottom of the Trade Center rubble, but this too was completely omitted from the Commission Report. Molten metal is a left-over residue of super-thermite- an explosive material which burns hot enough to melt steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        7.
       </strong>
       It is scientifically unprecedented that
       <a href="http://911review.com/coverup/fantasy/melting.html">
        kerosene jet fuel could burn at a high enough temperature to melt, or even warp, steel.
       </a>
       . Most if not all the kerosene jet fuel was burned up in the huge fireball that occurred right after the planes hit. The fires were, according to engineering experts, "briefly burning." 1535ºC (2795ºF) - melting point of iron
~1510ºC (2750ºF) - melting point of typical structural steel
~825ºC (1517ºF) - maximum temperature of hydrocarbon fires burning in the atmosphere without pressurization or pre-heating (premixed fuel and air - blue flame)
Diffuse flames burn far cooler. 
Oxygen-starved diffuse flames are cooler yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fires in the towers were diffuse -- well below 800ºC. 
Their dark smoke showed they were oxygen-starved -- particularly in the South Tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        8.
       </strong>
       A few brave firemen made it to the 78th floor of the South Tower, the impact area of the first plane, and
       <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/wtc/firefighters.htm">
        Cheif Orio Palmer radioed back to the ground
       </a>
       "Battalion Seven ... Ladder 15, we've got two isolated pockets of fire. We should be able to knock it down with two lines. Radio that, 78th floor numerous 10-45 Code Ones." With just TWO LINES of water, these firemen are saying they'll be able to put out all the fires in that building. In their transcripts there is zero indication that the firemen were worried about total structural collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        9.
       </strong>
       No plausible explanation has been given as to how both Twin Towers collapsed at the speed they did- the rate of gravity. They are the first of their kind to ever do such a thing. If 'pan-cake theory' is to be believed, the building's would've fallen much slower.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        10.
       </strong>
       <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/february2007/210207designers.htm">
        The buildings were designed to withstand impact from a plane LARGER than the one that struck it.
       </a>
       When designer and engineer of the Towers John Skilling heard the news that day, he was not worried and knew the buildings would hold. In his report before 9/11- "The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707 DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact." Further in his report- "Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed.
       <strong>
        The building structure would still be there."

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       1 - A mistake was made. Besides, reporters were in on the conspiracy? Way to keep it secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - If you google for pics of the
       <em>
        south
       </em>
       side of the building, you can see the immense damage with a large percentage of floor area destroyed for a dozen floors. There's also a huge fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 - Stuff were ejected from the impact at high velocity. It's possible that some objects escaped unharmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 - Against what protocol? Is it protocol to detain relatives of suspects? Did they know at that point that OBL did it?
      </p>
      <p>
       5 - There probably a lot of sounds, but none were caused by explosives. People might mistake structural collapse sounds travelling in elevator shafts for real explosions. If explosives were used, hundreds of people in vicinity of WTC would have had ear damage - which did not happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 - What kind of metal, and why is this impossible? Molten metal is the product of metal being heated to a melting point. Wouldn't thermite have burned out quite quickly?
      </p>
      <p>
       7 - The fire were not oxygen starved for the most part. But that's beside the point. Steel loses 80% structural integrity at the temperature the fires were burning. Also there was no molten
       <em>
        steel
       </em>
       at the site. Some other metals perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       8 - Initial assessment proved out to be incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       9 - Now this is patently bullshit. Look at any collapse video like
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk9uTjRNdVI">
        this
       </a>
       and you can clearly see debris falling at the side of the building
       <strong>
        faster
       </strong>
       than the building is crumbling. Debris is coming down close to freefall, but the building is coming down slower. Building = not in freefall.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 - The Boeing 707 is a mid-size, narrow-body jet airliner. 767s that hit the WTC towers are widebodies, that had over 50% more mass than 707. So you're wrong there. Additionally, the analysis was half right - the buildings stood long enough that a lot of people were evacuated.

       I did link to that one video for point 9.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 - OPs source shows the mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - For WTC 7 here's a
       <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/WTC7.htm">
        pic
       </a>
       of the south faces "two isolated office fires" .. what you see is a huge fire and a large hole in the side of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 - No video of the passport being ejected from the plane upon impact. There's no evidence that this could not happen, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 - It's on the op to provide the protocol that was broken. Anyways, remember that your argument is that Osama had nothing to do with this. US already knew that OBL had severed ties with his family - he was a wanted man way before 9/11. They probably had interviewed his family a bunch of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 - I can't prove a negative. At least WTC 7 collapse had no sounds of explosions. Can't find a WTC 7 vid with sound now, all are bullshit truther vids that have some annoying music to cover up the fact that there are no explosion sounds, just rumbling. But look up any WTC 7 video with sound, and there's only rumbling.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 - Do you want a source that heat makes metals melt? The metal is not identified, and thermite is not the only thing that can do that. Probably wasn't rivers of molten steel, but aluminum that melts at 660 C.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 - Well the fires did not melt the steel. This is a non-argument. No source needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       8 - Initial assessments are often wrong. The fireman was not a structural engineer. I don't have a source for that though.

       9 - Source provided. None of the buildings (including WTC 7) collapsed at freefall speed. The usual reason WTC 7 truther vids omit the first 13 seconds of the collapse and just show the facade collapsing ten seconds after the roof penthouse has collapsed inside the building.

       Here's a problem I'm not sure you can explain this away.
      </p>
      <p>
       There does exist not only audio of WTC7 explosions but also witnesses of explosions.  Why should we dismiss all of these?  Especially the 'officials' who are saying 'seven is exploding' right after an explosion..  that sounds precisely like demolition charges.

      <p>
       the rest of the video confirms where this is, and when.  It's after the WTC 1 and 2 have collapsed, and prior to WTC7.   Why do you think the official seems to clearly say 'we gotta get back from here, we gotta get back, seven is exploding'?

       No they said "city is all smoking", not "seven is exploding". I did hear the explosion sound though. The video isn't timed though, so we don't know when this was or what caused the sound. Commentators guess it's between twin towers collapse and WTC 7 collapse. We know that it wasn't right before WTC 7 is coming down (see video link later). Shoddy evidence of ... I don't even know what.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see in this video
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">
        here
       </a>
       that WTC 7 collapse is not preceded by an explosion, even thought the video description says there is an explosion. The video is shot 150 metres from the building, so any amount explosives required to demolish a building would be heard easily, and hundreds of rescue workers in the area would have had ear damage if real explosives had been present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any real demolition of building has a series of explosions.

       EDIT: About your vid: sometime, somewhere, something exploded is what the video says. A few blocks burning is going to contain non-bomb explosion sources, like pressurized tanks, gas lines, fuel tanks, fuel vapor, cars had fuel in them .. it could've been anything. Several buildings had generator fuel tanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Something, somewhere, sometime exploded -&gt; WTC 7 was a controlled demolition" is not that sound of an explanation. And listen to it again, they're not saying WTC 7 is exploding.

       Just start by how you logically can get from an unidentified, time not known, location not known explosion to explosives in WTC 7? BecauseI showed you a video of WTC7 collapsing with no explosive sounds at all. Building demolition will create a noise of 125 to 135 decibels for up to 8 seconds. That's not what happened in WTC 7.

       Then how come we can hear all the other sounds going on previous to WTC 7 collapse, but the expected 125 to 135 decibel explosions are the only thing missing? You have a special TV remote if can selectively edit out some sounds but not others. And how come these sounds are edited out of all videos?

       Okay, they could've filtered out certain sounds from all the videos of WTC 7 collapse - a bit implausible, but let's go with that (and if you claim that something is doctored, you should be the one who brings evidence. Surely some artefacts would be left of selectively filtering some sounds out of the soundtrack).
      </p>
      <p>
       But how did they erase the ear damage and hearing loss that would've been caused to a lot of rescue workers due to the up to 135 DB volume cause by building demolition?

       Could you provide some source that thermite was found in the rubble? In any case thermite is not used for large scale demolitions normally because of the huge amounts required to cut large steel beams. They would've required literally truckloads of the stuff. So any evidence you come up with, should support this - - there should've been an immense amount of aluminium oxide and ferrous dust at the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why was OP parading the explosive sounds testimony and video earlier if it wasn't explosives at all? What do you make of the explosions?
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: I have trouble finding evidence that large (or any) amount of thermite burn residuals were found at site.

       Aluminum oxide is one of the products of a thermite reaction, so the presence of it would encourage the theory that thermite felled the buildings.

       I can think of no other reason than sabotage. People argue that one airliner full of jet fuel burned fast and hot enough to melt those steel beams, then in the next breath claim that it would require a noticable amount of thermite to burn those same beams.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aluminum is actually pretty common, and it`s not difficult to produce thermite. Terrorist elements could easily get away with producing enough to level the towers. Building 7 included.

       No "freefall":
      </p>
      <p>
       "In every photo and every video, you can see columns far outpacing the collapse of the building. Not only are the columns falling faster than the building but they are also falling faster than the debris cloud which is ALSO falling faster than the building. This proves the buildings fell well below free fall speed. That is, unless the beams had a rocket pointed to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at any video you like and watch the perimeter columns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deceptive videos stop the timer of the fall at 10:09 when only the perimeter column hits the ground and not the building itself. If you notice, the building just finishes disappearing behind the debris cloud which is still about 40 stories high.

       No 2. It was not fire alone that brought down WTC7.  There was substantial damage from the collapse of the other buildings and other debris hitting it.  Firefighters were saying most of the afternoon (on video) that they KNEW WTC7 was going to collapse, based on their expertise and the sounds of the creaking and groaning of the structure that they were hearing.  NOT because they knew beforehand that it would be demolished.
      </p>
      <p>
       No 4. Witnesses are unreliable.  They MAY have heard loud noises, sure.  They are not experts and can't say for sure it was an explosion, or what it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       No 7. Kerosene does not have to burn hot enough to "melt steel" if the fucking building was just struck by a huge jetliner.  Didn't you see on the videos where BOTH buildings started to collapse directly at the point of impact?  You CANNOT deny that this happened because everyone in the world can see it, any time they want, on any video showing the collapse of the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And YES, plausible explanations HAVE been given on their rates of decent, but you choose to ignore them and deny they exist.

       <strong>
        10.
       </strong>
       <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/february2007/210207designers.htm">
        The buildings were designed to withstand impact from a plane LARGER than the one that struck it.
       </a>
       When designer and engineer of the Towers John Skilling heard the news that day, he was not worried and knew the buildings would hold. In his report before 9/11- "The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707 DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact." Further in his report- "Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed.
       <strong>
        The building structure would still be there."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       You mention eyewitnesses are unreliable and they are not experts- I meant to say that these eyewitness ARE experts in their respected fields- news reporting and firefighting. Who I wonder, would be more qualified than these people in that scenario? But I do cede that eyewitness accounts can only be taken for what they are... My point was more about how their testimonies were left out of the Commission Report, even though the accounts are consistent and lucid.
      </p>
      <p>
       To your last comment- I haven't chosen to ignore anything, I genuinely haven't heard a plausible explanation of the free-fall collapse. Could you possibly link me to one? I've seen some bullshit animatics, but I haven't seen any science behind them. Anything you can provide that proves the official theory would be news to me. Thanks!

       The buildings were designed to withstand the impact from a 707, which is not LARGER than a 767.  A 767 is larger in all dimensions AND weight.  Further, and this is the most important part, the buildings were designed to withstand the impact of a 707 which was ASSUMED to be traveling at half the speed of the 767's that hit the towers, since it was ASSUMED that if such a plane hit it would have just taken off from a local airport or was coming in for a landing at a local airport.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot produce credible evidence that the towers were designed to withstand the impact of a 600 MPH 707, because they were not.

       Yes, so, first we went from "bigger than" and now we're to "ok, well, it's a little smaller".  I consider that one point debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, "real world" capabilities were that NO BUILDING in NYC would get hit by a jet plane cruising at full speed.  Considering that in the history of jet aviation, it's never even
       <em>
        come close
       </em>
       (aside from these intentional acts), demonstrates that this is a safe assumption.  There would never be a reason for a jet plane to be flying lower than 1500 feet at full speed in the NY Metro area.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I realize the ESB was hit by a plane, but it was much smaller, and flying much slower and before the era of jet aviation, so it's not relevant to the discussion.

       How can you possibly think "a brick wall" is an appropriate analogy? The whole point is that the twin towers were made of steel. Is your bullet going to take down a steel wall, that's the question, and the answer is obviously NO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of the towers weighed up to 500,000 tonnes, compared to a maximum 150 tonnes for a 767. That means the aluminium plane represented 0.02% of the mass of the tower, a construction with a core of solid steel columns.

       "The World Trade Center towers used high-strength, load-bearing perimeter steel columns called Vierendeel trusses that were spaced closely together to form a strong, rigid wall structure, supporting virtually all lateral loads such as wind loads, and sharing the gravity load with the core columns."

      <p>
       The core was comprised of 47 steel columns. Was not in any way "solid core".

       The building came down in a SYMMETRICAL fashion. So even IF some "other debris" travelled that far and that fast to significantly penetrate building 7, it would have NEVER done so in a symmetrical manner. In other words, all of the debris would have had to hit the building along a perfectly straight horizontal line, and then somehow continue to penetrate EACH floor at a precise moment in order for such a collapse to sustain itself all the way to universal and total collapse. And that is physically impossible. If you start chopping at a tree with an axe, to which side do you expect the tree to fall? Towards its strongest side, or towards its weakest side? Logic dictates that it would fall where it does NOT have support and not where it does have support. Applying that principle to building 7 and by extension the Towers, a "natural" collapse would be where part of the building collapses towards the side where it is weakest. But for the building to fall onto itself at near free fall speed must mean that it's inner structure was removed before or during the collapse. Otherwise, we would have to accept that fire could somehow burn progressively in specific places in straight lines, and repeat such a an impossible action again and again and again on each floor. That can not happen. It is impossible. Fire is organic, it burns wherever it CAN burn. So even IF the fire somehow was able to get hot enough (which it did not) it would have produced asymmetrical damage, thus resulting in the building toppling over toward its weakest side (the point of impact) and not fall onto itself.  Never before had a protected steel structure building had a universal collapse caused by fire, and yet somehow on 9/11 it happens three times???  A few floors falling down on top of the rest because it violates physics! For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. So those floors (let's say 10) falling on top would have only had the kinetic energy to destroy on average another 10 floors, NOT the entire building. The building was built to support 4 times its own weight. So those two facts alone completely destroy the pancake theory myth. Let alone the fact that everything was turned into dust. A pancaking of floors would have resulted in at least partial floors being found. But nearly everything...expect a terrorist passport was pulverized to dust. Amazing

       Ok so you explain to me just how building 7 came down so symmetrically AND near free fall speed from damages causes by debris and subsequent fire. 
I'm all ears. 
Then when you finish that please explain how there were people alive near the windows at the point of impact and where the oxygen would have been entering the building the most, and yet the fire was supposed SO hot that it melted steel. So it's possible to melt steel and not human flesh??
And then when you finish that please explain to us how and why did thermite particles find their way into the building? 
And then when you finish that please explain why there were so many eyewitnesses professional and unprofessional who mentioned explosions, and bombs going off. 
And then when you finish that please explain how even AFTER the first plane hit, how a commercial airliner could penetrate the MOST defended and observed airspace on Earth and hit the Pentagon at 0 degrees and going over 500mph and not make any debris any remotely similar to a comparable plane crash.
And then when you finish that....
Never mind. Let me save you some time and effort. The official story is NOT true. Period

       holy fuck.  these have all been posted, reposted, debunked and debunked and debunked over and over and fucking over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, why the fuck is the BBC misreporting that WTC7 even considered important at all?  It was on fire all fucking day.  FDNY stopped trying to do anything about it.  Firemen reported hearing structural distress.   They KNEW it was going to collapse at some point.   Clearly the BBC heard or misheard something a long these lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, why would the conspirators give the press a fucking script of events?   MAKES NO SENSE YOU FUCKING IDIOTS.

       I can show you a link that proves this "investigation" was crap. It didn't make the 911 commission report because IMO they knew it was weak. In regards to traces of nano thermite, why would anyone think the USGS would have the faintest clue what to look for? I work with the USGS. Between you and some of my colleagues of like mind, they are over paid sloths that have samples handed to them they have no idea what to look for especially in this case where the idea of thermite wasn't thought of until after the fact. When put on the spot about it the lead investigator was left speechless with only attacks and promises to look into someone's questions, which never happened. Taking "air samples" possibly days after I had to chuckle. Who doesn't understand that iron spherules are much heavier than air? It's not like skin cells. It did say they tested residual dust from debris, but couldn't isolate any distinct difference between remnants of thermite and-a whole quagmire of other things they made excuses for it could possibly be. Instead of taking a scientists word for it that has studied that very thing. Also said nothing about the two eye witnesses that were inside the building when a bomb went off and nearly lost their lives from the stairway they were on collapsing. The fact that they mysteriously died before being called for testimony aside, this building should have burned for 48 hours until the fuel was gone and a steel frame was left. Citing the USGS in this investigation in determining the residue is hysterical. I only say that because my personal experience, which I couldn't provide proof of without violating tight hole ethics by the different companies that pay me. If they provided a simple copy of their mass spectrometry reading that would change things, I'm guessing they didn't, because I looked for it. Btw this would be the only way to tell the difference between random iron from paint or what have you, or nano thermite. You can't imagine the pressure these guys at the NTSB were under, and the way Giuliani wiped the chess board they didn't have time to do a respectable investigation. Knowing this, and still pushing this off as anything more than a couple of PHD's making a guesstimation, could be considered theory just the same.

       No they said "city is all smoking", not "seven is exploding". I did hear the explosion sound though. The video isn't timed though, so we don't know when this was or what caused the sound. Commentators guess it's between twin towers collapse and WTC 7 collapse. We know that it wasn't right before WTC 7 is coming down (see video link later). Shoddy evidence of ... I don't even know what.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see in this video
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">
        here
       </a>
       that WTC 7 collapse is not preceded by an explosion, even thought the video description says there is an explosion. The video is shot 150 metres from the building, so any amount explosives required to demolish a building would be heard easily, and hundreds of rescue workers in the area would have had ear damage if real explosives had been present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any real demolition of building has a series of explosions.

      <p>
       Evidence does not lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: About your vid: sometime, somewhere, something exploded is what the video says. A few blocks burning is going to contain non-bomb explosion sources, like pressurized tanks, gas lines, fuel tanks, fuel vapor, cars had fuel in them .. it could've been anything. Several buildings had generator fuel tanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Something, somewhere, sometime exploded -&gt; WTC 7 was a controlled demolition" is not that sound of an explanation. And listen to it again, they're not saying WTC 7 is exploding.

       People lie about evidence.  Such as you.   Entertaining too.  Keep waving those hands.. You believe religiously that is says something it doesn't and will come up with all kinds of unwarranted unnecessarily complicated reasons to do so.
