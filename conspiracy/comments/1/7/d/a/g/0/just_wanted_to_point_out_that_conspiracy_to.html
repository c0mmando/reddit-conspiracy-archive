        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People are often wondering why so many others laugh at conspiracy theories and deride them as foolish nonsense. It&#39;s obviously because of the mainstream media going against this narrative to sway public opinion. But why? Because the act of conspiracy is a crime and these elites know they are committing a crime. If you want to think of our whole situation as one big conspiracy then it&#39;s a really, really big crime. </p>

<p>Here is a useful definition on the lawfulness of conspiracy:</p>

<p>&quot;Conspiracy to commit a crime is charged against people who helped plan the crime and took some action toward committing it. It’s a more serious version of an aiding and abetting or accessory charge. For example, if two people made a detailed plan to steal a museum’s diamond, but only one of them broke into the museum and took the gem, both could be charged with conspiracy. Asking or paying someone to commit a violent crime is a more serious type of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is both a state and federal crime. Some systems make conspiracy to commit a felony punishable by the same amount of prison time as the crime itself; others put it at half of the prison time of the crime itself. Conspiracy to commit a less serious crime, like financial fraud, may draw a steep fine, jail time or a few years in prison.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IANAL, but I believe they strengthened/created a lot of conspiracy laws in the days when they were trying to bust up the mafia/organized crime. Of course, many of the crimes we complain about here are nothing more than organized crimes. I guess the difference is that this &quot;mafia&quot; also controls the legal system and many more dangerous tools for its crimes.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>by the amount of people who laugh &amp; deride even the very notion that the US federal government is involved in high-level conspiracies, no I would say not everybody understands this. People still think the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; means lunatic-fringe-crazy-nutjob-tinfoil-retard and it&#39;s actually quite the opposite.</p>
