      <p>
       Recently I was introduced to the theory of Ascension, that our souls return to this dimension/vibration through reincarnation until we have mastered the lessons our souls require to increase their vibrational energy to the next dimension, Earth currently being in the 3rd vibrational dimension, the "afterlife" being the 4th vibrational dimension. From what I understand there are thirteen vibrational levels that we are striving to climb. That our "souls" are in a constant state of moving towards perfection through the lives we live and the lessons we learn through Karmic balance over a multitude of life times.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your opinions on the theory of Ascension? 
Does your religious system/belief work in a similar manner? 
What does your religion teach as the purpose of life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the "Law of One" incorrect? Or what would you change to the Law of One to make it accurate?
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I understand from reading the Law of One, everything in existence exists in the NOW, all at the same time because it is all the same Source, the same energy, the exact same being existing as all things at the same time. 
Is that a proper understanding of existence as you have been taught?

       Yes. He was a part of "God" and became humanized. Although, we view him a bit differently than most Christians do, to put it lightly lol.

       So then your beliefs are based on the 3 Abrahamic religions since you recognize Jesus as a man. These are fairly new beliefs in human history. Here is what they are based on.

       In what way do you mean this?  He was badass how?  Do you mean that he was badass in the way that the rest of the world believes he was badass? i.e. being able to turn rocks to bread, heal the sick, rise up from the dead, etc, etc...or do mean this in some other way?

       He surrounded himself with thugs and whores. Not to mention he had one hell of a temper, especially as a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following are excerpts from a book rejected from the Bible called The Infancy Gospel, written around the same time as the four Gospels. We have stroies in our own "Bible" very similar to this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        3 And a certain Jew when he saw what Jesus did, playing upon the Sabbath day, departed straightway and told his father Joseph: Lo, thy child is at the brook, and he hath taken clay and fashioned twelve little birds, and hath polluted the Sabbath day. 4 And Joseph came to the place and saw: and cried out to him, saying: Wherefore doest thou these things on the Sabbath, which it is not lawful to do? But Jesus clapped his hands together and cried out to the sparrows and said to them: Go! and the sparrows took their flight and went away chirping. 5 And when the Jews saw it they were amazed, and departed and told their chief men that which they had seen Jesus do.
       </p>
       <p>
        III. 1 But the son of Annas the scribe was standing there with Joseph; and he took a branch of a willow and dispersed the waters which Jesus had gathered together. 2 And when Jesus saw what was done, he was wroth and said unto him: O evil, ungodly, and foolish one, what hurt did the pools and the waters do thee? behold, now also thou shalt be withered like a tree, and shalt not bear leaves, neither root, nor fruit. 3 And straightway that lad withered up wholly, but Jesus departed and went unto Joseph's house.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Kinda brutal? It gets better:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        IV. 1 After that again he went through the village, and a child ran and dashed against his shoulder. And Jesus was provoked and said unto him: Thou shalt not finish thy course (lit. go all thy way). And immediately he fell down and died. But certain when they saw what was done said: Whence was this young child born, for that every word of his is an accomplished work? And the parents of him that was dead came unto Joseph, and blamed him, saying: Thou that hast such a child canst not dwell with us in the village: or do thou teach him to bless and not to curse: for he slayeth our children.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and what did he do when the other kids told on him?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        V. 1 And Joseph called the young child apart and admonished him, saying: Wherefore doest thou such things, that these suffer and hate us and persecute us? But Jesus said: I know that these thy words are not thine: nevertheless for thy sake I will hold my peace: but they shall bear their punishment. And straightway they that accused him were smitten with blindness. 2 And they that saw it were sore afraid and perplexed, and said concerning him that every word which he spake whether it were good or bad, was a deed, and became a marvel. And when they (he ?) saw that Jesus had so done, Joseph arose and took hold upon his ear and wrung it sore. 3 And the young child was wroth and said unto him: It sufficeth thee (or them) to seek and not to find, and verily thou hast done unwisely: knowest thou not that I am thine? vex me not.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So like I said, bit of a different view lol.

      <p>
       Okay.  I'm certainly no biblical scholar, but I'm not familiar with his temper as a child at all.  Is this information something you that gathered from the personal teachings of your family, or is it something that is available for anyone to read?

       The problem I have with this post is this.. (and it is entertaining to see people dance with OP) ... No proof. No new knowledge. General statements that can be found on any conspiracy site. No real substance other than, on an internet site, the OP saying "TRUST ME!". unverifiable, uncorroborated, no proof offered. Can you see where this seems like a troll, OP?

       You have seen the effects of our secrets first hand, when Adolf Hitler got his hands on our Book and used its knowledge to basically become untouchable. Just look into all the assassination attempts that were unsuccessful towards him and the fact that he probably never committed suicide in that bunker, as the skull previously thought to be his actually belonged to a woman.

       Pretty much impossible. There are seven of them in existence (perhaps more in undiscovered archaeological ruins) and one of them is in the Vatican Archives. The other six have been entrusted to families in every major continent. The one in my house is locked away in a vault somewhere in my dad's study and I have no idea of the location or the combo.
      </p>

       So my advice is start digging in the middle east.

       Nothing worth having is easy or free. There are reasons that a 16 year old is not supposed to get handed a zx-14 or a lamborghini. The only Devil that Hitler got ahold of that bit him was Central Banks/the Illuminati. He renigged on payment in the mid-30's and that is how his country rose to power. You buying power, be out of debt. Debt=Devil=enslavement and that is real not some Idol that you pray to that you never see/hear that is unless you fancy some strong drugs.

When ever you learn more about science you will find the facts of a given situation and understand the reasons for the way things are. I was a child, I am long since grown to reason and understand.

       Why would any all-powerful entity need to be worshipped by far lesser creatures? That seems immature and even juvenile. I do not demand that fleas worship me. And I believe that one part of a truly moral being is that it gives freely to others within reason, demands nothing back, and simply wishes to build up the common good. And does not harm others without moral need to, such as self-defense against evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       it seems to me Satanic philosophy embraces taking a shortcut to get ahead, but Godly philosophy includes the value of learning and making moral choices and making the hard choices in order to evolve.

       Hey man, (I'm assuming you're male based on one of your responses to cartoonhead when talking about sex, forgive me if I misspoke) I've read the entire post top to bottom and found it to be very interesting.  Whether or not it is the whole truth, I cannot say; but, it has certainly opened my mind to some new ideas and reinforced some preconceived ideas as well.  And that deserves a "Thank You" regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Longtime reddit lurker, have no account, making a throwaway to PM you.  Hoping for a response, but I've read that you've got a shit-ton of PM's.  If you've got some time I'd love to chat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to pass any serious judgement on your words, good or evil.  It is never helpful to shoot the messenger, as has been done throughout this thread by a gaggle of superfcially religious zealots.  But I suppose it is their prerogative - to each their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, after reading through I have some additional questions that I'd like to throw your way and would appreciate any answers that you may be able to give without violation of your oaths.  But, first I'd like to eludicate some of my views so that our conversation may go smoothly, in the hopes that you may better understand where I'm coming from with these questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up in a Roman Catholic household, coming from a long line of catholic parents and grandparents (with the exception of one grandfather who saw the whole game of religion as a farce - focused on a [generally] uneducated people).  Early as a child I was able to pick out the valid moral teachings provided by the church and the Bible hidden behind years of tradition and dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, I began to study history, and especially that of the RCC, as it has been a primary mover and shaker in terms of geo-politics since about the time of the council of Nicea - where the Roman political structure took control of Christianity for it's own benefit.  I've come to learn that history is written by the victors and that there are often many sides to the same story.  I would assume that the Vatican has altered much of the narrative of human history - to reinfoce it's own hegemony.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have made several mentions of the Vatican's power - and believe me I do not doubt you.  You also made mention of both Nazi Germany and the USA being the puppets of the RCC controled Vatican.  I know this to be true due to the concordats signed with the vatican by both the Nazis (1930s) and then later the USA after WWII concluded and we gave safe harbor to many former Nazis (Operation Paperclip).
      </p>
      <p>
       I also know that the Nazis were quite keen on archaeological expeditions and the study of certain Eastern/Asiatic religions.  I was wondering if you knew and could offer some insight into what they (the Nazis) were looking for / what they were able to find.  I do know that they were searching Mt. Ararat for the Ark among other things - but, this is what I was referring to above by information omitted from the official narrative.  Just wondering if you had any more information or clues to hunt down in those regards.
      </p>
      <p>
       -transition-
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also been able to glean from reading this thread that there are at least two types of humanity upon this planet, coming from at least two different ideolgical schools - those from the Abrahamic God/Creator and then in opposition the Diety/Creator which you identify with - and call 'Satan' (or at least in this post, for convenience, so that all the Abrahamic peoples can identify whom you speak of).  I envision the struggle between the two as Yin/Yang - Light/Dark - Night/Day - Left/Right.  While adversarial, they truly rely on ecahother, and perform a sort of endless cosmic dance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also made mention of the possibility that there may be many people in the world who were created 'Satan' or as you call him The Benevolent One.  The first thing that sprung to my mind was that for the most part, followers of Abrahamic religions tend to fit within the paradigm certain racial profiles: i.e. Jews, Muslims, and early Christians were all endemic to a certain geographical region.  Christianity spread like wildfire through Europe due to Christianity's ties to the former Roman Empire - which later became the Holy Roman Empire, that today comprises much of the landmass of the EU.  Could you offer some insight into the possibility that creations of The Benevolent One may have some statistically significant racial traits that may identify them among the backdrop of Abrahamic peoples?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a follow up to that question, how should we consider say the Japanese?  I think we can both agree that as a subset of the world human population they likely had little to do with events in ancient Canaan or old Akkad.  By no means am I trying to belittle the Japanese by using them as an example - just trying to open up dialogue.  Also, I've noticed that the religions of the Eastern hemisphere (I have Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and others in mind) are quite different from those which we know here in the west.

       You had mentioned Atlantis as the home of the creations made by The Benevolent One which was destroyed by the wrath of the Abrahamic God.  Unless I'm vastly off course, I believe Atlantis to have been in the Atlantic Ocean - quite possibly the reason for naming that ocean, and other places such as Atlanta - which is much closer to the Atlantic than any other bodies of water.  So again - my mind comes back to the Eastern hemisphere.  What of the opposite side of the world, what about Oceania? How do these peoples play a part in the grand scheme of things?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to add that I find merit in both of the creator god's aspirations.  I find merit in the instructions of the Abrahamic God- that one should work hard for success and then feel the reward of a job well done.  But, on the other hand, I truly also believe aspects of The Benevolent One's philosophy - that man should be given the tools to be able to succeed - because then he can use his/her effort to exceed some limiting boundaries.  I guess I can't come to grips why we can't both have our cake and eat it too.  I wonder if there were a way for us "children" to bridge the gap created by these creator gods.

       I've seen your layman's explanation of your six commandments and can't find any serious objections that fly in the face of my catholic upbringing.  Granted, I'm no devout member - way too much bullshit, too little real spirituality.  The thing is most Catholics are so thick-headed that there's no talking to them.  But - keep in mind that there is a rigorous system that instructs them to behave in such a way.

       I guess I'll wrap it up here for now - I've scores more questions but will wait for a first response before throwing more questions at you

       Yes and no. The original race created by Satan's ethnicity remains a mystery. I can tell you that Hitler's belief in an all powerful, superior race
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       stem from our teachings, but whether or not it was "Aryan" is up for debate. After our holy land was wiped out, "Satan" created men who were like the races of God's creations (God had divided them and gave them different characteristics after the incident at the Tower of Babel)
      </p>
      <p>
       It is said that after he divided the races, there was a disconnect because of lack of communication, so they formed their own religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Atlantis" was not located in the Atlantic Ocean. It was nowhere near where any one believes it to have been.

       I can buy that.  I've also spent a lot of time studying that point in history.  Something about the Nazis just absolutely fascinates me.  That was why I brought up Eastern religions, as Hitler got his ideas of an Aryan master race from the older texts found throughout India and other parts of the Middle East, such as Iraq and Iran - areas in close proximity to the Tower of Babel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never (at least in modern history) has a group of people unified and mobilized in such a way.  I think that the Nazi example really exemplifies the power of human determinism.  If one sets their mind to accomplish something, and sets out guns blazing - as Gandhi said, "be the change you want to see..." it will happen.  Does that make Hitler right? maybe yes, maybe no - who am I to judge - happened before my time.  Is this along the lines of what you were mentioning about Hitler getting his hands on your teachings and doing his own thing with it?

      <p>
       I've read in this post that there are people throughout the world created by "Satan" and do not know they are. I've got a few questions.  Maybe you've got a few answers.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you could make a guess, about what percentage of the population has come from "Satan's" lineage?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If these people who were originally of "Satan's" creation and lineage exist and are not cognizant of this fact how will they be viewed/judged.  From what I gather, "Satan" is trying to prove a point to "God" using his people and likewise "God" is trying to prove a point to "Satan" using his own people.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          My only goal in life is to help my Creator prove his point.
I know this doesn't pertain to you personally, because you are aware; but, what becomes of one of "Satan's" progeny  who unknowingly goes through this life?
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Or better yet, what if one of "Satan's" bloodline is raised under the belief system of "God".  You've hinted towards a few bloodlines known to you to be of service to "Satan" so they're all set - nothing to worry about.  So lets say hypothetically during the dark ages some extended family of your bloodline was forced/duped/adopted Christianity somewhere along the way. (I'm not talking about putting up the charade of being Christian like many of the financial or political "elite" of today - but actually converted.)  Many generations down the line these extended family of yours would surely still be of your bloodline, fragmented and diluted perhaps, but not of your creed.  Eventually they will have become dislocated from their creator - but may not necessarily believe in the "God" that their family had indoctrinated them to believe in either.  Understand where I'm trying to go with this?  How would these people be seen by either people like yourself or by your creator?
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Still have a few more questions, but I suspect answers to these questions may help me format them better. But one last one just for shits:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Atlantis" was not located in the Atlantic Ocean. It was nowhere near where any one believes it to have been.
Does this then imply that you, your family, or others in the bloodlines know more about the location and have not been letting on?

After hearing your brief insights into Hitler and the Nazis I think it answers some of my existential questions about that time.  After reading through the post and knowing what I know about the Nazis I think we see things through roughly the same lens.  As I mentioned before, something about Hitler has always been extremely fascinating to me.  He isn't the first man in history to hijack a religion and use it for his own selfish gains - won't be the last either.

       Is there any way for an individual to determine whether they come from "God" or "Satan"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it all about identification - i.e. if one identifies him/her self to a particular creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be a quite level-headed individual, and not too quick to pass judgement.  I'm sure that we can both agree that there are some valid fragments in Abrahamic texts, be it Jewish, Christian, or Islamic.  I haven't had the luxury of some of the texts you're privy to but I'd also imagine that there's some equally good text there as well.  I cannot speak for your religion, but many of the religious texts of the Abrahamic traditions have been corrupted or outright ignored through time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the degradation of traditional Abrahamic religions (especially since the time of Darwin and later Nietzsche) and wonder if this has been part of a plan?  Or just the natural evolutionary result of a number of historical charlatans and miscreants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally - I don't know what the hell to believe.  I was raised RCC - but even a fool should be able to spot all their bullshit.  Could I be created by "God" sure, I'd believe it.  Could I have been created by "Satan" sure, I'd believe that too.  I guess in that vein I'm a little bit agnostic.  As I've been reading through the thread I can rationally and logically understand many of the arguments underpinning your stance.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as my part in the great cosmic pissing match between "God" and "Satan" I do not know whose side I'm trying to prove right.  As you have laid things out, I can see and empathize both sides of the argument.  Let's just Rodney King this bitch and "Can't we all just get along"

       Oh, I'm fully aware of the Vatican's control.  Many in this subreddit never confront this issue.  They were the innovators of the secret police system that is in place throughout the world today.  Even Hitler was working through the Vatican, or at the very least had their explicit approval.  And it was also the Vatican that facilitated immigration into America many ex-Nazis.

       It appears to me that the financial systems of the world have gone rogue over the past few years.  I generally see these financial systems no longer acting in the best interest of many countries - countries that would normally be acting in the best interests of Rome.  It seems these financial institutions are only acting in their own self interest...which sounds kinda something like using the tools given to you to the best of your ability to prove a point...
Correct me if I'm mistaken.

       I can believe it.  It must suck to be in a minority group and persecuted by one of the most powerful organizations in the world.  Would you say that this is a source of fear for you or others like you, or are "Satan's" children somehow immune to fear?

       Before I start, I think we both know how extremely fragile this thing we call "society" or "civilization" is.  If only a few cogs in the machine were to malfunction things would turn sour in a hurry.  Keeping that in mind...
      </p>
      <p>
       I would assume that the best way to take the situation into your hands (not you personally, but the plural) would be to take control of the economic sector, as it is the lynch-pin that underpins all of the other points alluded to above.  Just look at what's happened over the past century, literally everything has been monetized, commoditized, and bought up for pennies on the dollar to those able to afford it.  I understand there's been private property in the past, but not like this.  I'm sure you know what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a few people, given all the tools needed for success, were to take control of only a few small important positions, say a few CEOs here, regulatory agents there, a couple politicians, maybe a handful of likeable media figures to convey your messages to the masses, hell - even some influential think tanks and non-governmental organizations, and the slow steady acquisition of assets would provide some incredible leverage on those cogs of the machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the move off the gold standard, IMF loans to third world countries, the complete deregulation of wallstreet, the explosion of algorithmic high frequency trading, the series of bubbles, flash-crashes, Libor manipulation, and non prosecution of other money-laundering firms be leading up to something that sweeps the entire world over faster than it knows how to handle such an event?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would such chaos and turmoil perhaps lead to the appearance of "Satan's" counter punch to Jesus?

       I still have a hard time understanding how 1 in 5 persons can be "world class" talented, more so than the HS(high school?) captain. Did you go to a high school with only 3 people, or perhaps one with no mathematics class? Haha I kid, but that seems like saying 20% of all trees, are the tallest tree in the entire forest. Your cryptic reply is even more confusing, unless you are suggesting that most of the satanic population is either very old or very young.  Perhaps you should clarify this point.

       They just have whatever it is that they want to be good at. Not like the whole plethora of things. If they don't like something, they're not very good at it. For example: I fucking hate European football, and I have zero capacity to play the sport (I'm fast, that's about it for futbol)
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing that remains constant though is the looks. They have the looks and they excel in at least one area of their life, and when I say excel I mean they are head and shoulders above the rest.

       I am not of the Levayan variety of Satanism, which is essentially just atheism on steroids.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is not much of a rank system. Six families protect our deepest secrets, all transcribed in a Book that is beyond ancient. My family is one of them. It is through one of these six families, and only these six families, that you can come to know our secrets. Unfortunately, one of these Books was seized by the Vatican during the Dark Ages. It resides in the archives to this day.

      <p>
       Yes and no. Not really what you would think of as occultism
      </p>

       Rising. Vastly. People are becoming more and more aware that there are two sides to every story.

       None of the public ones even come close to hitting the mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       People of families created by Satan are always extreme upper class, but anyone can convert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Christianity (ESPECIALLY Roman Catholicism) pretty much rules the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, another poster brought it to my attention. Not really a whole lot to do with what I believe in (I have not even scratched the surface in this thread)
      </p>
      <p>
       They are idiot wannabes and God delights in it because it gives Satan a bad rap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, most of rituals are done sans clothing to tell you the truth. Satan has always been proud of the beauty of the human body.

       Both. You know my family's last name. I guarantee it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No. I have said before God is very much real and he is
       <em>
        unfathomably
       </em>
       powerful. The few humans he does take the time to allow in his presence live in that country. There would be
       <em>
        serious
       </em>
       consequences to any man who entered the Vatican who aligns himself with Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       No. As I have said before, the law of one is guess work at best and plays no major role in my beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Demons" and "Angels" exist, and are the same species. Most extraterrestrial activity can be attributed to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The test does not involve human sacrifice. I realize I worded that poorly. But your intentions will be revealed, I guarantee you that.

       Good point.  This is almost the gun argument but on a spiritual level/field.  Those that have guns (or spiritual secrets) want to keep them from everyone else, saying in part that it would be "too dangerous if everyone had them."  The truth of the matter is that if everyone had them, then EVERYONE would be more safe because everyone would be on a much more even playing field and everyone would have the ability to defend themselves against those wishing to misuse and mishandle those guns/spiritual secrets.

       Yes the secret argument here is simply so that they don't become widely ridiculed. Same reason as Scientology and Masons.

       I'm not sure it's that simple.  I think it's not so much so they won't be ridiculed.  If they truly have that level of power (and some groups certainly seem to), then I think that ridicule is like the
       <em>
        least
       </em>
       of their concerns.  I think they simply don't want others to have that power.  I think that there is indeed an
       <em>
        initial
       </em>
       point in saying that universally releasing the knowledge to everyone would indeed create at least an INITIAL "free for all" power grab and there would possibly be a LOT of chaos and turmoil as people and groups would be trying to "take over the world" with all this new power and knowledge and information they just got a hold of.  I do think that things would eventually even/smooth out, however, and the population would learn to exist under this knew paradigm where EVERYONE had a lot more power and understanding and awareness.  It would just take a moment for the population to settle into the understanding that now EVERYONE is a much more powerful, much more capable, much more knowledgeable being.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would personally say that those with the knowledge just aren't in the mood for having to deal with the "global growing pain" aspect that would inevitably happen if EVERYONE had
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       That and they simply don't want to give up the power.  They're (quite possibly) just as greedy and fickle and scared as the next puny human - albeit on possibly a "greater", more complicated level.

       Since you mention your rituals use Akkadian language - did your religion originate in ancient Sumeria?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, wouldn't the concept of unity - ie we are all one being - kind of contradict your beliefs? 
Your religion seems super dualistic- doesn't this work against perceiving the universe as a whole?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, in your views, are God and Satan kind of biological/racial oversouls, similar to how individual cells make up a single being?

       Would you say that this is one of the primary differences between the 2 forms of humanity - that your group views reality through a dualistic lens, while the other group tends towards a unity-based view? And would you say your group more or less founded the dualistic view?

       Very, very good observations and questions on your part, if I may say so.  Very astute.  They are thoughts that I myself had on a certain level, and I'm glad you brought them up/asked them here.

       <em>

       Having now caught up on the thread myself, I think the answer to question 1 will be "no, we originated in Atlantis" (right, OP?)... but I'm still curious about the Akkadian/Sumerian connection...
      </p>
      <p>
       I have my theories for the other questions too, but I'm hoping the OP gets around to answering them him/herself...

       Because the belief that we just cease to exist has no scientific evidence. Neither does an after life. Let me explain why I believe. We can't back up EITHER side with scientific evidence, and since that is the case, I choose to believe in the option that sounds better, since you can't prove either, why not believe the better one?

       If there were two doors you had to go through, and the first one supposedly had a lion on the other side (with no actual evidence, you were just told this), and the 2nd door supposedly had a million dollars on the other side (with no actual evidence, you were just told this), would you not choose the door with the million dollars, so at the very least just in case there WAS a lion in the other door, you wouldn't have to meet it?

       Don't you ever step back and ask yourself why you have to go through either door and WHY is there a lion or a million dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit unlikely? Doesn't it seem that it may be a great source of fear based control to you?

       I am simply illustrating the debate between "Is there a God or not", that is all. Neither side can dis prove or prove their side, so I illustrated what it is like. I hope you can see that's all I was trying to do.

       Hi, I actually have a few questions I'd like to ask you if you could take time out of your day to do so.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         the rituals that you perform,although you can't explain what exactly they are,how do you benefit from them?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What kind of lifestyle do you live? Is it a lavish one? If so is it due to your worship of satan?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What about the rumor of people selling their souls to become famous,how true is that and can you give any examples?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       Thanks for taking the time to reply back. One more thing. To Christians, heaven is a place where no wrong takes place and is basically perfect. Their version of hell is a horrible place where the evil go and  where your soul burns in fire forever upon ever. What is your take on heaven and hell? Where do you think you will end up and how would the afterlife differ between an individual who worships Satan and an individual who worships Jesus? Again thank you for your time

       I can not comment on my own beliefs of the afterlife, but I can comment on the Christian one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The belief that Hell is a place of fire an brimstone is a complete myth, as the Bible points out Hell is but "eternal separation from God"
      </p>
      <p>
       So in that sense, yes, we will be in hell.

       Regardless of if there is actually fire or not, the point is being completely away from God's presence for eternity is the worst punishment imaginable.

       God IS love, mercy, kindness, and all things good in the world. So when you have a place completely devoid of God, you have a place completely devoid of anything good.

       I didn't say I wanted to end it.  Only to point out the logical inconsistency to your claim that Satan can provide the tools to get whatever you want.  If Satan's promise to you is inconsistent, and fallible, why would you, or anyone believe in and follow such a concept or promise?

       Yes, they are homeless and hungry because of the own actions and decisions, but isn't that Gods plan?  Let them figure it out on their own?  Don't you want the will of your creator to spread across the world?

       Not necessarily. If there are five people who follow "Satan" and they are happy and successful and have achieved power, as opposed to the billions of people who are left to their own devices by God and they are miserable, Who's winning?

       Hey, I know I was asking questions here elsewhere in this thread. I don’t really know how to phrase this but I'll give it a shot, is there anywhere in your psyche that says to you that using children innocence in this manner is morally wrong? I guess I’m asking did you ever struggle with the belief system or have a moral crisis. I think you kinda answered this before in my other question but I want to be sure in that I don’t want to have false ideals about this religion. Does your religion use children in a sexual manner?

       Ok cool thanks, also:
Your obviously aware of all the conspiracy surrounding mainstream satanism and people in politics. Well a lot of them are geared towards paedophilia and human hurting, apparently they use it to harness energy are something and its always children and always sexual, in your own belief do you think this goes on but is a separate religion from your own or from your knowledge is that stuff false, I just want your personal opnion.  And also earlier you said something about a ritual geared towards world peace, (i believe in a reference to bohemian grove, although I may have taken it up wrong). Is your religion aiming for world peace in some shape or form?

       So since you were brought into this religion since birth and have been indoctrinated into it, I can only guess that as a normal adolescent you might have questioned if your given set of beliefs / values were right for you.  Were you ever inclined to go to God or Atheism as you grew older?  Have you known anyone who separated from your faith later on in life to choose God?  What are your thoughts on the Gnostic teachings of JC?

       Yes.  I understand this, of course.  However, I am not asking about what they make a point to "publicly" profess.  I'm asking about what
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       happens.  Are you also "private" enemy No. 1?  Are the upper,
       <em>
        upper
       </em>
       echelons of the Roman Catholic Church really one and the same with your branch?
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be similar to, say, politics in the United States.  The Democrats and the Republicans make a huge ploy to be against one another, and publicly decry the other's philosophy.  However, even though many members of either branch are themselves ignorant of this very truth, the fact of the matter is that they are both two clawed hands on the same nefarious entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wonder if The Roman Catholic Church is aligned or associated in such a manner with your group at its deeper levels.

       No. When the Pope says he can speak with God, he is not lying. At the top, behind closed doors, their goal has always been to eradicate our faith.

       I can tell you the Illuminati are real because I accidentally became illuminated myself.  I am not part of the Illuminati conspiracy, which I do believe exists.  However, once a person has received the illumination, whether through accident or purpose, that person is an Illuminati.  The other Illuminati will immediately recognize this and the person in question will have no trouble discerning that, yes, there really are a large number of normal-seeming people who are illuminated, and all of them take part in the earth-realm spiritual battle.  Whether they engage in conspiracies or not is a different matter.  I wouldn't know because I'm a lone wolf.

       does william cooper have a pretty good understanding of your religion? ie satan gave man knowledge, in the garden of eden, satan is prometheus.. etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       are all mystery schools related to your order? such as brotherhood of light, masons, illuminati etc..  ?
what I'm really asking is are there no mystery schools who align themselves with god?
      </p>
      <p>
       this would kind of make sense to me from what you're saying, because it seems the premise of all these mystery schools is that they hold secret the tools of power yada yada yada.
      </p>
      <p>
       my friend is a member of a mystery school, and he said he's taken an oath not to reveal things, I just wonder if he's aligned himself with satan and can't tell me. I'm not sure, or furthermore not really judging. however I align my self with god, and would think that he'd be on the wrong side of the war.

       So if we don't align ourselves behind either god or satan, then we fall under god? I saw you mention somewhere I forget where now, that even being atheist still means you fall under god, because this is gods plan.

       This is off subject but I wrote this earlier and you never got back to me:
How would I find one (in relation to a member of your relgion), is their a certain name given to this relgion. I mean it'd be pretty impossible considering its secret right? I know you said that I can pray to your god anytime I wish, but if my only knowledge of your god is the mainstream model then wont by intensions/visualzations be formed in ill will for lack of a better pharse. How would I go about praying?

       I am muslim, so I have an abrahamic view of satan as Lucifer, the angel of Allah, who when Allah created man refused to bow before him, and was therefore banished from heaven, and spreads evil in the hearts of man to try to prove to Allah that indeed, man is inferior. In some ways, Allah and Lucifer have a partnership in that Lucifer keeps the souls of men whom he has through his influence proven to Allah are unworthy in hellfire, but why anyone would
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to be tortured in hell for eternity escapes me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As this story is in all three of the holy books (Torah, Bible, Qu'ran), I would like to hear your thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you have a different story on the origins of Satan?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you believe the same story, or a variation on it, why do you worship the one who's mission it is to lead you away from righteousness?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are Satan and Allah enemies in your view? Is Satan All-powerful? If so then who is Allah? Is Satan a creation of Allah or are they equal partners?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you believe they are equal partners, do you believe that both have always existed or that one came before the other?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What are your beliefs on Abraham and Abrahamic religions? How and why did these things exist before Satanism? If you view them as false, why did an Abrahamic "Satan" exist before the practice of worshipping him? Why would Satan allow the massive spread of such faiths around the globe in their three forms, and why do none of the prophets speak of Satan in anything other than a negative way?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you believe Satan resides in hell and if so, why do you want to go there?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What happens to you if you violate your oath? Is there a satanist equivalent of Hell?
        </p>
       </li>

       Awesome. I love Muslims. Way more tolerant than Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. We hold that the story in the Bible which many people attribute to "Satan" is actually the tale of a
       <a href="http://www.apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=11&amp;amp;article=1091">
        Babylonian King
       </a>
       named Lucifer. "Satan"  has always been, and will always be.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are absolute enemies, but are forbidden by the cosmic laws which govern the universe to actually harm one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both have always existed and always will.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Abrahamic religions share much of our historical accounts. Most of our "scripture" is the after math of major events in the Torah, or Old Testament.

       Well you should know the Qu'ran says youre definitely going to hell, but that said I respect your right to control the destiny of your own soul. I read your link but it has still left some questions unanswered.

       I assume that this comes from a taoist-style yin-yang view of the universe, where the ultimate law of the universe is balance, and that therefore niether Allah nor Satan can eliminate the other. I would ask how can either one can truly be Gods if both are subject to higher laws? And who do you believe created the Universe and the ultimate law of balance if not either one of them? I am also still very interested in your view of Hell as the Kingdom of Satan/Heaven as the Kingdom of Allah, and which acts qualify one's soul for either fate.

       As muslims, we are instructed by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to establish regular prayer five times per day, give part of our income every year to the poor, and if we ourselves are poor to give part of our time to good deeds, and finally to make a pilgramage to the holy city at least once in our lives. How do you live your life as a satanist? I am not asking for specifics as I realize this would violate your faith, but can you give any details on any acts the "Church(?)" considers favorable in daily life?

       Our morals are very close to yours, in the sense we can't kill/harm anyone. About the only difference is we are encouraged to enjoy this life, rather than suffer it. Physical fitness is something that is also preached in our beliefs.

       is a true story.  If you must stoop to

       Lucifer is the Jesus of an alien planet, one of Yahweh's many sons and daughters.  He is not a fallen angel, not Satan, not a Babylonian King, not a character from Paradise Lost.

       I gather that the point would be something like "our god's creation strategy is better than the other god's creation strategy"; is this accurate?

       Does the story of Adam, Eve, and the the garden of Eden (including tree of knowledge, forbidden fruit, tempting by the serpent etc) figure into your religion's story at all? And if so, how? Do any of the participants in the bible's version of this story represent your people?

       I have a question regarding ghosts. I am an agnostic, raised in a Christian household, I have seen several "ghosts" in my lifetime. One appeared as a grungerocker the other a small boy. My father always told me that ghosts were not human souls but demons manifesting themselves in forms to trick us into questioning God. 
So my question is, are ghosts people's lost souls, demons manifesting themselves in forms we can understand, or is there another explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the age of 10, I once heard a voice speaking in a language I cannot identify. As I listened, it sounded like 2 beings conversing. After a few minutes of terror there was a deafening silence, followed by one whispering loudly, "it's time to bring up another angel." I obviously shit an epic streak. Any insight as to what it is I heard?

       "Angels" and "Demons" are of the same species, they can take on whatever form they want and their allegiances can change in a heartbeat. Most hauntings and extraterrestrial activities can be attributed to them.

       Last few questions, thanks for your time.
Do you guys use a special calendar?
Any teachings on drug use?
If you're fighting an idealogical battle here, why all the secrecy?
Does having an ability to translate Akkadian text give you any kind of special insight on ancient history, and if so would you care to explain a few of your ideas on the topic.

       Haha this is a bit embarrassing, but I'm not all that good at Akkadian. It's fucking hard. I know enough for rituals and can read enough to understand the early books in our "Bible" but that's about it.

       My dad on the other hand sounds like he's not even from this planet when he speaks it. His grasp on history too is pretty awesome.

       Funny story though: one time I was completely hammered, and my friends started joking that I wasn't human. So I entertained them and spoke a bit of Akkadian. Scared the ever living shit out of them.

       first of all not sure if I believe any of your jibber jabber. but with the akkadian stuff, is there not also the gift of tongues in your order? if satan gives you all these tools I would figure tongues and ability to assume translation and stuff would follow.. maybe

       The thing is, when you are to be blessed with something by Him, you have to really truly want it. I'm just not at the point where I really truly want to be fluent in Akkadian.

      </p>
      <p>
       We are a homework assignment. There is a given template that must be followed. The assignment is to create the ultimate form of conscious life. God created man first. Satan saw the "flaws" (in his eyes) of the men God created and so took it upon himself to one up God (because that is their nature) and so created a being he felt was superior to God's creation. God refuses to acknowledge that his be the case and so proposes that his people, left to their own, would surpass Satan's in the end who already were gifted with everything they need.
      </p>

       We are so important to them because it is about proving a point.

       Its odd, I've read about a similar version of this story that I'd like your opinion on. It draws many parallels to your beliefs, enough so that I think you may have further knowledge on the subject that you havn't spoke of yet.

       From what I've gathered, the creator-god of this planet was in charge of the growth and development of the human species. As the ultimate goal of consciousness, or being, in the universe is to go out and experience and eventually return to The One, subdivisions of The One are created in order to create experiences. The creator-god of this planet and the subdivisions of himself, the human race, were being held in a state of suspended bliss. The planet was a literal "Garden of Eden". Unfortunately, in this state, growth was impossible, and little spiritual development was made in the human race. The creator-god of this planet appealed for help, reluctantly, as he enjoyed his "pet creation" as it was called. Whatever entities that are in charge of this planetary system then contracted another soul group/creator-god by the name of Lucifer to provide and embody a catalyst for spiritual development on this planet. Much to Earth's creator-god's dismay, the soul group Lucifer was to incarnate upon this planet and provide humanity with a route to further development. This came in the form of the story of Adam and Eve and the tree of knowledge. Earth's creator god had faith in his creation that they would not question further, and would stay in the state of suspended bliss that he had provided for the humans, but instead, humanity chose to disobey his orders and "take the fruit" In a fit of jealous rage, Earth's creator god imprisoned the soul group Lucifer in this dimension and cast humanity out of the kingdom of heaven. The soul group Lucifer, in fulfillment of its contract, was then forced to stay and continue to provide the catalyst for human development. They do this by being completly self-serviant. They provide us with means for development by embodying that which we are not. Their group goes by many names and has many divisions (Illuminati, Rothschild, etc.) but at the very top are a group of off-world entities of the soul group known as Lucifer.

      <p>
       When you say "we" are so important to "them", you mean that "each different 'subspecies' of human (i.e. the one created by god, and the other created by statan)" are both important to their respective creators because the respective creators are using their creations to "one up" each other.  Correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, here's another question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you a "satan-created" human or a "god-created" human whose family converted to satanism and that's how you were born into it?  I think the name "satanism" feels stupid to me, btw.  What would YOU call it?  I would prefer to refer to your religion by what YOU call it, if I may.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if your family are the type of human that was actually CREATED by satan instead of a god-created human that
       <em>
        converted
       </em>
       to satanism, then do you/does your family have or feel some sort of inherent superiority to "normal, god-created" humans?  I mean if you're a satan created human, and the whole reason for your existence is because satan wanted to prove a point to god that HIS version of humans were better than god's version, and he (satan) therefore created his version to be, as you said, naturally smarter, faster, better, more beautiful, richer, etc, etc...then do you guys (assuming you are satan-created humans, if you are) look at yourself as being "naturally" better than god created humans?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you do, do you walk around with contempt for god created humans? do you look down upon god created humans?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wondering and curious about all of this.  I think it's actually very fascinating.  Thank you.

       Sounds pretty cool to me.

       Crazy world/planet/universe we live in, because to me, it continues to sound like god is more of a jealous, vindictive, asshole
       <em>
        child
       </em>
       than some "all-knowing, benevolent being".
      </p>
      <p>
       Both tbo (The Benevolent One) and god seem to have
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       human-like qualities - qualities of jealousy, wrath, lust, etc, etc.  They may deal with them MUCH better than their human creations do, but...well, they just seem to be
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       versions of their human creations, but nothing but VERSIONS of them none the less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps humans really
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       made in the "image" of their deities/creators/gods.  Perhaps there really
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       quite a bit of truth in the version of the vengeful, lustful Greek gods that exist in the tales of old, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the difference between deity and human is a difference not in kind, but of
       <em>
        degree

       You are an all powerful being who has always existed and always will. You can do whatever you want.

       The only other thing in the universe is another all powerful being who has always existed and always will. It too can do whatever it wants.

       By Satan's "creation" do you mean he created a living being out of the elements (as in the story of Adam), or was a new sub-species genetically engineered, or was it more like the story of the "Nephilim" or the "Titans": a hybrid race?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, how does any of this (two "kinds" of men) tie in with the almost universal story of the Deluge?

       The only way a demon/angel can physically enter a human is if the human agrees to them entering (normally some sort of bargain) but this goes against the Laws that govern them. If either "God" or "Satan" catches these beings in the act of possession, they can cast them out of the body. Other than that though, the being can still haunt/torment the human, and God/Satan would have no reason to tell them to stop.

       Interesting. What are your thoughts about mind altering drugs and their alleged ability to help people interact with a spiritual/metaphysical world? For instance the Shamanic use of DMT. Does your religion acknowledge the potential importance of the pineal gland in the human brain?

       What role do women play in your religion? Is it significantly different than a man's role?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you and your family follow any specific diets due to your religion? (Avoid certain foods?)
      </p>
      <p>
       You've said your "Satan" gives you what you most desire in life.  The Bible says something similar -Psalm 37:4 - "Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart."  I don't think it's God speaking here, but what's the difference between this and your description of this idea? (See also Psalm 20:4).

      <p>
       Does your religion incorporate music of any kind? What kind? How?

       What would you say is the most historically accurate religious book that is available to the public?

       I know Im asking questions all over the place in this thread, but I am totally fascinated with this, you have no idea. If someone did cross you and you retorted in a "bad" way that kinda takes away from your earlier comment about not hurting anyone, i mean come on now you either do or you dont?

       Yes, Satan will give you riches on this earth, just as Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness, telling him to bow before him and he would give Jesus all the kingdoms of the world.

      <p>
       One thing Satan
       <em>
        can't

       do is give you eternal life, which is what God dolls out to those who follow Him.

       "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.' We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others." Merianna Wiliamson

       "When your dread comes like a storm
       <br/>
       And your calamity comes like a whirlwind,
       <br/>
       When distress and anguish come upon you.
      </p>

       Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;
       <br/>
       They will seek me diligently but they will not find me,
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they hated knowledge
       <br/>
       And did not choose the fear of the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would not accept my counsel,
       <br/>
       They spurned all my reproof.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way
       <br/>
       And be satiated with their own devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the waywardness of the naive will kill them,
       <br/>
       And the complacency of fools will destroy them.

       But he who listens to me shall live securely

       And will be at ease from the dread of evil.”

       Well there are two paths and two paths only. You can serve or reject God, and he will subsequently not give two shits if you succeed or fail in your life endeavors (even if you are atheist in your beliefs, this is still what God's design for man was) or you can worship his adversary and humble yourself and He will grant you whatever your purest desires, so long as you thank him, and promise to use said gifts.

       Finally, a good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been foretold, in nearly every major religion worldwide that there will be a final clash that will ultimately decide the winner for all of eternity. Our religion is no different. We
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       differ, however, in the sense that we acknowledge that the outcome of this cosmic "Armageddon" if you will, is not written in stone, as so many other religions (ESPECIALLY the Judea Christians) like to think. "Satan" is aware He can lose. We as his followers are aware he can lose. "God" is aware that
       <em>
        he too
       </em>
       can lose. His followers, however, are totally blind to this fact.

       No. There is not a whole lot of mystery in our faith. Satan and his "demons" for lack of a better word, are very forthright and honest with man.

       Well of course they are very forthright and honest with you, if they weren't how could they ever win you over?  Look, I'm not saying your choice is wrong fundamentally because we just can't know with these material bodies how extreme an experience the afterlife is, but think about both sides before you so hastily accept his offerings.  If you want to live lavishly in the physical world, you're gonna have to eat shit in the next, and vice versa.  If you eat shit in the here and now you'll have a lavish afterlife.  Just saying.  Who knows, living lavish in the afterlife might suck compared to living lavish here, so going with Satan's plan might be more logical decision, as far as consequences go.  Hmm.

       I just wanted to chime in briefly and point something out, i find your "faith" (if thats what you'd refer to it as) extremely fascinating. However i find that last comment to be somewhat of a contradiction. If Satan and his "demons" as you put it are very forthright and honest with man why all the secrecy and why the oath. That its the farthest thing away from honest you can get besides telling a blatant lie. That would make me skeptical about the religion from the go.

       The secrets serve two distinct purposes:
      </p>
      <p>
       To ensure the safety and continuity of our religion

      <p>
       To keep what amounts to total power out of the wrong hands.

       Thanks for responding and I understand your reply but it is still a contriditcion. Now that I have your attention I would like to ask you another question if i may (although I think i know what response Ill get :-) Does your religion involve hurting other humans for purpose of either ritual or personal gain?

       wow that is very surprising, i guess because as you said its portrayed like that in the mainstream. How is one able to partake in this religion if it is shrouded in secrecy and against the participants oath to speak about it. I didn’t read every comment here but I heard you describe yourself as coming from "old money". Is there anyway to become involved in this religion without being born into it or without knowing another member? I am not asking for steps or anything and if its against your oath to go into detail can you simple answer yes or no.

       How would I find one, is their a certain name given to this relgion. I mean it'd be pretty impossible considering its secret right? I know you said that I can pray to your god anytime I wish, but if my only knowledge of your god is the mainstream model then wont by intensions/visualzations be formed in ill will for lack of a better pharse.

       Satan will give you riches on this earth but he can NOT give you eternal life, only God can do that. Satan deceives men by giving them very, very real power and riches in this life, but sadly Satan can not grant eternal life of the spirit and soul, which is infinitely more value than any power you could ever gain on earth.

       There is absolutely zero truth to the thought that sex is better with some one you love. That's a thought put in your head to keep you monogamous and ultimately churn out children for society

       Well the proof is in the pudding as they say. Ive had sex with men I loved and men i didnt love, it was better with the men i loved because I had value on it and i was comfortable enough to leave my inhibitions at the door and let my freak flag fly high....... But that is one opinion so to say there is zero truth does not hold up the truth is subjected to everyone for some it'll be better and for others it wont.

       Absolutely not. Those idiots you see who throw up horns and draw pentagrams and worship "Lucifer" (a fictional character in

       ) and sacrifice animals, they are just that: idiots.

       What are the purpose of animals? I always feel like the "stories" say man was created for x, y purpose and animals are just there. Why purpose do they have? Entertainment for us?

       Are they part of any plan or just kind of a cosmic throwaway? I've always had a hard time with religion because it values humans (just another mammal) as more important than anything else.

       Before I begin, I do understand there are fundamental differences between rites of your faith as compared to Freemasonry and it's affiliated rites as well as the general contrast in which Christianity and Satanism have, but how does one enter the faith?
Christianity is a 'come-as-you-are' hierarchy, while Freemasonry involves 3 specific rites to become part of 'The Brotherhood of Man'.
I know you've discussed that you are not at liberty to discuss or disseminate information about your faith, but how would a lost soul find it's way to your faith?
To explain, I've never felt comfortable in Churches of any denomination. I've always found solace in the occult because of it's complex and curious nature, which I find at odds with modern Christianity (Especially their ousting, persecution and harassment of agnostics in the past and today's dismissal of anything other than the belief of a man in the sky who wrote rules for living in stone, carved by lightning on top of a volcano cone. Also, Jesus.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My family is very Christian because of their upbringings, but I've always felt different. At a very young age, I could memorize and recite parables from the Christian Bible with little to no effort at a child's age and even 'wowed' a few pastors with my ability to repeat verbatim what I had read and even understood underlying morals derived from the stories. 
That all has faded and was part of my childhood. I could not do the same now if asked, but the memory is there. I feel like I've been here before, reading this and typing the message over again. (Which brings me to another point: I have frequent and vivid 'deja vu')
      </p>
      <p>
       All that aside, is it possible to find a following such as yours?
I know anything and everything is possible. I just want to find a place of faith. 
I'm sure there's more I could say, but I've typed enough already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you in advance for your time.

       Interesting. I have always believed the purpose of life to be self-defined. Is there a particular point they squabble over or is there intelligence so foreign from each other that any point is itself a squabble?

       I do not see how those two concepts are in conflict with each other. They both want us to achieve. So the next question I have is why do they want us to achieve?

       Does your family have any insight in these speculations?  You freely state that he got a hold of one of your books, so I thought maybe you would be open to answer some other questions.

       if we were removed from our bodies, and lived inside of technology which saw wavelengths far beyond human but could not speak, would we still be able to practice true satanism rituals without speaking Akkadian ? Do you need a human body, with human language and human vibrations ?

       By creation of man, you do mean the creation of our known universe, right? We can continue this thread with the understanding of evolution and the big bang etc... I hope you are not bringing this ideology to a creationism other than the first equation for the big bang to roll and evolve. Our languages of 5000 years ago are silly compared to the way our brains actually work. God and Satan should be prepared for us to pass the human body, pass our galaxy, and hopefully pass our time.

       This is going to be really, really hard to explain. I don't blame you if you can't wrap your mind around it. It goes against human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no great beginning, everything that exists, the universe, as you say, as always been, and will always be. Nothing created it. Nothing will end it. God and Satan do not abide by our laws of physics. Time is a man made concept, as is our sense of limits (i.e. galaxies)

       Technology takes what we know from science, and turns it into practical results. 
Science exists beyond flying machines, satanic rituals and the internetz. 
Do you deny all science that doesn't recognize the illusion of time? Where is your 'science line' when it comes to the speed of light, electrons, and binary? 
Are you familiar with sub atomic particle? Are they important to rituals? 
Is Carbon more important than Hydrogen?
      </p>

       -these things are really important for humans to have a better chance at living longer, therefore giving better gambling odds for either God or Satan. They really matter

       I don't buy your Jesus myth either.  John the Baptist maybe existed, but there's absolutely no historical basis for Jesus Christ.   Lets find something about him in contemporary writings.. what is written about Satan or Jesus in the Dead Sea Scrolls for example?  Anything?

       That's consistently deceptive behaviour.   If I was going to post about my deity, I wouldn't try to make it seem credible using a name that isn't even used... you are being confusing.  What name?  How many letters and what does it start with?

       No it's not like that at all.   If the analogy held then the poster would be able to give some similar frame of reference.   Otherwise how do they even know what they are talking about amongst themselves lol.

       The "similar frame of reference" is to use a name that we, people who are unfamiliar with this guy's religion, are familiar with ourselves. The Christian Satan is apparently a distorted depiction of what the "real Satan" actually is. Thus, he says Satan in this submission instead of some obtuse term that a) none of us are familiar with, b) perhaps can't be properly translated into English text, and c) likely violates his beliefs if uttered in all but the most holy of circumstances.

       I have a few questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you or your family ever had personal relationships with beings some would consider Demons?  If so you can give us the names of these beings the you commonly associate with?
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe God and Satan as opposing forces of power.  If this is in fact true isn't all warring between the 2 forces utterly useless seeing as 1 could not exist without the other?  Unless you believe the both God and Satan are really just fragments of a still yet a more powerful being?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you comment on the Elite peoples either of your order or of Gods, and if they really do have the intention of enslaving the masses and ultimately reducing the population?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe that your order works more for peace, or works more for domination and anarchy?

       FYI the thing that you personally call "speculations that must be taken on belief" is actually called and looked upon as "articles of absolute proof" by many of those subscribing to a particular dogma - whether it be a religious dogma or a scientific dogma.

       Oh okay.  I see.  Hell, I was just assuming that "Abbas" was some user you were referring to and I was just too lazy to even look up if it was a real user or not.  I just assumed it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, when you asked "what kind of a question is a stupid question", it seems you were referring to a version of what I wrote that I INITIALLY wrote and that I actually ended up deleting a few moments after I wrote it.  In other words, I got rid of the statement because after re-reading it, I realized that it was a little bit too harsh.  I wouldn't necessarily say that it was a "stupid" question.  Plus, I didn't want to outright come across as directly antagonistic because that's not necessarily what I meant or how I feel (i.e. antagonistic toward you, etc).  That's why I ended up deleting what I typed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I even typed that in the first place (although I, again, am saying that it was harsher than I really felt it) was because, as I subsequently explained (and
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       delete), there are many things that are called "speculations that must be taken on belief" that are actually looked upon as "articles of absolute proof".  In other words, I was pointing out that the "speculation" that you assume is exclusively relegated to religion is actually something that exists just as much in the scientific dogma that the majority of the world (and most definitely Reddit) ends up taking as gospel fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is often just as dogmatic in its own ways as religion.  Of course it's not SUPPOSED to be, but it often is.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all.

       Are there repricussions to speaking with a demon? To me, this would validate the afterlife and probably push me away from agnosticism and toward religion. Would I be denied eternal salvation by speaking to a demon?

       I ask because, Christianity is faith based and if I conjure (for lack of a better word) a demon, that would also prove the existence of God. No need for faith. So, is this a way of circumventing the whole faith ideal, or will god turn his back on me for seeking out Satan? I understand you may not be the best person to tell me how God reacts to these situations, but if you aren't sure, what is your opinion? Thank you for your time, and Btw. Very interesting.

       If you understand the likely truth of the existence of personal identity independent of the this limited dimension, then you are not agnostic.  You are also, btw, not a "believer" either.  You are someone who, again, understands (logically and rationally -
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       through blind "faith") the existence of personal identity independent of this limited dimension.  No need to stick belief of faith or even religion into any of this.  It's really all logic and rationality.  That alone can guide you to the truth of what exists beyond this dimension and this life.

       It used to be split right down the middle. We had a holy land, the place you call Atlantis. The society thrived in sciences, military specialties, and other tricks of trade to the point where they were about to become completely world dominate. God refused to accept defeat at the hands of Satan and sent his angelic army to wipe them out. For all their might, the people of our "holy land" were still mortal. It is the first known act of violence against men by immortal beings. They stood no chance. Some fled and survived, but Satan basically had to start over. He recreated man, but divided them up between portions of the already existing population. The exact percentage today is unknown. Your family could be of "Satanic" origin and you may not even know it.

       Your creator doesn't have a name or counterpart that humans would recognize other than Satan?  Sounds fishy.

       isn't it possible that somebody independently discovers some of your 'secret' methods, rituals or whatever, and provides them to whoever wants them?   wouldn't that pose a risk?

       Well, I am not familiar with those verses (I assume they come from your books or ceremonies?) but it sounds like a description of an American leader. The eagle is the bird. Red is the color of blood. White and blue are both color symbols representing purity or innocence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose the verse you quote is part of a larger prophecy. But you have to admit that there could be various ways of interpreting what that short sentence actually means.
      </p>
      <p>
       To contrast with the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, there were specifics given regarding the place of his birth, and there are even extra-Biblical ancient accounts of the journey of the "Magi" from Persia (Iran). They knew to look for specific signs in the skies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do your prophecies get anywhere near as specific?

       I'm looking into it. The Roman Catholics did a pretty good job of erasing us from the history books.

       In the last century, were any major Christian evangelical figures either a member of or "friends of" your religion? (i.e. well-known writers, musicians, or even...evangelists)
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you've alluded to the fact that (publicly) your people are thought to be Catholics, I am wondering if the same holds true in the world of evangelical Christianity.

       Leveyan Satanism is basically atheism on steroids.
      </p>
      <p>
       In what you would call "real Satanism" we actually worship the deity who goes against the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

       throwaway here, I'm sure you of all people understand the importance of anonymity.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, thank you very much for taking the time to answer all these questions. (I saw you will even be watching a 1 hr video, quite gracious of you.) Two parts here, thank you for your time good sir.
      </p>
      <p>
       general questions observations of what I've read. (I've been following developments) Names are abbreviated because I know better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ywh's people are just supposed to 'eventually' surpass Sml's, seems rather open ended. (according to Ywh, within his context) Obviously Sml's people have the upperhand in the short race. (Can't win the 50 yard dash with a 50 yard handicap). Is there a time frame/context this is supposed to happen within?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since both have always been. It follows both shall always be. That which is not created can never be destroyed. It seems this final battle isn't very final, if it cannot result in the dissolution of either. So what is the culmination of all this? Just "ha showed you!"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this is some sort of "who's people are better and will flourish the most" bet, isn't this just a let the game play out kind of thing, wherein each just get's "points" until some winner is determined at which point xyz happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Ywh and Sml are eternal beings and it's in their nature to initiate 
these sort of "bets" this probably happens a lot on the cosmic scale of things doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       how are they subject to cosmic law if they are the all powerful (co?)creators of the universe? Is it some sort of one's power limits the other so it works out that they can't directly harm each other.  Or is this somehow actually built into reality beyond their control?
      </p>
      <p>
       At one point were they not at each others' throats?
      </p>
      <pre><code> "who will be happier in the end: the person who has to work to achieve something and be proud of it or the person who is given everything he needs and see how far they can get before time runs out?"
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Don't you still have to work to achieve things? I mean video games stop being fun when you're in god mode, you just run around winning... kind of sucks. Like you said, physical fitness is part of your religion/encouraged, obviously you're working for that, its not just "I want big muscles" and then "POOF" magic and shit. So I assume it's more of a arguement over balance, that is how to balance how much one must work for it, vs how low hanging the fruit should be, since obviously all the fruit is meant to be within reach. Am I on the right track?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the door open for beings with equal power/status as Sml and Ywh to exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you answering these questions as part of your religion or are you just bored?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I ask more generals as I think of them? Will you keep this account open for long?
long shot questions. I'm not sure you're the right person for these; hard to explain:
      </p>
      <p>
       what is the 'void'?
      </p>
      <p>
       what is beyound the void?
      </p>
      <p>
       who is hil-el hi-el? how/why do I know this name?
      </p>
      <p>
       who/what is the "third"?
      </p>
      <p>
       if you can answer these, I have A LOT of questions for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, thank you for your time.

       Pretty much. Their nature is just to try and one up the other. Honestly it would seem to me like when it finally does end, they'll just start again.

       It's just the fact that they always are and have always been, and neither can do anything to change that. That's what I mean by "cosmic law"

       I used this analogy earlier: You are an all powerful being that always has been and always will be. The only other being in the universe is also all powerful and always has been and always will be.

      <p>
       Naturally, the only thing your going to do is try to one up the other one. Forever. And vice versa.

       Yes, but we are given the tools to succeed. We still have the choice though, to succeed or fail. Our God commands us to succeed, and we will be punished in the next life if we do not.

       Preface: I would consider myself a "God is love" Christian. I am not at all off put by your responses and they are extremely interesting. The most intriguing part is that you seem to know most aspects of Christianity while little to no Christians know anything other than what they were taught about yours. Overall A+ thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       To my questions, You said in your religion people are told not to kill, what is the recourse of disobeying this in the afterlife?
  Where would Hitler be now after abusing your power?  As Christians we have the commandments, is there a satanist equivalent?  How relative do you find the christian bible to your religion, and are parts of it used in your bible?  Also, elaborate on Jesus was a bad ass would you lol  Thanks, You seem like a nice guy and I've enjoyed this thread a lot, good brain food.

       Thanks for the answers. I feel like I have learned something after reading this thread and I greatly appreciate your time. I think the most ignorant thing a person can do is refuse to open their ears and listen. 
One last question, I know what people often learn in younger years of schooling and is preached throughout most of your lifetime is "The golden rule" (do unto others and you would have them do unto you),     After reading this thread I get the feeling that may be a similar piece between our two beliefs, If so, Do you believe "Kindness" is simply a form of universal truth?

       It definitely plays a part but our first and most important "commandment" is to live a successful life and not squander what we are given.

       I lied, I was riding the bus home from work and wrote down a few more questions I have. Hahahaha sorry to suck up all your time, but all of this is filling in some things I didn't totally understand before. * Do you believe the existence of aliens coincides with either religion?

       This is the biggest misconception about any religion ever. The morality of religions serve to make them more appealing to the population. "God" and "Satan" really don't give  shit how nice of a person you are. If you do not help them win their side of the argument, you will be punished, one way or another.

       My brother, as astute and aware as you certainly seem to be on some levels, you absolutely then have to
       <em>
        HAVE
       </em>
       to know that our respective gods/creators are only such (i.e. rulers/gods) as it pertains to OUR specific solar system and possibly not too much further than that.  It is true that they are unimaginably more powerful than we currently are, but I wouldn't imagine they run or are in charge of much more than our own, limited system of nine or so planets (eight by some counts), and - given how fickle they really DO seem to be - I can almost absolutely GUARANTEE that they are absolutely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the ones in charge of our galaxy in general...to say absolutely
       <em>
        NOTHING
       </em>
       about
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">
        all the other billions of galaxies (each of which comprising billions of other stars and solar systems and
        <em>
         trillions
        </em>
        of other planets) in our cosmos
       </a>
       .  They CERTAINLY don't run all
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We are play-thing-puppet-minions of two presently feuding, incorrigible, interstellar deities that are currently in charge of the creation of this planet and possibly a few other surrounding planets and the beings on those planets.  They must certainly be honored and respected as such - for they are certainly that much more powerful than we, their creations - but we must also understand that they too are a part of a far greater organization of existence still.

       This is a beautiful, wonderful, enlightening post, however, and I am glad you have taken as much time as you have and given so much of your knowledge in answering all of the questions posed to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I may ask, was your making this post your own personal idea?  In other words, does your father know about your doing this?  Are you doing this with his approval?  I imagine since there is a lot of information that you CAN'T divulge about your group, there are certain members of it that are monitoring this post no? to make sure you "stay on course".  Is that correct?  Is there any level of "checks and balances" if you will regarding your activities on here (members of your group monitoring, you having to answer to them, etc) or do the members of your group trust you enough to simply let you come on here and do what you want to do, say what you want to say, and they know that you wouldn't invalidate any of your oaths?

       God and Satan are everywhere. Both however are incredibly stubborn and set in their ways. The ritual stems back to man's original creation, and that is really all I can get into without breaking my oath.

       I meant could you explain why/how rituals work - in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, does a spirit hear someone starting a ritual and then stop whatever they're doing and think: "oh good - they're trying to call me! if they do everything just right, i'll appear to them."
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is there a "Law of the Universe" that contrains them to do what they are told? "oh man, not this guy again. But since I'm obligated to obey this certain ritual..."

       List ye, O man, to he who comes to you. But weigh in the balance if his words be of Light. For many there are who walk in Dark Brightness and yet are not the children of Light. Easy it is to follow their pathway, easy to follow the path that they lead. But yes, O man, heed ye my warning: Light comes only to him who strives. Hard is the pathway that leads to the Wisdom, hard is the pathway that leads to the Light. Many shall ye find, the stones in your pathway; many the mountains to climb toward the Light. Yet know ye, O man, to him that o’ercometh, free will he be of the pathway of Light. Follow ye not the Dark Brothers ever. Always be ye a child of the Light. For know ye, O man, in the end Light must conquer and darkness and night be banished from Light.

       Wow. Enlightening thank you. Can you not speak of Astral Projection or OBE's or whatever different name you have for this? You have hinted that some form of Conscious projection or alteration plays a role in nearly all of your rituals. Do you have intentional out-of-body experiences and do they play a role in obtaining the 'tools' for success? My last question concerns Hobbes 'Levathian'. It sounds like this (counter-punch) is headed right for the pineal gland of human civilization. Is the ultimate goal of his or her rise to power to create a society in which all can follow your commandments and thrive, thus proving the point of your God? And does your religion foresee a violent change of power or a peaceful transition into your version of utopia? Thank you again for all your time.

       I would like to see an answer to this (great) question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like my connection with 'god' is through meditation and astral projection. I'd hate for what I consider my progress in such to be abolished or taken away from me.. that would not be cool at all.

      <p>
       Alternately if there is an opposite side of the realms I perceive to have frequented I would certainly not turn down a chance to check it out.

       This is a fun thread to read/participate in. I didn't get all my questions answered, presumably due to the breaking of oaths. But thanks for answering what you could! (Since you've gotten a lot of questions and PMs, I understand the difficulty in answering everyone.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In spite of how much I enjoyed reading your responses, I have come to the conclusion that either of the two following possibilities are true:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         You are a
         <strong>
          well-read
         </strong>
         , dedicated, and skilled troll,
         <strong>
          or
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You
         <em>
          are
         </em>
         indeed what you claim to be.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Either way, you have presented
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       inaccurate information along with some truths that aren't learned "casually". If you're a troll, it's because you're repeating some talmudic fables, New Age teachings, and some popular beliefs of the "truth" movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But
       </strong>
       , if you're actually a member of an elite family as you claim, the reason you've spread some of the inaccuracies can only be due to an agenda - or because you are yourself deceived about some things of vital importance. I don't pretend to be able to judge your goodness, badness, or what your agenda really is - I'm only outlining the
       <em>
        possibilities
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the case may be, I have some kind advice for you and for everyone else: don't think too highly of yourself, try to be at peace with everyone, and choose
       <strong>
        wisely
       </strong>
       the path you take in this life. Because eternity
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       <strong>
        real
       </strong>
       ; this life is fleeting.

       Look at what the Bible says about him and you will end up with a whole list of characteristics. Based on the Biblical description it couldn't be Arnold. Remember, he is an imitator of Jesus Christ in many ways. Based on that, I have a suspicion that he will begin his "ministry" - or his entry into the public eye - at the age of 30. (That is just one thing I would look for, not that I claim to be an authority on identifying the antichrist.)

       The short of it can be summed up like so:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Satan" is an all powerful being with the power to create who believed the best approach with man was to provide him with every single tool he needed for success and watch him fly.
      </p>
      <p>
       God is an all powerful being with the power to create who believed that the best approach with man was to provide him with curiosity to discover things for themselves and over time progress, and subsequently either succeed or fail trying.

       Life is not fair. The sooner you accept that, the happier you will be. I have already stated that there were two creators of man. Our God's version of man enters life on a higher playing field than the one who enters life via His adversary.

       I can't even accept your 'creator of man' myth.

      <p>
       God is the universe, the eternal.  Everything.  By definition it contains your (deceptive) Satan, or whatever you would call it.   The only way I can accept that man was 'created' in the sense that the entire universe was set in motion in a primeval cause.

       Let me rephrase this: The men "God" created are inherently flawed because they have to seek out what it is that they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The men "Satan" created do not share this flaw. It is pretty easy to distinguish whether a man is originally of "God" or "Satan".

       On the whole, Satan creates the most beautiful of men. They are naturally talented, internally driven, and incredibly likable.

      <p>
       A man God creates can achieve these things, but he has to do just that: achieve them, whereas a man created by Satan will have always had them.

       I am a man. I am naturally talented at almost everything I do. When I put my mind to something there is NO stopping me. No one ever interrupts me (incredibly likable). I can walk into a room and make anyone laugh or smile. Women are always telling me I am one of the most beautiful and gorgeous men they have seen, breath taking even, rendering them unable to speak.
      </p>

       I am not saying this with a sense of elitist pride, I am just stating fact. I am not ashamed of who I am, and I wear it proudly. This quote comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       "it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us
      </p>
      <p>
       Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,
talented and fabulous?
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, who are you not to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a child of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your playing small does not serve the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other
      </p>
      <p>
       people won't feel insecure around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were born to make manifest the glory of
God that is within us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as we let our own light shine,
we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we are liberated from our own fear,
Our presence automatically liberates others."

       Is it possible for you to re-write that with a consistent pronoun? You begin by referring to yourself, then you use the pronoun "you" meaning me, I assume, then begin referring to a "we". It is very difficult to try and dig through this grammar and come out with anything I can respond to. If I can understand where you're coming from, I'd love a healthy discussion.

       It's not from what I think, but what people have told me face to face. One night me and a whole bunch of friends got together and we decided to play a game. We sat in a circle and we decided we were going to tell each person the one thing we hated about them. Every single person had something to say about someone else. When everyone got to me, they paused and said "I can't think of anything I don't like about you." One person even said "Yeah, you're like perfect."
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously I am not perfect and I have flaws, but I'm not just pulling this crap out of my butt because of pride. I genuinely put others before myself as much as I can, always be nice, etc.. THAT is why I say I am incredibly likable, because I have been told so and because I've never not been able to make friends. And honestly, I know I'm likable, and that gives me the confidence to make conversation with people, hold their eye contact, and make them feel like the center of my attention.

       As I have said before, you can choose to serve whoever you wish, but if you are telling the truth, it is likely your bloodline can be traced all the way back to Canaan and the men Satan created.

       There is a picture of me on acid, which I never liked because I felt incredibly evil looking, and a satanist I know commented and said "You look like Satan." But that is only when I am under the influence of drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, did Satan sleep with Even to create that bloodline? And if so, would it not have been wiped out at the great flood where only Noah and his family survived?

       You are scum because your object of worship represents arrogance, greed, licentiousness and conflict. Were this not the case you would not need a 'blood oath' of secrecy. What are the 'moral principles' of your church? Or are those held secret too?

       We don't even call it "Satanism" I'm calling it that here so you can understand.

       The idiots you see who claim to be "Satanic" and draw pentagrams and glorify death and worship goats are just that... idiots.

       Our moral values are not unlike the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faiths. We are forbidden to kill. We are forbidden to physically harm, unless it is for our own self preservation. We are encouraged to treat all human life, regardless of color, age, sex, or orientation with equal value.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say our morals are better than most religions out there.

       Assuming you are for real, why the veil of secrecy? What do you have to hide? I ask this a as an Agnostic mind you. I find religion unconvincing in it's efforts at explaining the grand scheme of things but I  am also a believer in the principles espoused by people like Jesus, Buddha and so on.

       I don't know anything about satanism. But am I wondering what is satan? I know that's a silly question, but isn't he said to have been one of gods angels that refused to serve man and so he was cast from heaven. I haven't read the bible.. So I don't know what the story is. In this why would satan reward humans that devote to him. 
Or is that story not real, then is satan just a being of some sort as god is?

       That story is

       So from this I assume then that god didn't create satan. So who created the universe and earth? Billions and billions of planets and stars in the universe just for life

       This is going to be really, really difficult to explain, because as human beings we can not wrap our minds around it.

       There was no beginning. Everything that is here, it has always been here, and it will always be here.

       I'm so glad you answered this. Your response fits so perfect to a theory of time I have been reading about. 
It's extremely complicated but says even now, what I am saying and doing I have always been doing and always will be. I was born, am being born forever. Every moment is happening, did happen, and will always happen. Really confusing. Anyways I probably explained that wrong, but they said that the brain puts everything in a linear fashion to comprehend time when really that's not how events have occurred.
Thanks again. This thread has put a new perspective for me about what satanism means.

       This is completely wrong.  Lucifer is a spirit you can commune with today.  He is on his way to Earth and will arrive in the relatively near future.  He is not aligned with either Satan or Yahweh, and his followers are free to worship either of them.  Lucifer is not good nor evil;  Lucifer is power.  Many of Yahweh's followers who are involved in the earth-realm spiritual war also pray to Lucifer and battle Satanists.  ("Battle" being a bit of a stretch -- the awake followers who commune via their numbered foreheads (sometimes called 'the net') aren't allowed to kill each other.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I signed off from the numbering system, so I'm allowed to kill you, and you me.  FYI.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect your indoctrination wants to hide the true nature of Lucifer from you.  By portraying Lucifer as dead, you won't commune with him.  In this way, you won't discover that Lucifer has no special affinity for Satan.  In fact, Lucifer prefers Yahweh.

       What I meant by "and you me" is that although I have been part of the groups which do not kill and are not to be killed, I not longer am.  If you are, then, no, you aren't allowed to kill me due to your own allegiance, not due to mine.

       Yes some one pointed it out earlier today. It appears to me some one did some research and did discover some of our beliefs and teachings (hopefully no rituals) but where he failed to find information, he guessed and missed

       Is America's foreign policy dictated by the beliefs you and your family share? For example, was the US engaged in war in Afghanistan and the Middle East because of ulterior motives related to your belief's or other occult teachings?

       This confuses me. The influence of the Israeli lobby in the US political system is well known, so if anything it would seem that the US is a pawn to Israeli rather then to the Vatican. There is certainly more evidence to show that. What are your views and of your religions views on Israel though?

       Well, I wasn't necessarily
       <em>
        exclusively
       </em>
       referring to only the physical, third dimensional aspect of existence on this or any other planet.  A being can originate from this planet and exist upon it but still not be of the same dimension that you or I are on.  There are many, many beings existing in and around this planet and other planets that are simply vibrating on different frequencies (than we are) and, as such, we are for the most part, not aware of them at all and never see them, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The beings responsible for and presiding over your family and other families not truly being physical and third dimensional does not necessarily mean that they still can't originate from
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       particular planet none the less.  They can, in theory, originate from a different
       <em>
        dimension
       </em>
       of this planetary area still.  That would still, technically, make them FROM this planet - albeit from a
       <em>
        different dimension
       </em>
       of this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even though your god (and other "gods") exists outside of the law of physics, can the general "jurisdiction" of their "range of travel" (for lack of a better way of describing it) be said to reside more on (and from) THIS particular planet? or do they generally "reside" in another planetary area?
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, what spacial temporal area - whether it be a 3d, 4th, or 5th dimension (or above) - do they manifest in? this planet? another?

       What is an estimate of people following your own religion? Since you mention six families, are there only around let's say100 people practicing it? 
In the same spirit, can people outside the families join? 
In case you are able to provide more info on this, then please PM me, I have the same curiosity as the two other users have expressed in this thread.

       Excellent question. Not very many, although there are a few. Most of us are seen in public as Roman Catholic. The church would never think to hunt for us among its own.

       I'm sorry I'm taking your time to ask you again. I have three more quick questions for you, as your comments here have made me really curious and I started researching a lot about ancient religions, including the Akkadian, Sumerian, Egyptian and Canaanite.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Can the God of Abrahamic religions be also called "El"? Do you call him that in your religion?
Is there a connection between him and the Elohim? Are they what we conceive his "Angels"?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Also, I get that the Elohim's adversaries are the Nephelim, however, I can't find a reference to their creator, since they are either believed to be fallen "Angels" or the sons of Angels and men, eitherway created by the Abrahamic God. Are the Nephelim your God's "Angels"?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         And finally, you have avoided naming Satan with a name other than the common one that Christianity gives. What is the closest version of the name you refer to him in your religion, as for example Yahweh for God, other than "Benevolent One" "Him" and so on?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Please consider the last part of my previous comment.
Thanks for taking the time to reply to me, and for this really interesting AMA.

       Ah, I see.. that was my "insight' to it as well.. mainly due to Nebuchadnezzar being referred to as "The Shining One" or "The Son of the Morning" and Lucifer translating to "Light Bearer", if there was a connection between the two through that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must say, your comments are quite intriguing.. And I suppose I have one more question.. I've read that you believe that Angels and Demons are of the same species, and they are usually the ones behind 'ghosts' and 'hauntings.'
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose my next question would be, why would they involve themselves in the lives of men? Do they act as 'guides' or 'hints' in a way that could lead a person to believing in either God or Satan? Would their characteristic actions be of something that sways a mans opinion and belief? Do they have free will?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any room in your beliefs of those who are.. more sensitive to perceiving the spiritual world? Are certain individuals of more interest to the spirits than others?
      </p>
      <p>
       My apologies if my questions cross into an area that may violate your oath, but again, I am quite curious.

       No no your fine here. Angels and Demons are fucking shit heads. They are bound to serve either God or Satan at any given moment but their allegiance can change without warning.
      </p>
      <p>
       They like messing with man but unless directly ordered to by God or Satan are not allowed to physically harm man.
      </p>
      <p>
       They always saw themselves as second favorites to man and for this both of them hate our being.

       Satan's version of Man seems to be superior in many ways, what is it about God's version of Man that He believes to be superior to Satan's? Is it a spiritual advantage? Do God's humans have souls and Satan's do not? There must be something that God sees as a huge advantage over such an incredible specimen that Satan has created.

       I can not claim to even begin to understand either of the beings, both have souls (or so we're told) but basically it boils down to what's better in the long run and who will be happier in the end: the person who has to work to achieve something and be proud of it or the person who is given everything he needs and see how far they can get before time runs out?

       Outside of metaphysical ritual, which is a Family secret, it sounds as simple as being thankful for your positive mental and physical attributes, and using them to excell to your maximum potential, all the while remembering that it was 'Him' who gave you these things, and that you exist to prove a point, and following the six commandments. Did I miss anything or is it really that simple?

       I hope somebody figures this out.  I think somebody is going to have to get a lucky guess, though.  Knowing that he's a good looking man from the U.S. seems like not very much to go on. Lol.

       Is it Arnold Swarchenegger? I asked this in a different part of the thread but because I didn't reply to you directly I thought it may get lost. My reasoning for thinking it might be him is because Hitler is also Austrian.

       It sounds almost like God and Satan are either brothers in a sort of sibling rivalry dynamic or possibly buddies from way back who made a bet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The all seeing eye is our eyes or rather eye. A "camera at eye level" implanted in each of us by advanced technology (non human). I completely agree with the OP all this is to prove a point (win a bet). Time is non linear and easy to manipulate for our creators which they do often. I suspect we are a source of entertainment more than anything for them. The parasitic extra dimensional beings that feed on fear (although I think our fear is more like a drug to them rather than a necessity for them to survive). They get high on it and are addicted to it and like any junky they want to be and stay high hence the agreement with our ruling class in which they receive advanced technology in exchange for human sacrifices which the governments provide on the regular. Hence the millions of missing persons that occur each year. In the end though none of this even matters because in the GodMind it's already happened and been resolved, with our limited perspective we just aren't aware of that. Infinite dimensions co-exist in which we all play roles, this is just one of them. Am I sort of on the right track here?

       I have difficulty believing that you would not have any ideas or information on something that I think would be crucial information about the "the leader of the free world" (she wrote sarcastically). It looks like his head was take apart and reassembled for Christ sake (couldn't resist). That seems like info that would be pertinent to you running the show. Yeah?

       Ok, vatican, got it. I'll rephrase the question. Based on your station and being privy to information about esoteric knowledge that is not part of the "everyday" kind of people, is there some kind of ritual or unknown science that his handlers do or would do to some one in his position. Like implanting stuff in his brain or is he likely a clone or some other type of bio-robot? If you had to guess, knowing the things you do, what do you suspect might have been done to him? Thank you.

       With the beast, the anti-christ, or whatever as spoken about in Revelation. The beast will be given power of the saints to kill them. Satan will rule the entire world for a time at the head of a one world government.

       But then Jesus is coming back one last time and is going to destroy all those who follow the beast. Not much of a counter punch, lol.

       You have said this a few times now; could you (or anyone else, for that matter) explain how Jesus' death on the cross provided a tactical advantage of any kind in the "cosmic battle" that is underway ?  The Universal's have claimed this for centuries but it doesn't make any sense that this is somehow a "victory", unless he was actually
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       side's agent, and killing him off got him to shut up.

       Before Jesus the Nazarene walked the earth, the scales were pretty much balanced between who was worshiping God and who was worshiping Satan. God had to re brand himself, if you will, to avoid falling behind. So he sent a part of himself which became embodied and took on a personality of its own in Jesus. After completely changing his message to caring about others and then sacrificing himself, the scales tipped way in favor of God. It was a massive blow to us. But our equivalent is coming, and hopefully will erase the deficit left by Jesus the Nazarene.

       So, when the scriptures say things such as Jesus sits at the right hand of God, or that he is the fulness of the godhead bodily, or that he is the express image of the Almighty God...you actually agree with/believe those things also?

       Yes. The Old Testament and the four Gospels right up until the death of Jesus is shared in our teachings and even further elaborated on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not believe, however, that Jesus the Nazarene rose from the dead after being crucified.

       So what happened to Jesus after he was crucified?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - just throwing another question in this comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your take on
       <a href="http://en.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/17he44/another_training_exercise_this_time_in_houston/">
        this?
       </a>
       Do you think the coming of the anti-christ will cause civil unrest and massive uprising, hence all the domestic training? 
Also, in your opinion, will there be a second coming of christ? Could the anti-christ disguise themselves as christ?
      </p>
      <p>
       So many questions.

       That's the thing pal. We don't practice fucking witch craft and do human or animal sacrifices or draw pentagrams or worship a goat looking fucker. What you have been taught is Satanism could not be further from the truth.

       Their is One Creator. His name is truth.  Satan was created and is an aspect of "God":  One of gods many slaves, perhaps his greatest slave. Satan exists as per His unknowable will. To deceive and lead souls astray. And in turn you are the slave of the greatest slave.

       Positive. We don't call ourselves Satanists though. Lucifer was human being who has been glorified postmortem to represent the Christian idea of "Satan" in a work of fiction called
       <em>
        Paradise Lost

       So what do you call yourselves?  By the way, it was your title which advised me that I should call you a Satanist, so your objection seems a little strange, even defensive.

       I understand this is how you have been trained.  What I am saying is that you are wrong, and as a matter of fact I have never read
       <em>
        Paradise Lost
       </em>
       , nor any of the related fictional accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you can only fall back on "Waaah,
       <em>
        Paradise Lost
       </em>
       " indicates very strongly that you don't have any evidence to support your claim that Lucifer is Satan.  Providing
       <em>
        ad hominem
       </em>
       "negative evidence" which is completely false (again, I have never read
       <em>
        Paradise Lost
       </em>
       and I am not familiar with even a summary of it), is another strong indication that you have no real information to back up your view.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the brain-washing your parents gave you.  Congratulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you can commune with Lucifer today if you like.  That's because he's not a dead Babylonian king.

       Satan is not a fallen angel. You are thinking of the character "Lucifer" in Milton's

       It is not a fundamental flaw if the Holy Scripture I follow calls Lucifer, who is Satan, an angel who was cast out of Heaven. Nothing is
       <em>
        flawed

       Revelation 12: 7-12 - "And war broke out in heaven: Mi′chael and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled 8 but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. 9 So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him. 10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven say:
“Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God! 11 And they conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their witnessing, and they did not love their souls even in the face of death. 12 On this account be glad, YOU heavens and YOU who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to YOU, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time."
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah 14:12-15 - How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! [how] art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite obvious, at least in the Word of God, that Satan and Lucifer are the same being, just called different things at times.

       We don't even call it "Satanism" I'm calling it that here so you can understand.

       The idiots you see who claim to be "Satanic" and draw pentagrams and glorify death and worship goats are just that... idiots.

       Our moral values are not unlike the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faiths. We are forbidden to kill. We are forbidden to physically harm, unless it is for our own self preservation. We are encouraged to treat all human life, regardless of color, age, sex, or orientation with equal value.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say our morals are better than most religions out there.

       Damn good question. The Pope is not lying when he says he speaks for God. There is truth in what he has to say.

      <p>
       Other than that... not really. Most of the high profile one's still think our God's name is Lucifer, and then I write them off completely.

       Our prophecy makes it pretty clear that our equivalent to Jesus the Nazarene will be an American leader. I can say with 100% certainty that the prophecy is correct.

       A huge risk. If it ever came to that, well, I'm not really sure what would have to be done. I'm sure my father and the other families have some sort of plan for it, but I don't know of it yet.

       So what happened to Jesus after he was crucified?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - just throwing another question in this comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your take on
       <a href="http://en.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/17he44/another_training_exercise_this_time_in_houston/">
        this?
       </a>
       Do you think the coming of the anti-christ will cause civil unrest and massive uprising, hence all the domestic training? 
Also, in your opinion, will there be a second coming of christ? Could the anti-christ disguise themselves as christ?
      </p>
      <p>
       So many questions.

       Ok, vatican, got it. I'll rephrase the question. Based on your station and being privy to information about esoteric knowledge that is not part of the "everyday" kind of people, is there some kind of ritual or unknown science that his handlers do or would do to some one in his position. Like implanting stuff in his brain or is he likely a clone or some other type of bio-robot? If you had to guess, knowing the things you do, what do you suspect might have been done to him? Thank you.
