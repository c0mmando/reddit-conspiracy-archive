       I would argue money is the root of all the other conspiracies. who prints the money, who distributes it, and who collects the interest paid on debt &amp; loans? these are the people who have major control over most of the systems we discuss in this subreddit. military, political figures/lobbyists, big business, everything is affected by the flow of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad that people don't realize the economy is gamed and basically 100% fraudulent. And that is a conspiracy which can be quickly proved(a very few families own the creation &amp; distribution of money worldwide). The Federal Reserve is NOT a federal entity of our government, but a privately owned business. Who owns the business? Who earns profit on their interest rates?
      </p>
      <p>
       People who honestly believe the economy is a free-for-all capitalist "anybody can get rich just work hard enough" system needs to do a lot more research.

       This. Things like 9/11 are just symptoms of this ridiculous monetary system that we live in. The biggest issue we all face, isn't even a conspiracy per se, it's the social model by which we currently operate. You change the way people see the world, and open their eyes to the possibilities of different, better ways of doing things, then the rest of the problems solve themselves fairly quickly.

       Is it just the economy? I think at least every war in the twentieth century as well as the ones that continue today, are planned games to keep us entertained with the idea that there is a bad guy out there trying to Hirt us. Because if we fear a large foreign entity, who is there to protect us but our country itself which then puts the same government that has it in for us, at the role of protector, guardian whatever.

       Yet it is the Central Banking system that both enables and then profits massively off of these conflicts- both off of the debt incurred and their myriad positions in the MIC. It is no coincidence that a century of war came immediately following the inception of the "Federal" Reserve..
      </p>
      <p>
       Think things would be the same if we actually had to pay for these wars up front in the form of taxes? I look at Central Banking as the mother of all conspiracies, the rest are sub-conspiracies, if you will- including your reference to the politics of fear.

       The financial monopoly is obviously the second most important conspiracy but the most important one is what created this condition in the first place.  The ability to accumulate vast wealth and power is but a symptom of a profound
       <strong>
        CULTURAL difference
       </strong>
       between the elite and the rest of us; a cultural divide so staggeringly huge I won't even attempt to describe it because few would believe what I say.  The movies They Live and Zardoz dwell on this theme and although they don't depict elitist culture quite accurately they deserve credit for illustrating the subject.

       I'm a first generation immigrant, a college dropout, a business owner and a self-made millionaire. I can tell you that anybody (who actually puts in more time and effort into trying to make it than he/she does into worrying and complaining about how unfair the system is) can get rich "just work hard enough."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true that not everyone is destined to become a billionaire. But being able to provide for a good life for oneself and his/her family is definitely within reach of pretty much everyone living in the western economy. It's just most people would rather complain than take personal responsibility for their own well being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who cares if there are wealthy families that "own" money? How exacly does that prevent you from achieving success at least to a point of being able to provide yourself and your family with a comfortable life style?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think if the world was set up in a fair (according to god knows who) way, then everybody would be rich?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that money is involved in a lot (maybe all) conspiracies. But how do you get from that thesis to what you outlined in your last sentence?

       because they charge interest on the money. so if we paid back every single dollar in circulation, there would still be debt left to pay. it is literally impossible to pay back all the money, plus interest, because there's not enough money to do that. there is more debt in the world than there is money. that is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does this specifically stop me or somebody interested in their own business from earning money? a comfortable living? it really doesn't. but the current economic climate does LIMIT small businesses because there are no investments being made. there are no loans being given by banks, because they just don't have the money to give out. People also don't have much spare money so they are purchasing far less than in previous years. This deteriorating economic climate is a direct cause of the elite banking families.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just want to hoard all their money in offshore bank accounts and quietly collect interest. they don't want to spend it or loan it out, or invest it or have it circulating at all. this is another big problem and it's why I care that the wealthy families print &amp; control the money. they have ultimate say of how much they want to hoard away from the public's eye. they can do a lot of shady shit and cook the books to make it seem legit. For proof just look at the recent LIBOR scandal which has still yet to explode....
      </p>
      <p>
       This also takes money out of common services where revenue can be generated. Think advertising, sales, distribution, services like restaurants or car repair garages. The average small business suffers because they just do not turn enough profit to stay afloat and because there just isnt any money out there, it's getting worse. Now one final comment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       No I do not believe that. But not everybody wants to be rich, some people just want to earn a decent living. However a lot of people do want to be rich and the game is NOT fair for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you answer this - why is our government bailing out institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan which are literally bleeding money? they are nothing but casinos running on the stock market and cashing in off derivatives based on big business, not based in real human needs. people trade corn for money, not to help corn farmers or lower corn prices for consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why in the fuck does BoA or Goldman Sachs deserve bailouts from the government? Why not bail out small business owners? Clearly they provide a lot more benefit to society as a whole. I'll answer this for you - because the banks pay the politicians and they pay the lobbyists. the bankers control the money and by design also control anything else they choose. It's a disguising system and the fact you would defend it just because your story is a successful one, is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       For every "success" story like yours there are literally thousands or possibly millions of failures. People who have run successful businesses for decades have been closing their doors at an unbelievable rate these past 4 years. Why? Because there is no money out there, because the wealthy elites are hoarding their share. And whatever's left is being devalued as they print more money every single month (Quantitative Easing 3). This is how I draw conclusions from "rich people own the money" to "they are using this ownership to game the system and it's rigged against the average business owner".
      </p>
      <p>
       However you are free to your own opinion, and I appreciate the constructive discussion.

       I'm pretty sure people at the top understand it. So the "money masters" don't actually expect full repayment... ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       They probably just compete for sport who can make more billions. And they don't actually expect all their recorded wealth to materialize any time soon (or ever).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can take care of all your needs (including the ability to start wars and influence elections, not just buying fancy shit) by using just 0.05% of your wealth which is mostly made up of debt, why would you ever need to call on all the IOUs in your name when you know for a fact that doing so would collapse the world as we know it?
      </p>
      <p>
       So this whole point about not enough money or too much debt is really meaningless.

      <p>
       Yes, banks aren't making loans. But for a different reason. Banks have a shitload of money. They aren't lending to the general public because they can borrow from the public at 0.01% and lend to the government at 2% without any risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a messed up situation. But to me it looks more like an example of the law of unintended consequences than a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take me for example. (And there are plenty of people in the same situation.) I have a substantial amount of money stashed away in several accounts at one of the largest banks. They pay my account manager $100/mo for each $100k I keep at the bank in the accounts she manages. Yet, I get paid something like 3 cents/mo of interest for each $100k I keep there (I'm not sure on the exact rate as I haven't bothered to check in a while.) It's an insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, I still keep my money there. Partly because I suck at investing. But primarily because it's the safest thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know why they pay my account manager more than they pay me for the use of my money? Because they know I won't go anywhere, while at the same time people like her know how to attract deposits, which supplies the bank with yet more cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a bank has access to cheap cash and a reliable way to earn income on the spread, why would they do anything else? How can you blame them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm digressing a bit, but I thought I would explain my view on why banks aren't lending.
      </p>
      <p>
       But so what? The banks aren't lending. Are they under moral obligation to do so on "your" terms?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have an awesome business plan, then find an angel investor instead of borrowing. Start the business. Endure your partners or investors for the time being. Grow the business. Sell your share and use this money as seed for your next business which you would be able to finance on your own without any debt or investors.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you have a crappy business plan that might somewhat kinda maybe work, then you probably shouldn't get a loan in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
       Neither do I. I don't want to loan, spend or invest my money at this time. If you are fantasizing (as many people do these days) about forcing the banks to give out loans, are you also willing to force people who happened to have some available cash to do so as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think this would work out for the better? No?
If current unintended consequences suck, think of all the crap that's going to happen if you try to force the markets even more.

       Was that extra burden more than the cost the iphone you own and all the 5-dollar-lattes you've drank during that same period of time? (I'm not referring to you personally here, just my sentiment on this whole situation.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, they are crooks. But the amount of which they defrauded you personally is insignificant. Again, it's all more emotion than logic.

       They should go to jail. But that would not have any measurable impact on your life.

      <p>
       I run an "average small business". Well, two actually. And I'm starting another one next month. (Should have started working on it two months ago, but I'm feeling really lazy these days.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I call bullshit on your statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it's true that a lot of businesses are failing, I have to question the sustainability of those failed businesses in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of them wouldn't survive without constant injection of new credit. And that's not a healthy business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is how I think about this whole economy in the toilet thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       (extremely oversimplified)
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say I make $X/mo in net income. The unemployment rate is, say, 10%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm thinking about the crappy future and the horrible economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if unemployment rate jumped to 20%?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would lose around 11% of my paying customers because they would be broke now. Let's add the cumulative effect of the entire economy slowing down and DOUBLE the contraction of my customer base.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now, I lost 22% of my customers. My business shrunk. I'm making $0.78*X/mo of my current income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would I all of the sudden become broke because of the evil bankers? Nope. The difference wouldn't be much greater than normal monthly fluctuations. It would be almost business as usual for me. Of course, it would suck to be making less, but my lifestyle wouldn't even change all that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I did become bankrupt and had to shut down my business?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would that be because of the evil bankers or because my business was total crap to being with?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just play around with various values of X (and your average business owner's lifestyle) to stress-test an imaginary small business. You'll quickly realize that all the stories of "successful" business owners who were ruined overnight because of the economy are definitely leaving something out.

       Because the world isn't fair. Like you didn't know that.
My point is that in this unfair world, it's still possible to live a good life.
This pretty much sums up my response to all your other points which I didn't quote here.

       Sorry but you sound like a fucking retard. This would have an enormous impact on every single person's life. Stop excusing these criminals and acting like we just need to suck it up and deal with their activities. Also have fun losing all your hundreds of thousands of dollars when these "too big to fail" banks finally come crashing down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FDIC no longer fully insures bank accounts so the fact that you trust one of these big banks instead of a Credit Union is just more proof that you have very little knowledge of how this all works. LIBOR affects EVERYTHING not just mortages or interest-bearing debt. LIBOR literally affects everything related to currency trading(not that you would know, obviously).

       You stupid asshole they borrow from the Federal Reserve which is a CENTRAL BANK THAT PRINTS OUR MONEY FOR US. You are arguing the banks like Bank of America borrows money from the "public".. then loans it to our government? No. Jesus christ no.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve
       <strong>
        prints
       </strong>
       the money then loans it to our government
       <strong>
        at interest
       </strong>
       which then becomes a burden on the taxpayers tacking onto the national debt. But yet again I will bring up these banking institutions are full of crooked liars. They borrow from the FED at the abysmal 0.01% rates then loan it back to the public(citizens) at much higher rates. Why don't we(small businesses) have the opportunity to borrow at 0.01% interest? Dude you are so clueless you just trust the system and believe "oh it's broken but theres nothing I can do but play along with their rigged game". TBTF banks earn a profit off basically moving &amp; hoarding money, which keeps less in circulation for regular people. Maybe that isn't illegal now but it definitely should be. Stop making fucking excuses and educate yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you run a business handling other people's money, there needs to be a limit on how much these CEOs can pay themselves and walk away multi-billionaires. The fact that you trust your savings with one of these businesses definitely shows how ignorant you are. Collapse happened in post-WWII Germany and it is definitely happening here whether you understand it or not.

       All the conspiracies listed here are all fine and good, but I think the one that most people should know about is Monsanto's taking over of the world food supply,  this combined with nestle's monopoly of the water the world wide is a dangerous thing.

       Big pharma killing people and keeping people sick just fora profit. We think modern medicine is all we got but really it's just all that we are price lodges with using. The suppression of master mineral solution (MMS) one and two as well as colloidal silver throughout the country is pure proof that big pharma is controlling us. But people don't want to you with the idea that diseases we fear today are totally curable but aren't for profits.

       So why don't they market the cure at a tremendous cost, and then invest that money?  If you tell an insurance company that you can cure a disease for even 2/3 of the cost for the standard lifetime treatment, they would take that, because people would still be paying them, and they would save money.

       No, there IS a prescription fish oil pill.  That's a natural substance.  So it seems that you both can patent something natural like fish oil, and bring it to market.  So it would seem that the cannabis juice you spoke of would ALSO be able to be patented and brought to market, correct?

       Are you disputing the theory that tobacco companies conspire to engineer and deliver nicotine as a more addictive, effective form in the face of advertising bans?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would further think an intelligent person might consider that without the (arguably sinister) engineering and delivery of 'crack nicotine,' the effect of the ad bans would have been far greater.

       Exactly. Something I've found in my studies of reptilian a is that they could be described as pure evil that they get off on horrible things that would make us cringe such as rape and dismemberment and murder. But the kicker is that these reptilians do not do this because that's what they were born to do, rather their heart-souls have been completely drained. What they need is real spiritual healing. They don't all want to be so savage because those with little power still suffer from their dilapidated state. We must start a revolution of healing and love in order to take back our planet.

       You're 100% right. But I also believe that there are "real" drones out there. As you probably know the body is just a carrier of the soul. You could describe the Reptilian people just with empty bodies + a Reptilian soul, rather than a possessed soul. Possession also still exists, I won't deny that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have had one personal experience with somebody who was just in every way Reptilian, the evil eyes, always hunting for "negative emotions" by creating fake stories etc. On a certain occasion somebody was nice to that person, and directly it started rambling complete nonsense. Like non existent words etc., just losing complete control of the body. At that time I wasn't aware of the existence of Reptilians, but when I connected the dots it was just 100% confirmation for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the realization of this however is enough, though only if everybody accepts this. Once the whole planet does so there simply is no negative emotion left, so they won't be able to feed themselves. Don't forget also that emotions are matter, just as much as anything,

       That is bittersweet I suppose, realizing you've had contact with one of these people, ill get on my computer and find a book written solely about a woman's encounter with reptilians. The point is, the first reptilian she met was a man normal in social stature. This is what people don't understand is that reptilians are everywhere not just in positions of power. Also have you ever heard of wilhelm reich who discovered orgone? Orgone was described as the matter that our thoughts and energy make up that surrounds us in the world we see.

       Well, the person was a woman leading about a 100 kids on my old highschool. Got appointed out of the blue for the job and left after 2 years of terrorizing. I actually liked finding out that she was a Reptilian, it just made more sense to her weird actions. It also connected the facts you can't confirm with personal experience. And I also learned the valuable lesson that ignoring negative emotions is the best way to live life, whether you are trying to battle Reptilians or not ;P. I know now for example that if I wouldn't be enraged at her all the time then, that she would have probably left me alone. The best way to recognize them is the eyes, you can see the viciousness in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think however that Reptilians in normal social stature just are "less" Reptilian. Royal interbreeding is only done to keep the purity alive. Once a family(member) starts to disconnect from the pure bloodlines, the evil becomes lesser. Some of those ancient bloodlines have decayed over time, but others have also actively been kept alive as we both know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard of orgone, I wanted to make/buy it for a while but just haven't got to it ;) Read amazing stories about it, people recovering from serious diseases, plants growing like 3x the normal size etc., seems very awesome!

       Yes, this. Not trying to be rude or anything, just genuinely curious. I consider myself a conspiracy theorist, and I just cannot get behind the Reptilian theory.

       I must admit, I haven't done a lot of research on the subject, but I have done some, and I just think it all sounds so ridiculous.

       The Bloodlines (Just one example: Every American president being related to eachother - except for JFK &amp; Obama), the draw to occultism/satanism and repetition of rituals (Bohemian Grove is a good example for both, the murder of Princess Diana is also splattered with compelling evidence of this). There are also many mentions of their methods in ancient texts found all across the globe, and lets not forget that there are many old societies (Freemasons for example) which are "carriers" of this knowledge (If you have the time to become a 32-degree Freemason they will tell you their "secret", the secret of course being the existence of Reptilians - hence why you can't join as an atheist). Interbreeding within royal families has also always been a rule and is there to keep the bloodline pure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understanding the nature of reality (and above all accepting that there is more around us than which we perceive) is also very important if you want to find out the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I can go on and on about this but I suggest that you look for yourself, because the problem is that there isn't
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       solid piece of evidence which is 100% proof; but put them all together and it's very obvious. If you follow the evidence you'll probably come to the same conclusion (if you are willing to challenge your preconceived notions on religion, reality and of course the governing powers ;P).

       <p>
        Who cares if there are wealthy families that "own" money?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       because they charge interest on the money. so if we paid back every single dollar in circulation, there would still be debt left to pay. it is literally impossible to pay back all the money, plus interest, because there's not enough money to do that. there is more debt in the world than there is money. that is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does this specifically stop me or somebody interested in their own business from earning money? a comfortable living? it really doesn't. but the current economic climate does LIMIT small businesses because there are no investments being made. there are no loans being given by banks, because they just don't have the money to give out. People also don't have much spare money so they are purchasing far less than in previous years. This deteriorating economic climate is a direct cause of the elite banking families.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just want to hoard all their money in offshore bank accounts and quietly collect interest. they don't want to spend it or loan it out, or invest it or have it circulating at all. this is another big problem and it's why I care that the wealthy families print &amp; control the money. they have ultimate say of how much they want to hoard away from the public's eye. they can do a lot of shady shit and cook the books to make it seem legit. For proof just look at the recent LIBOR scandal which has still yet to explode....
      </p>
      <p>
       This also takes money out of common services where revenue can be generated. Think advertising, sales, distribution, services like restaurants or car repair garages. The average small business suffers because they just do not turn enough profit to stay afloat and because there just isnt any money out there, it's getting worse. Now one final comment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Do you think if the world was set up in a fair (according to god knows who) way, then everybody would be rich?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No I do not believe that. But not everybody wants to be rich, some people just want to earn a decent living. However a lot of people do want to be rich and the game is NOT fair for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you answer this - why is our government bailing out institutions like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan which are literally bleeding money? they are nothing but casinos running on the stock market and cashing in off derivatives based on big business, not based in real human needs. people trade corn for money, not to help corn farmers or lower corn prices for consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why in the fuck does BoA or Goldman Sachs deserve bailouts from the government? Why not bail out small business owners? Clearly they provide a lot more benefit to society as a whole. I'll answer this for you - because the banks pay the politicians and they pay the lobbyists. the bankers control the money and by design also control anything else they choose. It's a disguising system and the fact you would defend it just because your story is a successful one, is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       For every "success" story like yours there are literally thousands or possibly millions of failures. People who have run successful businesses for decades have been closing their doors at an unbelievable rate these past 4 years. Why? Because there is no money out there, because the wealthy elites are hoarding their share. And whatever's left is being devalued as they print more money every single month (Quantitative Easing 3). This is how I draw conclusions from "rich people own the money" to "they are using this ownership to game the system and it's rigged against the average business owner".

       However you are free to your own opinion, and I appreciate the constructive discussion.
