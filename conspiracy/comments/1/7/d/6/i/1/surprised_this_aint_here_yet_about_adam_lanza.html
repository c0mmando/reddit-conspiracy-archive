       There haven't been much discussion about the aftermath of his life. So they haven't caught him? It was all staged. All went wrong for the government because of his brother's quick wits about informing about his own whereabouts in social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       No ceremony. Remains will be hidden. Cremated. Enough said?

       It is very possible that Ryan and Adam lanza are in fact the same person, who has had their name changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       At around the same time there is "no record of Adam" is when there seems to be plenty or record of Ryan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan's friends said they knew he had a brother- but never got to meet him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan and adam appear to look physically similar in all the pictures (except for the Ghostly image used by 99% of media which is clearly a photoshop).
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7VQbqh3gIVYC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=lanza&amp;amp;f=false">
        This book is a geneological publication called "the Births and deaths of Kingstown, NH" says only Adam Lanza was born to Nancy and Peter
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no proof that Ryan was born in Connecticut, many people claim his
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8EMA0dB13k">
        facebook page says he was but that isn't true, his facebook page just says he lived in connecticut
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no pictures of Ryan and Adam together-  how many brothers do you know where there isn't one picture of them in the same place?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we dealing with a potential "swticheroo"..  One brother becoming two brothers- a son who's father works for GE Capital- that owns MSNBC?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was so much confusion about Ryan being Adam-  Adam having Ryans ID etc. etc.-  even the pictures used confuse the two brothers.. maybe that's because they are in fact one and the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the person in the morgue was put on leave because the body in Adam's autopsy bag wasn't the person we're being told it was.

       Good points.  But why would they claim Ryan did it when Ryan is safely at work at his job in NJ?  That wasn't very smart.

       How is it relevant that a guy who works for a company that owns MSNBC is one of the few claiming to see the body of Adam?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that for a little while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing I recently discovered-  one of the few people who claims she has seen both of the "brothers" together is named Marsha Moskowitz- the bus driver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get this, Marsha Moskowitz was supposed to lose her owner/operator contract with Newtown Fall 2012- and was going to lose her house over the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://newtown.patch.com/articles/meet-marsha-moskowitz-and-phil-carroll">
        This article talks about how Marsha felt "anger and frustration for what they generally view as a complete betrayal and conspiracy at the highest levels."  About losing their contract with Newtown.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it any surprise she is one of the few people who claims she has seen both brothers together at the same time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Get this -Marsha Moskowitz is also a professional pet-sitter..  as is Gene Rosen.   Gene Rosen claimed a "female bus driver" came into his house-  I have a feeling we've found who that alleged driver is..  a very disgruntled Marsha Moskowitz.

       Yup, I got it. But let's suppose we had a "real" situation without any anti-depressants and government hoax. Still it's on Daily News.

       Yeah, because when my wife visits me at work, it's To Witness What Is Really Happening, not just because I forgot my lunch, or because she's shopping in the area and wanted to say hi, or because I'm having a stressful week and she wants to check on me.
      </p>

       Obviously someone visiting their spouse at work is evidence of giant nefarious conspiracy.

       Pointing out how normal it is to visit your spouse at your nine to five sort of makes the whole visiting your wife doing aj autopsy on a mass child killer seem more conspicuous.

       Reading comprehension. Learn it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article doesn't say she was performing the autopsy at the time.  It doesn't even say she took him in for the purpose of seeing the body.  It simply said he was in the room where the body was being kept.  That could be as simple as coming in while she was doing paperwork, dropping something off, and leaving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, for you to think this is evidence of some conspiracy is simply your confirmation-bias-addled brain filling in gaps with what you want to believe.

       You don't just accidentally end up in the same room as the body if you are just someone bringing in your lunch. What makes you think the wife didn't bring her husband in to show him the body? Even if there's nothing nefarious going on, that sounds like something that would happen

       Something this high profile, I would think he would be somewhat interested, maybe he is a conspiracy theorist himself actually doing the footwork to see with his own eyes? What better way when your wife is so close to the source.

       How? Most bodies are buried in a steel case in a concrete vault. What you
       <em>
        don't see
       </em>
       after that first shovel of dirt falls on grandma, is the yard of concrete they pour over the casket before filling in the rest of the hole. It's
       <em>
        damn hard
       </em>
       to get a someone's remains after a
       <em>

       burial.
