       It's been refreshing watching this crap be called out instead of believed. They may be able to game the upvote system with minion accounts, but at least the bullshit is being called. I'd suggest a bunch of us subscribing to the tards to keep an eye on their malarkey.

       Would have been better proof had he written that days date and his user name on a piece of paper laid beside his EMT/First Responder certification paper. But he didn't so I think this is a hoax.

       I've been to Watertown, it is 5 minutes away from a military base. So it doesn't match story. If OP travelled from Watertown to a major hospital in Syracuse (about 60-75 minute ride down I-81) where several of the hospitals adjoin parking garages (at least St.Joes and Upstate University) IIRC, the larger hospitals there tend to treat critical cases from the surrounding rural areas that smaller hospitals cant accommodate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But whatever right lets all throw a bitch fit over a fake story, lets not discuss Washington and other places receiving no punishments. Nothing will change.

       Couldn't have been the "Little House" (Upstate's smaller hospital in western Syracuse) because there is no underground garage there. My mom works there. Also don't think it could have been St. Jose, but I could ask my cousin who works there.

       I beleive it is true as well. Mk ultra is a real thing and was declassified in the 70's.it is a process of creating programmed alternate personas that can be triggered at any moment. I also believe aurora and sandy hook utilized this.

       A critical thinker/skeptic is OPEN to possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not its a hoax isn't that important.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important thing to note is how quickly people here claim "it must be a hoax, so obvious"
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have no information, just admit you don't have enough information to know whether its true or false. No one thinks you're clever claiming something is a hoax when there is no definite proof of either possibility.

       Trust me, I have an open mind. However, it is perfectly justifiable to give the story a "preliminary value of probability", based on the known facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of any corroborating evidence whatsoever (apart from a redacted image of a First Responder badge which is not evidence of anything at all) my judgment is that the story is "likely a hoax" albeit not proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, being a flexible person and amenable to evidence, my preliminary judgment may prove to be wrong, and it is certainly subject to change, should further evidence arise.

Hey, I'm a long time poster of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and try and spread as much solid knowledge about the underhanded workings of the government that I can. If there's anything you can send me to let me know if something happens to you so I can get the word out, sort of like a dead man's switch. You are in danger, there is no doubt in that area. You might not think that people are watching(especially here), but they are: constantly. There's a file on you that contains your IP, everything you've posted, where you live, what your routine is, etc. Because of your involvement in this, you've likely been flagged to be watching more closely. Make sure you have a way to defend yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: This was all assuming, of course, he was telling the truth( unlikely ).

       If you'd never heard of MKUltra, and you overheard somebody talking about it, (a) would you spell it correctly in recounting the story, and (b) would you even know what you heard the first time, accurately?  Or would you think you heard something like "empty ultra"?

       It was a Hoax. Most of it did not make any sense. The biggest factor was that the feds grabbed the "gunman" to silence, but let the "victim" go freely in an ambulance with random people.

       an unarmed gunman isn't a gunman. If you payed attention to the story it is obvious he at least believed he was acting in self-defense, and gave himself up freely to the police but knew the suits were out to get him.

       Noting BLD response is "have fun making fun of stupid people".  Sadists enjoy hurting others; believing that he is entitled to hurt others because he feels he's above them all, the judge of everyone, is also both narcissistic and sociopathic. Since BLD was not actually at the scene of the story and can prove nothing pro or con, his judgment used as basis for attacking others is only his opinion. And the 'stupid people' he is attacking are the Redditors discussing the story.  Nice going, psycho.

       he never said he was filling out paperwork in the back of the ambulance, and you don't think it is possible for 3 EMTs to work in the same vehicle, or that the driver of the ambulance is unable to talk to anyone in the back?
