    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been to Watertown, it is 5 minutes away from a military base. So it doesn&#39;t match story. If OP travelled from Watertown to a major hospital in Syracuse (about 60-75 minute ride down I-81) where several of the hospitals adjoin parking garages (at least St.Joes and Upstate University) IIRC, the larger hospitals there tend to treat critical cases from the surrounding rural areas that smaller hospitals cant accommodate.</p>

<p>But whatever right lets all throw a bitch fit over a fake story, lets not discuss Washington and other places receiving no punishments. Nothing will change.</p>

<p>If you have no information, just admit you don&#39;t have enough information to know whether its true or false. No one thinks you&#39;re clever claiming something is a hoax when there is no definite proof of either possibility.</p>

Hey, I&#39;m a long time poster of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and try and spread as much solid knowledge about the underhanded workings of the government that I can. If there&#39;s anything you can send me to let me know if something happens to you so I can get the word out, sort of like a dead man&#39;s switch. You are in danger, there is no doubt in that area. You might not think that people are watching(especially here), but they are: constantly. There&#39;s a file on you that contains your IP, everything you&#39;ve posted, where you live, what your routine is, etc. Because of your involvement in this, you&#39;ve likely been flagged to be watching more closely. Make sure you have a way to defend yourself.</p>

<p>Edit: This was all assuming, of course, he was telling the truth( unlikely ).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Noting BLD response is &quot;have fun making fun of stupid people&quot;.  Sadists enjoy hurting others; believing that he is entitled to hurt others because he feels he&#39;s above them all, the judge of everyone, is also both narcissistic and sociopathic. Since BLD was not actually at the scene of the story and can prove nothing pro or con, his judgment used as basis for attacking others is only his opinion. And the &#39;stupid people&#39; he is attacking are the Redditors discussing the story.  Nice going, psycho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been refreshing watching this crap be called out instead of believed. They may be able to game the upvote system with minion accounts, but at least the bullshit is being called.
