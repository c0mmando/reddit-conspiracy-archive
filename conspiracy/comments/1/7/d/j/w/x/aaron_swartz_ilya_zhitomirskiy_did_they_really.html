       Both Aaron Swartz and Ilya Zhitomirskiy, the late founder of Diaspora*, were people immune to common influence and willing to die and more importantly actively donate their lives to their belief systems, which were progressive and strongly moored in equality and freedom. This mindset of working willingly and ceaselessly for something greater than oneself is probably the least conducive to suicide of all the attitudes held through the entire spectrum of human experience. It would be analogous to MLK, Malcom X, JFK or John Lennon killing themselves and letting the people whom they had dedicated their lives to defeating win. Certainly, we can all agree that this is unimaginable.

       Truth in essence. Another good example is the death of Gary Webb. This guy linked the war on drugs to the CIA and "committed suicide". Funny thing is that he had 2 gunshot wounds to the head, but still the "official" explanation is that he killed himself.

       Suicides by activists/whistle-blowers are
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       suicides, your post makes a clear point, it's just too much in contradiction of their beliefs to kill themselves.

       That's how I feel as well. Thanks for the feedback. It's not only sucicides but there are also a lot of 'sudden unexplained deaths' that I am sure were brought about chemically by clandestine methods. For example, the death of Barry Jennings the day before he was set to film a bbc documentary. Barry was the last chap out of building 7 before the whole thing fell.

       Did you know that the BBC also reported the collapse of WTC7 20 minutes too early? On the live broadcast you can even see WTC7 still standing (seriously, how bad can you cover something up?). Dying of an unknown cause (I looked into Jennings, couldn't find a COD indeed) seems to me like they just made too much of a mess for a real official explanation or they used chemicals indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Novesky is also a good example: shortly after Sandy Hook the guy linked meds to suicides (I think meds are also a huge cause for "normal" suicides) and gun violence, got in a car "accident" shortly afterwards. The guy also apparently made the best assault rifle-mods in the U.S. and was a big name in that community.
      </p>
      <p>
       When somebody is pointing a finger and dies shortly after, I always refuse to believe that they died by accident or suicide. It's just too convenient.

       I did indeed know about the pre-preemptive reading of the PR release outlining the 'collapse of the soloman brother's building' one of the most compelling pieces of political evidence, surely.

       How can you compare Webb and Swartz??  Webb was uncovering massive corruption in the CIA while Swartz downloaded some files that are freely available to most college students.  If there's a conspiracy here, it's that he faked his suicide.

       are you kidding me, have you listened to any of his interviews or read his blog. He wanted to fundamentally change the entire power structure. He said he read too books when he was very very young, before he created RSS, they were moral mazes, and noam chomsky's understanding power. He wanted to obliterate all power hubs and their corrupt advantages over society. Including the CIA, Swartz was a real game changer, not just  a researcher. I think you have a lot to learn about how you can make changes in society. As we all know there is a tonne of irrefutable scientific and political evidence that makes clear 911 was executed by a faction with connections to the 911 commision, norad, the cia and others, however no one gives a shit cause information is easily ignored by the mases. Aaron was a game changer a unique intellect, and he wanted to do away with the corruption of corporate totalitarian states. You clearly have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. This kid was 26 and had already changed the world. He was a co-founder of the medium by which we are currently conversing for crying out loud. I hope you are not a schill and you will re-consider what it means to make a difference, it is, unfortunately, not necessarily guys like richard gage that make a difference it is guys like aaron swartz, and they are dangerous to the establishment.

       oh shoot! You weren't kidding, I had never heard of Rudolf Diesel, "In the evening of 29 September 1913, Diesel boarded the post office steamer Dresden in Antwerp on his way to a meeting of the Consolidated Diesel Manufacturing company in London. He took dinner on board the ship and then retired to his cabin at about 10 p.m., leaving word to be called the next morning at 6:15 a.m. His cabin was found empty during a roll call, and he was never seen alive again. A search of his cabin revealed that Diesel's bed had not been slept in, although his nightshirt was neatly laid out and his watch had been left where he could see it from the bed"
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like some fishy stuff, no pun intended, especially given that he had ownership of all the diesel engine patents. Thanks for bring this up, it's always depressing to see that their is even more blatant corruption that one has yet to see.  Cheers.

       yeah, it is unthinkable. Did you also know that JP Morgan convinced Tesla to rip up the agreement they made that he would earn 25 cents (or something small) for every single induction motor ever made. It would have made him a multi millionaire by the time the 1930s rolled around, and he was broke having his room in the new yorker hotel paid for....
      </p>
      <p>
       Morgan said if tesla didn't give up his share they wouldn't be able to move forward with the technology, fucking bastard...

       I think you might be even more outraged if you look into how JP Morgan gained financial control over Tesla.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hint: Tesla's principal financial supporter and friend drowned when a ship owned by JP Morgan unexpectedly sank, on a voyage that JP Morgan was supposed to have been on but which he cried out of at the last minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Controlling (and thereby neutralising) Tesla was not the only reason for the crime committed above. It was a collateral benefit, like the insurance payout.

       In fact, I was referring to
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jacob_Astor_IV">
        John Jacob Astor

       . He was the richest man in the world a the time, a bitter rival of JP Morgan. He was highly politically influential, and very much opposed to the formation of the Federal Reserve, and yes, his untimely death facilitated the birth of the Fed the very next year.

       Here's a Wikipedia link to Robin Gardiner's
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic_alternative_theories">
        "The ship that never sank"
       </a>
       . This switching of the (unseaworthy) Olympic with the Titanic was the vehicle for the plot. Just like 9/11, there many different benefits that the perpetrators managed to gain from their conspiracy.

       There are videos on Youtube of which this covers many of those angles.

       Thanks! This is a great forum ever since Facebook deleted by second account I haven't had an opportunity to discuss these issues with different people and hear from different people and collaborate and I really hope that I can continue this on reddit. Do you guys know of any other social networks where you don't have to disclose all your information ( for work purposes) but where we can discuss all this sort of stuff.

       I know the CIA/FBI are not above
       <em>
        blackmailing
       </em>
       people to commit suicide (see:
       <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/king-like-all-frauds-your-end-is.html">
        Martin Luther King
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are too many "suicided" names to list, but here are a few of the most suspicious deaths I can think of.  Please take a few minutes to Google them:
      </p>
      <p>
       Gary Caradori
      </p>
      <p>
       Mae Brussel
      </p>
      <p>
       Jack Ruby
      </p>
      <p>
       Gary Webb
      </p>
      <p>
       Barbara Jean Palfrey, "The D.C. Madam"
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Mary Sherman
      </p>
      <p>
       Hunter S. Thompson
      </p>
      <p>
       Beverly Eckert
      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Brown, U.S. Secretary of Commerce under Bill Clinton
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, putting a person under surveillance, threatening them with prison time and systematically defaming their character is enough to drive one to suicide if they're already depressed.  Either way, I consider it murder.

       Did he?  I read that he knew he'd be 'suicided' and wasn't suicidal at the time of his death, but who knows.  Here's the excerpt:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        He'd been working on a story about the World Trade Center attacks and had stumbled across what he felt was hard evidence showing the towers had been brought down not by the airplanes that flew into them but by explosive charges set off in their foundations. Now he thought someone was out to stop him publishing it: "They're gonna make it look like suicide," he said. "I know how these bastards think . . ."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       He was supposedly involved in the recording of snuff porn at Bohemian Grove and killed himself on the same day as
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahhotahp8Ck">
        Rusty Nelson's
       </a>
       computer was seized in connection with child porn.  Sounds kinda kooky on the surface but there's some pretty convincing anecdotal evidence out there.

       Agree.  He'd already written an eerily accurate 9/11 piece called
       <a href="http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=1250751">
        "Fear &amp; Loathing in America"

       Hell no. They were some of the most promising, idealistic young people of our generation. They had the ability to lead our generation against the system. They were killed before they could make a huge impact.
