</ol>

<hr/>

<p>So, the question is, did the children make it out alive or not?</p>

<p>The claim that they escaped and made it to Gene Rosen&#39;s house gives credit to Gene&#39;s story, but puts the death count at twenty, six deaths short of the official reports.</p>

<p>The claim that they died attempting to escape proves that Gene Rosen is a paid actor reciting his script, and supports the official death count  of twenty-six. </p>

<p>(14 from Rousseau&#39;s class + 6 from Soto&#39;s class + 6 teachers = 26)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking at this one today as well. It&#39;s an interesting one for sure.</p>

<p>For me the crucial questions are how many children were in that class that day and how many escaped. It seems uncontroversial that 6 children in the class were killed. <a href="http://articles.courant.com/2012-12-15/business/hc-timeline-newtown-shooting-1216-20121215_1_school-psychologist-classroom-special-education-teacher">It was reported</a> that 7 were found hiding in the closet. There is evidence that some children escaped the classroom.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/heartbreaking_smiles_ms_soto_class_mIAtV7NpFzD81i36jbTcvK">photo</a> of the class taken &quot;last fall&quot; in which there are 15 students. Given that 5 are identified as dead suggests 1 was absent that day. Anyway, that does not prove how many were there on the day of the shooting.</p>

<p>Aiden Licata said he escaped with some other classmates. I have not found a source indicating an exact number of how many escaped with him. Say there were 2, then that would tally exactly with the number of children in the photo (15+1).</p>

<p>The co-incidence of numbers (6 dead, 6 at Rosen&#39;s house) is I think a red herring. I have not seen any evidence that suggests that the 6 dead are the same 6 children that Rosen claimed to have on his lawn. There is evidence that children other than the 6 who were killed did in fact escape.</p>

<p>However, the Rosen story is obviously of interest. He says 6 children turned up on his lawn. Are we <em>sure</em> that <em>all</em> 6 children were from Ms Soto&#39;s class? He talks about &quot;two boys&quot; talking and saying that their teacher (Soto) was dead. Are we all maybe just assuming that all 6 were from Soto&#39;s class when maybe in fact they weren&#39;t? (Edit: should add that I don&#39;t have any logical conclusion as to what other class the children might have been from. There was 1 survivor in the other class but no other reports of children leaving the school of their own accord other than Aiden and friends.)</p>

<p>In any case, it&#39;s possible that Rosen is just someone trying to get in on the action and creating a bit of a story. He certainly comes across as a bit of an odd fellow and it is bizzare that the bus driver person hasn&#39;t come forward or been identified. It is bizzare that he would not call 911 immediately.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe for one minute that he is a crisis actor. This is a government said to have successfully orchestrated 9/11. A government with limitless resources. And this is the best they can do? No. (IMO) a crisis actor would have a tight script with no holes and would have instructions to give only one interview, to avoid discrepancies. And would be able to, you know, act. Furthermore, it makes absolutely no sense to include a fake Rosen story in the conspiracy. It&#39;s redundant and risky. Can you imagine plotting this conspiracy and saying &quot;right, what we need is a story about an old man who finds 6 kids on his driveway with a bus driver (and we won&#39;t assign an actor to play the bus driver because people are just going to forget about this crucial character), the old man is going to take the kids inside but not call 911 and he&#39;s going to give them toys and stuff. Yeah. This will definitely help sell the story and nobody will question it.&quot; At worst he made the story up. Or if he was a crisis actor, he went full retard, because literally no conspiracy plotter would include all that stuff in the plan.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s my conclusions about the possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There were 16 in class. 6 were killed, 7 hid in the closet, 3 escaped. Rosen made the story up. This is my preferred theory at the moment.</p></li>
<li><p>There were 16 in class. 6 were killed, 7 hid in the closet, 3 escaped. The 6 on Rosen&#39;s lawn were not all from Soto&#39;s class. Possible, but no real evidence that children from multiple classes escaped.</p></li>
<li><p>There were 19 in class. 6 were killed, 7 hid in the closet, 6 escaped and ended up at Rosen&#39;s house. Possible.</p></li>
<li><p>There were 13 in class. Aiden Licata lied and was actually one of those found in the closet. I think it&#39;s unlikely that Aiden lied.</p></li>
<li><p>Number of children found in the closet was misreported and was not actually 7. Edit: possible. The source of this appears to be <a href="http://articles.courant.com/2012-12-15/business/hc-timeline-newtown-shooting-1216-20121215_1_school-psychologist-classroom-special-education-teacher">this Hartford Courant article from Dec 15</a>. Is it accurate or is it misinformation that has flown under the radar and never been corrected?</p></li>
<li><p>Number of children killed was misreported and was not actually 6. I think this is almost certainly not true.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There may be other possibilities. My comments and conclusions could be completely wrong. That&#39;s fine. Just be gentle with me and use lube please.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I know there&#39;s no evidence, but what are the odds that the 6 who supposedly escaped, weren&#39;t all form Mrs. Soto&#39;s class? If every other class was in lock-down or hiding, then how could six kids from different classrooms escape together?</p>

<p>I for one think no kids ran out of the building, and made it to Gene&#39;s house. I think that was a fabricated story to give Gene&#39;s claims credit. Either way, Gene mentions the kids saying &quot;our teacher is dead / Mrs. Soto is dead&quot;. </p>

<p>So why would Mrs. Soto&#39;s kids mention her name, but the other kids wouldn&#39;t mention their teacher&#39;s name?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree it&#39;s unlikely they were from multiple classrooms. Also, Rosen is notably absent from Aiden&#39;s story or in fact any story. Both facts lead me to conclude that Rosen made the story up.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard to believe that CNN would lie, but look at how all of the major news sites have the more recent articles stating that some children escaped from Mrs. Soto&#39;s room. </p>

<p>Then look at the articles stating that the only survivors of Mrs. Soto&#39;s class were the ones who were hidden in the closet. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say that the six kids that weren&#39;t in the closet are dead, and the major news sites are paid to enforce Gene Rosen&#39;s story.</p>

<p>Yeah, schools don&#39;t work like that. Class sizes fluctuate, kids move into town, kids move out of town, schedules get moved around. Classes won&#39;t even necessarily be even at the start of the year. Some kids get slotted into certain classes depending on the availability of special education teachers they might need, an assistant teacher might only be hired for half days so those classes are larger, administrations screw up and don&#39;t plan well, and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have posted this theory before, but I think you should consider that the children who were allegedly &quot;dropped off&quot; at creepy Gene Rosen&#39;s house, may not be survivors of that conspiracy - ie that they are amongst the dead.</p>

<p>These unnamed children were abducted/escorted to his &quot;paedophile safe house&quot; just after the shooting, to get them out of public view. They were then secreted out of the area by a satanic/paedophile network.</p>

<p>The unfortunate &quot;Rosen children&quot; were then conveniently listed amongst the 20 child victims of Sandy Hook. Of course, they were later murdered, but they were ritualistically killed by paedophiles, not a crazed gunman, and they didn&#39;t die inside the school building at Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>It is critical that we find out the identities of the children who Gene Rosen locked in his house without bothering to tell anyone who might be looking for them (the parents, the police, the school etc). If those children are amongst the listed survivors of Sandy Hook, then my little hypothesis collapses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly the best and most inconspicuous way to abduct children would be to stage one of the most horrific school shootings in American history, a crime so massive it brings international attention, the attention of dozens if not hundreds of journalists - though I suppose that&#39;s not a problem, since the journalists are all in on it - a slew of politicians, the entire surrounding town, and millions of concerned citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t found a source of 13 students for OP&#39;s claim yet. However, I will point out that it would be very odd for the two teachers to have a class size disparity of 5. A similar ratio of 1:1, or 14:13 is far more likely than poor Ms. Soto ending up with 19 kids while the other teacher only has 14. School systems are generally very good about keeping the class sizes at the lowest possible teacher to student ratio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I say 13 because 7 were hidden in a closet, and 6 died or escaped. If you want to believe that 7 were hidded, 6 escaped, and 6 more died attempting to escape, then the class count changes to 19. But why would the articles claiming the kids escaped, not mention the kids who died trying to escape? And why would the articles claiming the kids tried to escape and failed, not mention the kids who escaped successfully? Almost every article mentions the 7 kids hidden in the closet, so either way there were 13 kids in Mrs. Soto&#39;s class that day.</p>
