</blockquote>

<p>No, they wouldn&#39;t. There is no death penalty for manslaughter, nor is there life imprisonment. When compared to murder charges, manslaughter maximum sentences aren&#39;t bad. In Florida, for instance, the max is <a href="http://www.richardhornsby.com/crimes/homicide/manslaughter.html">15 years</a>, and that is rarely given. A few years and then probation is common, depending on the nature of the crime.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><em>You</em> should probably look it up, since you grossly mis-state what corporate personhood is. Corporations do NOT have &quot;all the rights of people.&quot; That is a gross simplification and is highly misleading.</p>

<p>But I guess your ignorance is why you&#39;d ask such a stupid question, i.e. &quot;why isn&#39;t BP thrown in jail?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sparky, you might consider reading your own link.</p>

<p>I mean, Jesus Christ, it&#39;s the <em>third fucking line</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The doctrine does not hold that corporations are &quot;people&quot; in the most common usage of the word, nor does it grant to corporations all of the rights of citizens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then it goes on to outline the many different ways in which corporations <strong>don&#39;t</strong> have &quot;all the rights of people,&quot; in detail.</p>

<p>Like I said, saying they do is a gross simplification and is highly misleading - not to mention it&#39;s just plain false.</p>

<p>... how do they have &quot;all the rights of people?&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, that&#39;s right, they <em>don&#39;t</em>. They have <em>some</em> of the same rights, largely to facilitate legal matters and taxes, and to recognize corporate speech rights, but are <em>not</em> recognized as &quot;people.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have the right to be criminally prosecuted. At this point it really doesn&#39;t matter if they can vote or run for office. The corporation (as a <em>person</em>) may be criminally prosecuted. This means that the company itself is liable, not the shareholders individually. The question OP has is why is there no suitable action against them. It commited a crime (as a person) and needs to be held responsible. Obviously you can&#39;t put a business in jail but you could impose fines and probation as you would any other person. They wanted the rights, they need to accept the responsibility behind it.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/15/bp-oil-spill_n_2136063.html">they were</a>, 14 felony counts in all. They agreed to a plea deal. They&#39;re going to pay $4 billion to settle the charges. As of yesterday, the settlement was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/business/judge-approves-bp-criminal-settlement.html?_r=0">affirmed by a judge</a>.</p>

<p>So what is OP asking again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing the point. Do you have anything constructive to add? Thoughts, suggestions? Clearly you cannot put a business in jail. What <em>can</em> you do and why wasn&#39;t it done? For example, I believe they should be on &quot;probation&quot; meaning they hold no right to any sort of privacy or non-disclosure during that period. The authorities should not need any sort of warrant or permission to check up on them in any aspect whether it be accounting or logistics. This is how a person on probation is treated. Your probation officer can come to your home and workplace without notice or permission. They can question all your activity, they can drug test you, they can confiscate &quot;contraband&quot;, they can do everything to ensure you remain law abiding and haul your ass to court on new charges if they need. The article states that they settled and had they not, the punishments would have been much tougher. Whether or not you believe this is akin to a plea bargain is up to you, but in no state would you, as an individual, be extended a plea bargain for cash to remedy 14 felonies.</p>
