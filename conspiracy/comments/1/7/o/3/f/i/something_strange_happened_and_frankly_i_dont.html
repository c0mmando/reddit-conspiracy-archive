<p>I post a lot of controversial articles on Facebook, two of which were about the Water Barons buying up lands that have vast amounts of water beneath them, and another article explaining many discrepancies about Sandy Hook.  I also added these two articles to my favorites.</p>

<p>Now tonight, I just came to the realization my favorites have all been wiped, deleted, gone, and both articles on my Facebook have simply vanished.  Is this a normal occurrence, has it happened to others, and am I just being paranoid? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not even nefarious or dastardly in itself either, just shrewd marketing. Google itself <em>SAYS</em> it does this, yet we&#39;re nutters for discussing it. Look how quick the facebooks of Anders Brevik and other high profile suspects are removed and scrutinized by investigators and prosecutors, not looking for answers but building that big case that will get them promoted and brownie points with superiors- handy when competing with other departments for a larger budget. Now add an innocent, wrongly accused (happens all the time). Think the feds care? They&#39;ll go through your facebook and twitter looking for anything they can take out of context. Anything that will put them and their department in a good light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People do watch, my friend looks into artificial sweeteners and the negative effects that they have, and when she posted some stuff about it on facebook, Coke made her take it down. And that is just a fizzy drink. I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s what happened with you, but it does happen. </p>

<p>If you want to know more about artificial sweeteners I suggest you do some research, many people know believe them to be extremely toxic apart from stevia. Just look at what Pepsi is doing now, they have Pepsi with sugar, Pepsi Max without, and now they are bringing out Pepsi Next, with reduced sugar and stevia instead. Now why would they do this unless they have plans to remove one of the other two products. Many think that in the next few years we will look about artificial sweeteners as being as bad as smoking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such things have never happened to me. However many of my favorite woo-woo types report such things. If you&#39;re out-spoken you&#39;ll get noticed. It&#39;s possible that you&#39;ve been noticed.</p>

<p>Now this is where it gets funny: this means you&#39;re doing something right. They wouldn&#39;t react unless they felt threatened. It is my opinion that you&#39;re doing just fine.</p>

<p>Having just finished watching Gandhi [1982] I was reminded that it is good to speak out against indignities, lies and injustice. By caving into their threats to silence you they win. So, do not cave into their threats to silence you. Now, also note that they&#39;re spending resources on you. This is excellent. They can&#39;t possibly look after all of us. Our strength is that we out number them by millions to one. </p>

<p>I now regard this as a war of attrition. We win by default. </p>

<p>The next major step is non-compliance. Stop paying their tributes [taxes]. Stop obeying their laws [grow your own damned hemp if you want]. Stop using their money [this is the one thing that will break them].</p>

<p>Above all: stop using their money. They will be helpless without this.</p>

<p>Keep posting on facebook. Keep speaking out. It is your right and your duty.</p>
