        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s my personal belief that the primary function of fluoride in water supplies is to suppress the natural action of the pineal gland in the human brain, sometimes referred to as the &quot;third eye&quot;.</p>

<p>(Incidentally, I also believe the primary function of mint flavouring in toothpaste is not to make it palatable per se, but to mask the sensation of an industrial waste product contacting the tongue and the membranes of the mouth)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.icnr.com/articles/fluoride-deposition.html">http://www.icnr.com/articles/fluoride-deposition.html</a></p>

<p>(I am welcome to attempts at debunking this article - I seek truth, not an agenda)</p>

<p>Various things I&#39;ve read suggest that the chemical element Boron is a powerful detoxifying agent for fluoride, as well as for other ingested chemicals.</p>

<p>Borax is a salt of boron. It&#39;s available in grocery stores - not as a food product, but as a cleaning product. It is however rather safe for consumption; an example being &quot;20 Mule Team Borax&quot;, which claims to be 100% natural and 99.5% pure sodium tetraborate.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia and many other sources, it is effectively non-toxic, with the LD50 for rats being about 2.66g per kg of body weight. (However it is apparently toxic to developing fetuses, so you should not consume it if you are pregnant or breastfeeding)</p>

<p>This exact same substance - sodium tetraborate - is used as a food additive in some countries (E 285)... but this usage is banned in the USA.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder.</p>

<p>There is this new movement online where people take 100mg iodine, experience significant side effects, and attribute the side effects to &quot;detox&quot; or &quot;die off&quot;, etc. That&#39;s what I&#39;m referring to. See the post below for an example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol how is it bullshit? Food industry replaced iodine(which is required by our bodies - we couldn&#39;t live without it) with bromide/fluoride and whatever other crap which we don&#39;t need at all.</p>

<p>are some people iodine deficient? yea, maybe. my problem is with these people who advocate doses in the 1-10+ milligram range. pure quackery IMO. a lot of people complain of side effects at these doses which are attributed to &quot;bromide detox&quot;. there&#39;s also this perverse religious adoration of the &quot;iodine docs&quot;</p>

<p>Why did people use radium?</p>

<p>As with iodine, there&#39;s a lot of brainwashing going on. The iodine movement attracts people who are distrustful of mainstream medicine.

<p>There are just as many charlatans in the alternative medicine community as there are in mainstream medicine. I don&#39;t necessarily think Brownstein, Flechas et al are being purposely misleading, but I think their arguments, research, etc. are weak.</p>

<p>Iodine isn&#39;t medicine... that&#39;s the point. It&#39;s a CRITICAL element for all life forms and we&#39;re all deficient in it! Why? It&#39;s been slowly taken out of every food. Salt is all we have left at this point and now they&#39;re warning us that salt raises blood pressure so we should stay away from it...
Without iodine, there is no life.</p>

<p><a href="http://iodinehistory.blogspot.com/">http://iodinehistory.blogspot.com/</a></p>

<p>^ would you call that an iodine movement? No, medicine back then simply realized how important iodine was and it was used widely for all sorts of conditions. Today - most doctors think iodine is poison. Meanwhile everyone is sick and we&#39;re making up new health problems every month.</p>

<p>Dr. Browstein deserves a nobel prize for his iodine work tbh...</p>

<p>Ok, you think you&#39;re not getting enough iodine. Take a few hundred micrograms, maybe even several hundred or a thousand microgams. 100 fucking milligrams? What fucking need is there for that shit? Animals don&#39;t consume that much, our paleo ancestors didn&#39;t, pretty much <strong>no</strong> humans get that much iodine. Living creatures don&#39;t need that much iodine.</p>

<p>More importantly, I2 is <strong>not</strong> a necessary nutrient, it&#39;s not found in nature in a stable form, and it&#39;s a potent oxidizing agent.</p>

<p>You can see <a href="http://iodine4health.com/ortho/debate_ortho.htm">at this link</a> how Brownstein and Abraham are creationists who ridicule evolution. I wonder how much this plays into their beliefs regarding iodine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, medicine back then simply realized how important iodine was and it was used widely for all sorts of conditions.</p>

<p>Like I said, they used radium too. Many people died painful deaths because of the ignorance of doctors.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Placebo maybe? I suspect a lot of people who buy into alternative medicine are highly susceptible to the placebo. This is not meant to be an insult, as I include myself in this group.</p>

<p>In fact, the iodine docs did a study on iodine for fibrocystic breast disease. It did no better than placebo, and the placebo effect was enormous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>typical herx reactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes you think it was a herxheimer reaction? Why would iodine cause a herx rxn? Is there any evidence that iodine is killing off large amounts of infectious organisms?</p>

<p>I suspect the side effects you experienced were caused by the iodine itself. You can now tolerate the large doses because perhaps your kidneys have increased iodine excretion, and your body is prepared for the pro-oxidant stress caused by I2. Ie, you&#39;ve developed tolerance to iodine.</p>

<p>For example, iodine allegedly &quot;chelates&quot; mercury. Never mind that iodine doesn&#39;t have the structure of a chelating agent. The iodine docs show that it increases urinary mercury excretion. One symptom commonly reported with high dose iodine is back pain.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s happening is that the high dose iodine is damaging the kidneys, and this leads tubular epithelial cells to die and drain into the urine. The kidneys store mercury to keep it away from sensitive organs, so that may be why mercury excretion goes up. Iodine is killing the kidney and dead cells carry mercury into the urine.</p>

<p>fine, obviously you can overdose on almost anything but my point is that you&#39;re judging dosage based on FDA&#39;s requirements which are WAAY to low. You can easily take 100x times that every day for the rest of your life and you will be fine. Sick people will probably need more. I&#39;m sick thus I&#39;m taking more</p>

<p>Forget the number that is given by the government. 125 mcg is simply too little. The real dosage might as well be 10-20mg or more. 100 mg doesn&#39;t sound that much anymore does it?</p>

<p>Even in the 1960&#39;s bread was loaded with iodine. One slice of bread contained something like 150 mcg. People were consuming iodine in MILLIGRAMS which is 10x the current recommended dosage... populations near the coasts like Japan, consume tons of iodine because seaweed and other seafoods are loaded with iodine!</p>

<p>Any previous humans who lived near the coasts were consuming lots and lots of iodine. </p>

<p>so nothing to do with big pharma pushing THEIR products when iodine could have done its job just as well?</p>

<p>how is iodine related to alternative medicine? I haven&#39;t mentioned anything such. I started the discussion by pointing out that there is no reason to be paranoid about fluoride, bromide and all those other poisons they put in our food. Iodine will defend against that. As long as you&#39;re getting enough iodine, damage will be minimized.</p>

<p>About the breast cancer...</p>

<p>breasts need iodine. So does prostate. Both in large amounts. Do you know what are the <strong>two most popular cancers</strong> in the US are? Yes. severe iodine deficiency would make you more susceptible to cancer. Even if you don&#39;t believe that, think about this: what happens in an iodine deficient state? Hypothyroidism or low thyroid function. Infection of any sort, happens primarily in a low thyroid function. The insane part is when people with some sort of infection(candida for example, very popular and rising) frequently(not always, diet still matters to some extent) comes with a hypothyroidism diagnosis. Those poor souls are being told by their doctor that an infection(candida) is causing low thyroid when it&#39;s the other way around!!! I&#39;m explaining this because cancer is not far from the infection.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>??? Did you just google herxheimer reaction? Iodine has some antibiotic properties but that&#39;s nothing to do with that.
A release of toxins being pushed out by iodine is what&#39;s causing this.</p>

<p>it&#39;s not damaging anything... as I explained above - people used to consume way more iodine that currently today and no one was dying from kidney damage. Google &quot;evolution iodine&quot;. </p>

<p>You can easily take 100x times that every day for the rest of your life and you will be fine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on what evidence? Some isolated populations that have been exposed to large doses of iodine for millenia can tolerate large doses. Note that &quot;large&quot; here means a few milligrams, not 100mg. These groups are likely adapted to these doses. That doesn&#39;t mean other people need, or can even tolerate, high doses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One slice of bread contained something like 150 mcg.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so people were getting 500-1000mcg/day? That&#39;s not comparable to 100mg. A few mg of sodium is ok, 100mg is pretty much going to guarantee problems in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>?!?!!?!? You are insane? Iodine is one of the most basic antioxidants there is...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think you know the difference between I2 and I-. I2 is <strong>not</strong> an antioxidant. Iodoral contains I2. I2 is a highly reactive molecule - that&#39;s why it&#39;s not found in nature. It is a potent oxidizing agent. You can easily google this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how is iodine related to alternative medicine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You believe in 100mg iodine doses, and that bromide and fluoride need to be defended against. These are alternative medicine beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>breasts need iodine. So does prostate. Both in large amounts. Do you know what are the two most popular cancers in the US are? Yes. severe iodine deficiency would make you more susceptible to cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That may be. 1mg should be more than enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hypothyroidism or low thyroid function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If low iodine is causing hypothyroidism, then 1mg should be more than enough to fix the deficiency. Too much iodine is associated with higher rates of hypothyroidism in multiple epidemiological analyses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>??? Did you just google herxheimer reaction? Iodine has some antibiotic properties but that&#39;s nothing to do with that. A release of toxins being pushed out by iodine is what&#39;s causing this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you just read about it on curezone? I learned about it in medical school.</p>

<p>That <strong>is</strong> what the herxheimer reaction is. It was described when patients receiving antibiotics experienced a sudden reaction. A large number of bacteria die off simultaneously and release toxins, which causes a reaction.</p>

<p>Alternative medicine sites have latched on to this and use &quot;herx&quot;, &quot;die off&quot;, and &quot;detox&quot; as an explanation for the side effects of harmful treatments.</p>

<p>What &quot;toxins&quot; does iodine &quot;push out&quot;?  Where are these toxins stored?</p>

<p>If you say bromide, there&#39;s no evidence for that. The iodine docs keep saying that bromide is stored in various locations, but none of the studies they provide support that assertion. In fact, the research that is often cited shows that <em>there is no stored pool of bromide in the body</em>. Iodine may increase urinary excretion of bromide, but it&#39;s not pushing stored bromide into the circulation so this shouldn&#39;t cause &quot;detox&quot; side effects. There&#39;s also no reason to believe that bromide is such a harmful things. We evolved with bromide just as we evolved with iodide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>not allegedly. It does. Read the graphs from that scribd document. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went through Brownstein&#39;s work a few years ago. He showed that iodine increases urinary mercury. That is perfectly consistent with my explanation above. If there&#39;s more data, ie showing that it reduces serum mercury in the long term, then please link me. I don&#39;t see the scribd document.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that 100mg should be the daily dosage for everyone. It&#39;s very likely much lower but still in milligrams.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just bread. Iodine was in much higher quantities in many foods. Too bad it was replaced by some other crap due to phobia or just plain ignorance.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s IODINE. Iodoral also contains iodide. Your body needs both forms. If it doesn&#39;t occur in nature, then how are thyroid hormones made?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You believe in 100mg iodine doses, and that bromide and fluoride need to be defended against. These are alternative medicine beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s my personal and temporary dosage while the toxins are still being pulled out. And it&#39;s not just bromide and fluoride which are not needed in that quantities for our bodies - iodine is also able to remove mercury, lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That may be. 1mg should be more than enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably not, but even then, &gt; 90% of population does not reach those amounts. Year by year, the deficiency worsens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If low iodine is causing hypothyroidism, then 1mg should be more than enough to fix the deficiency. Too much iodine is associated with higher rates of hypothyroidism in multiple epidemiological analyses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too much iodine is associated with higher TSH, which is temporary. Even a temporary hypothyroidism is just that - temporary.</p>

<p>If 1 mg is the recommended daily amount, then taking that much won&#39;t fix the deficiency. You need much more at first to make up for all those years where your body was starving for iodine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is what the herxheimer reaction is. It was described when patients receiving antibiotics experienced a sudden reaction. A large number of bacteria die off simultaneously and release toxins, which causes a reaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept is the same - you will feel worse before you will feel better. Why wouldn&#39;t you want to release toxins?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>increasing urinary mercury would by default decrease serum mercury...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have a link showing that we evolved with 100mg iodine, then I&#39;ll look at it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>forget about 100mg.. that&#39;s just temporary until I fix this deficiency. Even if I start taking 10mg(which should be the normal dose), I would never reach sufficiency due to me being years and years deficient in it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The body doesn&#39;t need both forms. It only needs iodide.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase that is used to incorporates iodide into the organic precursor of thyroxine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Too much iodine is associated with higher TSH, which is temporary. Even a temporary hypothyroidism is just that - temporary.</p>

<p>In epidemiological studies it is associated with the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. TSH is not routinely screened by doctors, so there&#39;s no reason to think these diagnoses are just a result of transient elevations in TSH.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept is the same - you will feel worse before you will feel better. Why wouldn&#39;t you want to release toxins?</p>

<p>What makes you think that iodine significantly reduces your toxin burden? The iodine docs have never shown a persistent drop in serum levels of various toxins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>increasing urinary mercury would by default decrease serum mercury...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read my explanation again. If the mercury is coming from kidney stores, then this will have no impact on serum levels. It also comes at the cost of potential kidney damage. (back pain is a common symptom with high dose iodine)</p>

<p>On the topic of iodine as a chelator, IIRC brownstein showed a chart of <em>one patient&#39;s</em> (is that all the data he has?) urinary mercury, which barely doubled. Real chelators like EDTA should increase urinary excretion 10-20X. It doesn&#39;t do much good to simply double the excretion rate. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This also doesn&#39;t make sense. Total body iodine is in the range of 10-30mg.</p>

<p>You&#39;re using toxins too generally here. Humifulvate can remove organic toxins. Chelators can only remove metals. MCP is <strong>not</strong> a better chelator than EDTA.</p>

<p>Humifulvate can remove heavy metals. MCP is great and the reason it&#39;s better is that it&#39;s much gentler.

<p>... biggest mistake ever. Both things. Veganism might be even worse than taking synthetic T4 which is just ONE of the thyroid hormones. Why not take raw thyroid? Why not try taking iodine?

<p>not the only link, but since iodine anti-cancer and we&#39;re getting more cancer and less iodine these days, then why not?</p>

<p>Your synthroid experience will give you cancer. Oh and if you&#39;re loaded with heavy metals, then you&#39;re fighting a losing battle. AND - boosting your thyroid in such ways DEPLETES IODINE. You will need to up and up your synthyroid dosage without knowing why because medicine doesn&#39;t understand this. Read that post above about infection and thyroid status. You&#39;re in stage one. Cancer ALWAYS ALWAYS occurs in a low thyroid stage. Most women with breast cancer had been diagnosed with hypo before and of course they&#39;re taking thyroid hormones now...</p>

<p>Iodine isn&#39;t medicine... that&#39;s the point. It&#39;s a CRITICAL element for all life forms and we&#39;re all deficient in it! Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is sodium. It&#39;s possible to have so much of a good thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Salt is all we have left at this point and now they&#39;re warning us that salt raises blood pressure so we should stay away from it... Without iodine, there is no life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, you think you&#39;re not getting enough iodine. Take a few hundred micrograms, maybe even several hundred or a thousand microgams. 100 fucking milligrams? What fucking need is there for that shit? Animals don&#39;t consume that much, our paleo ancestors didn&#39;t, pretty much <strong>no</strong> humans get that much iodine. Living creatures don&#39;t need that much iodine.</p>

<p>More importantly, I2 is <strong>not</strong> a necessary nutrient, it&#39;s not found in nature in a stable form, and it&#39;s a potent oxidizing agent.</p>

<p>You can see <a href="http://iodine4health.com/ortho/debate_ortho.htm">at this link</a> how Brownstein and Abraham are creationists who ridicule evolution. I wonder how much this plays into their beliefs regarding iodine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, medicine back then simply realized how important iodine was and it was used widely for all sorts of conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, they used radium too. Many people died painful deaths because of the ignorance of doctors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel good though?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Placebo maybe? I suspect a lot of people who buy into alternative medicine are highly susceptible to the placebo. This is not meant to be an insult, as I include myself in this group.</p>

<p>In fact, the iodine docs did a study on iodine for fibrocystic breast disease. It did no better than placebo, and the placebo effect was enormous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>typical herx reactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes you think it was a herxheimer reaction? Why would iodine cause a herx rxn? Is there any evidence that iodine is killing off large amounts of infectious organisms?</p>

<p>I suspect the side effects you experienced were caused by the iodine itself. You can now tolerate the large doses because perhaps your kidneys have increased iodine excretion, and your body is prepared for the pro-oxidant stress caused by I2. Ie, you&#39;ve developed tolerance to iodine.</p>

<p>For example, iodine allegedly &quot;chelates&quot; mercury. Never mind that iodine doesn&#39;t have the structure of a chelating agent. The iodine docs show that it increases urinary mercury excretion. One symptom commonly reported with high dose iodine is back pain.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s happening is that the high dose iodine is damaging the kidneys, and this leads tubular epithelial cells to die and drain into the urine. The kidneys store mercury to keep it away from sensitive organs, so that may be why mercury excretion goes up. Iodine is killing the kidney and dead cells carry mercury into the urine.</p>
