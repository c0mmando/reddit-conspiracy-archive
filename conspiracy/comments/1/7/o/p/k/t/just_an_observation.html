        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is the only sub i&#39;ve ever been on where people will literally come here to insult people and bash everything that is said.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only been here, what, 10 days, 2 weeks maybe? Yet it&#39;s just astounding to me. A great comparison would be places like r/atheism and r/christianity - as far as i know, nobody goes between those subs purely trying to insult and discredit people for the sake of it. All of the posts i&#39;ve seen on r/atheism by Christians/other religious people, have been constructive and have asked genuine questions, or put across different views in a respectful manner - you know, like a discussion? Here, it&#39;s petty insults.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t go over to r/chistianity and start trying to tell everyone they&#39;re crazy and stupid, even though i don&#39;t necessarily agree with their views - why does it happen here? I mean you&#39;d have to feel pretty emotionally threatened to feel the need to do that, imo. People have different opinions on subjects throughout the world, and most mature people will either move on and ignore it, or have a civil discussion about a subject.</p>

<p>And i don&#39;t buy the whole &#39;shill&#39; thing - i genuinely don&#39;t think the government has any interest in what the comments section of a thread on reddit looks like.</p>

<p>Thoughts on this? Just trying to understand what must drive people to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - This is probably long dead, but it really hit home for me after posting in that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/17n3na/we_learned_from_the_best/">&quot;We learned from the best&quot;</a> thread. How on earth do people get downvoted to oblivion for saying 9/11 was a setup on the fucking conspiracy sub? It&#39;s like going over to r/aww and having the piss beat out of you for posting a cat with a tie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Read me</strong> if you feel the same way as OP please read. </p>

<p>A lot of the grief comes from the outrageous claims that can be made as a conspiracy. Sometimes these can be humorous, I believe in UFO&#39;s for example - but someone who hasn&#39;t researched it might find it funny and I would too - it&#39;s just the nature of it.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m sure we have some tin foil nut jobs in here. But as a collective most of the material and discussion posted here <strong>is on the basis that everyone&#39;s done some kind of research</strong> into the matters. That&#39;s normal, if I go to <a href="/r/buildapc">/r/buildapc</a> I&#39;d assume people know what intel are and AMD. Likewise if I post here about 9-11 I&#39;d assume people are aware of its controversy. </p>

<p>So the reason we get trolls and insults is because our claims are rightly humorous to someone who hasn&#39;t looked into it (or at least seen our case for it). But we shouldn&#39;t need to vet and source every single thing every time because that&#39;s time consuming and as I said before, a hardware subreddit don&#39;t clarify what they mean by &#39;hard drives&#39; in ever post.</p>

<p>So how can we tackle this? A while a go I set up <a href="/r/Vetting">/r/Vetting</a> and the idea was that if someone had a thread about 9-11 in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> then they&#39;d inevitably come up against debate and maybe even flames/trolling. And this would happen for every post. But if one person made one post on <a href="/r/Vetting">/r/Vetting</a> then <em>both sides</em> would have to post sources and discuss their points. Then everytime 9-11 was referenced in a new <a href="/r/conpsiracy">/r/conpsiracy</a> thread, users could simply reference the r/Vetting thread.</p>

<p>It will stop us having to go over things over and over, hopefully clean up the subreddit a bit and should deter trolls. If we want to be taken seriously, we should put up a serious effort. </p>

<p>Just to re-iterate, I&#39;m not saying how this subreddit should be used, but I believe people should be able to speak their mind and engage in discussion as per the sidebar. If people want to make threads on r/Vetting to back their claims up or redirect people looking for sources - all the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The human psyche is very <a href="http://youtu.be/xSkkLChJMrw">vulnerable to manipulation</a>, which manifests as cognitive dissonance. Go tell a patriotic military member they have blood on their hands, or go tell a bible thumping &quot;believer&quot; that religion flies planes into buildings. I have done both and you will get snarled at for offering to unlock their cage.</p>

<p>Author and de-programmer Fritz Springmeier says that most people have built in &quot;slides&quot; that short circuit the mind&#39;s critical examination process when it comes to certain sensitive topics. &quot;Slides&quot;, Springmeier reports, is a CIA term for a conditioned type of response which dead ends a person&#39;s thinking and terminates debate or examination of the topic at hand. For example, the mention of the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; often solicits a slide response with many people.</p>

<p>What most people believe to be &quot;Public Opinion&quot; is in reality carefully crafted and scripted propaganda designed to elicit a desired behavioral response from the public. Public opinion polls are really taken with the intent of gauging the public&#39;s acceptance of the New World Order&#39;s planned programs. A strong showing in the polls tells them that the programming is &quot;taking&quot;, while a poor showing tells the NWO manipulators that they have to recast or &quot;tweak&quot; the programming until the desired response is achieved.

<p>I believe the majority of people of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and most critical thinkers have broken past this conditioned &quot;slider&quot; effect. </p>
