       This is the only sub i've ever been on where people will literally come here to insult people and bash everything that is said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only been here, what, 10 days, 2 weeks maybe? Yet it's just astounding to me. A great comparison would be places like r/atheism and r/christianity - as far as i know, nobody goes between those subs purely trying to insult and discredit people for the sake of it. All of the posts i've seen on r/atheism by Christians/other religious people, have been constructive and have asked genuine questions, or put across different views in a respectful manner - you know, like a discussion? Here, it's petty insults.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't go over to r/chistianity and start trying to tell everyone they're crazy and stupid, even though i don't necessarily agree with their views - why does it happen here? I mean you'd have to feel pretty emotionally threatened to feel the need to do that, imo. People have different opinions on subjects throughout the world, and most mature people will either move on and ignore it, or have a civil discussion about a subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i don't buy the whole 'shill' thing - i genuinely don't think the government has any interest in what the comments section of a thread on reddit looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts on this? Just trying to understand what must drive people to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       - This is probably long dead, but it really hit home for me after posting in that
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/17n3na/we_learned_from_the_best/">
        "We learned from the best"
       </a>
       thread. How on earth do people get downvoted to oblivion for saying 9/11 was a setup on the fucking conspiracy sub? It's like going over to r/aww and having the piss beat out of you for posting a cat with a tie.

       10k accounts, probably a fraction real users.  They literally create dozens of accounts daily - you can see them cropping up here fresh as a daisy posting anti-conspiracy rhetoric.

       They use the multiple accounts to downvote anything and everything that provokes any kind of analytical thinking.
      </p>

       Also they like to make imitation reddit names that closely resemble subscribers of r/conspiracy. I think there are a few in this very thread.

       Exactly.  What is so weird is they say that we invent these conspiracies to find comfort in a chaotic world, yet they don't even believe in them and they find them so disturbing that they devote huge amounts of their energy into trying to disprove them.

       The fact that there is a belief that comfort is to be found in the theories posted doesn't add up to me. How on earth does someone derive comfort from coming to a conclusion that what they thought they knew is not only untrue, but a fabrication. The last thing I get personally from realizing what I thought was true is in fact an orchestrated lie is comfort. I get just the opposite in fact.

       I couldn't agree more.  Realizing the truth of these conspiracies is very troubling, and to make it even more so is the fact that you have to wonder how most of the population can't or won't see them given how glaringly obvious some of them are, but instead choose to belittle or demonize people that question what they are told by official sources.

       Something can't simultaneously be a "fun thought experiment" and "quite easy"  (this doublethink, or inability to see  inherent contradictions is a defining characteristic of your ilk). You aren't disproving anything.  You are just a scared little delusional bitch, its really that simple.

       what group would be so emotionally threatened by this information getting out? the federal government and all the corrupt people who go along with it.

      <p>
       who has enough money in the budget to hire hundreds/thousands of people to go online and post comments all day in order to sway public opinion? Probably the DHS/TSA/FBI/CIA/NSA/etc.

       While I do believe the government pays people to comment on certain sites, that does not necessarily mean that this particular site is flooded with, or even has, shills. When someone posts something completely ignorant it should be downvoted and ignored, but claiming someone is a shill simply for asking a question or bringing up an argument should not be an acceptable response.

       <strong>
        Read me
       </strong>
       if you feel the same way as OP please read.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the grief comes from the outrageous claims that can be made as a conspiracy. Sometimes these can be humorous, I believe in UFO's for example - but someone who hasn't researched it might find it funny and I would too - it's just the nature of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm sure we have some tin foil nut jobs in here. But as a collective most of the material and discussion posted here
       <strong>
        is on the basis that everyone's done some kind of research
       </strong>
       into the matters. That's normal, if I go to
       <a href="/r/buildapc">
        /r/buildapc
       </a>
       I'd assume people know what intel are and AMD. Likewise if I post here about 9-11 I'd assume people are aware of its controversy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the reason we get trolls and insults is because our claims are rightly humorous to someone who hasn't looked into it (or at least seen our case for it). But we shouldn't need to vet and source every single thing every time because that's time consuming and as I said before, a hardware subreddit don't clarify what they mean by 'hard drives' in ever post.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how can we tackle this? A while a go I set up
       <a href="/r/Vetting">
        /r/Vetting
       </a>
       and the idea was that if someone had a thread about 9-11 in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       then they'd inevitably come up against debate and maybe even flames/trolling. And this would happen for every post. But if one person made one post on
       <a href="/r/Vetting">
        /r/Vetting
       </a>
       then
       <em>
        both sides
       </em>
       would have to post sources and discuss their points. Then everytime 9-11 was referenced in a new
       <a href="/r/conpsiracy">
        /r/conpsiracy
       </a>
       thread, users could simply reference the r/Vetting thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will stop us having to go over things over and over, hopefully clean up the subreddit a bit and should deter trolls. If we want to be taken seriously, we should put up a serious effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to re-iterate, I'm not saying how this subreddit should be used, but I believe people should be able to speak their mind and engage in discussion as per the sidebar. If people want to make threads on r/Vetting to back their claims up or redirect people looking for sources - all the better.

       Author and de-programmer Fritz Springmeier says that most people have built in "slides" that short circuit the mind's critical examination process when it comes to certain sensitive topics. "Slides", Springmeier reports, is a CIA term for a conditioned type of response which dead ends a person's thinking and terminates debate or examination of the topic at hand. For example, the mention of the word "conspiracy" often solicits a slide response with many people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What most people believe to be "Public Opinion" is in reality carefully crafted and scripted propaganda designed to elicit a desired behavioral response from the public. Public opinion polls are really taken with the intent of gauging the public's acceptance of the New World Order's planned programs. A strong showing in the polls tells them that the programming is "taking", while a poor showing tells the NWO manipulators that they have to recast or "tweak" the programming until the desired response is achieved.

       Angry, scared people who refuse to admit there is anything outside of their own worldview come here to disrupt discussions and troll on a regular basis. Yes some wild claims are made here and yes some of the posts cannot be taken seriously but some of the information is well researched and basis for solid debate. It is the same with any serious topic that you can debate on the internet, look up anything and you will find half the information is misleading, it is our job to sift through it all to find the small portions of truth hidden within.

       This sub not only represents a lot of truth, but represents an aspect of the truth that we are told that is real, extremely powerful, and
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       nefarious.  That power and influence works hard at making sure that the masses remain confused and at odds, and a lot of agents are sent here to disrupt those that start getting too close to the truth.

       I don't know, man. Certainly plenty of nutty shit gets posted here, but some good alternative news does as well. What's more, because the spectrum is as you say, impossibly broad, we're actually less susceptible to the type of groupthink you see in places like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . People here will call eachother out far more regularly than they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do have some valid points, but I'd stop short of saying nothing of substance is discussed here.

       I agree to a certain extent, there is a lot of bullshit here. Half of the problem is even naming this sub 'conspiracy', because as the media has shown, we all get thrown under the same umbrella, whether we believe in alien reptile overlords or not.

       Still, I haven't seen an example of a sub that is filled with so many childish attacks as this one.

       Yes but his argument to the multiple shooters is that multiple officers were all talking about the same person, even though there were two apprehended at the side of the school, and there was a van with a busted window that escaped the scene. He simply hasn't taken the time to review the police scanner audio.

       JIDF is a real thing. I don't think it's necessary to call someone a racist sack of shit to say that a sub dedicated to attacking a sub that
       <em>
        sometimes
       </em>
       attacks Israeli/Jewish interests (and
       <em>
        often
       </em>
       attacks Zionist interests) is subject to Jewish (JIDF) influence.

       I wonder how many of these conspiritards know that Zionism has been a cancer in every country where the Talmud's teachings have been put into practice? The Balfour Declaration illustrates the flaccid state of "Great Britain" capitulating to a criminal, bankster kingpin.

       It proves we (the 99%) are all cattle on various tax farms; however, more importantly, it squelches the debate surrounding this fact by the reactionary screams of "anti-semite" against us "gentiles &amp; goys".

       Calm down big man. I didn't say they didn't exist, I was making the point that they probably have better things to do than type "lol retard" in reddit threads. If they're gonna spend their time spreading propaganda, they're gonna do it better than that.
