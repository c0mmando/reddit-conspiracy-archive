    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a 401k. I don&#39;t really have any savings.
 The coming catastrophe will probably not effect me. I don&#39;t live anywhere near a large metropolis. Also, I would love to see somebody come and disarm my part of Alabama... Lolz. 
The fact that I can see the fraud everyday is overshadowed by the fact that I can do nothing about it. I could come out and tell everybody about it all the time when I see it, but nobody would believe me. Most likely, people would start trying to avoid me. 
I love how people think that the &quot;coming catastrophe&quot; isn&#39;t already happening. Genocide goes on everyday in this country (and others). Flouride in the water. Prescription drugs that have worse side effects than the ailments they are prescribed for. Cigarettes. A million different kinds of poison that we buy and consume. They don&#39;t need to shoot us to kill us. They are already feeding us the poisons to kill us. They need to take our guns away so that we won&#39;t have them when we realize that they have been poisoning us for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your understanding of history is off a bit. Colonial script was a fiat currency, and the notes were by definition bills of credit.</p>

<p>The colonists were not happy. Trading between colonies was a mess because each had their own (multiple) systems.  There was a trade deficit between the colonies and england.  But the trade was still happening so the bank of england was happy.  All they want is volume, typically they don&#39;t care who wins or loses.  When the bank does want to pick winners that may be an instance of fraud but individual people who act on a fraudulent basis do not make the system fraudulent.  Their fraud is one of the flaws of the system.  Metallic debasing was fraud, and that was aflaw of a gold based economy. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t the bank of england that was upset, it was the british merchants, who were getting screwed because the colonies were using an inflationary fiat system to counter the trade imbalance.</p>

<p>The colonies did in fact fight the war in part to gain control of their currency, and rightly so, but not for the reasons or the outcome you describe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/86174715/The-Most-Dangerous-Superstition-by-Larken-Rose">The Most Dangerous Superstition</a></p>

<p>First, I&#39;m not trying to contradict anything you&#39;re saying. This is just super-related to something I was reading last night. What you say is true, but Larken Rose argues that this is even more true for government. And government is what forces us to participate in these kinds of things against our will. Think about this. We give the right to forcibly control people through threats of violence to our &quot;government&quot; that &quot;represents us&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To wit, if human beings are so careless, stupid, and/or malicious that they cannot be trusted to do the right thing on their own, how is it that the situation would be improved by taking a
subset of those very same careless, stupid and/or malicious human beings and giving them societal permission to forcibly control all the others? Why would anyone think that rearranging and reorganizing a group of dangerous beasts would make them civilized? The answer hints at the mythological nature of the belief in &quot;authority.&quot; It is not merely a different arrangement of human beings that authoritarians seek, but the involvement of some superhuman entity, with rights that human beings do not have, and with virtues that human beings do not have,which can be used to keep all the untrustworthy humans in line. </p>

<p>To say that human beings are so flawed that they need to be controlled—a common refrain among statists—implies that something other than human beings needs to do the controlling. But no matter how hard you study &quot;government,&quot; you will find that it is always run entirely by people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, my point is that I don&#39;t care if the &quot;system&quot; is flawed until it it threatens me into participating in it. So many of the things that people think are wrong with &quot;society&quot; are really just symptoms of government.</p>

<p>He&#39;s attacking a strawman, stating that anyone who believes in authority must automatically believe in despotism. Government is not necessarily designed to &quot;initiate violence and extortion against innocent people&quot; as you stated elsewhere.</p>

<p>The US government was designed in the spirit of what John Locke had in mind.  He was very much a classical liberal, if not <em>the</em> classical liberal, and he wisely conceded that <em>some</em> government was an improvement over pure natural law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not saying that statists believe in despotism, but that they unwittingly support it and are partially responsible for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As soon as you accept the premise of government and authority and a ruling class, the only thing keeping it &quot;limited&quot; is the conscience of the master. Like if you’re a slave, and you say, “I accept that I’m your slave, master, I belong to you, but please be nice to me.” Well, maybe he will and maybe he won’t -- but it&#39;s not up to YOU any more. And that’s the problem with “limited government”: As soon as it’s government, it’s the master.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether an &quot;authority&quot; is seen as absolute or as having conditions or limits upon it may have a bearing on how much damage that&quot;authority&quot; does, but it has no bearing on whether the underlying concept is rational. The United States Constitution, for example, is imagined to have created a very limited &quot;authority,&quot; the right of which to rule was, in theory, severely restricted. Nonetheless, the Constitution still sought to create an &quot;authority,&quot; with the right to do things, such as &quot;tax&quot; and &quot;regulate,&quot; which the average citizen has no right to do on his own. Even though the Constitution pretended to give the right to rule only over certain specific matters, it still claimed to bestow a certain amount of &quot;authority&quot; upon a ruling class, and as such, is just as much a target of the following criticism of &quot;authority&quot; as the &quot;authority&quot; of a supreme dictator would be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It should also be mentioned that some have claimed (including Thomas Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence) that it is possible, and desirable, to have a&quot;government&quot; which does nothing except protect the rights of individuals. But an organization which did only that would not be &quot;government.&quot; Every individual has the right to defend himself (and others) against attackers. To exercise that right, even through a very organized, large-scale operation, would not be &quot;government&quot; anymore than organized, large-scale food production automatically constitutes &quot;govern-ment.&quot; Exercising the right of self-defense (individually or collectively) does not, by itself, constitute &quot;government,&quot; as it does not require the right to rule. For something to be &quot;government,&quot; it must, by definition, do something other than what average people have the right to do. A &quot;government&quot; with the same rights as everyone elseis not a &quot;government&quot; any more than the average man on the street is &quot;government.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the <strong>whole point</strong> of government, especially as described by the US constitution.  Cordoning off a space where government shoudn&#39;t go, establishing justice, promoting the general welfare, etc. I can&#39;t be expected to arrest, adjudicate, and incarcerate people who violate the law, or the natural law on my own (unless every crime is a capital crime - see sharia law).  The power is conceded to the government by the people, under a constitution that describes limitations to it&#39;s power, to prevent the situations you&#39;re talking about.  No, it&#39;s not perfect.  If you think some anarcho-capitalist society is an improvement, then drive on your own roads.</p>

<p>Right, that means <em>our</em> society is shit. It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;society doesn&#39;t make sense&quot;. Saying &quot;society doesn&#39;t make sense&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So hollywood people are jewish and have intolerant views but you then say hollywood people were dragged over the coals for not wanting to conform to these intolerant views? The very same people who have them?</p>

<p>Indeed it was about conformity but McCarthy did believe in a fifth column operating in America and his obsession with communist agents was very real. </p>

<p>One of my heros Pete Seeger was brought before the trial, you should check out his response to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now I&#39;m waiting for my copy of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/86174715/The-Most-Dangerous-Superstition-by-Larken-Rose">The Most Dangerous Superstition</a> to come in the mail. You can read the first fifty something pages there. He makes a pretty strong case that <del>the government</del> the belief in legitimate &quot;government&quot; authority is the cause of almost everything that is wrong with &quot;society&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The belief in &quot;authority&quot; (which includes all belief in &quot;government&quot;) is irrational and self-contradictory, it is contrary to humanity and morality, and constitutes the most dangerous, destructive superstition that has ever existed. Rather than being a force for order and justice, the belief in&quot;authority&quot;is the arch-enemy of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically his point is not that the state has lost it&#39;s mind, but that it is doing a great job of doing exactly what it was designed to do (which is to initiate violence and extortion against innocent people).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s all congratulate ourselves on how we can see what the sheeple can&#39;t.  Give me a break, McCarthy&#39;s desperate search for fifth columners has resurfaced in the hunt for hollywood zionists by conspiritards.  The rest of us stopped believing in the boogeyman.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Government is society&#39;s attempt at making sense (order) of things.
There is no perfect sense to be made, therefore</p>

<p>...people have difficulty understanding why an entity with the right to forcibly control everyone and legislate morality will inevitably lead to more violence and injustice...</p>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the way a society governs itself will always be somewhat flawed.</p>

<p>...therefore people should have not have respect for a system that dictates what is &quot;moral&quot; and backs it with threats of violence.</p>

<p>Look, just read The Most Dangerous Superstition.  He explains it better than me. If you have arguments, he always replies to comments on his youtube channel. Seriously just check it out... give it a shot. How could it possibly hurt?</p>
