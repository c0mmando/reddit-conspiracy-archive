       This "theory" has done more to damage our credibility in the eyes of the public than anything I can think of in the post-9/11 America era.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my job were to manage the public perceptions of the American people, and I had a particularly unruly crowd that would not quit demanding answers, I would do everything in my power to discredit that movement, even going to such lengths as to help foster the notion of a conspiracy that would be so unpopular with the general public that it turned support away from their cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like heckling the father of a slain child may do more to ensure that gun rights disappear and that there is never any legitimate truth than anything else I've seen in a very long time (even worse than Alex Jones going Glen Beck stupid with Piers Morgan).

       i've felt the same about numerous instances in the media. Some are obviously conspiracies, such as the seattle anarchists. I mean really it's feds fishing for the right kinds of people that they can push and manipulate into whatever actions they want, and then they swoop in to say "hey we saved the day" without mentioning that it was them who were starting trouble in the first place. TDKR in colorado is one of the first that I think was meant to push for just gun legislation as opposed to patriot act powers.

       It could entirely be a multi-stage plot to push gun legislation, which clearly was the first thing that sprouted up. This has done a great job at pushing the sales of guns through the roofs and making bullets near impossible to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, dividing the populace. Gun control has always been a major debate, right up next to abortion. People either love guns, or hate guns, and there aren't many in-between. By separating the people and having them focus on smaller issues, it's easier to control them since they spend all their time fighting each other and not paying attention to the big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third motion would be to discredit conspiracy theorists, especially since 9/11 trials just started, there are numerous undeclared wars, the economy is going to hell, and anti-government sentiments have been running high, especially since OWS, and NDAA 2013 passed silently, without provisions to protect American citizens and indicates that protests are anti-American and terroristic in nature. But what is everyone talking about now...gun control, and anyone who doesn't believe Sandy Hook happened - and by extension anything reported on the mass media - must be insane and terrorists.

       Except that school shootings are a dime a dozen in the USA. When the smoke clears (so to speak) this will just be one of scores of shootings in recent years, albeit with more unanswered questions than most shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there have been enough school shootings in the USA (and there is a resonable expectation of them continuing) without the government needing to stage one to push gun reforms.

       Which is exactly what makes this one suspicious. A lot of people think Columbine was the first staged school shooting, but that involved a bunch of high schoolers. Actually, most school shootings involve teenagers, and while that is tragic, it doesn't have the national knee-jerk reaction that killing
       <em>
        poor, defenseless 6 and 7 year olds
       </em>
       does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at it, people were sad about Columbine, but they moved on. Then there was Santee, CA where 2 people died and 13 were injured at a
       <em>
        high school
       </em>
       and no one heard about it. 2005 10 people died and 5 were wounded at a
       <em>
        high school
       </em>
       in Minnesota, and again, not major news. Virginia Tech 2007, a bunch of
       <em>
        college students
       </em>
       die, it makes the news but not enough to spur much more than a whimper of gun control. 2008 in Illinois 6 people killed and 21 are wounded in a
       <em>
        college
       </em>
       , and it barely makes the news. But then, out of nowhere in 2012, the statistically highest death:wounded ratio that far surpasses any other school shooting just happens to occur where a bunch of
       <em>
        innocent, helpless kids were
       </em>
       , resulting in a massive gun control knee-jerk reaction where some legislations were passed within weeks of the tragedy happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there have been six incidents since, which resulted in 1 or 2 deaths at most, all occurring in colleges or high schools, and were minimally reported aside from the one in Houston.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the Sandy Hook incident - some kid that is essentially "invisible", had no trackable online presence yet spent most of his time on a computer, diagnosed with developmental disorders randomly kills a bunch of young kids and teachers for the first time in recent history, with incredible accuracy and no training, and no weapons of his own. Compare that to Virginia Tech, where a highly intelligent guy kills 30+ people and wounds 20+. That guy had a vast history that is well documented, including psychiatric evaluations, who legally purchased the weapons he used.

       I'm not sure what this guy's deal is. You belittle NoHero3s on the basis that he makes no sensible points. However you yourself fail to make any reasonable or noticeable points in your post.

       I, for one, thought that NoHero's points were satisfactory and in some cases he/she has brought to light some previously skimmed over information.

       If this kid spent most of his time on the interwebs atleast ONE of us would know SOMETHING about him. Instead, we're left with nothingness. It's as if someone didn't want us to know who Adam Lanza actually was.

       I'm sorry - I just have a little trouble understanding his usage of phrases like "1 stands above 30". These aren't ghost stories, it's very simple to discuss, yet he doesn't write clearly.

        Secondly, dividing the populace. Gun control has always been a major debate, right up next to abortion. People either love guns, or hate guns, and there aren't many in-between. By separating the people and having them focus on smaller issues, it's easier to control them since they spend all their time fighting each other and not paying attention to the big picture.

       This has been done for years, it's just one more thing to add to that list. Gay marriage, abortion, there's always going to be a bunch of people on each side who feel very strongly about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elections are yet another way of doing this - as if it matters who is in the White House. This serves two purposes: to again divide the population, and to give the people the feeling that they actually have the power to make a difference. Win/win.

       Your third point might have been an after-effect of this, concious or unconscious, but it's not like they really needed any more ammunition against us. From where i'm sitting, we don't pose much of a threat at all to the establishment as it stands. It's something to watch out for though - we all know how they like to take 'preventative' actions.

       The one thing I know is that we've been lied to constantly about this incident. All it takes is questioning the official narrative and you get labeled a conspiracy theoriss. Asking dirt simple questions makes people think you don't believe we landed on the moon and that you believe people get abducted by UFO's.

       Thank you. I've worked with the federal government and and am now working with a state departmental agency and they can't even scratch their asses without fucking something up. A multi-layered conspiracy to stage massacres and create martial law over ~400 million people is ludicrous.

       tl;dr Max Igan suggests Sandy Hook is a trap, that the 2nd amendment is the bait in order to draw people into conflict.

         23:10   "But I think it's incredibly important for the people of the United States -- the ones who are rushing out there and buying arms and getting ready for a big showdown -- I think it's very, very important for these people to understand that what the government wants here is conflict.  And the best thing that could happen for the government, at the moment, is for the people to make a stand against the government in an armed uprising.  It's absolutely what they want.

        <p>
         "I think if the guns are there and people will simply make a peaceful stand (sure, keep your gun at your side but don't point it at anybody) -- make a peaceful stand against the government, and let them know enough is enough, I think you still have the ability to change things.  But people have to keep it clearly in mind that the best thing they can do for the government at the moment is to start a civil war, because that's what the government wants.  That's what all this is about, folks.  It isn't just an attack against the 2nd Amendment.  The 2nd Amendment is the bait that they are using to create the conflict that they want, and they have set up for this conflict well in advance.  They have put all the FEMA camps in place, they've militarized the police over the last few years.  They've given them sound canons, and microwave canons, drones.  They've just supplied them with millions upon millions of hollow points, and they are ready.  And they are like the bully in the schoolyard that is taunting the population and simply itching for conflict.    Because once that conflict happens, they will crack down with such blinding force that if the people are not fully organized, then they will be crushed...

        <p>
         "What this mechanism is pushing for, folks, is conflict.  That's what this is all about.  That's what they want in the United States right now, is conflict.  So you must not give it to them.  You must draw up articles of impeachment, even if you have to impeach the entire executive branch.  You got to understand that there are domestic enemies that have taken over your country.

       Hypothetically: The people that would rise up are typically the same ones that question authority/ believe in the 'NWO', believe the constitution actually applies to them, and believe in sovereignty.

      <p>
       It is a great opportunity to paint people with these characteristics as the 'domestic enemy' and through guilt by association the others that are not armed and may have some of these traits can be marked as 'mentally ill'.

       I thought the same thing when I saw a news site with an article about the Parker family meeting the president, and pictures of Emilie and her sister wearing the same dress in two different pictures, all on the same page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who already thought that no children were killed that day, would notice right away that it was the same dress in both pictures, and come to the conclusion that it was also the same girl.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like the put both pictures on the same page on purpose so that someone would notice, and then create pictures and videos about the theory, even though it could be easily dismantled by someone who isn't looking for evidence supporting the theory. The point is to make conspiracy theorists look like they're sure about something, when really no one can be sure.

       And this is a classical example of confirmation bias. Taking separate bits information and putting it together to adjust to one's beliefs or suspicions. I know conspiracy theorists claim to be skeptical people, but skeptical people would never ever go for that conclusion from those photos without further info.

       And the whole thing about the "unruly crowd demanding answers"? The powers that be have effectively shrugged off the "unruly crowd" with little effort so why take all the time and trouble to stage something like this? Every harebrained conspiracy theory of the past decade--trutherism, birthergate--has had absolutely no effect on any election that I can see, so why bother?

       People confuse Sandy Hook was a "false flag" operation... but it was a "wag the dog" situation (never let a good crisis go to waste). The event happened, the news was distorted to push an anti-gun agenda.

       This is a thought I've had too. I think it was a hoax, and they know that a large percentage of people will never believe that it was. So it doesn't matter if anyone finds the truth, if it was a hoax.

       This is the point I like to make.  I don't care what people think really happened with 9/11 or Sandy Hook, but look at what those events led to.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 - "War on Terror" (Within 10 years crude oil becomes our biggest import, and Refined becomes our biggest export.) And let's not forget the Patriot Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook - Immediate strengthened gun regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet Kim Jong Un can sit around and tell us he's going to try and blow us to smithereens while performing terrible crimes against humanity.  But who gives a fuck?  There's no oil in North Korea.

       What's with pretending like there has been any legislation passed or it's actually a huge restriction on gun ownership, purchasing, or anything like that.

       i said this the other day. (no oil in north korea.) appearantly though, (i've never looked in to it too much) they have an army of over a million. and they have a military first policy. so it'd be tough to fuck with them.

       They put all of their money into their military.  They're ranked 24th in the world power rankings this year I believe, with something like 8+ million soldiers on reserve, so it is certainly tricky.

       No, the main stream media is simply getting desperate.  They are loosing power to the internet.  I suspect that the attack on "conspiracy theories" was either an afterthought, or simply a contingency part of the main plan (if it was planned).

       I've been saying this from the first hoax debunking I saw and subsequent news reports clarifying the early shitty reporting!

       Same goes for the equally easily debunkable 9/11 Truthers.

       I think there are too many 'reason deficient' people that equate the government using a crisis to manipulate the people into accepting their agenda, to the government creating a hoax.

       A lot of the 'facts' that get thrown around the 9/11 conspiracy [inside job] are flat out lies. 3 examples: No plane debris at Pentagon or United Airlines Flight 93, Bush's brother in charge of security of World Trade Center, No Steel structure ever collapsed from fire [not to mention that all the steel would have to completely 'melt' in order for the structure to be weakened]... all lies.

       of course a lot of "facts" get thrown around. what's wrong with you? it's bound to happen! it happens with everything. that doesn't mean other things arent true. and i've never heard of any of these things you speak of, so i'm not going to try and "debunk" you. however, weather what you say is true or not, good on you for going and checking the facts yourself. (at least that's what it seems like you did.)

       Yeah, but don't get me wrong - I KNOW they are using the incident as a crisis... and excuse to drive their political agenda. That's not a conspiracy though, it's an opportunity to propel their propaganda. Big difference.

       yeah. the way i see it, i will go on and tell people what i think the truth is. but i generally don't force something down peoples throats. (not that i never have.) but i think about it as religion in a way. cuz weather you believe it or not, you gotta admit, if it was proven true, and everyone could see it for their own eyes, there would still be those (especially seniors) who would still not believe it.

       So, I don't believe it was an "inside job." I believe it was a crisis that was used as an opportunity to greatly empower the Government above the Individual and to steadily erode our liberty.

       What is your theory on the fireproofing work done on the sections of the towers that were struck in the months before 9/11?  Do you think that the section of the Pentagon  containing the offices responsible for the investigation into the 9 trillion missing from the federal reserve (that rumsfield announced the day before) that was destroyed  was just a lucky coincidence?

       It's stating that exposure to conspiracy theories regardless of validity has a tangible effect on those being exposed. It doesn't really address or attack any theories.

       Furthermore, it is a Canadian article. Unless you are proposing that a Canadian article is trying to discredit a largely American theory by targeting Canadian readers it doesn't really apply.

       Is that really where it linked? Fucking weird, i had that sight saved for the reason of them attacking conspiracy theorist. I just looked at it again and that's not the article i saved. The article i saved and i was suppose to link was talking about how we are becoming "disillusioned." Thanks for pointing that out to me, I'm going to remove it and try to link the correct one.good day to ya.

       Max Igan did a thing along these lines. He suggests it is a trap, that the 2nd amendment is the bait in order to draw people into conflict, which is what the status quo thrives on.

       willy loman has referenced this, too. i fully entertain the notion that whether or not theorists are onto a state terror act, the media does seem to be attempting to motivate large numbers of people by showing the most absurd BS 'theories' they can find, and attacking the character and sanity of anyone who seems to stand on the wrong side of camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe an argument can be made that policy makers are attempting to turn historical skepticism into a communicable disease, as well. viewed as a whole, it is possible to make a case that certain authors, state figures (cass sunstein), media figures, bloggers, psychiatrists, and scientists are attempting to turn conspiracy theorizing into a clinical diagnosis, with popular acceptance of this new raceless, classless popular social and political marginalization.
      </p>
      <p>
       citing the above sources, people become acclimated to thinking conspiracy theorists need medication, jail, or worse authoritarian methods of censorship, and see no problem wishing for them to get hit by busses, fall down stairs, choke and die.
      </p>
      <p>
       i've read the comments. i'm sure you have, too. this rift is growing, and i believe will roughly form the populations of the 'sides' of what i see as a forthcoming civil conflict, when the real conflict should be between the mutually manipulated against the manipulating financial cartels that have our country's policies within their opaque influence.

       Yes.  Max Igan's analysis of the Sandy Hook psy-op is the best articulation I've seen of the impact and deliberate design of these calibrated steps being taken to shape public opinion and action.  His video, Project Sandy Hook Explained, is really a must watch.

       Synopsis from the book Going Postal.
      </p>
      <p>
       "An eye-opening look at the phenomenon of school and workplace shootings in America, Going Postal explores the rage-murder phenomenon that has plagued — and baffled — America for the last three decades, and offers some provocative answers to the oft-asked question, "Why?" By juxtaposing the historical place of rage in America with the social climate that has existed since the 1980s — when Reaganomics began to widen the gap between executive and average-worker earnings — the author crafts a convincing argument that these schoolyard and office massacres can be seen as modern-day slave rebellions. He presents many fascinating and unexpected cases in detail. Like slave rebellions, these massacres are doomed, gory, sometimes even inadvertently comic, and grossly misunderstood. Taking up where Bowling for Columbine left off, this book seeks to set these murders in their proper context and thereby reveal their meaning."

       Wanna hear something strange?  I saw a video once where someone mentioned to google for the terms "sandy hook ct mobiledevmag.com". Where you can find a Canadian newspaper's mobile page about the event, but the strange thing was that the article was dated
       <a href="http://mobiledevmag.com/wp-content/uploads/folder/sandy-hook-ct.html">
        September 04th, 2012 right on the top of page
       </a>
       .  The commentator was saying how this was proof that it was known before hand.  But then I decided to look around the site by going here
       <a href="http://mobiledevmag.com/wp-content/uploads/folder/">
        http://mobiledevmag.com/wp-content/uploads/folder/
       </a>
       and found the html file in question (sandy-hook-ct.html) along with it's related jpgs  (they all started with sandy-hook-ct
       <em>
        .
       </em>
       ) .  All of them were dated December 22nd, 2012.  If someone was going for obfuscation, this may be a way to do it.

       I like to think that once the world being round was a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, until things are proven true they are seen as conspiracy, and if they are EVER proven true the conspiracy theorists "got lucky" or get no credit at all for looking at things more critically. To not question what someone tells you doesn't make you better...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe all the ones I see out there, but when so many conspiracy theories have been proven correct through time I have to take a moment and look at information for myself. What people tell you and what is truth are frequently different, even if just ever so slightly. I wish that people would stop being so offended by curiosity and doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can disagree at any time! Opinions differ, it isn't a direct assault on you or your beliefs that I disagree. So when people are portrayed as nut jobs and tin foil hat crazies I feel truly disappointed. I would love to see a world where conspiracy theorists are respected when they were right and given the benefit of an open mind when either wrong or even just questioning. I would also love to see that go the other direction, conspiracy can be wrong and people who disagree with you should add to your understanding of an issue, even if it is just the understanding that there are differing opinions out there, rather than offending you.

       Sure.  There's s ton of this going on.  In my mind there are serious questions to ask about MK-ULTRA, assassinations of X, King and both Kennedys, and 9/11.  But fake Moon landing, chemtrails and this Sandy Hook bullshit lead the public to think all conspiracy theories are crazy.  It's done deliberately and it works very well.

       I think the media coverage of the day aided the 911 truth movement .people could go back and look through those footages, rewatch the interviews.  Now the trend is to black out the media,make them report for days although they saw nothing and were given absolutely no information.

       Judging on certain things I've read - I believe that it was staged in order to see exactly how, where, and why information disseminates. It's all about information travel, and how to bottleneck that and control it.

       No if anything this incident is gaining more traction than 911 or JFK.  And they hate it. The internet will be the next target before attempting gun control again. Once they silent the spread of information we will be left with state run media and it will be business as usual.  Discredit  and ridicule  then there is  saying im one of you on certain points is perfect cointelpro counter play and Agent provocateur bullshit.   They are  playing the game from all sides.

       They don't ever target only one single objective with every event they do. They work in parallel and make all their moves slowly, constant, and multi-directional. That's why no one ever agrees with what they were going for, because they create different points of view by pushing different stuff at once. The "mistakes" are also on purpose, carefully crafted. There is a need to feed everyone's mind with what they prefer, and having everyone disagreeing is always good for them, they'll simply continue doing what they want

       If we can deduce that at least one event was staged, faked - a complete hoax that manipulates the public's view on a particular situation then we have the utmost authority to question any official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course everybody will think of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. So, it's only fair, and right for us the people, to question everything that the government does and to know the truth, because if we know that we have been lied to before to go to war...then you can be damn sure we have been lied to about other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that Sandy hook has multiple levels of manipulation. Manipulation as everybody suspects to push gun control and at the same time, discredit conspiracy theorists or as I prefer to call us, truth seekers or realists for not falling into blind submission to the media and government. It doesn't end here though, as shootings arise, or are reported more often than before we will see a growing rise in gun sales (as we have already seen) and see more states go against the grain and fight against gun disarmament (like we have already seen) and what's the end goal? Civil war, or as close to it as possible. It's quite clear this is what is going to happen.

       This is the point I like to make.  I don't care what people think really happened with 9/11 or Sandy Hook, but look at what those events led to.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 - "War on Terror" (Within 10 years crude oil becomes our biggest import, and Refined becomes our biggest export.) And let's not forget the Patriot Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook - Immediate strengthened gun regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet Kim Jong Un can sit around and tell us he's going to try and blow us to smithereens while performing terrible crimes against humanity.  But who gives a fuck?  There's no oil in North Korea.
