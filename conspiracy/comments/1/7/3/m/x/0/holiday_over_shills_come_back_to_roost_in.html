    <div class="md"><p>Well from my perspective, here is the low-down:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fragmentation - the site is being fragmented into endless sub-reddits that are ever increasingly specific.  This means every user must &#39;like&#39; the subreddits they are interested in...clever right?  This has a very specific purpose - reddit makes next to no money from advertising.  How does it survive? It&#39;s a data miners goldmine...the demographic here is the type that never/rarely clicks on ads, so instead we are mined on the back channel where the information is sold (it&#39;s a private company so we cannot view financials to verify).  Remember, this is no charity.</p></li>
<li><p>Popular culture is &#39;formed&#39; here.  Front page has become a mindless array of &#39;candy&#39; for the alpha state mind, a perfect replacement for tv &#39;programming&#39;.  You have no more choice than you do on television unless you cull the noise.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaming is also standard procedure; almost every AMAs is just a commercial wrapped up as interactive chat - just don&#39;t be overt.  Companies have armies of social engineers posting their products as a backdrop to some funny story.  The military industrial complex is dumping war porn to gullible blood lusting youths proliferating war into an almost expectedly endless state..</p></li>
<li><p>Any real discussion is bad for business, so it&#39;s eradicated quickly via standard operation procedures, forum sliding, topic dilution, circle jerk humor, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Welcome to reddit, you are the <em>product and consumer</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is some confusion will the words shill and troll. It&#39;s actually a lot of trolls calling people shills because they want to reinforce the idea that everyone here responds to a critical comment with the word shill which doesn&#39;t really happen. The influx of trolls has been recognised and its either a bit of fun for them or more nefarious. That along with it being posted to SRD where people equate comments here made by blocks of accounts (or people) to everybody in the entire sub-Reddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be like me saying everyone who posts in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is an Obama supporter when that simply isn&#39;t true nor is it displayed in a quantifiable way. Again, other people have  noticed the influx of trolls that have been intentionally spamming Sandy Hook videos and making vile comments. Don&#39;t engage with trolls who use ad-hominem attacks and only respond to people who are displaying the intention to actually engage in a meaningful debate whether they agree with you or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Instead of open debate, any opposing view to the hive-mind gets you labeled as a shill and that&#39;s the end of discussion. You can&#39;t ever have a civil discussion with them because they&#39;ll always just spout back with <em>&quot;that&#39;s just what a shill would say!&quot;</em> It&#39;d be funny if it weren&#39;t so sad. </p>

<p>That&#39;s your opinion.  Maybe someone called you out as a shill because you used dishonest arguments and appeared to employ standard shill derailing tactics.</p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t get paid for it doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t many others (and their sockpuppet armies) that do.   These days it&#39;s very obvious given the attention that the Sandy Hoax Narrative is getting here and elsewhere.   </p>

<p>bullshit. unprovable. </p>

<p>if you lack the imagination to understand how intelligence services would value data trees and &#39;alternative info&#39; networks, not to mention the value in gatekeeping and forum sliding, that&#39;s not my problem. if you fail to consider how many members of conspiracy forums are also members of militia or activist groups, i can&#39;t help you. lastly, if you can&#39;t understand how forum manipulation isn&#39;t about outright battling people, but is rather about misleading heroes and confusing fence-sitters, then you shouldn&#39;t be voicing unenlightened beliefs about intelligence values, tactics and priorities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are attempting to apologize for those sellouts that go so above the call of sellout duty as to be a shill, then that is extremely disingenuous.  To rationalize shilldom by saying &quot;Well, we&#39;re <em>all</em> sellouts, so it&#39;s okay!&quot; completely misses that gradient whereby some (e.g. shills) push their sellout status <em>so</em> hard as to directly attack anyone that goes against a societal narrative that (sometimes subtly, sometimes not so subtly) pushes us toward compliance, stupidity, and slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not condoning the shills or any of the false images used to sell the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  Well it certainly seemed like it when you began your previous response with &quot;The world is run on shills&quot; and went on to explain how practically everything in life has to do with &quot;selling and being sold&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And maybe i did sellout, but it was literally that pr job or the street.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say you&#39;re a sellout JUST because you accept a PR job.  You can do that PR job, but still at least understand what it is and who and what <em>you</em> are independent of it.  You can still do the PR job to pay rent, but all the while be diligently fighting the system as much as possible otherwise.  I realize it&#39;s a very slippery slope, and it would simply be better to NOT be in the PR job, but I also realize the practicality of certain things.  To realize that practicality, however, is not necessarily to condone it or relish in it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i took the street after half a year witnessing too much that I couldn&#39;t live with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an expected reaction from anyone with a general amount of decency in their system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just don&#39;t see why anyone would be surprised to find shills in our open discussions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, we must realize and acknowledge the different gradients of &quot;shilldom&quot; within discussions.  There is the person that on one hand A) is not afraid to voice the difficulties and practicalities involved in &quot;bucking the system&quot;, and then there is on the other end of the spectrum B) the person who actively PROTECTS that deceitful system.  There&#39;s a big difference between the two, and many of the shills that are found in these open discussions are more of the B category than the A category.  Those kinds of shills are NOT necessary, and <em>should</em> be fought against.  Those kinds of shills SHOULDN&#39;T necessarily be expected to be part of our open discussions, and when they are found here, they should be aggressively rooted out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its not largely different than advertisements or lobbyists in Washington.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  And a lot of those motherfuckers should be given the same treatment as I advocate the B category shills here should be given.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that they are there and I believe it&#39;s for money, but I don&#39;t agree with it or defend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say that part of it is definitely for money - yes - but another, deeper, part (whether any low level shills know this or not) has to do with protecting an inherently self-defeating system (which the one we live in most definitely is).  Fighting against even these low level shills in part is a statement and a gesture against that deep seeded corruption that exists on this planet and that corrodes so many other aspects of this civilization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s deplorable, what they are doing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not disagree with this.</p>
