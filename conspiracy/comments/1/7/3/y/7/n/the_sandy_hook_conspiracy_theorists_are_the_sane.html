        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What I believe doesn&#39;t matter - but Gun Control does. Whether you are pro gun-control or anti gun-control you should, by now, be sick of the government taking away our freedoms and starting wars through fear and intimidation. </p>

<p>911 was a freedom-taking jamboree.. while we were in an emotionally crippled state, the government passed all kinds of laws (like the Patriot Act for instance) and went to war with Afghanistan and then proceeded to scare us into a war with Iraq - for no good reason as far as I can see. </p>

<p>Then we had the economic crash of 2008, and immediately after that massive blow we were scared into giving the banks nearly a trillion dollars, so that the very companies which had caused our financial pain could stay in business... </p>

<p>Now, after this Sandy Hook massacre, with a nation grieving for 20 dead children, the government is at it again - this time they are coming for our guns... and they are using these children&#39;s deaths to justify this effort. And, in typical fashion, the corporate-owned media are in lock-step with the government and are cheering them on as they attempt to take away yet more of our rights...</p>

<p>But wait - isn&#39;t it a good idea to cool down before making important decisions? Aren&#39;t we too emotional right now to start passing new laws that limit the freedoms that are guaranteed to us by the Constitution? Shouldn&#39;t we be allowed to heal before we debate this nuanced and broad issue? Are you sure, America, that making a decision based on a negative emotion is a good idea? </p>

<p>So... who is saying &quot;Wait a minute!&quot;? Who is trying to slow this process down and look at it openly? Who is trying to break through the media narrative to get to the heart of the Sandy Hook story?</p>

<p>The people asking questions are now all &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; according to Anderson Cooper (who, as many of us know, was born rich and worked for the CIA), and many others in the corporate-owned media. </p>

<p>Maybe some of the questions about Sandy Hook are insensitive to some people, but how much harm can a question really do? And when I was at school, I was told there was no such thing as a bad question, and there is a good reason for being allowed to openly ask questions: To encourage critical thinking. </p>

<p>I might add that critical thinking might be in serious need right now, during an age where 20 white children killed by a gunman is a national tragedy, but 200 innocent brown children in Pakistan, killed during Obama&#39;s administration by US drone attacks, barely registers in the (so-called) News. </p>

<p>So I would like to say a big THANK YOU to all you people who stand up and ask questions, who put together youtube videos crammed with information, who write articles, who poke holes in the official story, who try and convince your friends and family that something doesn&#39;t add up, who shout at the TV, who even just dare to consider that the narrative that we are being fed is bunkum.</p>

<p>So thank you guys, thank you for being human, for being cautious, for using your brain when everyone else is caught up in an emotional tizzy... I may not agree with a lot of you, I don&#39;t care... I just wanted to say thank you all very much for being that person and shouldering your share of the hatred of the ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t think that these are just unrelated tragedies.  The PATRIOT ACT was written in 1995, by none other than <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=the+bill+john+ashcroft+sent+up+was+my+bill">Joe Biden</a>.  Its target was not foreign terrorists, but American Patriots.</p>

<p>So it is absolutely no coincidence that Homeland Security, and the American military, is now being aimed squarely at the American people.  Iraq was nothing more than an urban warfare training ground for their planned civil war.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all the same agenda, 9/11, the financial crisis, Sandy Hook, all of it.  These aren&#39;t isolated incidents.  These are globalists, foreign terrorists, perpetrating false flag attacks on America.  They want to sell us out.  In fact, they already have.  And in order to collect, they have to disarm us first.  They would have started a long time ago if it weren&#39;t for forums like this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks to you too OP. I agree. I took a lot of shit for posting theories on FB but after a month or so, I began to see the same people re-posting my Sandy Hook stuff. It doesn&#39;t matter to me if there are wild theories out there that make me look crazy for believing, because I&#39;m also not afraid to drastically change my opinion provided I get new improved evidence. With the amount of time I have in a day,  I like to spend it researching the theories I find here. It leads me down rabbit holes I never knew existed. I mean, the Dark Knight shooter “woke me up” so to speak to r/conspiracy which has led to a complete transformation of my beliefs. All because a MKULTRA reference in a comment I read somewhere. There was no way I thought MKULTRA was a reality until I found r/conspiracy and figured out it’s not so crazy to question these things. I think even if shills are releasing disinfo docs, then it is only doing them more harm than good. Anyway I&#39;m rambling, just dont be discouraged by the naysayers.... especially the ones who frequent r/conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funniest thing about trying to make Sandy Hook into a reason to ban assault rifles is that a rifle ban would not have stopped the shooting.  Drawing attention to Sandy Hook in the context of gun control should bring attention to the fact that gun control laws are ineffective if anything.  The only thing I can clearly pin on the media is deception and ineptitude.  Possibly for the government, possibly for ratings, possibly as a cost-saving measure.  In any case, we cannot trust them.  That is the crux of the issue.  It is not that we all truly believe Sandy Hook never happened, it is that there is little evidence supporting that conclusion and much contradictory evidence.  If you want us to believe the official story the official facts and official news reporting should confirm it.  </p>

<p>The same goes for the Aurora movie theater shooting.  The shooter&#39;s AR jammed very early on, after just a few shots.  After that, all of the damage was done by a run-of-the-mill pump action shotgun and a pistol.</p>

<p>Completely sick of hearing about it.  People who think gossiping about Romney and Obama has something to do with fixing society should wake up and live their own lives.   It&#39;s when we get caught up in this stupid political process and lose sight of whats important that our quality of life starts to slip - and that&#39;s half of what the (apparently completely fake) Sandy Hook event was about.  Getting people to bicker against each other, and not unite against the crimes of the people running this sick system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You&#39;re right. I remember after 9/11, &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; were a lot more widely discussed in public. For Sandy Hook it almost seems taboo to discuss - due to the media demonizing anyone that questions the official story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t WANT to believe anything was lied about, or staged, or set up. But until the &quot;official theory&quot; is proven to me, beyond a reasonable doubt, then I am absolutely within my right, as a rational thinking human being, to entertain the possibility of an alternative theory.</p>

<p>All alternative theories are just as valid as the media and law enforcement&#39;s theory of events until proven otherwise. What they have presented thus far to the public has been nothing more than another theory. And the debunking of details in an alternative theory does not, therefore, imply the validity of the &#39;official theory&#39;. It only debunks that specific detail. It does not validate someone else&#39;s entire telling of events.</p>

<p>Strong disbelief, faith, slander, and hostility do not help the pursuit of truth. It only serves to further distort our perception.</p>

I see a lot that you guys tend to think that your rights are being stripped, may I ask by whom? It seems to me that you guys pinpoint this to the government, but I don&#39;t understand how since there is different administrations in the office over time, why would they all be following the same trend/path if from various parties and backgrounds? I could understand perhaps if there was a dictatorship, but not when in this case... So someone please explain and elaborate so I might be enlightened more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so you&#39;re saying the corporations are behind this, then may ask why would they want to remove guns? it would cut down the sale of the guns in the US and therefore negatively effecting them, furthermore, If it were to be the corporations, who would lead them as head? I think its too general just to pinpoint it onto &quot;corporations&quot; as thats just a word. Its a general statement, so it is unreliable to say this (from a modern history perspective -- learnt how to analyse sources etc.).</p>

<p>If it is not corporations in this case, who is part of the conspiracy? the industrial-military complex? who?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t sure you were legitimately engaging in a conversation with me due to the fact that your comment had nothing to do with what I said.  I assumed you were distracting from the actual conversation. </p>

<p>In all honesty I did not personally say &quot;the corporations are behind this&quot; in that comment and was not intending to point the finger in any specific direction.  </p>

<p>The true meaning of my comment is showing that the term &quot;conspiracy&quot; means people working in a coordinated manner.  If multiple administrations all behave in the same manner, violating the constitution in the same manner, and the same non-governmental entities reap the same benefits regardless of the color of the banner of the party, then they are probably working together in a coordinated effort to effect the same exploitative goals.  That, would in fact, be the definition of a massive &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t say &quot;It can&#39;t be blindness, I can&#39;t see!&quot; anymore than you can say &quot;they are all acting against the public interest in a coordinated effort, it couldn&#39;t be a conspiracy!&quot;</p>

Nor have you told me a specific date for how long this has been going on for, that corporations are running the government as such, and it would not hurt to know that &quot;conspiracy&quot; is a term used from a long long time ago, not sure exactly but it was used in the old testament. (and no I&#39;m not a Christian mad man, you guys only have that problem in the US not here in Australia... don&#39;t know why). You can&#39;t have all these theories and link them weakly together with vague and general ideas, it isn&#39;t a theory then, since a theory is; &quot;a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with most of what you said, I believe you have missed an important point. </p>

<p>CRITICAL thinking. </p>

<p>This does not include painting the grieving parents as paid actor shills. </p>

<p>This does not include accusing at least 150 Newtown citizens of being in on the &quot;false flag.&quot; </p>

<p>This does not include claims lanza was dead years or even days before the incident. </p>

<p>This does not include anything having to do with mind controlled slaves. </p>

<p>If you want the world to wake up, and hear your voice without an immediate kneejerk reaction after which any truth you spew will be met with mockery, you all need to concentrate on the critical part of your thinking, and move far far away from tactics used by people like Alex Jones. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of nuances in the videos you can&#39;t really expect somebody to spell out in a reddit comment.  It&#39;s kind of like, you just see it, and you know - even if you&#39;re not pushing yourself to accept any conclusion.  Although there are some things you can easily put into words - lack of tears, Robbie Parker turning from grinning guy who looks like he just got a promotion to tearless, grieving father after getting himself into character...the medical examiner actually giggling, supposedly just hours after he examined the bodies of 18 or 19 dead children...</p>

Demonstrably fake testimony occurring multiple times gives serious credence to the theory that somebody is trying to change the way the reality of the event appears to the public.  This is called &quot;basic source analysis&quot;, get used to using it if you&#39;re going to hang around in here.</p>

<p>I gave you a totally plausible theory - that some huge amount of the shooting was faked, which explains the total lack of evidence it happened at all as described - and all you can do is pretend I&#39;m blaming the whole thing on aliens.   You should either grow up or leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were any good at &quot;basic source analysis&quot; you would have come to the conclusion that my comment about aliens wasn&#39;t meant to be taken as fact or even my opinion it was meant to be sarcastic and insulting. But since you finally gave me a better answer than &quot;i say it is true, therefore it is&quot; then i&#39;m going to watch your silly little video and get back to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I concluded that some elements of the news coverage were staged, simply because the contents of that coverage made it clear.   Some of the people featured as victims or &#39;authorities&#39; of the event  were exhibiting major signs of dishonesty, so severe that it indicated  they had been instructed to follow a script.  Considering that the event was turned into a political attempt to partially disarm the public, I think that deserves a second look.  Don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>You can write whatever you want on here.  You described your thought process in this thread, and it involved actively ignoring the primary source evidence that I went and fetched at your request.  So I&#39;m not really holding my breath for your opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you&#39;re gonna get it anyway. So far, 3 minutes in all that happened was video was shown of a guy in the woods and someone disguised as Penn Jillette told me that guy was a professional sniper. Again, no proof was mentioned that this guy had anything to do with anything other than the host of the video telling me i should be scared while ominous music played behind a sad kid who probably just lost his best friend to an insane murderer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alrighty, 6 and a half minuted in. The next point brought up that there were conflicting reports on the amount and types of guns used. The only thing this part of the video actually proved was that the media should check its sources and information before immediately airing it, which is pretty impossible considering the 24 hour news cycle. made even more impossible by the demand for information considering the horribleness of this crime and the need to make the public feel at ease. On to the next one...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about that fucked up magic trick I mentioned. They&#39;re over here distracting everyone with this side show about guns and taking away our freedoms which is the &quot;big&quot; issue. Not North Korea threatening to Nuke us to kingdom come, not our president senslessly bombing innocents in the middle east, not our debt that&#39;s growing while somehow our taxes keep rising. I can&#39;t tell you what the big picture really is because i don&#39;t even know. But wake up and see your Government for what it really is a cheap two bit magician for your 5th birthday party. </p>
