       The victim is a family member this time, so it's personal. All the other police shootings, "oops" wrong house, or 'oh... he "had a gun"' incidents up until now have outraged me. But this one makes me incensed, to know that my cousin who was doing nothing at all wrong is now gone simply because he... what exactly can I say here? He wasn't doing anything, just sleeping, and now he's gone because of two over-zealous cops. He waited for his girlfriend there every night and I do not for one second believe that he pulled a gun on the cops. He would never do anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want everyone to know that this can happen to anyone, and when it happens to you or someone you love, you begin to see things in a completely different light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit ~thanks everyone for your kind words and sympathy.

       I'm really not sure if it is truly on the rise or we just have better communication, grassroots media, and exposure. Cops have always been fucktards with small dicks that peaked in high school.

      <p>
       157 murders in Memphis last year.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Memphis police director Toney Armstrong said around 90 percent of last year's homicides involved individuals who knew one another.

       <p>
        In 2012, more than 80 percent of Memphis' homicides involved firearms.

        According to MPD statistics, African-American males under the age of 25 commit most of the city's homicides.

       Sorry, but to me this looks like this unfortunate young man was doing all he could to avoid becoming a statistic and ends up becoming one at the hands of the police. So very, very sad.

      <p>
       It would be easy to speculate on what happened, I can only hope that the truth comes out and all the families involved find peace.

       Cops are fucking scum. They often join the force with good hearts and good intentions, but the draconian laws they have to enforce warps them and they start to do more bad than good.

       Hell police were solely responsible for creating the Crips (which than created the bloods). So we can thank them for our two biggest gangs as well

       On another forum, a well known cop (has shown pix for years there) said shoplifters should be shot if a thread about a drug store manager choking a homeless man to death over toothpaste. He routinely tolerates stories like these and throws his virtual weight around because the site owner has a cop in the family and allows no cop bashing. I believe police are recruited these days based solely on having this holier than thou mindset. The recruiting process takes 6 months and several psychological evaluations. Ive been asked to apply to several firms when i was in security- offering free schooling if i signed on with a certain dept, college classes, and was told "no matter what I do it'll take an act of god to get rid of me" to paraphrase the recruiter. They want thugs who have no problems grinding citizens. Even the good ones left are so jaded from seeing the worst humanity has to offer both on the street and in their heirarchy they stop caring or quit.

       It was a SCOTUS case from NH. The rationale is that anyone too smart would be bored very quickly by all the mundane shit cops spend their time doing. On one hand, defense attorneys love this because cops don't know the law and their clients walk ... on the other hand, we have to deal with those morons everyday who can jam us up.

       Wow. I just read all of the articles pertaining to the shooting. My deepest and sincerest prayers go out toyou and your family for your loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       My questions are, did he indeed have a gun and if so, was it legal? Could he have, upon being woken up panicked and pulled the gun? Is it a bad neighborhood?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm getting really fucking tired of scumbag cops killing innocent people and being rewarded with paid vacations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm not calling for this or encouraging it, but how much longer until people start hunting cops? I mean, the American people can only take so much of this brutality.
      </p>

       Peace and tranquility, brother.

       I live in Memphis and the cops here are going way overboard. Nearly 100% of the time they are saying that the person pointed a gun at them and I just don't believe that.

       My condolences. They say we live in a classless society, but the police are part of a class that can do whatever they want with impunity. And it's going to get worse before it gets better. The militarization of the police has been a noticeable trend, corresponding to the development of counter-insurgence institutions like the DHS and NORTHCOM and domestic surveillance and data mining. Those who once swore to serve and protect have been trained to think of themselves as occupiers surrounded by insurgents.

       And now, with Mr. Hope and Change having rubber stamped the NDAA and made killing US citizens without trial legal, the elites are now attempting to whip up anti-gun hysteria so they can further defang the population.

       THIS. People, wake up. We live in a time, for the first time in American history, we have a PORUS who has not only endorsed indefinite detention for all Americans(the only similar thing is Japanese internment camps back in the day), but has asserted the right to assassinate US citizens without charge or trial as he did with al-alawi(sp) and in a separate drone strike, murdered his 16 year old son(also an American citizen). The police have been militarized. The hammer is about to fall. So, situations like what gapped to the OP's cousin will increase. I mean, gun control my ass. Every law-abiding citizen should carry. You got as much chance of being smoked by a cop as you do a criminal these days.

       Yeah, gun death statistics are a red herring. If people truly care chiefly about being safe and secure they should ban alcohol. Alcohol kills over 6 times more people per year than gun murders. Banning alcohol, however, would be ridiculous. And so, in my mind, is gun control.

       That's not just an American thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here in Quebec, back in 1995, my cousin was found dead in her car and had spent 6 months underwater...
      </p>
      <p>
       She had a thing for cops (if you see what i mean (she was 18)). All of a sudden, one night, she is seen in her car with a police officer that she had a "relationship" with just across the street of the body of water she was found in 6 months later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Serious clues pointed to that officer for a murder... How did it all end ? The officer in questions gets suspended 2 weeks WITH salary and the case gets put to rest, no more work is done on the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as the Police can be the good guys, they can also be the bad guys... and when they are, it gets pretty fucking ugly.

       They certainly have no problem doing it to potentially innocent citizens, without trial and simply by their own judgment. I'm not saying I condone wantonly killing any police officer, but there are certainly some out there that deserve nothing less than what they've forced on helpless citizens.

       That's what happened to a lot of their victims. They don't deserve a trial. They are supposed to be part of a system of justice. Instead, they themselves stepped outside that system. Let them get what they deserve outside that system.

       It should be illegal to not let the family see the body. I don't get how they don't have a right to see the body, it's their own flesh and blood they should have more of a right to see that body than the fucking coroner does.

       Sounds tragic, I hate the idea of anyone being shot, I hate killing in any measure at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do feel like, the poor guy was likely wakened by shouting and knocking on his window, groggy, a flashlight blinding him, by two cops who see a gun inside the car. There are just so many unfortunate ways that situation can go negatively for the poor young kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not justification, but, I'm not sure it makes the cops brutal murderers either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, sorry for your loss. I wouldn't comment on it so blatantly but, you put it out there for discussion, and I'd easily change my mind if some evidence comes to light. Unfortunately, the defense don't even seem to be contesting the story, all I can find is that a couple extra shots, seventeen seconds later, is brutality. Which I agree with.. But I mean... It doesn't discredit anything in the story.

       Did you read some of the comments on the actual website?  What the fuck is wrong with the racist people over there.  Are the comments accurate to the feelings of the general population?  If so i will never be traveling to Tennessee.  I like a good joke here and there but those commenters were vile and so full of hate.  Sorry about your cousin bro.  If your black i would suggest moving out of that town.  Pack your bags and go.  There are plenty of towns here in the USA that are a bit more progressive.

       Heres the thing.  The people commenting aren't kids.  Kids don't go onto the news websites and comment ( for the most part).  Those are adults who watch the news!  Thats disgusting!  Once again, sorry for your loss and the utter lack of human compassion from your town folk.  If your not close to your family then now is the time to do so.  Sometimes there all a person has.

       Bullies with badges man. That's all cops are. They live in their collusion club, protecting each other so they can continue abusing their power. But nothing lasts forever, and whether its by legislation or violence, cops will get what is coming to them when enough people wake up.

       Unfortunately, the cops will always be able to rely on each other to get away with murder if need be.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why it boggles my mind when people want less cameras in public. Well what do we always want when something bad happens? We want video. Time and time again you see bad cops getting busted because they step in front of their own police cars camera. Film everything.

       if cops have the power to cover up their crimes, they have the power to bury any footage. biggest problem of this is that good cops do nothing about all the corruption they are exposed to, while Serpicos are weeded out fast.

       I don't think they could bury a video since if there's a security camera meant to watch a public place then everyone know the footage exists.

       I have noticed a disturbing trend where I live, officers seem to have the ability here to erase certain portions of their car's video. It really hasn't happened lately mostly because it was causing an uproar. For quite a stretch I would say three years or so. It would take weeks for the video to be released then when it was made public, mysteriously the portion of the video that was relevant to the plaintiffs case would be gone. They threatened to make the officers video unit tamper proof. Suddenly these abuses stopped to a degree. Not going ahead and doing that is erroneous IMO. It benefits no one but that unethical cops out there who would abuse citizens. In op's case it really looks like there seemed to be a pattern going on.

       Guess gun owners cant protect their family from home invaders cause it just might happen to be the thugs in blue botching another address. If car repossessors can run a proper skiptrace on a person theres no reason police cant unfuck themselves. Google home invaders shout police. The real criminals often disguise themselves and shout POLICE SEARCH WARRANT. And come to find- real police raids sometimes dont announce if uts a no knock. At 3am i wont know the difference. All i know is to protect my fiance with everything i have.

       Cops no longer serve and protect, they are right along side the gang thugs they pursue. No free thought, code enforcing robots who think everyone on the planet is going to pull a gun on them. Tryanny is already here folks, time to pull your head out of the sand.

       I don't have all the details and I haven't been able to read all the news reports about the incident (nor do I feel particularly inclined to believe them), so I don't know if they actually found a gun or not.

       If this happened to a family member of mine, I would murder the officers involved, slowly. Then I would murder their families. I would not care what happened to me as long as I got my vengeance. The justice system exacts no real justice... I lost my brother, and I you can bet that if it was caused by harm from another individual that I would make it my lifes work to terrorize them and their relatives.

       Prove it.  I haven't seen any video of the shooting taking place.  And there are tons of inconsistencies in the story.  Why aren't they releasing more information than this?  The people they interviewed in that article were actors.  You are an actor.  There was a drill scheduled in Nashville where the police were going to be killing innocent civilians.  Do your research.  I am a critical thinker.  Welcome to

       Come on, now. This story was corroborated with eye witness reports and the attorney handling the case has come forward stating that there is actual video footage (that the police do not deny exists) of the incident shortly after it occurred. Please inform me of any "crisis actors" involved in this case. The police admit that the footage exists, but won't release it... because it's part of an open case. Come on, now. They won't even let my aunt SEE HER DEAD SON!
      </p>
      <p>
       In Sandy Hook, there is nothing, NOTHING, except a void that is being filled in by people trying to get an accurate picture of what actually occurred, which is something that I think we all are entitled to, since it's being forced upon us so aggressively by the media. And then, they won't even actually address all the discrepancies regarding the case! Oh, I wish they would make this case as big as Sandy hook. It's not nearly as big and there's no way they would be able to maintain their version of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, trying to use this as an agenda against Sandy hook doubters. Get out of here with that. Not even on topic.

       The attorney handling the case is an actor.  Eyewitness testimony is usually useless.  We know there's a video because there's a video of everything.  Even your cell phone is reporting everything it "sees" - every moment of the day.  Why won't they release the video?  What are they
       <em>

       I'm not part of the immediate family to which this atrocity happened. But we are close knit. We don't die. Strong roots never die. So you're not hurting me with this. I don't have to sit up and watch the space that Steven used to lie in. I don't have to sit up at night and keep watch over the door he used to come in and see that he don't come in no more. I'm apart from that, but he's my family, and so while I have a part in that, I'm still capable of sitting here and absorbing all your bull shit that you bring into the community, without even having to think about it, because it's just that. Bull shit!.

       People's arguments when they're defending the system tend to be purely emotional once logic has cleared away most .  Lots of people defend the "official story" at Sandy Hook or 9/11 and they sound a lot like this.  WAKE  UP!  Do your research.

       So every shooting is now fake? You are an idiot and probably the actor we should be most concerned about. You see, very real subjects get derailed by stupid shit like what you type. When the NWO pulls this stuff, people really die, they dont fake it, that would be too easy to prove eventually. So shootings may be staged, but there very real, stop lokking for actors everywhere.

       Only the shootings that can be proven are likely real.  Wake up and do your research.  If people would just learn to think critically.

       You know they're hiding something.  Once logic has pared away your arguments, you continue to defend the system either for emotional reasons, or you just come after someone like me trying to wake you up with ad hominem attacks.

       You're so rabid you are attacking your allies. I do not defend the system ever. Look at any post i have made on any website and you will see i am a full believer in the NWO and that we already have a police state, people just are slow to recognize it. However,  you come across like nthe guy who points at every plane in the sky and yells UFO. even if you are right you're hurting the movement. so only point to those you can prove false. otherwise the movement gets derailed and that is exactly what the NWO wants.

       If only there were some public entity that were paid to protect its citizens, or even some sort of place of law where events could be discussed and justice served out fairly.  But since such things do not exist everywhere, sometimes the local citizens have no choice but to take matters into their own hands.

       You seem to be asking that a lot in this thread.  Do you have a personal motive for random killings, or are you trying to justify your own personal homicidal nature?  Maybe you should stop trying to read your own agenda into everyone else's words.

       Before we had local police forces, the citizens policed themselves.  I think if certain police departments and courtrooms continue to brutalize the citizens they were sworn to protect, then its only a matter of time before those citizens take up arms, make a stand, and defend themselves.  Once that happens in the first location, you're going to see a whole lot more incidents popping up rapidly -- nobody wants to be 'first', but everyone is willing to be a copycat.  If/when that happens, it will quickly become apparent which police forces have been taking advantage of their citizens, and the government will either have to step in and take down the citizens who are revolting, or be forced to admit that there is a problem with many police agencies which they have been purposefully ignoring.
