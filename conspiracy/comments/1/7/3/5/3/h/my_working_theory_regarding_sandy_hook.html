      <p>
       Given the info we have:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) Parker family actors, evidence of psychosis
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Media misidentifying principal
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) Media misidentifying school nurse
      </p>
      <p>
       (d) Media misidentifying police sources, or conflicting info from police sources (2 handguns + 1 semiautomatic rifle vs. 4 handguns)
      </p>
      <p>
       (e) Dishonest Gene Rosen with logical holes in story
      </p>
      <p>
       (f) HUGE push by federal government to codify new laws through executive order (totally illegal!)
      </p>
      <p>
       (g) Conflicts between medical examiner's testimony (evidence of psychosis)  and some police releases - evidence suggests "assault rifle" (semiautomatic rifle) may not have been present
      </p>
      <p>
       (h) Police Chief apparently took part in FEMA drills for school shootings for the past decade, town was close-by to FEMA center, FEMA drill of "children in emergencies" that very morning...
      </p>
      <p>
       (i) Possibility that Emilie Parker was accidently put into a photo with Obama...
      </p>
      <p>
       (j) Possible "Crisis Actors" affiliations, several actors with convincing similarities twice between this shooting and others (Holmes and Giffords)
      </p>
      <p>
       (k) Photo op manipulation by Obama - why is he appearing in photos immediately after the event with the supposed parents of deceased children, and why does nobody in those families seem even slightly bothered by what has happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       (j) "Man in camo pants" (allegedly a police officer from another town, or alternately, a father who had 'smelled sulfur') reports of two shooters on police radio, other suspicious figures appearing that day - suspect says to parents "I didn't do it" and is put in the front seat of a police car...
      </p>
      <p>
       (k) Car apparently belonged to Christopher Rodia (verified by license plate?)
      </p>
      <p>
       and the very staggering lack of:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) Evidence of victims - "shipped away in refrigerated  truck during the night"?
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Evidence of emergency response (some ambulances present at both school and fire station, but apparently zero photographs where the ambulances aren't boxed into a parking lot by several cars - highly unusual) - also apparently no evidence of emergency personnel
       <em>
        taking care of anyone
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) Evidence of Lanza actually being involved besides speculation/hearsay
      </p>
      <p>
       (d) Injured children - extremely high death to injury ratio compared to other shootings, uncharacteristic of alleged shooter
      </p>
      <p>
       (e) Non-staged displays of grief...
      </p>
      <p>
       My working theory is thus that the parents of deceased children were actors, the medical examiner  was an actor, Gene Rosen was likely a local resident but paid to lie, and that otherwise, the parents of children at the school were simply told that 18-19 children, who may not have even existed, were killed in the event.  Contradictions in the official story were railroaded as "rumors" and "misinformation" in order to ensure the policy push would go through.  Estimated total number of complicit people, 50-150.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any corrections on evidence appreciated.  Trying to piece my way through a very distorted situation...

       As for (e) it can be proven that Gene Rosen's story was completely false. With a little google map magic you will find that the firestation was before his house, and right next to it. He could see the firehouse from his property. If this was going on as allegedly happened, the bus driver would've passed a crowd of people already at the firehouse and there's no way Gene Rosen wouldn't be able to see the commotion at the fire house.

       Is that so? Those 6 kids escaped at the start of the murder spree.

       How would there be anyone, let alone a crowd gathered at a volunteer fire station?

       Escaped at the start of the murder spree...to a bus driver who was still present at the school (after dropping kids off for the morning?)...who then dropped them off at the house of a strange man...who exhibits clear signs of lying and a recounting of an impossible series of events during interviews.

       Great story guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       The children were running down the street. The bus driver
       <strong>
        who was on foot
       </strong>
       saw them and lead them away down the street
       <strong>
        on foot
       </strong>
       . They wound up down the street at Gene Rosens house, where Gene brought everyone inside including the bus driver, they called the police and the bus driver had a list of all the childrens phone numbers and he was able to reach 5 of the childrens parents.

       Why do you feel the need to sock puppet? Does the truth scare you? There's so many of you socks around here, it's curious as to why you'd need to create sock puppets if you guys aren't just bullshitting all the time.

       instead of the ad hominem why don't you disprove the theories behind Rosen's seemingly false story with actual video of him recanting it...oh that's right, you can't because this is the exact story he gives...he didn't call the cops
      </p>
      <p>
       why does the bus driver change from a man to a woman in his story?

       Ok... so the bus driver is a female? Can women not drive a school bus?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just bizarre these ideas you guys make up to deny sandy hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Here's an interview with the bus driver.

       I hope you're not too alarmed that the bus driver is a female.

       No he does not say the bus driver is a man. If you could point to the exact time he says this and quote exactly what he says then maybe we will get to the bottom of this.

       why was there a bus driver, according to Rosen's story, with the children, who then left the kids there at his house? in his story he says that only six kids were on his lawn. also in some versions of his story the bus driver drives the bus off.

       Not sure yet why Lanza was picked as the fall guy.  May be too early to speculate - pretty sure one of the leads on him already turned out to be disinfo.

       Pretty good theory.  Do you believe that any kids actually died on the school premises?  I don't.  If there are actually any missing kids, they were abducted.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the adults who were allegedly killed?  How do they fit in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Folks I am convinced are actors:
"Parents" of:

      <ul>
       <li>
        Jessica Rekos
       </li>
       <li>
        Grace McDonnell
       </li>
       <li>

       <li>
        Noah Pozner

      <p>
       Victoria Sota appears to be in on it and most likely got a wad of cash and relocation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the other parents, I can't say.  They've been keeping a low profile, which is to be expected if they really did lose a child.

       Everyone feels it in their bones? Really? I certainly don't.  People for the last 3000 years have thought they were on the cusp of some dramatic apocalypse or rapture. Guess what it never fucking happened. Now I know that's not necessarily what you're saying, but the same principle applies. "Feeling something in your bones" is not in any way shape or form evidence. There is none for what you're clamining.

Is that if the illumaniti is real and I controlling things and hoaxing things eventually if they did control it all and had everyone enslaved everything would fall and they would be no more?

       Um, well, I'm not sure if you've been paying too much attention to...um...HISTORY, but people actually HAVEN'T gotten their freedom "somehow".  This whole bullshit "land of the free" paradigm that you, me, and all of us have been indoctrinated with since childhood to recite and believe is actually all bullshit.  You're not free.  You're a fucking wage slave - a tax slave.  Just like me, just like 99.999% of the U.S. population.
      </p>

       I'm all for overthrowing TPTB.  I am....But the shit hasn't happened yet, let me tell you that.  The people - the wage slaves -

       It seems that this thinking you have that "We will overcome!" suffers more from a romantic notion instilled in your head by Hollywood brainwashing (movies like Braveheart and

       Oh, that's convenient.  You live there.   And a kid on your little street died.

       I think this guy was trying to rush with his emotionally manipulative post, and accidentally called the street little instead of the kid.  Well, happens to the best of them...
