       The point of this thread is to prove that the media (particularly this helicopter) was there shooting the event
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       they evacuated from lockdown. Proving definitively that no footage exists of them leaving the school though it should also that either none of the 600 children were there that day, or that only a select few were there for the media magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's the order of events and my evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday when I posted a link to this
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/170352/theres_only_one_thing_people_need_to_do_to_prove/">
        video
       </a>
       , in the comments several folks were stating that the children were evacuating before any media arrived to film it and that they got footage of that from the firehouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       My contention was that the first helicopter to arrive on scene arrived around 10-10:30am while the children were on "lockdown" and before they were evacuated.
      </p>
      <p>
       From this footage here -
       <a href="http://www.wfsb.com/video?clipId=8069373&amp;%C2%ADautostart=true%EF%BB%BF">
        http://www.wfsb.com/video?clipId=8069373&amp;%C2%ADautostart=true%EF%BB%BF
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to prove my case I followed up with questions and called them; contact page found
       <a href="http://www.wfsb.com/story/14535270/contact-us">
        here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my conversation with the man I spoke to at that news channel. -
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQIMTDvNs1s">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQIMTDvNs1s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       (TL;DW - He said the footage was from an affiliate wcbs in NY and he gave me their number)
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately I call the number he gave me and spoke to a man about this inquiry, he said he would look into it and he would respond to the email which I used to send him a link to the video in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOs-njt-to&amp;feature=youtu.be">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkOs-njt-to&amp;feature=youtu.be
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Several hours later, he replies with the answer at last.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAaE39qrEig&amp;feature=youtu.be">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAaE39qrEig&amp;feature=youtu.be
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Confused?
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooting happened at about 9:35 am. The children were on lockdown until about 11:15 when they were evacuated (CNN timestamps the events
       <a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/14/shooting-reported-at-connecticut-elementary-school/">
        here
       </a>
       ; also other outlets such as NY Times and others reported this)
      </p>
      <p>
       The first helicopter footage from wfsb/wcbs started filming at around 10:30am, this proves that media were in fact there before the children were "evacuated" and there's no way in hell that this helicopter and possible others wouldn't of caught of that footage if there really were 600 children in that school, and they did evacuate at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       - People contend that the children were evacuated before media arrived, this is undeniably false. There were helicopters in the sky, no footage exists of the 600 children leaving that school.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Asking about a timestamped version of the video, will edit this or make another post if he gives me new footage.

       I ask this, what do we do if we find out that it was a hoax? What was the point of it? Who's to blame? Who was really behind it and why go through the trouble? all for gun control? and if it was for that reason, why did you need to go to those lengths? Is there something coming where an armed populace wouldn't be too good for the controlling government?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are just my thoughts, I agree with you guys that this was all just bullshit made up to garner legislation support for gun control, I just don't know why they'd want to take away our guns unless they want to make like the Nazi's. . . .

       Gun control isn't the 'endgame' point for these people.    Gun control is just another stepping stone to assuring total control and tyranny, and making sure those that otherwise would  step up and

       It is also a convenient distraction from the fact that every central bank controlled financial system has been shown to be a ruse, manipulated at the whim and fancy of the banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it.  We have the constitution placing absolutely zero limits on our right to "keep and bear Arms" (with a big "A", not muskets, not sleeveless shirts, Armaments).  There is no argument.  There is no discussion.  The fact that we are embroiled in a fight to the death over a moot subject tells me that we are being pitted against ourselves to distract us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other red-herring arguments include gay marriage and abortion, both things the government has no authority over.  Any time one of those subjects is being debated on a national level it is a distraction.  You know it because the answer is so simple and it is the same in every case: the government has no authority over the subject.  Filing jointly on your tax return should not have anything to do with your religious beliefs, color of your skin, sex, or anything else.  Marriage is a religious/personal thing, combined assets is a tax thing.  Abortion is a medical thing and our federal government should not be in the position of making medical decisions for the entire nation.  That is between a person and their doctor, and the state laws.  Roe v Wade was inappropriate at the federal level and went beyond the limited authority of the federal government, however states are authorized to pass such laws.  If we want a prohibition nationally there are 50 state congresses that must pass a law outlawing it in order for the ban to be lawful, or an amendment must be passed to our Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed that these diversions are always a reaffirmation of a non-authority.  They are emotional arguments that tend to short circuit logic and reason causing people to argue passionately for the authority of the federal government to intrude into our lives unlawfully.  And they tend to pop up in the national dialog around very critical events, like the undermining of the entire world's financial system, a presidential election, commission of an illegal war, or something to that effect.  This time it's distracting from the LIBOR rigging scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no debate on gun control except at a Constitutional convention.   Until the Constitution infringes on our right to keep and bear Arms there are zero limits.  Even the statement about "a well regulated militia" is an explanatory clause and imposes no infringements at all.

       If a corporation that manufactures munitions doesn't want to take responsibility for selling you a heavy weapon that means you don't get one.  I guess you can try and build one yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       At no time did I ever claim the constitution guarantees you access to anything.  Just that the government cannot infringe on your right to keep and bear Arms.  That doesn't mean the government must compel a private company to sell you something.  Why would it be any different if we realized that there are no lawful impediments to owning Arms instead of pretending the government has an authority they do not?  Everything would be exactly the same as it is today, because it would be exactly the same as it is today.  You can pretend that the government has an authority it does not if you want.  That's up to you.  You can pretend there is really a Santa Clause if you want too.

       You made up a false argument.  You are hallucinating a series of events and trying to blame me for that.  I'm not sure what to say in response.

       What you or I are in favor of doesn't change the constitution.  I'm not in favor of our government violating the constitution at all for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun control is not about guns.  It's about control.  If "crazy" people can't have guns, and the government can label anyone they want "crazy", then nobody that questions the government will have guns.  This isn't even a "what if one day" scenario.  Recently the
       <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-03-07/news/the-nypd-tapes-confirmed/">
        NYPD labeled one of their own "crazy" and put him away
       </a>
       for recording evidence of systemic corruption in the NYPD.  It is nearly standard operating procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore the label "crazy" can be applied to absolutely anyone.
       <a href="http://www.bonkersinstitute.org/rosenhan.html">
        An experiment was conductced
       </a>
       in which eight sane people were committed to inpatient psychiatric care to see how long they could act sane in an asylum without anyone catching on.  The answer is forever.  None of the doctors ever even considered the undercover patients might be sane.  It is impossible to detect a sane person.  The idea that someone can be insane is so pervasive and amorphous that any evidence, even the mundane, is interpreted as evidence of insanity once the assumption is made.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we do decide to amend the constitution to allow any limitations on Arms I would suggest giving it clearer parameters than "anyone the government considers crazy".  Convicted criminals are another thing the government has control over.  They make something harmless illegal, say a plant for example.  Make it a felony.  Then arrest anyone who lawfully violates the unconstitutional law (the first hemp tax act was ruled unconstitutional and was replaced by the controlled substances act which has never been tested in the supreme court).  Now anyone who has shown they will defy the government's overreach can't have a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not theory.  This is not "one day maybe our grandchildren may need to fend off tyranny".  We interned our own citizens in concentration camps in the last 100 years while simultaneously condemning Germany for the same.  We routinely spy on our own citizens and effect searches without probable cause.  We imprison and even execute our own citizens without due process.  This is not some paranoiac dystopian future we are afraid might one day come.  We need not be afraid of our government, instead they must be afraid of us or the seeds of tyranny sprouting up in Our government will grow into oaks, and axes will have been outlawed.

       Whoa whoa whoa. Some guy who doesn't sound he really gives a shit gives you a off-handed answer and it's definitive proof? His email says,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Around 1030a"
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't even bother finishing his sentence and you're calling this proof? Get the raw footage timestamp. Then maybe you have something. Right now you have some guy who doesn't really give a shit giving you something he's thinking off the top of this head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also CNN timestamps are all over the god damned place. None of that shit is reliable because they're looking for the exclusive story and being first, not for actual fact checking, which is why they started plastering the wrong person's facebook page ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

       I think the problem also lies with the fact that OP gave him options.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't say "At what time was this footage taken?"
      </p>
      <p>
       He said "What time in the day was the footage taken at?
       <em>
        10am 10:30am?
       </em>
       etc."

       Leading questions will always get the answer you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Omar also comes across as if he couldn't care less, his response is blasé "Around 10:30a. (... whatever. I don't care.)"
      </p>
      <p>
       It also looks like Omar can't even be bothered to form proper sentences:
      </p>
      <p>
       "That is Ch.2 chopper video; are a reporter for FS8?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I love it how some people's level of evidence is so high but lower their standards when it comes to 'proving' what they believe.

        I showed my cousin the video of the helicopter and asked him if that's how raw feeds come in because he works at TSN, a sports news channel in Canada. His explanation was that they don't have time stamps on those camera's since every time they would come in they need to take it off, so instead when you do see a time stamp on helicopter feeds most are overlays done on the raw feeds.

       They still have time stamps somewhere. They'll have documentation of all of that shit.

       You primed the guy with asking, "Was it 10 or 1030?" He clearly didn't really give a shit and just gave you a half-assed answer dude. That isn't proof of anything. It's shitty investigative work and is full of holes. You can't ask a leading question like that and get a real answer.

       I've spent my entire life trying to wordsmith a way to break the human spirit. I used to tell people that I would devote my life to developing a time machine so I could go back in time and convince myself to convince their moms to abort them if I had known they'd come out this retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've told people that I would name my cancer after them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've told people that I want to floss their asshole with barbed wire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've told people that if ever there were a reason to support abortion, it was because of their existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list goes on and on and it gets more and more horrible. But the one that has always worked 100% of the time is mocking them for wearing that god awful hat. Because deep down inside, you, me, and them: we know. We know what the fedora really stands for. It's a symbol. It's how it only partially covers their face. It says, "Hey I'm a little mysterious, note how this covers only 15% of my face." And yet at the same time it says, "Hey look at me. I'm different. It's not a baseball cap! I mean I AM WEARING A FEDORA GOD DAMN IT. LOOK AT ME. OH GOD PLEASE, LOOK AT ME."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the last struggle to gain some momentum on the catastrophe of their personality. Everyone just kind of lets people who wear fedoras go on with their lives. Nobody wants to be the one to tip that scale and send Mr. Fedora spiraling down into an abyss of existential hell. And this is what it comes down to; he's afraid. Because Mr. Fedora has stared into that abyss in his lowest moments and you know what happened?

       Thanks, even more proof the children were evacuated before helicopters arrived. People yesterday were trying to say that the helicopters were there minutes after the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's video of children saying that when the police arrived they told everyone to run outside, nobody was made to wait inside the school. So that would be 10am.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CNN timeline further helps to show that since they are even reporting things after the fact that are being reported to them. Gives a large window for the school to be cleared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good work.

       Here's the picture of the students being evacuated at 10:09am. Again, great work showing the children were gone before the helicopter. Honestly, I applaud you for doing some research even thought it destroyed the argument you wanted to make.

       Yet again, here is some decent evidence that goes against the conspiracy theory, and it gets voted down while conjecture and using google maps and a retarded version of a sundial gets up votes. No amount of proof will change these people's minds.

       Yes you did. Your first comment states:

         Well even if I were to believe they were talking about a large group of children coming out, 10:24 is before 10:30.

       Why would you not believe a policeman saying a large group is coming out? Who else, teachers? Staff? Even so, you're telling me that 600 children made it from the school, a quarter mile away to a firehouse, and from there are promptly picked up and escorted away by whomever...by 10:30? 10:45? Even without the traffic surrounding the area those logistics are impossible.

       I was misinformed, a police chopper was there with video feed from earlier which is what I was referencing. I thought I saw on the ground footage from about 10:45, but I can't find it. Do you know when the first reporters were on the ground?

       Because nobody said it was a large group of kids coming out of a school. That police scanner audio is coming from neighboring cities even. So "a large group coming out" could be anywhere. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt anyways.

       Nope, I never said that. The children were at the firehouse. ENS notified parents who were on their way. The parents lined Riverside Dr and picked up their children. That's why we have photos and video of that happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original "problem" was that people here assumed children were inside the school and that the news media would have seen them swarm outside. We've already resolved that they left the school prior to their arrival. There's videos from cell phones and cameras showing parents picking up their children from the fire station. Do you want to argue against that too?

       Given context, it's most reasonable to assume they're referencing the school. Also, neighboring cities tend to use different channels.

       Yeah, I would. First off I'm establishing that some children had left the school but there's no way they could have left the vicinity. Secondly, I've done a shit ton of research trying to find these pictures from cell phones and news outlets and I've found one, the one you posted. Care to share your sources on those?

       I'm not "moving the goalposts", I'm saying that you show me half a dozen clips with a few kids in each which is sparse at best. You didn't answer the few valid arguments that
       <a href="/u/Toronto_boy">
        /u/Toronto_boy

       (not all, but a few). Do you not understand the logistics of moving 600 people? That you've spent so many comments here saying the children were evacuated before the media arrived, then given me 6 (5 really, considering 1 is just a repeat) videos of children you consider "being evacuated"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not asking for a swarm of 600 kids, I don't need to see video footage of every single one leaving, but the challenge of getting so many people to and from a location is why we have buses. I don't see any evidence from what you've given me besides a few lone kids wandering about and being interviewed. One would expect more given the circumstance.

       It's not a challenge to clear a school. Multiple times a year schools hold fire drills. This seems especially simple because the school is secluded on a dead end road. There's only one way to go, run up the freakin' road.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how moving 450 kids would be any more difficult than moving 20, it's not like 450 kids were waiting at a start line behind a gate and the gate swung open leaving them to stampede over each other. The cops went room to room and told the class to exit outside. The teachers in each class could easily move everyone outside as they had practiced before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I say you're moving the goal posts? It's because the argument starts with there being no helicopter footage of 450 kids leaving the building. Once that is shot down the problem changes to no video of 450 kids standing outside the firehall. Once that is shot down the problem changes to logistics of parents being able to pick up kids, no wait it's being able to get kids to walk 1000ft down the road, no wait, the real problem is that we don't have footage of all the kids being picked up individually. I mean sure, we have footage of some kids but not every kid... stop moving the goal posts.

       Interesting straw man. My argument starts with the question of "Where's the footage of all the evacuating kids?" The method of filming, whether from the ground or the air; or location, the firehouse or outside of the school, doesn't matter at all. I just want to see some evidence of an
       <strong>
        evacuation
       </strong>
       , not a singular kid getting escorted or a group of 3 kids standing around, from a helicopter or otherwise, and the logistics of the situation are umbrellaed by this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to have missed that. My problem of logistics had nothing to do with being able to "get kids to walk 1000ft down the road", it had to do with getting 600 kids from a school 1000ft down the road to a firehouse and taken home.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I'd say you have been "moving goalposts" with your contradictory argument consisting that the children had been evacuated before the media arrived then giving me what you claim to be evidence of children being evacuated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep straw manning though, it's the only thing you can cling to now as it's becoming apparent we simply disagree on the finer points and you have no more evidence.

       You're swamped in so much evidence of an evacuation but you keep moving the goalposts to the point of pretending that parents are completely unable to to get their children. That's why you need to run away, you have painted yourself into a corner and cannot possibly deny any harder than that. lol

       You consider 6 videos with a few children being "swamped with evidence" of an evac? I'm not running from anything, feel free to discuss this some more. However, I don't agree with your evidence, you have multiple factual errors, you're straw manning me, and you've contradicted yourself, so where else can we go with this discussion?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. I'm not "denying" anything except for your allegation that this evidence is enough to convince me that 600 kids were evacuated from Sandy Hook which is pretty reasonable.

      <p>
       You're asking for a photo/video of every single child in the school which is pretty damn unreasonable. I've shown exactly why there shouldn't be any expectation of such a thing since there was no media around at the time the school evacuated.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         You then argued that a school can't possibly be cleared in ~30 minutes, which is nonsense.

         Your counter argument was that because I didn't show all 430 students in that school, that everything I say is invalid.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Is your request reasonable? I think not.

       You asked for a photo of a group of kids. Also, lots of the kids were already escorted out by the time the media got ground people out there and were sure to be "safe."

       I read the TIME story about that evacuation picture you're using to defend the official story, and I'm shocked at how deceptive and underhanded it is.  The writer creates a snappy back-story for the photographer, then tells us:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        She snapped frames of police and emergency personnel rushing to the school as well as of anxious parents — already on scene — pressed against police barriers, straining to see if their children had emerged from the building. Among armed police officers and weeping parents, she kept watch, diligently clicking the shutter.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay, so she has all these pictures, and more!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For the children freed from the school, parents rushed to their side, sweeping them up in firm embraces as they walked the 1100 feet to the nearby fire station. Hicks, camera in hand, followed them every step.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So they go on to claim that some people called in upset that they had published this photo, and then proceed to warn reporters not to look any deeper.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As a journalist, Hicks is proud to have documented the event, but issues caution to many media outlets now trolling the grounds in Newtown.
       </p>
       <p>
        “There are different levels of journalism out there, and ours [at The Bee] is not to follow people when they go to the funeral home, or the cemetery. We don’t go knocking on the doors of victims of anything,” said Hicks. “It’s very hard for us to watch other journalists do this to our neighbors.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh, okay.  I'll just roll over and go back to sleep.

       That's the Newton Bee reporters response. I'm not sure how you can fault someone for not wanting to be a part of a media circus involving childrens funerals. The local newspaper isn't going to be doing themselves any favors or selling more papers by reminding their readers(locals) of what happened by displaying their children on the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is their integrity your beef?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if the local paper released hundreds of pics of kids running in terror, people here would claim it was just staged to scare people into giving up their guns.

       As far as I'm aware, there was no media circus following the funerals.  If there were, we would have pictures of funerals and grieving parents instead of theories that there was no shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protecting grieving families is noble and right, and as any sensible neighbor, I sympathize with their need for privacy. However, while our president uses these suffering families to promote his political aims, we are told not to ask any questions to protect the same families.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emotional nature of the event makes it easy to deflect questioning, which is very convenient.  It's hard to fake grief, and so rather than do it poorly (yet again), they'd rather offer a convenient excuse while shaming skeptics.

       Define "Media".  I consider myself and my cell phone "media" for all intents and purposes.  The corporate hacks with their financial constraints didn't show up until later, but I don't see evidence that 600 children were ever in that school on that day, or lead from the school to the firehouse by their parents or whatever that pro-law enforcement fluff piece you link to claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever happened at Sandy Hook it is being exploited by all sides.  If it was real they did a very bad job of reporting on it, and a lot of people with cell phone images and video at the scene are really fucking stupid for not selling that to the criminally negligent corporate news agencies.  If it didn't happen then the news agencies and every human being involved in the deception is criminally responsible for the conspiracy.  Either way there are people being deceptive and making a huge controversy about gun control when this is a perfect example of how gun prohibition doesn't actually stop crime.  The strict gun laws in CT didn't prevent this violent crime, and they don't prevent violent crime nationally.  This entire event has been used to distract us from the real issues and conspiracies affecting the entire world, for example the LIBOR rigging scandal.  Notice the corporate owned 24-hour news agencies don't have time to talk about that one anymore?  What about the mortgage and eviction fraud?  Nope.

       I like to think that any adult there would be too busy helping children escape a school shooting to worry about getting the footage for channel 2. And I would also hope that elementary schools don't typically have large numbers of adults filming/taking personal photos all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I agree mostly with the gun control point. Every single mass shooting in the US has had two things in common:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Guns (kind of goes without saying)
       </li>
       <li>
        Perpetrator(s) with serious, untreated mental health problems.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       People often point out that these events happen less frequently in Europe, or Canada and sometimes wrongly cite gun laws as being the only difference. While it's true that you can't buy an assault rifle at Canadian Walmarts, people with mental illnesses have access to affordable mental health care. The same goes for industrialized countries in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shooter's 30 round magazine definitely caused a lot of damage, but so did his mental health problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the media coverage, you don't need a conspiracy to explain it. The television news media have always tailored their coverage to what gets them ratings which has always been the following things, in order:
      </p>
      <p>
       Tier 1 (used to fill all 24hrs when possible)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Violent sex
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Violence
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sex
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Celebrities
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Elections
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Any combination of the above, or preferably all 5.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Tier 2 (great time fillers so that you can save tier 1 stuff for the top of the next hour)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Things that are scary (and violent 99.99999% of the time)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "On your side" human interest stories
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Non election-Political scandals
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Washed up celebrities
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Tier one topics, but which happened in poor countries/too poor people
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Tier 3 (used sparingly, maybe an hour a week)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Non-scandal politics
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Business/stock market news
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Topics which require the viewer to have any previous knowledge about anything not in tier 1
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And tier 3 item 3 is exactly where LIBOR is. The news media doesn't avoid it because they're a part of a global conspiracy, they avoid it because the topic is difficult. You may have read a lot about LIBOR and why it matters, so it seems easy to you but it's not easy for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If CNN is airing 24 hour a day in depth business analysis of LIBOR and other interest rate regulation stories how well will they do? You already know the answer. It's a similar story in print magazines:
      </p>
      <p>
       Who has more readers: OK! or any business/banking publication ever?
      </p>
      <p>
       The media coverage is not a global conspiracy, it's various companies competing for ratings in what is really and
       <em>
        entertainment
       </em>
       environment first and foremost.

       b-b-but... that makes too much sense! I feel like people are either waaaaaay underthinking this by just believing the media story, or waaaaay overthinking it by buying into the conspiracy theories. Regardless, something has been smelling rotten here and there will be no progress made with both of these polar opposite views of what happened. Obviously theres some truth to the media story, while there are a ton of discrepancies that would indicate either a massive failure of communication and journalism, or a conspiracy of some sort. The problem is that the facts aren't there to support ANY theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why cant some people just accept that the facts don't add up and leave it at that without going off the deep end and suggesting things that turn people away from the idea all together?

       If it was a conspiracy, why would they have an insane person as the fall guy? Now the massacre can be attributed to insanity, and since he didn't own the guns it can be argued that increased background checks wouldn't have done anything anyway.

       To best further the gun control agenda the shooter
       <em>
        should have

       been a card carrying NRA member who owned the guns used for the massacre, and who also left a suicide message of not wanting to let children or himself live in a world where you cannot buy machine guns and rocket launchers legally.

       If that's a lie, then all mass shootings committed by 'postal' people are staged. That's beyond even the scope of r/conspiracy, since they have happened, and still happen, all around the world, even in countries that have the strictest gun ownership rules. Which would mean global conspiracy for no purpose at all (because most countries already have strict gun laws).

       Given his actions at the time?  You should learn some history that doesn't come from conspiracy theory websites.  McNamara did not support invading Cuba, nor did Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs disaster.  The Joint Chiefs were continually pushing for military intervention and McNamara had already rejected numerous proposals/demands for military strikes.  He'd probably stopped reading them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, didn't you study the Cuban Missile Crisis in high school?  The relationship between the White House and Joint Chiefs was extremely toxic in the early 60's.  The Operation Northwoods proposal was idiotic on its face and I'm sure even the Joint Chiefs knew that.  They're just busting Kennedy's balls about invading Cuba.

       So, can we get this straight now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Children were actors?
      </p>
      <p>
       So the School is a real School though? Is it used for teaching 'real' kids on a day to day basis or was it empty until the shooting happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the School is 'real' but was used for a fake shooting, where are the parents whose kids were not allowed to go in that day, you know the parents of the kids who were replaced by the actor kids?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the school was not previously used before the shooting then why has no one commented that it was just used to fake this thing?

       So I was able to find another image of kids evacuating the school. You can compare it to the famous one, and you can tell it's a different group of kids. So now we have at least 2 dozen kids in images at the school evacuating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still find it odd that this wasn't on video or photos like it was at columbine. Doesn't mean they didn't evacuate just odd there aren't more photographs or video.

       Also if you look at this, this was a photo the principal had previously tweeted. Of them doing a drill. I know that they can evac fairly quickly based on drills but again still odd there wasn't a ton of photos actually AT the school of the evac.

       Well, can we find it interesting without necessarily agreeing with it? And all he's saying is that the kids were evacuated before 9:35 am, so they could stage the scene entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the kids I've seen who have given eye witness accounts heard just a couple of random banging noises that they didn't even think were gun shots. Maybe that's all they did hear to evacuate the school so they can stage it properly?

       Not sure but I assume since it took him a few hours to get back to me that he either had to dig up the footage and the unedited copy had the timestamps or he had to contact the film crew and confirm it.

       Ok... Half assed emails that don't even have complete sentences in some cases. Yup, definative proof right here! /s

       Seriously, mass media coverage is going to cause discrepiency amonst facts. This is how it works. You have some channels reporting one thing, some reporting others, and Fox news reporting bullshit. All the "questionable" infomation has probably become questioable due to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the helicopter, say your right and it was their before the evacuation, whats to say it wasn't in the area at the time? It could have been reporting a police chase or something similar. Someone could have simply called the press after they called the police, thus the helicopter would have quickly moved and arrived before the police and the evacuation.

       What are the conspiracy theorists' explanations to explain why, if no children were actually killed at Sandy Hook and it was all staged (is that what you folks contend?), there are actually people, myself included, who
       <em>
        personally know a family whose child was killed there
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://sunnysidepost.com/2012/12/19/solemn-evening-for-sunnyside-residents-who-knew-sandy-hook-victims/">
        This
       </a>
       is an article on the memorial event held in my neighborhood for one of the children.  I know the parents personally.  Their child was killed in the shooting.  They are not liberal conspirators, anti-gun nuts, have not been paid off by the government, and have not been hypnotized or brainwashed.  As members of the Sandy Hook community, they know other parents whose children were killed there as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the conspiracy theory explanation for this again?  That these two people that I know are part of a federal plot and they've just been acting like their lives have been destroyed every time I talk to them?

       Helicopter arrives at scene. Doesnt see any kids outside the school. Thinks maybe they are in lockdown. He is not the most reliable witness now is he? Why is his opinion more valid than the dozens of people on the ground?

       These people bring the news to you on a professional basis. They get rung up and are given a job. This world you "rationalists" are envisioning seems to be full of incompetent retards.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are whole medical teams in ready formation with strechers ready on the go you can see they are waiting. Had 20 dead kids come out you wouldn't see them standing by. There is zero chaos on that parkinglot. So unless you claim this footage to be taken hours after the incident I don't see a goddamn reason for it to be so calm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me one scenario where this footage would make sense? It obviously cannot have been taken before the incident so it was probebly after the incident. Every school has a lockdown procedure that exists since the Columbine massacre in 1999.

       and the raw helicopter video. There are clear differences in both. It seems that the CNN video was taken even later then the raw helicopter video. Because there are more people and there is a white van next to Lanza's car which is not present in the other vid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing is that in this CNN video it uses the raw helicopter footage. But it seems to be longer then the one I showed you because it includes the swat teams getting ready to go in.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from this I deduce that the raw helicopter footage was taken before all of the shit you see on the cnn video which means it was definitly on lockdown. And still there is no conclusive footage of mass evacuation except some sketchy pictures. The pictures are sketchy because they are sparse and because the reporters on ground never seemed to make multiple pics of the same scene. Any journalist when given the oportunity will start clicking away on his camera as soon as he gets the chance. But the pics we are shown are all completely different. One of each.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its completely staged as to who is invovled and who is not I don't know. The cnn video also shows that no parents from the dead kids have been filmed. All the parents had their children with them and were very happy for them to be alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder people don't believe this bullshit, I would make a video on this but I don't have time. In the meantime im afraid you are going to have to use your brain.

       I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what the procedure is with removing the dead bodies. I don't know when they were removed. Probably not for some time. I imagine a scene with 26 dead people is going to take a fair while to process (photographs etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not talking about them though, we're talking about the surviving children leaving the building. I agree there is zero chaos in the parking lot. Why should there be? The shooting is over, there were 2 wounded (probably already transported to hospital), children are evacuated. Investigators are inside the building. What sort of scene are you expecting to see in the parking lot? A few emergency services personnel are hanging around, probably waiting to get confirmation they are no longer required at the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       The times you mention are irrelevant. They do not indicate when events happened, they indicate when CNN received that particular piece of news. The shooting happened at about 9:30am. There was at least one class of kids evacuating at 10:09am.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you are going to claim photoshop, it is indisputable that at least a handful of kids left the school and walked through the parking lot. So why did the helicopter not get footage at least of that event? Isn't it clear that the heli arrived after the evacuation?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the journalist clicking away, I imagine it's possible she took more pics than what has been published. But even if she didn't, I don't think the first thing on her mind is going to be "Man, I'd better make sure I get footage of every single child leaving the building, otherwise conspiracy theorists will say this was a hoax". Anyway, according to her she accompanied the children (presumably the ones in the photo she took) to the firehouse. They may well have been the very first group to be evacuated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm completely open-minded on this topic but it seems to me that all evidence points towards the helicopter arriving at the scene after all the surviving children were evacuated from the school. I'm just not seeing anything that convinces me otherwise.

       Have you seen the late night video images on the news were it was pretty dark and the scene was still full of people? Thats the reason why this video cannot have been taken later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your claim that this video has been taken hours after the whole thing came to an end is an indicator of how you perceive news agencies to work like. Do you actually believe that a news crew would get on the scene hours after the event and start reporting it as though it is the beginning? Doesn't make a lick of sense. New agency people are in constant contact with headquarters that is putting every person on the story. Yet you believe that they didn't know anything what was going on even though CNN was already putting up updates by the minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to see that the first video came before the other footage is the clue I pointed out in the CNN video. There is a clip in there of exactly the same helicopter from the first video. However this is a different clip that includes the swat team arriving and a white van next to Lanza's car which were not there on the first video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reporters don't need to think about conspiracy theorists when they are making pictures. First of all a reporter has his job just as a firefighter, medical staff and cops have their jobs. There is absolutly nothing a reporter can do then just cover the news. Thats his fucking job and thats what they do in every even no matter how many kids died. So don't start twisting reality again. Reporters take a massive fuckton of pictures its what they do. The pics we have been given look weird, staged almost. And there are far too few of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might not be able to piece everything together perfectly but I can smell this whole thing stinks. Just like 9/11 it is all very controlled. And just like all the other events there will be groups of people asking for inside camera footage and the likes. Do you think people will get the evidence that they ask for? Ofcourse not. The whole population will be divide between those who want more footage and those who don't need it and simply believe it because thats what the news tells them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the game keeps going on and on.

       I never said they arrived hours after the event. Elsewhere in this topic it's been suggested that it arrived at 10:30am. That's not officially confirmed, but I suspect it's pretty close to the right time. The evidence of the photographer is that she took the photo at 10:09am. The fact that there is no helicopter footage of this event proves that the helicopter had not arrived by this time. If it was there it would have filmed the children from the photograph walking across the parking lot. It did not because it wasn't there yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the photo doesn't prove that 600 children were evacuated from the school. No photographic or video evidence "proves" that. But some children were evacuated pre-helicopter. If some, then why not all? That is the most reasonable conclusion. I don't know how long it takes to evacuate 600 children so I can't say with any certainty at what time the evacuation finished. But I don't think it's unreasonable to hypothesise that evac was between 10:10 and 10:40 and helicopter arrived some time between 10:45 and 11:00.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said it's quite possible that the photographer took more photos and just didn't publish them. In her Time interview it sounded like she was a little apprehensive about even publishing one photo of distressed children. So it's understandable that there wouldn't be many others published - in any case they would be somewhat redundant as they would all be very similar - just kids walking in a line. That's a possibility, I'm not putting that forward as fact, just responding to your suggestion. If you look at some of the news footage they even blur out the faces of the children. So obviously some news outlets are sensitive about broadcasting photos of children under these circumstances.

       Thats why I quotes the CNN blog who was giving the updates. The blog said that the school was on lockdown 10:53 and that kids whent to the firehouse at 11:19. I was going on those time frames when trying to place the copter shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN's update timeline would make way more sense because the copter commetary corroborates it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose we do not go off the CNN timeline and suggest that the helicopter came an hour after evac it would make absolutly not sense for the reporter to talk about what he did with all the info at hand at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again about the pictures, it doesn't make sense. One line of 10 kids is not enough to claim 600 kids were evacuated. Not for me, and I hate when people start rationalizing why pictures are not released you have to stop that. We as a people are entitled to get all the facts and a few crying faces should not be enough to keep those facts away from the public. To believe this is a valid reason is just stupid, im sorry to say this. But this slave mentality goes against everything that I hold true.

       The truth is something nobody must touch not with emotional manipulation not with political correctness not with so called security risks (ie pentagon 9/11 footage).
There is no excuse not to disclose this footage, none at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reporters have done their job for years and are doing their job around the globe but for some reason suddenly reporters in the US start being sensitive to the victims? Cmon man, I don't want to fight with you I don't want you to feel bad at the things I say but I cannot for the life of me accept what you are telling me. It doesn't fit at all with my common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in europe btw and I have seen footage of the mass shooting in Norway, its completely different then that of the americans. Yet here everyone is trying to convice me that all is normal. Its not normal, parents cry when their children die and massacre scenes are never relaxed! So don't even try to convice me otherwise.

       The CNN timeline reflects the time of their update, not the time that things happened. For example the report of the shooting was at 10:30am whereas we know it happened about an hour before that. News takes time to filter through from official sources to news outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the photographer did in fact photograph all 600 children evacuating, can you give one reason why those photos should
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       be published, except for the purpose of countering conspiracy theories?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, one or two photographs do not prove there were 600 children evacuated. But what conclusion do you draw from that? Are you saying that there were only a handful of children in the school that day? How does that make any sense whatsoever?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was zero evidence of children being evacuated then I could understand people speculating that there were no children in the school and it was all a big hoax. But we have these photos. There were children evacuated. So why is it so hard to believe that there was a school full of children just because there are not published photos of every single child being evacuated?

       Good to see some actual investigation work! The CNN timestamps are not realtime though. At 11:19 they say the children are being taken to the firehouse, but at 11:10 they already referred to a photo of children being led away from the firehouse. So I don't think the CNN timeline establishes that they were in lockdown until 11:15. Unfortunately the heli footage doesn't show the firehouse so it's impossible to see if anybody is there already.

       If you watch that heli footage the man says that he doesn't see any children and he believes they're on lockdown. You can't exactly have tunnel vision in a helicopter, if there were kids swarming the firehouse they would've surely focused on that for some time.

       CBS story including the famous Newtown Bee pic of children being evacuated was timestamped 10:47am. If accurate, obviously means children were being evacuated before that time and depending how long it took for the photo to reach CBS and them put out the story it is possible the children were no longer at the school when the helicopter took those shots at 10:30am.

       According to this article the photographer/editor arrived at the school at 9:59am and took the photo at 10:09am. Again, if accurate, it is evidence that evacuation was under way some time before the arrival of the helicopter.

       Like you, I believe Sandy Hook narrative is packed full of lies and misinformation, but I am certain the helicopter footage time of 10.30 that you have been given is incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the orientation of the shadows on this image of
       <a href="http://timethemoment.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/ap650970505603.jpg?w=735">
        the Sandy Hook "evacuation"
       </a>
       . Note the person's shadow is parallel with the ground sign saying "drop off".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have used this site
       <a href="http://www.sunearthtools.com/dp/tools/pos_sun.php?lang=en">
        sun earth tools
       </a>
       to place a shadow marker where the person is standing in the car park of Sandy Hook school. I set the date to 14 December. The sundial time corresponding to the shadow puts it
       <strong>
        just after 10am
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you now compare the shadows on the helicopter footage, you will see that they are oriented further north, most likely somewhere between 11am and 11.30am.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, this part of the official narrative does compute. The question of how many children where evacuated at 10.09am is very much open to debate, as the only images we have show only about 20 kids in total.

       Look at the helicopter footage.  Specifically the shadow direction.  The look at google maps to figure out the direction of them(The direction is slightly NNE).  You can use that to figure out the time.  Because they are facing east the footage is from after lunch at the earliest.

       The shadows are being cast from SSE to NNW (denoting a time of approximately 11.30 am). Read my other post, above yours, for the explanation.

       I haven't paid as much attention to this story as others, but I have a question:  Even if they were wrong about the media being at the scene, how does mean that it could all be a "hoax"?  Could they have suppressed the footage for other reasons, or been told to leave that airspace during the evac, etc?

       Alright, so at 9:53 a.m. the building is clear of suspects.  Between 10 and 10:30 a.m. we have a helicopter in the air.  Is it not possible that the building had been evacuated of children before the helicopter arrived?

       I'm thinking that once the building is clear of suspects you let the kids out pronto rather than have them stay in a building with 26 corpses. And it is consistent with the photographer's timing. Plus we don't yet have confirmation of the time the helicopter arrived. But even if it was 10:30 as suggested, half an hour seems to me to be enough time for 600 kids to walk out the front door and a few yards down the road.

       Hmm... Kudos for your patience in trying to establish a timeline...
      </p>
      <p>
       However again there some minor issues about context that need clarifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The relevance of the helicopter being 'there' around 10:30am kinda rests upon 'there' being in  the air over the school. Or 'there' as in on the job, accounting for preparation, loading, travel time and then arrival... perhaps I'm naive but the lack of any time stamp, or the stations insistence for footage with one seems odd, if its from around 10:30am its a major exclusive scoop, if its from  later then its stock filler footage... 
Hmm... also, from where did it travel?... But that's just nit-picking...
      </p>
      <p>
       The lockdown?... Apparently its claimed to have lasted until well after 11am? Can this be confirmed officially? It would help to establish a time line linking these events, and put your patient efforts into context...

       The school "nurse" Sally Cox said she wasn't evacuated until well after 1PM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did ANYONE see her actually leave the school?

       Also, any footage of nuns ON the school premises (as opposed to @ the fire house)?

       The police would try to get the kids out of the school as soon as safely possible. They would not leave the kids there. There might be booby traps or explosives and the entire school wasnt secured for some time, as they did at least two sweeps to secure it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The WCBS video showed the police dog at Lanza's car. It was probably an explosives dog, looking for evidence the car was rigged with explosives. That possibility had to be eliminated as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was an active developing crime scene. The Fire  Dept was also staged some distance away, as the scene was not yet determined to be safe.

       All are standard public safety procedures.

       Absolutely right. The only other time you will see long shadows like that is in the later afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone could google the schools layout / orientation and measure any known height object near the school &amp; it's shadow and get a real time stamp for that day of the year.

       I assume someone in the school called 911 shortly after 9:35, and that police were dispatched. I know news stations listen to police radio. So, if the news station learned of the event that way, I can understand that they'd send a helicopter right away, rather than needlessly waiting until they got word that an evacuation began. Am I missing something?

       Let me ask you this.. were you there? Or are you, like everyone else here basing your theories on bad reporting and misinformation? Silly coincidences like photos of people supposedly "crisis actors"..
      </p>
      <p>
       A photo of a dead girl that the government in all their cloak and dagger secrecy forgot to hide away and broadcast on the news? (turned out to be her sister) Cmon its horseshit ...
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel terrible for the loss those parents endured.. I have two young children myself and our own school recently had a threat.. It's not a joke and i am not amused. If anything happened to my kids i don't know what i would do. To make light of an incident like this by calling it a hoax is inhuman . But hey maybe you are right and the government staged an elaborate hoax just to amend the 2nd amendment in an ultimate goal to declare martial law and disrupt our day to day lives like a sci-fi movie because why not right? i mean it's not like the system is working right now so lets break it and create dissent and civil unrest.

       Now im no Obama supporter but here's my theory.. All of the people who decry him and make him out to be the antichrist are just racist assholes.. end of theory

       The exact same could be said for anyone saying the official story is true.
I'm not denying that people were killed or accusing parents of "acting"...
To me it just seems like a false flag event in order to ramp up gun control.

       I'm not accusing him of being the antichrist but I completely hate Obama.
It doesn't make me racist. He could be any colour. IDGAF.

       You say you don't give a fuck but you do. Hes the first black president and with that title came alot of heat. As an American it is your God given right to hate him all you like but what does hating him do? Nothing. False flag event ? 9/11 i believe was a false flag event.. sandy hook? no my friend I don't buy it.. it was some mental kid who got his hands on his moms gun and lost it.. Next thing people will say was the gov't was using mind control on him to make him do it..  Hey believe what you want imho. I doubt you will lose your guns.. I just don't see it happening.. more obstacles to purchasing guns sure.. but how many guns do you really need? Do you live in a war zone?

       Okay first off... you have absolutely no right to accuse me of being racist simply because I hate Obama... I'm not racist in the slightest. I hate Obama, I hate Bush, I hate Romney... I pretty much hate all politicians in general... and if you want to know my political stance the closest thing would be Libertarian... Secondly I'm not even American... I'm from that pseudo-communist nation known as Canada... Ontario to be specific. Not that any of that was any of your business... I hate when people get the nerve to tell me how I feel on issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not forcing you to believe Sandy Hook was false flag. All I'm saying was that it's etremely fishy... and the fact that they are using this event and the theatre shooting to push gun-control makes me even more suspicious. I'm keeping an open-mind to the possibility it was false flag... I doubt we'll even know one way or another.

       I was shown something from youtube, showing it was a hoax, but as much as I would not like to believe that our government would do something this fucked up, I cant argue with evidence. Plus isn't it strange that around this same time, we have a lot of incidents like this being covered by the media, but it doesn't show what the positive sides to owning a gun can do? Its a conspiracy man

       Regardless of your disagreement with this user, name-calling is never appropriate in this subreddit. Logically make your arguments against what is being said, but do not force the devolution of conversation/debate.

       Do not call people shills going forward or you will be banned. I have messaged this particular user, and will take action accordingly.

       Define "Media".  I consider myself and my cell phone "media" for all intents and purposes.  The corporate hacks with their financial constraints didn't show up until later, but I don't see evidence that 600 children were ever in that school on that day, or lead from the school to the firehouse by their parents or whatever that pro-law enforcement fluff piece you link to claims.

       Whatever happened at Sandy Hook it is being exploited by all sides.  If it was real they did a very bad job of reporting on it, and a lot of people with cell phone images and video at the scene are really fucking stupid for not selling that to the criminally negligent corporate news agencies.  If it didn't happen then the news agencies and every human being involved in the deception is criminally responsible for the conspiracy.  Either way there are people being deceptive and making a huge controversy about gun control when this is a perfect example of how gun prohibition doesn't actually stop crime.  The strict gun laws in CT didn't prevent this violent crime, and they don't prevent violent crime nationally.  This entire event has been used to distract us from the real issues and conspiracies affecting the entire world, for example the LIBOR rigging scandal.  Notice the corporate owned 24-hour news agencies don't have time to talk about that one anymore?  What about the mortgage and eviction fraud?  Nope.

       McNamara never approved Operation Northwoods, and Kennedy fired the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs after hearing the ridiculous proposal.

       I mean best case scenario is we go back to the Wild West. Have duels on the street to settle disputes. I bet you'd see a drop in people acting a fool killing innocents....and a rise in innocents killing fools. I can't wait to hear the news cast, "soccer mom saves day with savvy SAW skills, marine husband taught her all she needed"
