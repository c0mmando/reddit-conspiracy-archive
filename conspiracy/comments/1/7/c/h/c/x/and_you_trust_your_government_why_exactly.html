        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just wrote this. Figured you guys would like it, and maybe critique it to make it better. </p>

<p>&quot;While you are here thinking that our government is taking away or guns because it is &quot;an epidemic harming people&quot; and that their intent is to protect you, let&#39;s look at this over here. They are off bombing Yemen, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan. The Patriot Act which allows law enforcement and federal agencies &quot;to search telephone, e-mail, and financial records without a court order, and the expanded access of law enforcement agencies to business records, including library and financial records.&quot;, was re-passed with, to my knowledge, no changes despite the massive uproar considering it&#39;s unconstitutional nature. They recently passed legislation that allows for your indefinite detention of american citizens with no trial. You can now be a suspected terrorist subject to warrantless wire tapping and searching of your records, and indefinite detention on their discretion. </p>

<p>Not one banker who caused the 2008 stock market crash has been jailed or even brought to trial. No legislation has been passed the prevent the same thing from occurring in the future. All the people who made millions, if not billions, off of gambling with your life saving got away clean and most kept the money. These same companies have funded and supported every major presidential candidate of at least the last decade. </p>

<p>The federal reserve, which issues all of the money that you use, is essentially a private institution which, instead of being regulated by your government, is essentially regulating our government. It is a debt based system. Every dollar you own is a piece of debt, If the US debt was paid off, there would be no money in circulation and the economy would crash. When we run out of money, the fed simply prints more money, causing inflation which diminshes the dollars you own. Every hundred dollars you save for retirement, is worth less each time you put a new hundred in. Your money is just a piece of paper at the whim of the bankers, a subsection of people whom I think everyone hates at this point, who control it. </p>

<p>Your governments spends in 10 days what it would take the feed everyone on this planet for a year. 50% of the people on this planet are starving in poverty living on under $10 a day. If 2% of the money that was spent conquering other nations for their oil or for &quot;pre-emptive striking&quot; nations where half of their population is within days of death at all times, 4 billion people could live exponentially better lives. Let&#39;s just think about that for a second; if your whole life you were days away from dying when you received your next glass of water or meal, and someone came in and made it so you never had to be scared about starving to death ever again, wouldn&#39;t you love them? Wouldn&#39;t you fight for them? Wouldn&#39;t you beat the shit out of or kill anyone who opposed them? If 2% of our money spent destroying nations who would have probably all died before they could even have hurt us, was used to help those people instead we would have an army of 4 billion people. 4. billion. It would end war on this planet. IF 2% OF THE MONEY SPENT ON WAR WAS SPENT ON PEACE IT WOULD END WAR. PERIOD. Do you really believe that the point here is to help people? to end war? to protect you or our species?</p>

<p>Your government drastically buffed up the president&#39;s martial law capacity (Executive Order 13603), and FEMA can essentially run the country in the event of a disaster. The DHS just purchased 18 million rounds so deadly they are prohibited by the geneva convention. I&#39;m sure plenty of you have heard about hundreds of tanks getting shipped around the US or even seen them for yourself. They are preparing for something, but what is it?</p>

<p>Mass shootings make up 0.003% of gun violence, yet that seems to be the major driving factor in taking away the guns. according to FBI.gov records: more people are killed by hammers and fists than by ARs, there was no change in AW crime rates during the AW ban (Columbine happened during the AW ban), gun crime has been cut in half in the last 20 years with no changes to gun control, 98% of guns are never fired and 99.9% are not used in crimes. According to the dictionary, AW&#39;s aren&#39;t fully automatic (Full auto weapons have been banned for decades), and they are simply long range pistols that look scarier. </p>

<p>As of the 2013 NDAA the government can legal spread false information in the media to sway your opinion for whatever they wish you to believe. When 3 corporations own pretty much everything you read in the newspaper or see on TV, it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to get you to believe what they want you to believe instead of the truth.</p>

<p>And after all this, you trust them with your safety and you trust them to have a monopoly on weapons in the US? Good luck.&quot;</p>

<p>Things to add/modify:</p>

<p>As of this year, the constitution is essentially void of meaning and can be bypassed by our government.</p>

<p>mention the whole thing about mental health and taking away guns being reactive not proactive. Mental health would be a much better way to address mass shootings. </p>

<p>and most importantly, this hardly all encompassing is the tip of the ice berg regarding what is going on that most people don&#39;t know about it. If this scares you or makes you think even a little, you should look further into it because this isn&#39;t even 0.01% of all the information about this.</p>

<p>thanks for reading guys. no fear! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Power is the only truth for those who hide their machinations behind the auspices of the state.</p>

<p>And no this has not changed in the last 30 years.</p>

<p>What had changed is that the internet allows people to ignore the fascist media/gatekeepers and talk about it.</p>

<p>Both parties are bought by the same bunch of criminals.</p>

<p>And when I point this out in this toilet I get mass down voted.</p>

<p>Nothing happens in politics that the facsisti don&#39;t want.</p>

<p>Bush solution = put the banksters in his cabinet and bail them out.</p>

<p>Obama solution = put more banksters in his cabinet and give them more.</p>

<p>Bushs oil policy = subsidies are great</p>

<p>Bushs department of fatherland security = start it</p>

<p>Obamas department of fatherland security = expand it</p>

<p>Bushs internet = 3rd world internet is fine</p>

<p>obamas internet =bandwidth caps are even better</p>

<p>bushs wars = start them</p>

<p>obama wars = privatize and expand them</p>

<p>bushs prisons = privatize them so that the police state cannot be dismantled.</p>

<p>obamas prisons = build more</p>

<p>bushs education fuck education</p>

<p>obama education = fuck education</p>

<p>bushs social security = almost no cost of living increases,and cut where possible</p>

<p>obama social security = one small increase during selection year, and cut where possible(500 billion due to obamacare)</p>

<p>obamas health care policy = romneys health care policy</p>

<p>But but but.... gay marriage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Flag burning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>please elaborate. Please note that I by no means provided a fact for every opinion, but I have those opinions as a result of being convinced by the facts. I know in the eyes of a skeptic that sentence means nothing without sourcing but I honestly don&#39;t have time to source every single thing I research. Well actually I am working on a database that has about 150 hours of things I have researched (and that doesn&#39;t include the research time) just the length of the videos, filmsand articles that I&#39;ve compiled so far. Probably only 5% of the time I spend researching this stuff is included in that 150 hours. Again, this probably means nothing in the eyes of a skeptic, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not open to 150 hours of reading/viewing material, but I figured it was worth saying anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right, of course, except for one thing. The whole idea of mental health being a way to address mass shootings after listing statistics that show that mass shootings aren&#39;t a real threat.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obama-asks-doctors-help-deal-guns_696121.html">This</a> is a slippery slope that essentially gives the doctor the ability to regulate an individual&#39;s life. If the doc says you can&#39;t own a gun, this will be enforced by the government. Can&#39;t breed, drive, etc. because you have a &quot;risk factor&quot; will become the norm.

    <div class="md"><p>Well when I say mental health I meant more broadly. educated parents and children on psychology. Allowing kids and adults alike to get therapy and otherwise and just an overall more educated society. The overwhelming majority of mental illness is the result of poor parenting and if parents were educated on psychology and how they affect their kids things would be a lot better I think. I&#39;m not saying we medicate everybody or give people pills to fix the problem; I am aware that that often just makes it worse and is not the answer regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately the pills are exactly what will happen. The Pharma companies basically took over the DSM 5 and added tons of new &quot;syndromes&quot; that docs will be medicating you for and restricting your rights for. The doctors will simply be doing what they understand as &quot;best practices&quot;. Kids will be medicated in school. This is not a worst case scenario. This is by design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is where real healthcare/mentalcare reform needs to happen, rather then treat the symptoms with &quot;pills&quot; we need to find and deal with the cause, our current method is like throwing out the baby with the bath water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent summary. The only thing I would add is that the Executive doesn&#39;t just have the right of indefinite detention, but (also through NDAA 2012 &amp; 2013), the President now has the right to have ANYBODY legally MURDERED for whatever reason he/she so chooses, without indictment, trial or any due process. </p>

<p>Better known as the &quot;Presidential Kill List&quot;, these murders are carried out by unmanned drones, but there is no reason to believe that the President will not delegate these powers to other humans at some point in the future.</p>
