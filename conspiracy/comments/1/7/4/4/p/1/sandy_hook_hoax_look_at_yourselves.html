        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe in the illuminatti, or at least the top people coming together to shoot the shit. I believe that the government had something to do with 9/11, if not play an active part then at least let in happen. I believe that there are aliens somewhere out there. I believe that there was more than 1 shooter of JFK etc etc.</p>

<p>But this theory that the sandy hook shootings were somehow staged to take away gun rights is very hard to swallow. Of course the first reports are going to show some discrepancies. That goes with all breaking news stories. second of all these kids are DEAD as in not living anymore, they are not hidden somewhere and they were not made up.</p>

<p>Just like the theater shooting it is just some crazy dude trying to go out with a bang, it isn&#39;t the government trying to take way your guns. If it was they could have just done it after columbine or just waited for one to occur naturally to do it, not stage (yet another) one.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disaster">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disaster</a> - That is the story of the worst mass murder of a school in history it occurred in 1927. And yet you don&#39;t hear about it. Do you think the government had something to do with that to? Shit like this happens no matter what time period. And tainting these kids lives with your stories full of holes isn&#39;t helping shit. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t want you guns taken away, hey, maybe call your local congressman and complain. If that doesn&#39;t work get off your lazy asses from in front of the computer and start a revolution with those guns you so desperately cling to</p>

Without them it doesn&#39;t matter how conspiracy prone people are.  You need organization to spread this bs as fast as it did.  Many people pushing this are veteran conspiracy mongers with connections to the patriot movement and a variety of cults.

Everyone listen to him, he&#39;s generalizing a population.  Second would be superwinner.  He too seems to be a spokesperson for people other than himself.  He also takes the role of a psychologist, just as media does when bashing conspiracy theorists. Then, we have hookerzsuck.  That has to be the most blatant indication of his standing.  Then links the worst article I have ever seen (salon article).  Notice the upvotes as well.  How do they get so many, while everyone else is so few on points?</p>

<p>And the real kicker. Instead of a point by point dissection of events, they link you to that garbage. Look at it. It&#39;s all around us.</p>

<p>Yes, sometimes the police do, in fact, have more than they need. It&#39;s politics and empire-building: &quot;I have all this stuff already, but the only way to increase my political power is to get more, so why not?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>then why worry about the rednecks?  if you have your almighty military you should encourage the populous to arm themselves to the teeth since it doesn&#39;t make any difference..   But there is that little Asymmetric warfare that has bankrupt this country. Plus we haven&#39;t won a single war or police action since WW2.  If guys on horse back living in the mountains gave the best/most powerful military force the world has ever known a run for its money..   I think the fine patriots of this country would give them an even better fight. Plus the fight will be in their backyard and they will finally see what war is like for themselves.  Fucking war pigs.. Colbert and Stewart are just promoting their corporate propaganda. Believe what you like. And lets hope the time doesn&#39;t come when people are getting their heads cut off in the streets because of their treasonous actions and beliefs.  </p>

<p>I will just say that the people of Afghanistan have fought for the last 100 years, they are a hard people who live in a hard country so it is not surprising that they are good fighters.</p>

<p>The American people have lived in comparative luxury for the last 100 years, especially the last two decades. Comfy beds, heated water on tap, electricity at the switch of a button, cheap petrol, luxury cars. Compare the two nations and then tell me that you really believe the average American is tougher than the average Afghani.

If they have to be at war for a few decades with the very people they make money from through taxes and what not than they lose out on a shit ton of money.

    <div class="md"><p>Our difference of opinion stems from a different meaning of win.  Do they have superior fighting power? Yes.  Could they use that to destroy us? Yes.  But would they accomplish anything other than losing a ton of money which everyone wants more of? No.  That would be a war they would spend money to fight, lose money on killing otherwise tax paying citizens, and then have to rebuild all the parts of their country they fucked up.  We don&#39;t have to win in the traditional sense, we just have to make it non profitable.  If they cant make money off of it they wont do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you retarded?  they destroyed nothing.  The people knew it would come to a asymmetric fight.. so they did what anyone would do. They left the large target areas and blended in.  then  they slowly drug us down and made it their war. We lost and left and nothing changed besides the infrastructure..  The only way they could stop the fighting was to pay them to not attack us.  LOL.. that&#39;s not how you win a war or an occupation.  Now look at Afghanistan..  These guys on horse back fucked our world up and we spent the next 4 generations of retirement and bankrupted this country.   if that&#39;s winning.. i would hate to see when we lose.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know the history of the Iraq War? Their military was met in battle many times and effectively destroyed and then disbanded once Saddam was overthrown. Also their war? You don&#39;t seem to really know much about that is happening in Iraq right now I&#39;m afraid. </p>

<p>Afghanistan, again I feel you miss the real picture. It is NOT a war of attrition, we do not win by killing more of them than they do of us so by using casualty rates as a mark of who is winning or not does not compute. </p>

<p>We win by creating Democratic institutions and by allowing people to be secure enough that they can have faith in these institutions. This is the process the country is going through right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not so sure about that tbh. It is a very different case but there is precedent set by the American Civil War of Americans killing their fellow countrymen. </p>

<p>Strong leaders and strong political indocrination would also help convince them to pull the trigger, as with all wars.  </p>

<p>People would cease to be civilians when they join a militia and take up arms against the government but become combatants. Weather Underground and others who oppose the Government have been killed by the military or police. The US Military I am sure would not have a problem killing other US citizens, other American Institutions do this all the time, the Police, CIA, FBI all of whom are American themselves and would have families. Sure a few would refuse, but then a few also refuse to kill foreigners. </p>

<p>I do not think it would be framed like that either, I do not think there will be a line and you&#39;re on one side or the other, some might form militias etc but imo that would only make it easier for the US Military to kill them, rather than families etc protecting their homes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? What are you talking about? There is absolutely zero chance that they will pass laws that take away all the guns from people who currently own then.</p>

<p>It... would be retarded. What <em>cant</em> the government do successfully right now that they would be able to do when the minority of people mostly is rural areas gave up their non-automatic weapons? What would be worth pissing off thousands of people who aren&#39;t a real threat to anybody but other citizens? I can understand other conspiracy theories. 9/11 was an excuse to start an illegal war/pharmaceutical companies are hiding legitimate cures to diseases, but the idea that they would engineer the murder of a bunch of kids to disarm a bunch of rednecks who aren&#39;t a real threat is just idiotic.</p>

<p>Which part of this do you doubt?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Got you confused with another poster in this thread with whom I was having a conversation explicitly about gun control. Sorry.</p>

<p>I was only mentioning that <em>of all the armed services</em> the military is the <em>least</em> likely to fire the first shot on other Americans. If there is already a war on, then all bets are off. I realize I wasn&#39;t very clear about that. In fact, I incorrectly said they wouldn&#39;t do it. I meant to make that sound a lot more conditional.</p>

<p>I only wanted to distinguish the way they&#39;re trained from the fact that police fire on US citizens all the time and won&#39;t have a huge mental block about it as long as they feel they&#39;re doing it for a good reason.</p>

Just by the brief interaction I&#39;ve had with you I know that you&#39;re a danger to the American people. Like I told another asshole on here just a half hour ago, I&#39;m done with this sub. You aggressive bullies make it impossible to have civil discourse.

    <div class="md"><p>I only visit this sub like I visit the zoo, too watch the monkeys throw poo. I could care less if you don&#39;t find me civil I think the talk of war/revolution, without regards for the toll on quality life or human life is absolutely disgusting, so if your offended by &quot;aggressive bullies&quot;, then you should really consider how you would fair once the drones started firing Hellfire missiles down your block, or how you would feel cleaning up your neighbors kids body parts from your roof. </p>

<p>I&#39;m amazed at how little people realize about war, but then I remember that most of you have lived such a comfortable life for so long that you have forgotten how good the federal government has been to you. Sure the fed does somethings wrong and its not perfect but to actually sit around and contemplate an overthrow of that same system when their are literally 100000000000000000 millions of ways to go about affecting real change, is borderline psycho. </p>

<p>The federal government is made up of people, its not an inanimate object. You would have Americans fighting Americans, cause Americans elected Americans to run the country the way a majority of Americans wanted, but Americans didn&#39;t want a country that way, so they went to war with Americans, so then Americans killed other Americans, because Americans didn&#39;t like Americans, and Americans had to bury their children while Americans buried their children and in the end, we decide this is fucking stupid and go back to the way things were before..... Its fucking total nonsense. </p>

<p>Most of the people on this thread wouldn&#39;t know how to hunt, fish, farm or live off the land, most of these people wouldn&#39;t have any clue how to survive in the winter, or in the summer, or how to purify water, or how to clean a weapon, etc. but these same idiots will gleefully point the way to destruction and despair without a single though of the fickleness of their behavior. </p>

<p>I fought so you didn&#39;t have to. I didn&#39;t fight so I could come back home and fight some more, and if I can keep people from having to experience war I will. I can&#39;t do it when mouthbreathers assume that regulations on gun ownership= gun bans, and that we should take up arms against the &quot;tyrannical&quot; government. Trust me you have never seen a tyrannical government and if you did you would be the first person to fall in line, cause a truly tyrannical government doesn&#39;t make you want to live, they make you beg to die.  </p>

<p>So yeah I get a little pissed when I hear po&#39;dunk rednecks who don&#39;t know the difference between an APC and a tank, talk about how they are going to take up arms. I have yet to get an answer from any of them as to how you plan to achieve air superiority, which even a half ass no brain &quot;butterbar&quot; can tell you is essential to achieving victory in any meaningful sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. <strong>Some</strong> Afghans oppose America’s involvement in their Country. </p>

<p>Have they stopped them? Clearly not. America is still there and will be there for the next two decades at least, with the support of the elected representatives of the Afghan people. </p>

<p>The Taliban make up a small portion of the Afghan population, they never had full control of the country and have been battled and defeated by the Northern Alliance for decades. </p>

<p>The Soviet Unions defeat is much more complicated than ‘the Afghans beat them with Aks’. America funded and armed the Mujahideen for a start with stinger missiles and advanced weapons which could effectively attack Soviet Air power, something which gives NATO the winning edge in the Afghan conflict. The Soviet Union was in it’s death throws for the last years of the war and was economically unstable (thanks in no small part to their war in Afghanistan). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your comments and i guess i generalized mine.  What I&#39;m saying is that &quot;long guns&quot; can do a lot when fighting a larger or better funded enemy.  I recall in the movie Restrepo, the unit in FOB Restrepo knew they could be pinned down and overtaken with a few automatic weapons.  This could not be obtained with pistols or guns with 7 round mags.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed Restrepo was great at showing what a small badly equipped enemy can do to a superior force. </p>

<p>However although it was bad for those particular soldiers arguably it had not effect on the overall campaign. It is sad and demoralising for soldiers to fight in the way they were forced to in Restrepo but I would argue that this does not effect the overall result of the war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then the only response I have is that there is no goal that gun control legislation furthers that is worth organizing a school shooting. There are so many better, more passive, ways of controlling public opinion that I would say it&#39;s retarded to think sandy hook was a good decision.</p>

<p>If you imagine their goal is to disarm the public, we&#39;re already disarmed. The people who get behind gun control laws are people who don&#39;t own guns and don&#39;t plan to own guns. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve been following the news lately, but that&#39;s the majority of people. (Not that the majority of people want more gun control, but that the majority of people don&#39;t own guns.)</p>

<p>So if they&#39;re trying to disarm the people, too late. We&#39;re disarmed. What&#39;s the next step? Domination? Whoever would be in charge of that... is already in charge. There is nothing else to gain there.</p>

<p>Because I can&#39;t ascribe any sensible motivation that would be so worth having that somebody would orchestrate such a horrific tragedy, I can&#39;t give any credibility to any theory like this.</p>

I see some weird things about it, but nowhere near enough evidence to leap to the conclusion that it was an inside job.  And to your point yes I believe they have without legislating it.  They have made guns as taboo as teenage pregnancy to talk about.  I just believe they are trying to legislate it now that they believe they have swayed the public opinion on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok pandagurl, let me ask you this. if one of your friends died, and you heard of all these people claiming this person did not exist, would you not go on to make a youtube video (or something along those lines) saying HEY YOU BASTARDS, LOOK! Here is a picture of us on her 13th birthday at chucky cheese, and here&#39;s a picture from this time we did this and that, here&#39;s a text message she sent me a few days before he/she died. etc. I know i would have done that.</p>

<p>and don&#39;t you dare say they are too young to be doing that shit, cuz they are not. when i was 4 or 5 i was killing shit on the computer. my 2 year old (21 month old to be exact) knows how to use a fucking iPad.</p>

<p>and yes i agree lots of the people on here are nuts. but not all of the nuts are stupid (although many are). because these people became nuts from having the facts, and realizing everything they ever knew was a lie. the truth is everything is a lie, and everything is a conspiracy. imagine everyone laughing at you thinking you&#39;re an idiot when you know the truth, you&#39;ll go crazy. the only things that aren&#39;t really conspiracy&#39;s are most gang shootings, but even those are the fault of the media and government. there are a lot of over crazy people though that i wanna smack the stupid out of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, i will use sadny hook as an example of what is wrong with you! the whole world is laughing at you. this information didn&#39;t just come from anywhere. i really don&#39;t give a flying fuck if they are actors or not. they are not my concern. my concern is the children! THERE ARE CAMERAS IN THE SCHOOL. THERE WERE HELICOPTERS THERE FILMING THE WHOLE TIME! WHERE THE FUCK IN THESE VIDEOS DOES IT SHOW CHILDREN BEING EVACUATED, THAT&#39;S ALL I WANT TO SEE.</p>

<p>How is is that they have a video of the florida school board shooting  ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6PeC6NTnpY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6PeC6NTnpY</a> ) but not one for sandy hook? this video was released immediately.</p>

<p>and lets say children did die, which i&#39;m not saying didn&#39;t happen. that does not excuse these actors. They most definitely lied about the guns used, and they most definitely lied about either who the shooter was, or how many there were. WHY IS THERE NOT ONE INJURED? JUST 1? IT IS UNHEARD OF! you are a fool! and honestly, i do feel bad for these people being harassed even if they are actors. they are only doing what they see is right, or threatened in to doing it.</p>

<p>Why is it that all the articles/videos debunking this &quot;conspiracy&quot; have NOT 1 GOOD POINT. NOT 1! especially when they talk about the little girl who &quot;died&quot; in the picture with obama the day after. saying &quot;it looks like her&quot; i&#39;ve seen the family photo and i am not a fool. You&#39;re speaking to someone who has been interrogated by the feds first hand, both american and canadian. and i&#39;ve only been the the US once in my life, to watch the Buffalo Bills vs The Philadeplhia Eagles</p>

    <div class="md"><p>everything is a lie. and what you say isn&#39;t true. as i&#39;ve been in to this kinda of shit since i was 11 and i noticed weird things on the media that didn&#39;t seem realistic to me. everything is a lie, it really is. and i&#39;m not saying it in ways that are crazy. life is beautiful, and i do enjoy my life. also i&#39;ll tell you this, you don&#39;t have to be a conspiracy theorist to know fox news is bullshit. fox news of all news channels in the world is probably the worst, and tell you just how stupid a human being is.
and you&#39;re right, i don&#39;t have to look in to it for everything. but i do... why wouldn&#39;t i? if the whole world is being affected by these lies, of course i&#39;ll look in to it more. can we change anything? not really, unless the people start a militia, which they would do anywhere but north america.</p>

<p>and be a little more clean? they don&#39;t need to be. there is a quote that i do not remember very well, but it is about handing someone your own noose to gain trust, and that&#39;s what they do.</p>

<p>i take it you are american. however, i am not. but i know a lot about your country, and so does the rest of the world. the rest of the world is not nearly as brainwashed as the United States of America. In America, patriotism is a big thing (correct me if you feel i&#39;m wrong on anything i say). You guys love your country, and show a great deal of respect to the forefathers of your country. But somehow, even though your country was created because &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; that happened to be true a long time ago, and the same thign is happening now, you guys somehow don&#39;t see that. The forefathers warned you that this will happen again. They didn&#39;t say maybe, they said it will. Because it is human nature to want power &amp; money, and there will always be someone trying to get power. always. the fight for freedom is ever lasting. not one war. It&#39;s strange to me that for a country who loves it&#39;s forefathers so much, people are just waking up now cuz of gun control.</p>

<p>&quot;The beauty of the second amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it.&quot; -Thomas Jefferson</p>

My lame ass of a country gave your country permission, to not ask permission for the military to come here and do whatever it is they please. like i said they are in this together. you&#39;re under the impression that i don&#39;t know many americans, but i do, from all over. and i do know many smart ones. so i hope you don&#39;t think i&#39;m saying all americans are as dumb as you are.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UryciFTWTP4">what if china had military bases in your country</a> how would you feel about that? you&#39;re actually going to tell me i don&#39;t know your country? you&#39;re pathetic. everyone does. it&#39;s why we all laugh at people like you. have you ever been tackled and arrested by US Secret in your country? Nearly shot by 50 guys that literally came out of bushes in seconds? No? ...I have, IN CANADA (toronto to be exact)! so fuck you! and fuck the united states government!</p>

nature has a lot to do with this to. for example, it only takes one person to lead. for example, if you&#39;re in heavy traffic on the highway, not moving at all, you&#39;re there for an hour, or 2, even 3. one person will eventually decide FUCK THIS SHIT, i&#39;m going to drive on the shoulder. then you&#39;ll see another, and then moer and more people will start doing it. it just takes one person to lead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“The government encouraged the manufacture and importation of firearms for the criminals to use. This is intended to foster a feeling of insecurity, which would lead the American people to voluntarily disarm themselves by passing laws against firearms. Using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients in a process called Orion, the CIA inculcated the desire in these people to open fire on schoolyards and thus inflame the ant-igun lobby. This plan is well under way, and so far is working perfectly. The middle class is begging the government to do away with the 2nd Amendment.”</p>

<p>This is from 1990 written by Bill Cooper. The idea of staging school shootings is nothing new. I&#39;m not saying this proves that Sandy Hook was staged, but it&#39;s not like the idea came out of nowhere. This is the modus operandi of those in Power (I&#39;m not referring to POTUS by the way, or any politician).</p>

<p>Answer me this why can a guy who killed his mother when he was 14 be able to buy a gun when he is of age? because he committed this crime as a juvenile and they can&#39;t see his history. so he buys tons of guns and stock piles them and plans to shoot a lot of people. But they catch him before he does anything. </p>

<p>Why can he buy a gun? We need better laws with guns. If you are clean then it shouldn&#39;t matter to you.</p>

<p>I dont like guns either but I live in NYC where cops just shoot you for no reason. 
Bad times are coming my friend. The dollar will not be able to buy anything soon and when that happens people get angry. 
The folks in charge know this. So whenever they get an opportunity they disarm the people.
There are just as many shootings in ny. But Bloombergs pushed out the poor and made nyc for rich men like himself. Dont let the peasants get mad. Hand guns to cops who barely went to college and couldnt do anything else. </p>
