       He was the first parent to speak. His daughter is accused of not being murdered. I dont know if I was him Id make another statement calling everyone insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also he said he was a Physical Assistant. Has anyone found any proof of this? Patients or the people he worked with?

       My aunt lost my cousin about 3 weeks ago in a freak accident. Im starting to doubt this guy bec she doesnt smile at all neither does her father. And she was 29.

       Hmm... Why?

       Why should he?... I do not know why he chose to speak to the media, why he exposed himself to the unflinching gaze of the camera... But...

       I also do not have any context other than that snap-shot of a few seconds with which to judge the 'sincerity' of his pain and grief.
      </p>
      <p>
       To generalise from this 'snap-shot'' to dismiss with absolute certainty the effects of grief, pain and the icy numbness of the loss of a child, speaks more about our humanity, our values and our character, than his 'legitimacy' as a parent.

       I've only ever seen somebody laugh like that shortly after the death of a family member or close friend if they were reminiscing about something funny or crazy. However, this has always been when talking a out an adult who has had a long enough life that the pain and grief can be tempered by laughter. As a parent, I can tell you there is nothing to laugh about when your child is murdered. They haven't been on this planet long enough to have earned those kinds of stories. The death of a child is too raw.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why the fuck does he start hyperventilating to get some tears going? That right there is some straight up method actor exercise going on.

       John Bowlby published a paper describing what he called "disordered mourning", some telltale signs that a grieving person was experiencing this are positive emotions of pride and cheerfulness, as well as optimism and the appearance of being in good spirits.

       Do you have children? Do you know anyone close to you that has had children that died? I've witnessed this grieving process more than I like to admit and never have I seen the look on their face that this phony had.

       That's your uneducated opinion. I see it as a person who was struck with emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you say he is acting, prove it. It should be very easy to show that these people are all actors. But you can't, so instead you pretend to know they are acting.

       I'm uneducated? You know nothing about me. You attack people with vitriol because of their beliefs. You're a hate filled person who, for some reason, either gets off on (or gets paid to) ridiculing people who post here. I'm done with you and I'm done (again) with this sub.

       I said "uneducated opinion", which in the context of our conversation meant you aren't trained on the subject of recognizing whether people are acting on television on not, so it is unwise to pretend to

        know

       The basis of your argument here seems to be "I'm a parent and I've witnessed parents grieve for their children. They did not react in the same way as Robbie Parker did in a YouTube video. Therefore, Robbie Parker was an actor."

       Fair enough. You're entitled to your worldview. And I don't have evidence that will convince you.

       I would say that looking at the bigger picture shows that something is wrong with Sandy Hook. Any one element in a vacuum can be easily explained away. It's the pile of discrepancies that bothers me.

       But I hate reading a memorial page for dead children and seeing "fucking actors! die in a fire bitch! alex jones proved you're all actors! /spit" and coming here seeing people spread these and similar stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a son that is breastfeeding and he sleeps with me and my wife, I find myself thinking of that fucking nutbag entering that school and hunting babies. Then I get angry knowing people are out there trying to pass it off as fake because they want to turn it into a gun debate issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me feel better every time I talk to someone who fell for this hoax nonsense and I give them the proper information that debunks the stuff someone posted on their facebook. One less angry person to harass grieving parents.

       But a shooter gunning down children in Sandy Hook is also a gut feeling, stemming from the same lack of evidence. This is what's most fustrating for me, that one conspiracy theory is acceptable and one isn't, simply because of what side the obviously corrupt media and government come down on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you STILL believe everything they tell you without evidence? Even when they tell you that your own eyes lie? There's no footage of Lanza in the school despite an expensive camera system on property. There's no footage of Lanza at ALL, save ONE file photo they show repeatedly. There was no televised evacuation of 600 children, even though it allegedly happened while there were any number of news helicopters flying over head. There's one file photo of one adult with a handful of kids in a line. Nothing else. That might wash with you, but this isn't my first media circus, it
       <em>
        stinks
       </em>
       to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, there's no hard evidence to support ANY story here. All we the public really have is what we can see, which is delivered by the admittedly corrupt media.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again I ask you, are you really going to sit there and tell me that your theory is right and my theory is wrong because the media and the government, known liars, are on YOUR side? That's the only proof you have, and you expect me to honor it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I refuse.

       There's no footage of students being evacuated because the helicopters weren't there until after. A reporter for the local newspaper took that famous photo of the evacuation, it was at 10:09am, the earliest report of a helicopter was at 10:30am.

       If you wanted to know the truth you would stop clinging onto questions that have already been debunked over and over. Asking questions is fine but continuing to claim foul after being shown incorrect means you just don't like the answer and never will.

       I don't have press credentials, nor am I affiliated with a press agency with any pull. I don't expect I'd get very far.

       I don't think a press pass is going to secure security footage owned by a public school that is currently in an ongoing police investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the Columbine pictures and videos were leaked, not released and the police were in shit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Families of some victims are outraged, and said that the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office has failed to keep a promise that the photos would never leave that office.
       </p>
       <p>
        "People don't want the pictures of their dead kids circulating on the Internet, which it appears likely is what's going to happen," said Brian Rohrbough, whose son Dan was one of the 13 killed when shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold rampaged through the school on April 20, 1999.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rocky Mountain News has copies of a number of the photos, as do some Columbine families.
       </p>
       <p>
        County officials were stunned Monday upon learning of the leak.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Oh my God," said Assistant County Attorney Lily Oeffler.

       Why guess? If these people are actors, if they are not

       the parents of dead children and not actually the people they say they are,

       People are making the effort, in the face of stonewalling from all official agencies and the media. I see new information coming out every day, with varying degrees of believability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is this like that thing where people expected Obama to fix all the nation's problems on Day One and when he didn't he was a failure?

       If people
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       believed Robbie Parker was an actor, if they really believed it and really believed revealing that truth would blow open a gigantic, disgusting conspiracy and prevent more of their freedoms from being taken away, they could do nothing more complicated than go knock on his neighbor's door.

       This could have been done on any of the 60+ days since the shooting.

       You know why this hasn't happened, or if someone

       No, I don't. I mean, I know
       <strong>
        I
       </strong>
       have the airfare laying around to go traipsing out there and start knocking on doors, but between being independently wealthy and fucking supermodels on luxurious yachts I just haven't found the time!

      <p>
       But please, do tell me the one reason why everyone else interested in asking questions hasn't made the effort to go to the new Ground Zero to research the issue for themselves! I am waiting on the edge of my seat!
