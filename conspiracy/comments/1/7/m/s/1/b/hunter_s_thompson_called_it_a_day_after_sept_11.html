       Hunter S. Thompson, great writer, he foreshadowed our current political situation with the world one day after the world trade center and I will quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble, along with all hopes for peace in our time, in the U.S. or any other country. Make no mistake about it: we are at War now- with somebody- and we will stay at war with that strange and mysterious enemy for the rest of our lives."
      </p>
      <p>
       "It will be a religious war, a sort of christian jihad,fueled by religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerrilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is going to be an expensive war, and victory is not guaranteed-for anyone, and certainly not for a baffled little creep like George W. Bush. All he knows is that his father started a war a long time ago, and that he, the goofy child- president, has been chosen by fate and the global oil industry to finish it off"
      </p>

       Make no mistake about it... this is NOT a religious war - it's about money and power, and religion is the shroud that hides their intent. It's a shroud that will divide the people so we become easier to conquer while the focus is removed from the truth.

       I don't think he meant that the powers that be who are the catalysts of the war see it as a religious war, but that the soldiers on the ground and the propaganda used to gain public support for it will involve religious and cultural differences. Think about how often we see how women are mistreated in Islamic culture compared to the way women are treated in our western culture, and how that fact can be used to justify aggression that has absolutely nothing to do with liberating Muslim women.

       True, he could have meant that it was the catalyst. He's a much smarter man than I, and probably knew exactly what the root was. I just like to be clear. Too many people blame religion for war, but I don't think religion itself is the motivating factor. People use religion and so-called "religious beliefs" to mask, or justify, their intents (just as you pointed out). It's convenient to blame religion and use religion as justification, but I feel it's dangerous for us to easily be deceived by, and not uncover, the real core of war.

       I would say that money and power can become a person's religion, but IMO true religion is love - anything that would detract from that may be a "religion" by our technical definition, but would never be true religion. Therefore, to me, "religious war" is an oxymoron. There is no such thing. The root of war would then be something far different, and it would be best for us to seek out and expose that root.

       Exactly! So do we just let it be called a religious war because the religious fanatics got suckered into it, or do we stop calling it a "religious war" so we can seek out and expose the real intent?

       What? How? Their worship of the emperor was the only reason they went to war, and death was their way of paying back a debt to him. That's not from a promise of heaven. It's standing by their emperor in anything he says or does.

       If you do not see the allegory of Emperor and God(Jesus for some) and dying for the Emperor... shit it's like Warhammer40k essentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       They died for their Emperor, so their family had honor, it really is easy to see how it is the same as a christian dieing for his lord and savior, or a Japanese soldier going to war for the emperor.

       Dying for your people, land, and even honor is not the same as dying to go to heaven. the Japanese were doing the former which is something any people would do in the face of aggression, even the Taliban and Hamas. it's different from the US sending its troops to liberate oil fields and install friendly regimes, under the same pretext mixed with promises of heaven.

       Yes, for whatever your reason to go to war and willing to die for it, is equivalent to a man who believes in heaven, or a man who wants to defend his country or a man that wants honor for his family. Just my opinion.

       Right, but the Christian who believes they're dying for Jesus is doing it solely for the promise of getting into heaven for eternity after they die. The Japanese, on the other hand, do not. They are aware that when they die, regardless of if it's for the emperor or not, they're dead. That's the difference I'm referring to. They aren't promised anything after they die, and that isn't required in order for a country to support going to war.

       They are promised honor for their family for dying honorably. Honor to the Japanese then meant the same as heaven for a christian.

       Honor for their family isn't why they die for their emperor. Japanese people have an "on," which is a debt that can never be fully repaid to the emperor. Death is a form of repayment. Familial honor is not the reason, nor is it "their heaven." Now please do some research on the topic as I am tired of arguing this with you.

       Well, many may believe in Heaven, but it doesn't mean that has to be their motive. Again, people may even SAY it's for religion, but rarely that is the core intent.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide">
         Rwandan Genocide
        </a>
        - motive: "ethnic competition"
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars">
         American Indian Wars
        </a>
        - motive: Greed. (religion may have been used at times for justification, but it wasn't the motive)
       </li>
       <li>
        Civil War - motive: Greed, slavery, freedoms, politics
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You know... I'm not going to keep going. I'd say there are far less conflicts that are motivated strictly by religion than other factors. I'd say the #1 reigning factor in most conflicts is Money. #2 (especially historically) Endemic Warfare. It would be wise to weed out the rhetoric and focus on the causes.

       Yes! Most soldiers I know are there because of the offer of a job and/or a scholarship and career. Unfortunately, from America's standpoint, it's the poor that end up on the battlefield, and it's not religion that puts them there, it's the want for a job/money.

       I don really believe in any organised religion but the hostility against the money makers is quite clear throughout religions.

       "And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all of them who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."

       In the original Greek, Jesus didn't overthrow the tables of the moneychangers. What it says is that he picked the tables up and threw them out of the Temple. JC was built like a brick shit-house. I always found that fact amusing.

       Disagree. Its as much of a religious war as anything else. We just see it as a one way religious war "its the crazy muslims". The reality of it is we have just as many christian hillbilly fanatics from the bible belt ready to be cannon fodder as the other side does with muslims or whatever

       Religion isn't about money or power. It's about believing and a means to justify a set of morals or culture. It eventually can come to money and power but not at the start.

       Yeah.  And the Byzantine Church to the East, too, because things got a little 'hot' in Rome and the Roman countryside in the middle of the 5th century and the boys had to get themselves and their church out of town, else be killed.  They picked a place in Turkey to flee to which Emperor Constantine later named after himself.  Such grand old boys clubs they are.

       The Roman Catholic Church has, as it likes to brag, been there from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard of The 700 Club?  How about Scientology?  How about Mormonism?  How about
       <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/26/joel-osteen-megachurches-business-osteen.html">
        Joel Osteen Christianity
       </a>
       ?  How about Oral Roberts?  How about Garner Ted Armstrong?  How about
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_new_religious_movements">
        any of these
       </a>
       ?  These are all churches which are concerned with wealth for their 'founders'.  Have you ever seen those gold statues on top of all the Mormon Temples?  Mormons are obligated to give their church 10% of their income.  Are you familiar with the way the Roman Catholic Church was able to seize and to hold on to all of Mussolini's money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Churches are, from day one, ALL ABOUT money.  That's the history of it.  You may, in your imagination, have a different version than the historical record.

       Also, you might wanna read that Joel Osteen article yourself. He didnt appear to be about money. And for you to group them all into one group with one label was quite ignorant because they do not all profess the same ideas nor are they all for money. The 700 Club seems pretty greedy too with their thousands (if not millions) of dollars in donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the "10% of harvest" from the Bible was originally intended to be 10% of your harvest, as in crops, to be given to the church to give to the needy. Now it has become about 10% of whatever you make which God didn't intend. It's also a stereotype to think anyone who pays tithes is trying to get God to love them more. Granted, you have those people but it isn't many, many do it because they feel that the church needs money, which it does in this day and time.

       It is a very good general rule that churches, like kingdoms, like countries, like companies, are very much about power, and money.

       If god exists, the leadership on both sides beating drums of war are the worst of sinners.  They place their prophet idols and petty desires for power ahead of unity under god, ignoring the first and greatest commandment.  I hate theocrats because the state corrupts religion to the point where god is forgotten and replaced by men with delusions of grandeur.  I do believe in god and that most neo-cons will burn in the lowest rung of hell for eternity.  I like to envision a rung of hell with a human centipede for all the tele-evangalists, mullahs, fox news reporters, neo cons, and zionists that spent their lives dividing god's children for personal profit.

       This has always been the case. Religion was once a tool used to bring society together, to help form civilization and get people to work together. It didn't take long for it to become a tool of the rich, of the powerful, to keep the common man under their finger. It's just a truth of history. What powerful person follows their religion's ideology? None of them. They pretend to, until we catch them with their hand in the cookie jar. Yet these are the ones everyone admires, so how can we blame the average person for being fanatical religious, yet never follow their tenets? It's disgusting. No, not everyone is like that...but that's because we have evolved sociology, and we're becoming more aware. But not everyone is. It takes time. But things are bad and they need to improve.

       Beneath the surface in America, the eternal war against a military tactic does have some religious motivations. Namely with those people who feel that they must ensure the prophecies in the the Book of Revelations are fulfilled via some help from the good ol' USA. And, yes, Israel has a role to play in that Apocalyptic "dream" of Armageddon. What some people won't do to get to heaven, eh?

        "I was on the phone with him, he set the receiver down and he did it. I heard the clicking of the gun," Anita Thompson told the Aspen Daily News in Friday's editions. She said her husband had asked her to come home from a health club so they could work on his weekly ESPN column. Thompson said she heard a loud, muffled noise, but didn't know what had happened. "I was waiting for him to get back on the phone," she said.

        That's how I imagine a tribute to Hunter S. Thompson should begin. He was indeed working on such a story, but it wasn't what killed him. He exercised his own option to do that. As he said to more than one person, "I would feel real trapped in this life if I didn't know I could commit suicide at any time."

       I read the article back when it came out, and it always struck me Roberts clearing his conscious by putting his personal account of the suspicious circumstances of Thompson's death on record in the the first paragraph, and just covering his ass in fear of being ostracized as a conspiracy theorist in the second. Regardless, I'd still like to see Thompson's notes on explosives in the towers, though I haven't been holding my breath.

       That one is a doosey.  The anthrax was so highly weaponized there are less than 4 labs that could make it in the world.  All of which are in the west.

       Hunter S Thompson never trolled his readers. That's why I think your theory is ridiculous. He did shit, in his time, that bypassed authority and went straight to the heart of the average reader. He invented "gonzo journalism".
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that he'd bail out of the world and create a conspiracy "just for the lulz" goes against everything the man was (at least as far as I know him having read all his books).
      </p>
      <p>
       The man was an outlier and much loved. He wouldn't throw all that away in an easily disproved suicide troll death.

       Hunter wanted to send a message to the world that he was in control of his own life.  He wasn't a perfect man, or even a stable man.  Hunter was a guy who was incredibly paranoid and yet dulled that paranoia with copious amounts of intoxicant and fresh fruits and veggies.  He was an absolutely wonderful writer, and I've read absolutely everything he's written that has been published.  I can read them again tomorrow and get something completely new.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Hunter always wanted to be in control of his life was his eventual downfall.  That's why he killed himself.  If I could pass a message along to Hunter right now, it would be "Coward!".  I believe he would appreciate that sentiment.  I couldn't imagine a man so brave in changing the public image of his life to suit him could be so cowardly after watching a terrorist attack (fake or not).  No one even halfway competent would feel that the best thing they could do is take out an aging beat writer because he supposedly had material or evidence that the truthers claim they have every day.  Hunter had a house full of guns and one on him at all times.  The chances of being killed by a professional assassin is almost zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor Hunter.  I miss him terribly.  I miss reading everything new he created.  I miss his reckless abandon in changing the details of a story to make things more interesting or mysterious.  I miss the nicknames he had for his vehicles.  I miss his fire and his rage and his passion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I miss Hunter Thompson and the world misses him.  What a terrible waste.  The world needs him more than ever.

       Or it could be that phones don't have the greatest fidelity - dynamic range, tonal quality, etc, and the gunshot could have just maxed out the cheap microphone/low-quality voice signal over the line. You know how crappy music sounds over the phone (especially cell phones with their low-bitrate codecs!) They're just not made to carry a signal like that.

       yea phones have a set range of volumes and frequencies that can possibly come out, they can't just transmit the pitch, tonal range, and volume of a gun shot because you think it should. You can't just alter physics.....
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had conversations with people at gun ranges and the gunshots are just about the same volume in my ear as the voice.

       Two years ago in January 2003, Thompson actually did give an interview on KDNK radio (Colorado) where he made a suggestion that he may be murdered to shut him up.
"Bush is really the evil one here and it is more than just him. We are the Nazis in this game and I don't like it. I am embarrassed and I am pissed off. I mean to say something. I think a lot of people in this country agree with me...we'll see what happens to me if I get my head cut off next week -- it is always unknown or bushy-haired strangers who commit suicide right afterwards with no witnesses," the writer said.
      </p>
      <p>
       More confusion has arisen after a quote from one of the police officers investigating the death scene. Deputy Ron Ryan said there was a spent shell casing, but there was no cartridge in the firing chamber, as there should have been under normal circumstances. Sheriff's officer DiSalvo confirmed this opinion; "I think a bullet from the magazine should have cycled into the chamber". This "single bullet" problem has led to speculation that Thompson was coerced into self-inflicting a gunshot wound, being given a gun with a single shot, perhaps accompanied by threats against his family.

       Here's the story I believe he is mentioned.  The Franklin Credit Union Scandal and child sex rings. Thompson was at least reportedly in attendance at some of the parties, although I'm not aware of him writing an expose on it. It's a crazy read if you've never heard about it.

       It has been a while since I have pursued this information, but I remember the Jeff Gannon link being very intriguing.  Gannon was that gay prostitute who was somehow in the White House from time to time....often tossing softballs at George W during press conferences (even though he was running an active stud-whore website and had no real credentials).
      </p>
      <p>
       Gannon might be one of the kids from the Franklin Scandal named Johnny Gosch (Jeff Gannon/Johnny Gosch).....Gosch's own mother believes that Gannon and Gosch are the same person.
      </p>

       Supposedly, there is a story of Larry King (not the TV host) taking Gosch to Bohemian Grove where the most disturbing sexual torture you have ever heard of went on.  The story goes that King stopped the plane before The Grove to pick up some people.  Gosch remembers a photographer named Hunter Thompson getting on the plane and being present (photographing) during the torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have NO IDEA how much of this is true, but the rabbit hole is there if you watch that Conspiracy of Silence video and check out the Gannon/Guckert/Gosch link.  Enough IS provable to make this a HUGE conspiracy (dictionary definition of the word).....the only question is how far it goes.

       You misremembered the Bohemian Grove/Johnny Gosh part. Paul Bonacci was the boy who was taken to the grove and who reported the making of a snuff film at the Bohemian Grove. Bonacci later also identified Johnny Gosh and said that Johnny had been kidnapped for the pedophile ring.

       Most allegations against Thompson came from Rusty Nelson. Nelson is a photographer who was involved in the Franklin scandal. His allegation against Thompson can be heard here:

       Paul Bonacci, one of the abused teenagers in the Franklin scandal, has testified to have been introduced to a man, who has called himself Hunter Thompson. Even if his story is true, the man could also have used a pseudonym. This is at least the believe of Nick Bryant. Bryant has written a book about the Franklin scandal. Here a

       Here is a video in which Paul Bonacci is interviewed by Gary Caradori the chief investigator of the Franklin subcommittee. Bonacci tells the story about the Bohemian grove and the snuff film.

       Since the Bonacci interview is a bit difficult to listen to, here is a shorter, quite dramatic version given by his attorney, the former Nebraska States Senator DeCamp. DeCamp reads a part of Bonacci's diary.

       Nick Bryant has studied sealed court documents and has found flight records which proved that children have been flown in private planes to Washington DC. Bryant has also tracked down and interviewed about 60 witnesses who were abused during their childhood and who were part of Larry King's pedophile ring.

       This year Nick Bryant plans to bring out a documentary about the pedophile ring of Nebraska and the kidnapping of Johnny Gosh. The trailer can be seen here:

       The Franklin child prostitution ring is beyond conspiracy theory. People went to prison. If you watch the pulled Discovery channel documentary and read Bryant's stuff, it is beyond clear what was (is) going on. Some sick, fucked up shit.

       I'm pretty sure Hunter was murdered. Yeah, he always said he would go out by suicide, but I think that just made it convenient to cover it up.

       I dont have an opinion on Hunter's murder/suicide, but I absolutely convinced of the Franklin Scandal...as you said, it is fact.  The aspects that you could prove and that were covered in press are numerous enough to leave little doubt in my mind.....but the Hunter stuff was just hearsay, interesting food for thought, but not provable to me.  I am going to check out Drunkenshrew's info above and look further.

       Yeah, it's hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction with Hunter. If you take everything he said as fact, then this is a truly scary world. But I believe most all of it. He often saw things and spoke about them long before anyone realized the truth he had uncovered. And the access he had to Washington insiders! His reputation worked for and against him, no one seemed to be too worried about him being a witness to bad stuff, because the public never knew what to believe from him. Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail was pretty revealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one will ever know if he committed suicide or was assassinated. Plenty of people would want him dead, especially if he was writing what he said he was. I wonder where his notes went. But he and his family always knew that was a risk of the life he lead. If they did get into the Owl Farm and kill him and get back out without either being seen or getting shot by any one of the multitude of guns around that place, whoever they were must have been pretty impressive.

       A gun to make that noise would need to be silenced, right? So they would have had to have a recently fired second gun of the same make with no silencer to get the balistics correct. Then they would need to get into the house after shooting him arrange the body in a suicide position including prints on the weapon, and get out again without being seen.

       More confusion has arisen after a quote from one of the police officers investigating the death scene. Deputy Ron Ryan said there was a spent shell casing, but there was no cartridge in the firing chamber, as there should have been under normal circumstances. Sheriff's officer DiSalvo confirmed this opinion; "I think a bullet from the magazine should have cycled into the chamber". This "single bullet" problem has led to speculation that Thompson was coerced into self-inflicting a gunshot wound, being given a gun with a single shot, perhaps accompanied by threats against his family.

       I don't think it would be unusual for Thompson to load a single round in. He was familiar with guns, and he wouldn't load his gun completely to shoot himself. There is also his suicide he wrote which is undoubtedly his writing style.

       Note, we assume he fired one shot and the next round in the magazine should have been chambered.  Yet, it was still in the magazine.  What type of scenario can you think of where this would happen?  This appears to be some sort of revelation of method technique in play here.  Are you all in?

       He constantly talked about killing himself.  His family knew it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when.  He wanted to die on top, die at the best point in his life.  When he killed himself, he was at home with his wife and son.  His son was in the next room, and heard the gunshot.  He then walked into the room to find his Dad dead.  No one in the family suspects anything.  No friends suspect anything.  He left a note that sounds like he wrote it.  No one was surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       His ex-wife claims he was incredibly depressed, and that led to his suicide, not his desire to 'die on top'.  I think it was a combination of the two. Life was going downhill, he had already waited to long.  It was time to get out.
      </p>
      <p>
       He lost his will to live once GWB was elected a second time, not 9/11.  That is when it became a matter of when.

       Are you implying someone would assassinate him while on the phone with his wife? That's ridiculous. His eccentricity and his pubic unabashed suicidal tendencies makes the shoe fit fine in this case. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

       If you're talking to
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       , I'm not implying anything about assassination. I just wanted to say that his wife (according to Wiki it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       his wife, second wife, Anita Bejmuk, married in 2003) said in an interview that she was talking to him on the phone and he asked her to come home to help him with writing his ESPN column. She evidently thought the sound of his cocking the pistol was HST typing and hung up. His son, daughter-in-law and grandson were in the next room. They thought the gunshot was a book falling and did not immediately investigate.

       I never understood everyone being okay with him always talking about (and actually commiting) suicide. Just because he was/is was such a one of a kind person, it was "Oh. Hunter S. is so BRAVE. Him suiciding is the way he wants to go."
      </p>
      <p>
       i love Hunter S. Thompson as much as anyone. But the whole suicide thing was not heroic in the least. Of course, his final statement was about truly being free to make the ultimate decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it had more to do with him knowing he was gonna die living the life he lived, yet he didn't want to give that up.

       He talked about suicide all the time.  With friends, journalists and his assistants.  He always said he'd take his motorcycle off a particular bend leading to a cliff there in his town of woody creek Colorado. Not during a phone call with his ex wife after saying "I'll be right back."

       Yeah except when he killed himself he was already in pretty bad physical shape. He couldn't walk and used a wheelchair to get around. I doubt he could even get on a motorcycle let alone drive it around a bend.

       Come on. He didn't want to get clean...he was a lifelong addict and it had done it's damage. He had no interest  in cleaning himself up. That's the truth.

       He should be praised for his contributions in life, not because he offed himself because of the shape he had put himself in.

       To be fair, at the time, I remember that all American's wanted was blood. We didn't care who it was, or what the reasoning behind it was -- We wanted blood and we wanted it now.

       I was in my late 20's when it happened, so maybe I'm taking my wisdom at that time for granted.  Maybe I should change my reply to "Most adults knew what was coming when we saw 9/11 go down."

       As much as I love and admire Hunter for his writing and for just being the man he was, I suspect living with him would have been a frustrating and sometimes terrifying existence. He was gun obsessed and threatened the life of friends, family and strangers alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       His outlook on America post 9/11 was shared by Bill Cooper, who called 9/11 a week or two before it happened. He ended up dead too. I don't believe Hunter was "suicided" although he may have been driven to it by the CIA since he was already pretty unstable. All they would have had to do was play on his paranoia, leading him to believe they were closing in on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, who knows? We'll never know so all we can do is speculate. Some people just can't accept that sometimes the story is what it is. The man took out a gun and blew gis brains out.
      </p>
      <p>
       RIP Hunter.

       Here are the sources for these allegations. Mark Dice didn't make this up:
      </p>
      <p>
       Most allegations against Thompson came from the photographer Rusty Nelson. Nelson was involved in the Franklin scandal. His allegation against Thompson can be heard here:

      <p>
       Paul Bonacci, one of the abused teenagers in the Franklin scandal, has testified to have been introduced to a man, who has called himself Hunter Thompson. Even if his story is true, the man could also have used a pseudonym. This is at least the believe of Nick Bryant. Bryant has written a book about the Franklin scandal. Here a
       <a href="http://www.franklinscandal.com/">
        link
       </a>
       to his website. Nick Bryant also finds Nelson not credible. I share his opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a video in which Paul Bonacci is interviewed by Gary Caradori the chief investigator of the Franklin subcommittee. Bonacci tells the story about the Bohemian grove and the snuff film.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       During this investigation Gary Caradori died in a mysterious plane crash. His death meant effectively the end of the Franklin investigation. Afterwards witnesses were to afraid to come forward. Further interviews of abused victims can be accessed here:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the Bonacci interview is a bit difficult to listen to, here is a shorter, quite dramatic version given by his attorney, the former Nebraska States Senator DeCamp. DeCamp reads a part of Bonacci's diary.

       Does this guy have any proof or just heresay? He's making some pretty serious allegations. Where is this video he claims Hunter shot? Surely it must have turned up once he was dead or do you think his family found and destroyed it to protect his legacy. Hunter was not the most technically proficient person (As evidenced by his hilarious call to tech support for whatever company sold him his DVD player).

       Except, the Jews were never thrown out of Egypt. That's a biblical myth that somehow got accepted as historical truth, when recent studies have shown that there are no Jewish artifacts anywhere in Egypt, or on the supposed path of exile. The pyramids weren't even built by slaves, they were built by Egyptian contractors as ruins of settlements around the Pyramids have shown.

       I'm well aware of confirmation bias, but it's another thing to use that justify rhetoric that is still bigoted and near sighted. You're not being revolutionary by being controversial and even you have admitted that in the big picture not one single race can wholly be responsible for anything. The bigger picture is way more complicated and definitely wouldn't fit solely into the worldview of one guy, especially someone as deranged as Hitler and you can trust me on this, I grew up in Germany, I saw a concentration camp in the Czech republic and the Germans are very adamant about this never happening again and I think they are wiser for it.

       And then you wonder why people keep calling your posts racist, have you maybe considered that it's not them acting like sheeple, but perhaps, they are racist?

       From wikipedia:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The consensus among biblical scholars today is that there was never any exodus of the proportions described in the Bible,[15] and that the story is best seen as theology, a story illustrating how the god of Israel acted to save and strengthen his chosen people, and not as history.[13] Nevertheless, the discussion of the historical reality of the exodus has a long history, and continues to attract attention."

       It's not a hard thing to google, you'll find more and better sources. The problem being that people have already accepted something from a book without evidence, when there wasn't any to begin with.

        Evidence for the Exodus from Egypt is plentiful---as long as one has their Biblical chronology right, and thus knows to examine Egypt's history around 2450 B.C., rather than around the traditional 1450 B.C.

       <p>
        You and other scholars point out that there isn't evidence outside the Bible, in historic documents and the archeological record, for a mass migration from Egypt involving hundreds of thousands of people. But it may be plausible that there was a much smaller exodus, an exodus of people originally from the land of Canaan who were returning to it. Is that right?
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes. Despite all the ways in which the exodus narratives in the Bible seem to be non-historic, something about the overall pattern can, in fact, be related to what we know from historical sources was going on at the end of the Late Bronze Age [circa 1200 B.C.E.], around when the Bible's chronology places the story of departure from Egypt.
       </p>

        Now, what is the evidence? ... [ discussion continues]

       <p>
        Before the discovery of the Merneptah stele scholars placed the date of the exodus and entry into Canaan much later. They are now forced to admit that Israel was already in Canaan at the time of Merneptah. Israel was big and strong enough to challenge Egypt in battle. This stele puts a terminus ante quem date of 1210 BC for the exodus (McCarter 1992, 132).

       <p>
        :
       </p>
       <p>
        It also seems most likely that the Exodus from Egypt should be equated with the expulsion of the Hyksos. Not all the Hyksos were Israelites. It says in Exodus that a great mixed multitude came out of Egypt with Moses (Exodus 12:38).

       <p>

        This exit from Egypt by the Hyksos probably included the Israelites as well. The story of the Exodus is most likely bases on the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt, for there is no other record of any mass exit from Egypt (Robertson 1990, 36; Halpern 1994, 89-96; Redford 1897, 150). The evidence seems to fit well with Josephus' account. Although the Egyptians saw the expulsion of the Hyksos as a great military victory, the Israelites viewed this as a great salvation victory for them.

        which presents a range of interpretations, with some bullshit ("very little Egyptian influence is discernible in biblical literature" - are you fucking joking ? the core of the Torah philosopy and rule system is a copy of the horus theology

       In summary, while the bible is crazed make-believe, and I wouldn't believe an israeli that said "X million" (where X = 2.5) last week, let alone 3,200 to 3,400 years ago, there is nothing like a "consensus among biblical scholars today is that there was never any exodus of the proportions described in the Bible"

        Correction. "It will be a religious war, a sort of Zionist jewhad, fueled by religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerrilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy." Make no mistake the entire "War On Terror" is planning of Jewish Zionist minds for their international Bankster brethren's benefit. Mostly Christian oriented soldiers will be on the front lines and the Jewish Zionist media will write about it and promote it. War is the Banksters Harvest. This is a perpetual war for international Zionist banking. It is about destroying Islamic banking and bringing Muslim cultures under the control of Zionist cultural Marxists. Those that don't cooperate will be murdered by the Zionist controlled Military Industrial Complex.
