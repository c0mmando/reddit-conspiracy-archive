       Let me preface this by saying that I don't intend to offend anyone; I just want an insight into the minds of people whom I can't comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really one to give in to conspiracy theories, and, as a physics and astronomy enthusiast, the hardest theory of all to believe is that the Moon landing was a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every facet of this theory has been debunked, any "wrong" shadows have been explained, and the proof on the surface is observable using some high-end amateur telescopes. Why do you still believe we were never there?

       “If NASA returns to the moon in 2020 as planned, astronauts will step out in a brand-new space suit. It will give them new mobility and flexibility on the lunar surface while still protecting them from its harsh environment … The space agency has awarded a $500 million, 6.5-year contract for the design and development of the Constellation space suit.” Astronauts performing EVAs these days currently use something known as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit: “It has a hard upper torso, layers of material to protect astronauts from micrometeoroids and radiation, a temperature-regulation system, and its own life support and communication system. The EMU weighs over 300 pounds and has limited leg mobility – astronauts feet are normally locked in place on foot restraints while performing extravehicular tasks, and during Apollo missions, which used a different EMU suit, astronauts were forced to develop a bunny hop to traverse the lunar surface.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I could, of course, point out once again the absurdity of it taking about four times as long to develop a spacesuit now than it did back in the hi-tech 1960s, but I’m pretty sure I’ve already beat that particular horse damn near to death and then rubbed salt in the wounds. I could also point out that the Apollo suits somehow managed to perform all the duties of the current EMUs while weighing about 40% less, but that’s also already taken a pretty severe beating.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead, I’ll focus on the contention that the Apollo astronauts were “forced to develop a bunny hop to traverse the lunar surface,” which, as an alert reader pointed out, flies in the face of numerous past claims in which it was maintained that the ‘bunny hop’ was found to be the most effective means of locomoting in a reduced gravity environment, not that it was something forced upon the astronauts by the limitations of the spacesuits. If I remember correctly, one of the Mythbusters propagandists claimed that he had verified that it was the most efficient means of moving in reduced gravity, and he was, by his own admission, wearing a costume and not a pressurized spacesuit when he conducted his experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone, it would appear, is doing a little lying here. I am, needless to say, as shocked as all of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       “‘When we went to the moon the first time, we were just trying to get there. Now astronauts need to be able to explore the surface, harvest resources, and do science,’ says Daniel Barry, vice president and director of research and development at David Clark Company, and head of the Constellation space suits project.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Apollo missions, it turns out, were just about getting there. And the reason, I guess, why we allegedly flew men to the Moon eight times (including the alleged fly-bys by Apollo 8 and Apollo 13) was to, uhmm, prove that getting there the first time was no fluke. Sure, we were told that the boys were sent there to “do science” and that they took along a bunch of scientific testing equipment – and even, on the last flight, an actual scientist – but that apparently wasn’t really the case. And the lunar rovers allegedly flown to the Moon were not brought along to enable the astronauts to “explore the surface” and conduct additional science projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time, however, we’re going to do it right … in another 20+ years, that is … if we fast-track it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What “resources,” by the way, are we planning to “harvest”? We’ve already allegedly brought back numerous samples of Moon rocks, which appears to be about the only resource readily available, other than the water NASA now claims can be found there. How much does it suck, by the way, for NASA to have to cancel the Constellation Program right after the agency had reported allegedly discovering loads of water on the Moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       One ‘debunker’ claim that has been made fairly frequently over the years, it should be noted, is that NASA’s alleged Moon rocks contain no traces of water, proving that they are not of Earthly origin and could only have come from the surface of a waterless sphere like the Moon … which isn’t, NASA now claims, waterless. I have no doubt though that those same ‘debunkers’ will be able to come up with some convoluted, hackneyed explanation for the apparent discrepancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pictured below is the evolution of the American spacesuit. From left to right in the top row are the Mercury suit (1961), the Gemini suit (1965), and the pre-Playtex Apollo suit (1968); in the lower row are the famous Apollo magic suit (1969), the first space shuttle suit (1981), and the new suit being produced for the now-defunct Constellation Program. Below that, believe it or not, is an early prototype Apollo suit. While it may appear to be a still from some 1950s sci-fi flick, or a computer generated artist’s conception, it is, in fact, an actual suit being tested in the Mojave Desert in the mid-1960s. It is probably safe to assume that it didn’t pass the test.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing Bear Grylls would undoubtedly do is bring us back some of those dazzling lunar starscapes that the Apollo guys neglected to capture. Presented below, by the way, is one of NASA’s former astronomy pics of the day. It carried with it the following explanation: “If you could turn off the atmosphere’s ability to scatter overwhelming sunlight, today’s daytime sky might look something like this.” Below that is a shot from deep space, illustrating that stars in outer space maybe aren’t really as camera-shy as some would like us to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Bolden, NASA had “focused so much of our effort and funding on just getting to the moon, we were neglecting investments … required to go beyond.” So while we don’t have the money required to get back to the Moon, you see, we do have the money to bypass the Moon and fly our guys to more distant locales, like Mars. No target date has been set, but I’m guessing that if we focus our attention on these bolder objectives, we’ll probably succeed by, like, 2050. Or maybe 2060. Or 2069, on the 100th anniversary of the first alleged Moon landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As will be recalled, we set our sights a little higher in the 1960s. When Kennedy delivered his famous declaration back in May of 1961 that we were going to the Moon, he gave the aerospace community less than a decade to make it happen. Engineers across the country, who were well aware of the fact that the nation hadn’t even taken its first baby-steps yet, were understandably dismayed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first Apollo contract was awarded just two months later, in July of 1961, for the sophisticated navigation system that would allegedly guide the spacecraft to the Moon. In an unusual move, NASA opted not to solicit bids for the guidance system; instead, the contract was handed directly to MIT, generating “immediate controversy,” as noted by Moon Machines. As one of the show’s talking-heads noted, “There was actually a budding industry out there that had developed guidance systems and people from industry were quite upset. They felt that they should have been given the chance to bid on the contract – and a university is not ordinarily what the government contracts out to build hardware for operational systems.”
      </p>
      <p>
       There was, alas, nothing ordinary about the Apollo project.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       According to Moon Machines, Draper and his team got to work on the Apollo guidance system in the spring of 1962. Given that Moon Machines also contends that the contract was awarded to MIT in early summer of 1961, the question that is naturally begged is: why, with the clock ticking and with an absurdly short timeframe to pull the Apollo project together, would the MIT team have waited almost a year to get started? Or did they, in fact, spend that first year working on their real assignment – mapping out the key elements of the simulation?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, then they apparently spent a fair amount of time viewing an obscure German silent film by the name of Die Frau im Mond (The Woman in the Moon), as noted in the painfully long documentary, What Happened on the Moon? The German feature film, released by filmmaker Fritz Lang in 1929, provided the blueprint for the heavily ritualized launch procedures that were adopted for the Apollo program. As can be seen in the screen caps below, all of the elements were there: the unnecessary vertical construction of the spaceship in a specially built hangar; the grand opening of the massive hangar doors; the excruciatingly slow roll-out of the upright rocketship from the hangar to the launch pad; the raucous crowds watching the spectacle live; the now ubiquitous countdown; even the shedding of two stages of the ship. In other words, the only elements of the performance that the public ever actually witnessed were all lifted directly from a forty-year-old silent film.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Anyway, returning to MIT, the starting point for engineers was to develop a gyroscope-based guidance system. The problem though was that gyros could not be produced to MIT’s exacting standards, resulting in gyro after gyro being rejected. Another problem was that translating data from the gyros into flight instructions would require, as Moon Machines noted, a “modern digital computer,” and putting such a beast in a spaceship “was an entirely new challenge.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Computers in the early 1960s,” you see, “were huge. The idea of squeezing such a monster into a spacecraft seemed preposterous.” But that wasn’t really going to be a problem since, as we have already seen, clearing seemingly insurmountable obstacles was something that the aerospace community was uniquely skilled at in the 1960s. The engineers working on the onboard computer utilized an entirely new technology known as the silicon chip. The technology was so new though that no one knew what it could actually do. And as with the gyros, it proved to be nearly impossible to produce chips of acceptable quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time, ‘software’ was a virtually unknown concept. As Moon Machines duly reported, “With nobody clear on exactly what the computer should do, the software engineers were free to write almost anything they liked.” One of those flight software developers, Alex Kosmala, made the following remarkable admission: “There were no specs. We made it up. Uhmm … and it’s always [been] amazing to me – why was I allowed to program something that hadn’t even been specified [but] that would be critical in assuring the success of the whole Apollo Program? I couldn’t believe it, but that’s the way it was. We made it up as we went along!”
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m going to take a wild guess here and say that NASA probably wasn’t unduly concerned since the functioning of the software would only have mattered if the agency was planning to actually send guys to the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most complicated aspect of the Apollo missions was the landing of the lunar modules, which made the software program controlling that part of the mission the most difficult to design. Amazingly though, that aspect of the software design was not assigned until after most of the other programs were 2/3 complete – and it was assigned to a twenty-two-year-old gent named Don Isles who had just recently started his very first job. According to Moon Machines, “the program without which it would be impossible to land on the Moon … had been written almost as an afterthought by a junior engineer.”
      </p>
      <p>
       It is rumored that MIT first tried to pawn the job off on a kid who flipped burgers at the local McDonalds, but he apparently had prior commitments.
      </p>
      <p>
       By mid-1966, Draper’s dream of controlling the entire mission via an onboard computer had been dropped in favor of an Earth-based control system with the Draper system along as back-up. MIT allegedly produced a computer the size of a small fridge, which both the command module and the lunar module were outfitted with. Despite the overwhelming obstacles faced by the MIT team, and the seemingly lackadaisical approach taken with the project, the Apollo guidance system, as would be expected, performed nearly flawlessly on every outing.
      </p>
      <p>
       One final note here on Die Frau im Mond before wrapping up this installment: the gatekeepers over at the BAUT forum appear to be in on the joke. Why else would the site's logo contain not an image of NASA's lunar module sitting on the surface of the Moon, but rather a rocketship that looks suspiciously like the spaceship from Lang's film?

       claritication: these are mere segments comprising of about half of one in a series of 14 articles, that together comprise a pretty brutal decimation on the entire question of the moon landings... at least they do for me, perhaps you should give them a shot

       Boy, that was... comprehensive, but you didn't link to your source, and some of the images mentioned are missing (I'm particularly interested in the Apollo suit prototypes).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the actual suits used in the mission, assuming they weighed somewhere in the neighbourhood of 300 lbs, they would weigh approximately 1/6 of that on the Moon: 50 pounds is heavy, but absolutely bearable.

       I'm currently on page 4, where the author describes how the photos of the orbiter are "clearly" composites (based on a cut antenna array, which looks a bit off). The antenna array had to be cut like that so that it could fold into a more compact space when it was inside the Saturn V launcher.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, again, most of the stuff shown in these photos (the rover tracks, reflectors, waste bags left by the 'nauts) can be observed using a 30" amateur reflector telescope (one of the most powerful on the market). If you don't have 12 grand to burn for one of those, you can rent out an observatory with an optical telescope (as I suspect some people might be suspicious of digital imaging), which has an focal length several times greater than amateur telescopes, and observe it from there. Even if the 1960s saw a robotic probe capable of placing reflectors on the Moon, then taking off without covering it with excessive amounts of dust, there's nothing which could've put those tracks there other than a human-piloted rover.

       a. Strawman?
      </p>
      <p>
       b. I withdraw my statement about the 30" amateur telescope. I know that reflectors left on the moon by Apollo astronauts could be targeted by lasers, and though that we had Earth-based telescopes powerful enough to image targets that small. Turns out that the technology is still about half a decade away, while Lockheed-Martin is working on next-gen mirrors.

      <p>
       What else do you think could've put all that stuff on the Moon?

       c. The tracks left on the Moon were made by a 4-wheeled rover. The tracks of a 6- or 8-wheeled vehicle (rovers all have extra sets of wheels for stability) would be different.

       So why wouldn't the rover the astronauts were driving have 6 or 8 wheels if they were carrying much more important cargo?  I actually think this point goes against your case.

       Random lurker here but I think I have an explanation, basically if an unmanned rover flips over the entire mission is completely screwed, also I think they're much more likely to flip over, because rovers are significantly smaller than buggies unless I'm incredibly mistaken. With the buggies A) they don't use them as long, rovers stay up there for years and they only need the buggies for as long as the astronauts are there B) if they flip over I'm fairly certain the driver could flip it back over, and definitely could with two people C) buggies are built for mobility, rovers are built for stability, I imagine having 8 wheels would have a negative effect on maneuverability. Also I don't think the 'important cargo' part really comes into it, I'm sure it would be pretty difficult to get into a moon-buggy accident bad enough to cause you serious harm, and you would have to drive pretty far to not be able to walk (or hop, in this case :p) back to the lander.......that's pretty much it. Also, just for the record, I don't know anything about this, and I don't really believe the moon landing hoax thing one way or the other, and I'm pretty drunk; logic is good, if you think things through you can generally come up with reasons for and against things and then decide which one seems more reasonable, it's pretty fun.

       I'm not completely familiar with the specs of the lunar rover, but I should think it had a lower centre of gravity. A contributing factor is also the fact that the pilots weren't controlling it on a 3-second or so lag.

       This seems to be most likely to me, so both camps are right and wrong.  Even if they filmed a fake landing in the event of a failure they could save face and show it to the public, a plan b of sorts.

       I've always been on the fence about the moon landing: I feel that without testimony from those involved or official documentation, there's no way I can know whether or not it was faked.  However, this is an extremely informative and thought provoking post, thanks.

       One massive wrench to throw into your theory.  The russians, I always point this out to "moon conspiracy" believers, and have yet to have a good rebuttal.  The Russians.  Explain to me how our rival in the space race failed to notice NASA faked the moon landing?  Wouldn't they have supporting radar data to call NASA out?  What about the samples they brought back?  I'm sorry, but your conjecture based off uncited quotes and assumptions due to wastefully government during the development cycle ( what a surprize) isn't enough to prove your point sadly.

       No, and nobody has either.  There are questions remaining, but nobody has answered them.  I'd go further and say if it was a "black op" everyone involved is buried in a lonely grave out in deserts of the southwest.  Something that big anyone not trusted would be liquidated immediately.  It's unlikely the truth will ever come out.

       I haven't read the book in question; however, if you believe anything otherwise you're a nutter sorry.  The west did fund the communists in the early years true, which, most people jump directly to they've ran the communists the whole time.  That's a bit of a far fetched tale in my mind.  I'll quote the most recent batman movie (I've given you so much money) "and you think that gives you power over me?"  -Bane.

       Right.  If you've really deluded yourself that much I'm sorry we can not have an intellectual debate, as you are clearly of a higher "axiom of knowledge" than I am. Do a little reading on the teapot fallacy.  I think it describes this situation very well.  Further I find it very telling anyone who disagrees with you is a "child."  Mr. holier than thou.

       Anyone remember a show called Salvage 1 starring Andy Griffith as the owner of a junk yard that decides to build a rocket to go to the Moon and Mine it for Moon Rocks to sell back on Earth. It was a completely commercial venture. I was about 11 when it came out so I thought it was pretty sweet.

       Something you didn't mention: no other country even attempted to land on the moon after us. Not even Russia. Since 1969

       Oh there was nothing there some may claim. Why are several countries going there now? Why the fuck would the USSR listen to the US about something virtually unknown (like the moon) during the cold war?

       Not necessarily. Perhaps there was a very strong incentive on their part to not do that. Perhaps the USA was holding something over their heads. There are MANY reasons that they might have kept it to themselves.

       If they're honestly going to try explain away the Soviet Union not telling the world of the USA's deception, then there's no reasoning with them. This Moon hoax nonsense only further serves to make this sub look like a bunch of loons.

       For example the death of their first astronaut into space and that possibly Yuri was not the first into space. It is rumored that another astronaut actually went into space and Yuri was snuck out of the capsule so that if something went wrong, they can stick him in another capsule for recovery so that it appeared as though the mission was a success. His mission was a success so this wasn't necessary.

       This is simply not a compelling argument at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is based on an erroneous presumption that the USSR would have the technological capacity to PROVE the moon landings were faked. It also demonstrates a massive lack of insight on how the Soviets operated politically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without a doubt, they would have been extremely puzzled that NASA had been able to steal a march on their (up until then) more advanced space program.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would certainly have suspected that the Americans might be conducting an audacious hoax, but their whole approach to the West was paranoid, and ultra-cautious. So, even if they were 95% sure the Americans had faked it, they would not have taken the 5% risk of being wrong. They would also have been aware that the Americans could win the global propaganda battle even if the Apollo missions were fake. The Soviets would appear to bad losers and conspiracy nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may have suspected a double-bluff, a trick to get them to deny the moon landings , only for NASA to reveal irrefutable proof they put men on the moon (which we're all still waiting for, 40 years on, but the Soviets weren't to know that).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the Russians may have remained silent because they were concerned about some of their activities being called out by the Americans. The Cold War was predicated on mutually assured destruction, but this didn't just refer to nuclear weapons - it also applied to potentially "explosive" public slanging matches which would reveal information that could undermine the credibility of both sides.

       My problem with this is if the Russians were so close to landing a man on the moon, surely they would have already invested quite a bit of time and money into their moon landing program but because America landed on the moon first, they were just like, "Awww...Fuck It. we give up." I think if it was possible, they would have followed right behind us. Just landing a man on the moon is one thing but I think the ultimate goal is establishing a permanent moon base.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially once the Soviets gained all of their experience with Mir and other space stations. The logical next step would be a moon base. I feel like we're getting the bait and switch with all of the talk about building a base on Mars. You would think we would practice on the moon first since it's closer, cheaper and if something goes wrong, we can mount a rescue mission and it won't take 6-8 months to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that the Soviets just gave up because they weren't first is the dumbest argument. We got the Atomic Bomb first. Didn't stop them from building their own
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Soviets knew it was not possible. The fact that NASA was able to send 8 missions and all performed flawlessly except for Apollo 13 and Apollo 1, strains belief. Apollo 1 burned up on the pad after Gus Grissom hung a lemon on the capsule and said the Apollo Space Craft were crap.

       The thing is, the USSR was only close to a Moon landing
       <em>
        on paper
       </em>
       . In practice, their N1 boosters were a failure of epic proportions, and some of the launches ended in some of the largest non-nuclear man-made explosions ever.

       Yes but it's been 44 years. Surely they would have dialed those in by now. The Soyuz has been the most successful space craft ever made. If the Apollo, Saturn V was such a good rocket then why was it scrapped when the Space Shuttle was designed?

       Like I said, if it was possible, they would have done it. I would think a Moon Base would be a pretty high priority for any nation capable of doing it. If we were able to pull it off in 1969, Surely Russia would have managed to do it in the preceding 44 years. No one has been outside of LEO since Apollo. That strikes me as a little strange.

       This is what has always peeked my interest... we were in a space race with them, right? We got there first, I get that. I get that it might be a little demoralizing... but for russia to never bother at all? While we went several more times? It makes no sense to me.  I really don't think in this case that the prospect of sloppy seconds would be enough to entirely abort any plan to go to the moon. Ever.

       Bill Hicks himself came up with the idea for the Alex Jones character.  This is documented.

       The voiceprint of Bill and Alex are identical.  You can hear Alex on the Bill Hicks Hates Hecklers video, and you can hear Bill on the Alex Refuses Thumbscan video.

       Why must you ignore the words of Bill himself in an interview with Kevin Booth - they discuss the shock jock character and why it would be a good thing to do.

       Did Bill would discuss it with his producer on record, but simply not follow through?

       Nah they wouldn't forget...they just probably knew that expert astronomers (who weren't afraid of  the backlash obviously) would call out the fake backdrops. It would be next to impossible to make a new fake backdrop that matched up correctly constellation and angle wise for each of the thousands of pictures and videos that exist... so they did the easiest thing possible...CLAIM THEY DIDN'T SEE THEM! BRILLIANT!

       That's an interesting theory. Why would it be next to impossible to fake the star fields? The expert astronomers debunking the images would be at the same professional level, or lower, of those actually constructing the hoax. In fact, accurately mapping the stars on the backdrop would have been a relatively easy task compared to all other aspects of the hoax.

       Getting roughly 3k-6k stars at a time precisely correct on multiple backdrops at different angles in videos and in pictures, while showing the correct constellations and angles of those constellations would be anything but "easy". You're in denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stars were simply left out because any tiny mistake in placement would have been undeniable proof that the missions were faked, and the ratio for a mistake would have been ridiculously high based on the number of pictures, videos, and locations that they were taken. One single backdrop wouldn't have worked, they would have needed hundreds of different backdrops to cover the scope...how do you not get this?

       If someone is capable of detecting a mistake in a fake star field then that very same person would be able to make a correct star field. How could he/she know a star is missing or in the wrong spot without also being able to put it in the right spot? Just because it would take thousands of man hours does not mean it is impossible.

       I never said it was impossible...but the effort/risk is easily avoided by just making up the simple excuse that the astronauts "couldn't see them".

       It's possible that the reflection from the regolith would have given them a form of "snow blindness" (as a Canadian, this is a common occurrence, and a nuisance, and can be a hazard when on the open road).

       The actual albedo of the Moon ranges from 0.12 (similar to dry asphalt) up to 0.45 (comparable to light sand, which is rather blinding in large quantities), but has been observed at albedos up to 0.60, similar to white ice. It's conceivable that, with the refraction and glare caused by their visors, they could have missed the stars.

       I'd like to see the actual quote where astronauts actually say that they saw no stars before presenting counter-arguments (it's always good to have all the theses on the table). It doesn't seem like something that would be left out of such a major conspiracy theory (or conspiracy).

       The Moon hoax has been debunked to hell and back, there truly is not a single shred of evidence to suggest anything was faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have debated this hogwash for years, and 99% of the time those who believe it was faked don't want to know what is true, only what is most entertaining. The sheer scale and number of people involved
       <em>
        were

       it a conspiracy would be mind-blowing, it's just not possible.

       I highly recommend a fellow by the name of "Astrobrant" on Youtube. He, among others have a vast series of videos debunking pretty much every Moon hoax claim to date.

       Okay, let's see, almost every single person who worked at/with the following would have to have all lied for the Moon landing to be a hoax:
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA, the Russian space program, the Chinese space program, the Japanese space program, the European space program, all privately funded space companies, the astronauts themselves, the astronaut's families, the astronaut's doctors, the engineers, the scientists, astronomers, the telecommunications folks, the military, and finally amateur astronomers who tracked the Apollo missions there and back. I'm sure I've missed others, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, not a peep. Not a single word from anyone that wasn't Bill bloody Kaysing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of people involved would be
       <em>
        staggering
       </em>
       to the point of impossibility. Hundreds of thousands of people working at and around NASA would have to be in on it, and that's just within NASA alone. 
And the number of people in on the Moon hoax would dwarf the living hell out of the MK program, the two simply aren't comparable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is ABSURD to be even discussing this in the year 2013. Were it a fake, we would have found out long ago. There is OVERWHELMING evidence to suggest men did in fact walk on the Moon. The evidence of extraordinary claims HAS BEEN MET.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sincerely hope you do some genuine research into it.

       I haven't looked into all of this a lot, but 2 things that seem significant:
       <br/>
       They planted mirrors on the surface of the Moon. Mirrors which are to this day being used for research. They bounce lasers off of it and track the time (or something like that). They even did it in an episode of The Big Bang Theory.
       <br/>
       Secondly, if it had all been a hoax, how did no other country call their bluff on it. There must have been spies everywhere.

       Leaked NASA footage around 2001 shows the 3 Apollo astronauts faking a shot of the earth from about 2/3 of the way to the moon. They communicate with mission control stating how far out they are, the date on the tape indicates they should have been about 1 day away from lunar orbit. They then speak on another channel with someone giving them directions on how to fake the shot (using transparencies over the window). Upon removing the transparency from the window you can clearly see they never left low earth orbit. This documentary shows it somewhere towards the beginning (maybe about 20 minutes in).

       well all i can say is not even in interviews and nasa has still not explained how an thinly shielded spacecraft was able to transport humans successfully thru the van allen radiation belt unscathed there and back again...oops transgressed on to the lord of the rings...lol...no one not even the astronauts can explain this in interviews,,,can you...i am open minded and work in science so methodically thinking the craft would require very extensive shielding ? so back then they solved this yet in the space shuttle they could not?..just an observation..what are your thoughts....wont go into other anomalies  just throwing it up for discussion

       "Radiation belt" is a bit of a misnomer. While there are some gamma and x-rays (generally high-energy waves), most of the radiation belt is composed of atomic nuclei (stripped of electron shells, and, as a result, polarized). Unless they're decaying heavy elements, nuclei don't produce any radiation on their own; assuming that there are some decaying heavy element nuclei there, they're few and far apart, and the shielding on the landers and the far more considerable shielding on the lunar orbiters would have sufficed, and then some.

       In space, there's approximately 1 hydrogen atom per cubic foot (depending on proximity to star, etc.). Let's say that's tripled in the Belt. Still not enough to produce any major effects over the few days the Astronauts spent immersed in the belt.

      <p>
       This has been explained ad nauseum. They went through the van allen belt at high speeds, not spending that much time in it, the ship was lightly shielded, and they went through a thinner portion of it. If you do the calculations then the radiation exposure wasn't that great.

       yes you cant dress it up more than that even the astronauts avoided it in answering questions just better to leave it  i guess too many trolls..just apply logic that we cant go to the moon now but will need to wait another 20 years so how did they do it back then?????...

       Another example, is to look at the rubegoldberg machine that they had to create to land the mars rover.

      <p>
       Also, they were very concerned with dust. When we allegedly landed on the moon, there was no dust kicked up by the landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when a helicopter lands here, it kicks up stuff. So why none on the moon, and a huge concern on mars?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is the issue of the stars. They say that they could not have been picked up by the camera due to lack of technology, yet the astronauts should have seen them. They say they didn't see any stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, (some would say completely unrelated) the astronauts were all Freemasons.

      <p>
       The reason the dust didn't stay suspended for very long (as it does here on Earth, forming a cloud) is because the Moon has no atmosphere (making the particles settle almost immediately, see
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C5_dOEyAfk">
        feather and hammer demonstration from Apollo 15
       </a>
       ). Mars had enough of an atmosphere to allow for the creation of dust clouds, which is the reason why Curiosity's sky crane had to hover 25 feet above ground level — which still kicked up a significant amount of dust, which, in turn, prompted NASA to wait a few hours before lifting the cameras' dust covers, the cause of much anxiety and frustration in the amateur astronomy community.

       As for your argument about the astronauts not seeing any stars, I'm intrigued. Care to post a source?

      <p>
       On a side-note, the Hasselblad 500 EL used on the Apollo 11 mission used
       <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11-hass.html">
        70mm film
       </a>
       , which is comparable to 4K resolution, with approximate frame widths of 4,000 x 3,100 pixels, or 12.4 megapixels — about the resolution of an entry-level DSLR camera. The camera would most likely have seen some stars, depending on the configuration, and the composition of the lenses, which might've refracted enough light reflected by the regolith to wash out the stars.

       It's my belief that Apollo 15 footage is valid as evidence, as no vacuum chamber around back then (and very few around today) were large enough to have that entire set contained within them. Same goes for famous

       You can't see stars on the Moon when it is daytime, just like on Earth. Also, the technology could pick up the stars, but it would have had to heighten the exposure dramatically to see the stars at which point everything else would have been over-exposed.

       I'm 99% sure the moon landing happened (maybe not how they claim), but it is a fact that our government will lie, cheat, and steal to push their agenda, so I can never be 100%.

       Just a tidbit - in Bill Clinton's autobiography
       <em>
        My Life
       </em>
       , he talks about an old carpenter he knew when he was growing up.  After the moon landing, the carpenter asked young Bill if he believed they had really landed on the moon.  Bill said he did, and it was because he "saw it on TV".  The carpenter replied that he didn't believe it for a minute, and "them television fellers could make anything look real".  Back then, Bill said, he thought the old guy was a crank, but during his 8 years as President, Bill recollects that guy may have been ahead of his time.

       OK - just a question. The US spends trillions on wars to colonize other countries here on Earth. They kill millions of innocents - just for space and resources here on Earth.  Yet almost 50 years ago the US owned the monopoly on access to the nearest planetary body to Earth, and just wholesale abandoned the effort to leave it up to grabs for other countries? It seems as if we could easily travel there 50 years ago, we could have had some type of base there by now - even if only rudimentary, or have made multiple trips there to investigate for resources. The US could basically have claimed the entire moon for the  home country with a 50 year advantage on everyone else and they just...walked away? This I don´t understand. Did the ancient sailors, after reaching foreign shores, decide to keep sailing within miles of shore for the next half century? Did the first explorers on the new world decide to stay within a few miles of the coast for 50 or so years, for whatever reason? None of this makes sense to me.

       The US doesn't really colonize other countries. They make military interventions when they're not needed, but apart from some islands in the Pacific (Guam, the Johnston Atoll, etc), they don't really have that much extracontigeous land.

       Sorry about that, just wanted to clarify that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Saturn V was an amazing technological advancement at the time. Building it required years of research, and getting the LM light enough and small enough to fit in there was also a tremendous challenge. I think that they simply lacked the technology to propel larger loads towards the Moon, and saw that it would be a while yet before it would be even remotely possible.

       Verandaguy nice responses.  Most of the room was taken up for the required needs of the people on board..  Even now, the amount of room needed to fill up with scientific tech and survival needs would be impossible without having a midpoint or different crafts at once

       OK - so I still don´t understand. We had a rocket system totally sufficient in the 1960´s to successfully carry men to the moon and back - multiple times - with no human loss. Now, 40 something years later it is somehow a technological wonder that we can even send men into orbit in a glorified dump truck? How does that answer the question? This midpoint wasn´t necessary in the 1960´s ? This doesn´t even even slightly answer the question at hand.

       Dump truck?  Hardest part is GETTING THERE..  See how many USSR rockets didnt even make it off the ground...  Also what I meant is that the shuttle was FULL, no more room.  They couldnt bring any real scientific tech with them that is why they didnt stay long..  If they had a midpoint where they could either refuel and resupply than that would be a huge help.  We live in a much more expensive world now also.

       ... Which is why so many private space companies are investing in new technologies, which would allow for foldable or inflatable stations to be placed in high-Earth orbit between the Earth and Moon, which would allow for refuelling of larger ships, which would be used to place temporary or permanent colonies on the Moon. But that's still

       Retard-baby-conspiracies like Moon Landing Hoax just make all the other more authentic ones look bad. I think it's partially paranioa and ignorance and partially deliberate. I imagine the Soviets helped spread around the initial rumors.

       You mistake what I say.  People are paid by agencies to post and downvote here, not there.  People from that sub also post and mass downvote here.  Most regular posters here are halfway rational.  They hold conversations with you and try to answer questions you have with relevant evidence/links.  Sure, they may downvote if you're blatantly being overly dickish or cynical, but they will still consider what you have to say.

       Yes, just go ahead and belittle someone because you disagree with them.  The entire thought process of "not important enough for the government to care" is completely bullshit when we have evidence of FBI plans to assassinate occupy protest leaders and mass information collection campaigns through facebook and such.

       Disinformation campaigns are a long standing tactic for governments all over the world.  By simply brushing off the possibility that there are people who are paid to dissuade ideas that go against the official narrative for no reason other than "they wouldn't do that," you are propagating their potential to cause harm and suppress information.

       I Think a lot of reason r/conspiracy gets a lot of shit is not because of the content, but rather based off how everyone INTERPRETS the content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the moon landing for example, iv read through some comments that are like "i saw the blueprints. We went to the moon". First you have to understand what people are saying when they say the moon landing was a HOAX or that it "DID NOT HAPPEN". When I say this people come back with things like, "how can that be possible, NASA exist and thus everything NASA says is true and they let the public know everything THUS the moon landing must be real."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well for me this inst the case at all. When i think of the Fake moon landing im not implying that NASA secretly filmed us landing on the moon in some studio in Hollywood, NOR am i even saying that NASA THEMSELVES were in on the Faking of the landing. What i AM saying is that we did not send a man to the moon and that a few high lvl people were involved in a plot to make it LOOK like we went to the moon, without actually going.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me it boils down to the fact that
 A) we can't even go to the fucking moon know and you expect me to believe we went in the 1960's on shittier technology?
B) The fucking Van Allen radiation belt.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt
       </a>
       C) The fact that many NASA employies have come out and said that we, the public, are being LIED TOO. and dont forget that even THE ASTRONAUTS THEMSELVES have come out and said that we are being lied too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you must go ahead believing what every the telly or the news tells you, BUT DONT get mad or accuse people who are trying to find out all the facts  anything but sane.

       This is the oldest one in the book and has been explained to the point of nausea. The Wikipedia article you posted in fact contradicts your claims. If you are seriously suggesting the Van Allen belts as proof, then you have a lonnnnng road ahead of you in understanding physics.

       <strong>
        new
       </strong>
       spacecraft that which are superior to the old. Vehicles all the way from cars to jets get replaced routinely; they're not about to send a Saturn V back to the Moon now are they?
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you trying to prove? That the rockets weren't feasible, or the ability to navigate wasn't possible, or the life support isn't real? What could you possibly be trying to say?
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA hasn't been sitting around twiddling its thumbs for 40 years, buddy. If you bothered to look around the NASA website you posted, you'd see there have been and are hundreds of missions underway and planned for the future. And guess what? They're not all Moon-related! I mean seriously, why am I even explaining this to you? Look at their damn website.

       Money. The Moon has the uses of mining and setting up a base which we can use to extend our reach to the rest of the solar system. Unfortunately, NASA has been receiving less and less money ever since the Apollo days. 2013's spending is at roughly $17 Billion, but in the grand scheme of things is an abysmal amount. The lack of incentive for space exploration and allocations of funds is the main culprit here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's far easier to send a rocket from the Moon or its orbit than it is to send it from Earth. Less gravity equals less fuel and mass required, and in turn less money. Once we set up a base on the Moon, it becomes a stepping stone for future manned space flight. Unfortunately, the US government has a hard-on for war, and not space exploration. It's gonna be slow, but we'll get there eventually.

       Yes, the VAB
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an issue to both unmanned and manned spacecraft alike.
       <em>
        However
       </em>
       , only minor amounts of shielding is required for the
       <em>
        brief

       time period a craft must spend in it. The radiation
       <em>
        is

       harmful to a degree, but can be extremely nullified with even the most thin amounts of radiation-resistant plastics built into the walls of the craft.

       I honestly understand why people get caught up on this one, but for god sake it's been debunked time and time again.

And of course NASA has had other missions,i never said anything AT ALL related to NASA's progress other than for some reason we decided to take off from going to the moon for 40 years and NOW in the aftermath of an economic melt down that has been the greatest in united states HISTORY we are finally deciding that it is profitable to mine the minerals on the moon that have BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME? i mean i guess that vaguely makes sense???

       I understand that it is an easy fix using "thin amounts of radiation-resistant plastics built into the walls of the craft" THEN Y THE HELL DIDNT WE APPLY IT TO THE SPACE SHUTTLE? Add additional radiation safty to the space shuttle? NAH BRAH WING IT, WE DONT GOT THE FUNDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       again this makes literally no sense to me. We were able to do something in 1969 but current day space ships had this radiation shielding taken off completely or switched for a much shitter radiation shielding system??

       Oh dear. There's something we need to clear up here: the belts begin at about 1000km above the surface, and extend to an upwards of 60,000km.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that in mind, the Space Shuttle has gone no higher than 600km above the surface, and even then that was a one time venture to perform maintenance on the Hubble Space Telescope. The ISS, which orbits roughly 300km above the surface was the main docking point for the vast majority of the Shuttle missions, so they don't
       <em>
        need
       </em>

       protected from radiation. They have shielding. In case you weren't' aware, the Van Allen Belts aren't the only source of radiation out there. Spacecraft and

       You've only provided one source (amongst your numerous, unnecessary profanities and spelling mistakes), and it's for something which really couldn't have affected the trip to the Moon or back that much. Please provide some sources for the "NASA employees have come out and said that we [...] are being lied to," as well as the astronauts that claimed that. Videos where the alleged witnesses have their voices changed and/or faces hidden don't count.

       The Van Allen radiation belt most definitely could and would have effected the moon mission.  It a set of belts that surround the earth completely like the magnetic field. One at approximately 400 to 4,000 miles and the other at 9,000 to 15,000 miles from the ground. When astronauts in our current space ship tech went out just 300 miles from earth they reported seeing lots of spots and having headaches. This is caused from all teh radiation you are absorbing. Had they gone further out they would have passed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to wrap up in 1969 we had the space capability to fly a man on the FURTHEST mission every flown in the history of man  BUT in 2012 we currently DO NOT have the technology to send another man back to the moon untill 2020?!?!
      </p>
      <p>
       HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY MAKE ANY SENSE?

       did we just decide to go BACKWARDS in space technology?

       you know, that Saturn rocket worked TOO well, lets take it back to the building blocks and start all over again with a new design.

       WHAT.

       and im sorry i can't provide sources for my claims, too me this is jsut general knowledge i have gained from browsing the web for hours a day every day since 2007. I know everything i said is true, you jsut have to go find it on the internet yourself.

BECAUSE NEWER CARS, PLANES, AND EVERYTHING ELSE ARE SAFER AND MORE EFFICIENT. YOU DON'T JUST SIT THERE WITH WHAT YOU'VE GOT AND CALL IT A DAY, YOU BUILD BETTER, SAFER, MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLES THAT'LL GET THE JOB DONE. I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO GET THIS INTO YOUR THICK SKULL.

       LESSSS GOOO, good discussion lads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, with our CURRENT SPACE SHUTTLE TECHNOLOGY we are NOT  able to pass through the belt. LOOK IT UP. Astronauts went out just 300 miles and were experiencing head aches and seeing spots when they had there eyes closed(radiation particles flying into them). I in know way acknowledged  that they went through the belt, i dont think they did nor could have even if they wanted too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So about this infromation about going to the moon in 2020.........
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/science/02nasa.html">
        http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/science/02nasa.html
       </a>
       . BOOM.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The proposal would officially end aspirations to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020"
      </p>
      <p>
       I am baffled by how informed you think you are. I REALLY have researched all of this and COMPLETELY believe everything im telling you is backed up by valid information, it just might take you 2 hours + of browsing the web to find it. Sorry, research is time consuming.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have fooled yourself on this one. Like you said we are not driving around in 1950's cars because there was a STEADY progression of new cars with better technology in them.YOUR RIGHT, you DONT just sit there for 40 odd years thinking, hmm how can we make this better?
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA instead opted to instead, in the midest of the best economy we have had since the great depression, lay back on the space exploration and only have manned orbital flights.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of advancing off their brilliant Saturn rocket they completely redesign the general look of the space shuttle and cut back on its capabilities??
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if some car companies decided to completely remodel the entire body of the car in the 1970's and cut back on its general power and ability as a vehicle. Why  would you do this i dont even.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the caps locks did not help, it just made me read it as if you were yelling all the info at me. lol
      </p>
      <p>
       Also to get back to the idea of making things more efficient and safer, couldn't we have done that will all our new neat technology in the 80's or 90's?? NOPE
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead we wait 40+ years to "make sure" we have it perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yah and you know all those revolutionary technologies that you are saying we would use to make the trip so much more efficient and safer?
      </p>
      <p>
       LOOK AT THE ROCKET, LOOK AT IT.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the SAME general design as the SATURN rocekt. Your telling me it took us 40 years of waiting just so we could keep using the SAME general format of a rocket but we HAD  to have all the little gadgets that will make the trip more pleasurable/efficient??? and obviously safer.

       you are correct kind sir. Im just saying if you could do it in 1969, i feel like we could have made it cheap enough today as that it could be applied to all space ships. And to me at least i feel that radiation shielding is one of those "necessary" things for space ships to have, as it could save there life from cancer or many other radiation related diseases, so the more the marrier, why skips out on possibly life saving technology that were able to do in 1969 but fr some reason 40+ years later we are like "nah man, we will use that shitter radiation shielding to save on a few bucks"

       It's not shittier in that it's lighter and still performs as it has to. NASA's coffers aren't exactly overflowing, and the shielding on the shuttle blocks all the radiation it will ever have to. For the shuttle, this shielding is as good as the other one as it won't ever go far enough to need the other one.
