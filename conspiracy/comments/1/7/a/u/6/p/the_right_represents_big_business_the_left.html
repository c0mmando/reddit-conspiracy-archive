<p>This is <em>exactly</em> where we&#39;re headed, and the two parties really are two poisonous heads on the same evil snake.</p>

<p>Why oh why is it that people can&#39;t wake up to this?</p>

<p>The shit is <em>obvious</em>.  All you have to do is look at it for a moment and realize now more than ever that the apex of negativity that either party represents is EXACTLY what this country is turning into as we <em>speak</em>.  Every moment we really ARE turning into what I just mentioned above:  A society where the state is <em>entirely</em> run (as per the Dems) and ruled by corporations (as per the Reps) - fulfilling the <em>negative</em> climax and end game of both parties with what was in all likelihood the plan <em>all along</em>.  Split and divide the people into thinking that they are either on one side or the other of the coin, not realizing that what they&#39;re fighting for is either THIS side of their ultimate demise, or THAT side of their ultimate slavery and bondage.  In the end, regardless of what side you choose, we end up in exactly the same place/shit hole (that was planned all along).  We either get total government and state rule over the people and every aspect of our lives (Dems), or we get total <em>corporate</em> and big business rule over the people and every aspect of our live (Reps).</p>

<p>What&#39;s the difference?</p>

<p>Neither party is better than the other folks.  Neither is &quot;the good guy&quot;.  They&#39;re BOTH evil because they both belong to the same ultimate agenda.</p>

<p>Wake up, my brothers and sisters.  Wake up.</p>

<p>Both parties use the strategy of making the other look completely evil.  We see the dem&#39;s view on reddit.  On the other side, the republicans are doing exactly the same.</p>

<p>Dividing people is an excellent strategy.  Conspiracy theorists are painted as nut jobs/racists, libertarians are painted as angsty teenagers.  To casual observers this is enough to dismiss their views entirely (at least as I&#39;ve witnessed on <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>).  </p>

<p>I personally just try to not fear giving out my opinions, but also try to be gentle with it.  Being contrarian for the sake of it doesn&#39;t help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very, very good question.  Upvote for better visibility.</p>

<p>Ha.  I just wrote a long response, and realized that I was responding incorrectly, as I was proposing some things we could do AFTER we oust the corrupt government that we have.  I got ahead of myself, however, because you didn&#39;t ask what we do after we oust the corrupt government.  You ask what we do after we wake up.  So what do we do after we wake up?</p>

<p>We oust the corrupt government.</p>

<p>By the way, when you say &quot;we&quot;, I&#39;m assuming you mean the American people...as in the WHOLE of the American people.  If that&#39;s what you mean, then don&#39;t think that ousting the corrupt government would actually be all that difficult, because if WE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE were to <em>ALL</em> stand up and march forward, TPTB would have no chance.  None at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That is why the leadership and direction and action needs to take place INDIVIDUALLY from WITHIN.  There is no hot air whatsoever if each individual were to stand up and be ready and willing to do something other than what the MSM indoctrinates us to do.</p>

<p>This is the reason that another pertinent thing to do is to engender a better state of education and culture in the population.  It is no surprise or accident that the great increase in violent crimes and the general degradation of this society is coinciding with a decreasing in the countries education.</p>

<p>Leadership and direction and action are indeed important.  Those qualities exist in each of us, however, but they are completely and fully undermined when we wholly give that power over to any one person that &quot;everyone&quot; follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish someone would step up and make an organized effort and actually DO something about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish that would happen as well, and I further wish that what is advocated and taught via this organized effort would be autonomy and individual effort, ability, and fortitude.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, no, no.  You misunderstand.  I <em>agree</em> with you fully 100%.  I&#39;m not saying that it is &quot;individually&quot; that we can make the kinds of significant accomplishment spoken about here.  It is a collective effort.  Not an individual one.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying, however, is that the only way that the collective will be fortified is if EACH AND EVERY individual has the ability to AUTONOMOUSLY function as a leader in and of themselves <em>independent</em> from the blind following of any one person or figurehead.</p>

<p>It certainly seems paradoxical, but it is not a notion that is contradictory in the least.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example: if the company I work for decides to freeze my wages, cut my benefits, and make me take a mandatory unpaid furlow, what can I DO about it except quit, or bitch? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the current societal paradigm we live in, it does indeed seem that it would be difficult for you to do all that much about it.  However, EVEN within the context of this civilization, you <em>could</em> make an effort to exert yourself under such circumstances and be a &quot;one man army&quot; against your employers actions, for example.  It&#39;s happened before and with much success.  There is a lot you could do legally, etc if you so chose.  Again, however, this society is indeed structured in such a manner that such action on your part would NOT by any means be either condoned or very supported, but this isn&#39;t because things simply &quot;have&quot; to be this way or this is just the way thing &quot;are&quot;.  Not at all.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I am not advocating or advising <em>against</em> communal cooperation.  Not in the least.  I feel this is a necessary aspect of a functioning society.  However, I AM advocating for a greater level of self actualization on the part of every individual - one that this society does NOT at all seem to engender as much as some might think.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the argument was about earlier (and don&#39;t remind me), but this assessment right here seems about <em>very</em> right to me - something which I myself would say, and <em>have</em> said in so many words.</p>

<p>Depending on who does the regulating and what that regulating entails, this could be a very good or a very bad thing.</p>

How in the 50s they found out that the Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Ford Foundations(among others) were funding the media, universities, and politicians to fundamentally change the American system to bring about a synthesis of the Soviet and American cultures in a world government, they facilitated at the <em>very least</em> WW1 to bring in a world government.  The Reece Committee just briefly exposed this(the media at the time attacked them for attempting to expose it) but <strong>never stopped it</strong>, meaning that the machine is probably still furthering the goals.

<p>the one where you just contradicted yourself but ok whatever</p>

<p>business and government aren&#39;t the same thing but can be used together</p>

<p>I can see why it&#39;s easy for you to get confused as you seem to reject complexity </p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious you&#39;re only looking for something to argue with.  People like you really are very, very tired, and your inability to see there has been no contradiction is ultimately an embarrassing testament to <em>your</em> lack of understanding and ability.  No one elses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>business and government aren&#39;t the same thing but can be used together</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of the extent to which the two industries are so incestuously conjoined in this country as to actually <em>be</em> practically the same thing, you have missed the greater point, and have chosen to confuse yourself in arguing about minutia.  This is, unfortunately, typical of people like you.</p>

<p>Your last statement is truly funny, and it illustrates a level of hubris on your part that you might be the ONLY one here blind to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blind to what? That you guys think that government is an inherently bad institution. That&#39;s as moronic as thinking business is inherently bad. </p>

<p>To reject government as a whole is a pretty popular opinion in this subreddit, though there is a tinge of irony in that many quote the constitution when doing so.</p>

<p>Yes, when the will of the people can be overpowered and corrupted by separate institutions - it&#39;s a problem. I don&#39;t chose to use the same words as you do, because I don&#39;t agree with your blanket statements. They are trite and childish. </p>
