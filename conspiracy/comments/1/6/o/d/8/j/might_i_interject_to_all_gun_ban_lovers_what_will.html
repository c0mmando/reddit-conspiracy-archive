(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FinRqCocwGE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FinRqCocwGE</a>)</p>

<p>The assault rifles, and clips will not go away. This black market flourishes there still today, and such the like will continue in the undergrounds of the USA. Just like the drug war. As long as there is a demand there will be a supply. Then how many more prisons will need to be built to cover 6 to 10 million illegal weapons buyers, and the tax levied to cover the expense. Perhaps you would like to just execute them to bury the problem.</p>

<p>Hmmm... millions of executions sounds like North Korea. It ain&#39;t gonna work out folks to ban weapons, and their accessories. The government is just fooling themselves, and gun ban lovers are deluding themselves of what will occur here. The only cure to not need weapons is to cure the desire for violence, and treat it as a disease of the mind and spirit of men. Then and only then when tyranny coupled with violence and oppression is wiped out. Will you see people no longer needing guns to protect their freedoms.</p>

<p>Edit: I also suggest that you watch &quot;Camp 14: Total Control Zone&quot; on video. It&#39;s a documentary of the life of Shin Dong-hyuk. Who was born and spent 23 years in the N. Korea death camp and his escape. When you see it you will understand why guns are necessary, and to keep the 2nd amendment alone and unobstructed.</p>

<p>True and no one is denying this.  Gun laws do not make all guns disappear.  They do make them more expensive for criminals though which means they are used less often since the risk/reward is bad.  They also all but end crimes of passion using guns.</p>

<p>Straw man.  Strong gun laws have been brought in to multiple other western countries without these problems.</p>

<p>Sure and while we&#39;re doing that make it more difficult to acquire weapons that are immense force multipliers.</p>

<p>Plenty of politically stable countries survive just fine with strong gun laws.</p>

<p>Also using NK as a comparison is stupid.  A lot of the population there DOES have guns since so many are in the army.  It does nothing though.</p>
