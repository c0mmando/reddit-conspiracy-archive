       I just read a post dedicated to debunking the "Sandy Hook Conspiracy". In the comments I notice a trend which I am sure many of you have experienced before: the employ of sweeping generalisation when referring to "conspiracy theorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       This label is something that I accept, but I cannot help but feel a little uncomfortable with. I feel alarmed when I see "coincidence theorists" using extremely aggressive rhetoric when condemning "conspiracy theorists". Some appear eager to conflate issues and ideas that are completely unrelated. Others are downright violent and address "conspiracy theorists" with a vitriol that I find to be disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I read opinions that I disagree with, I do not condemn the source. I think about the factors influencing his/her opinion, as well as those that influence my own. I do not believe that people
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       their opinions. Further, I do not tell people what they should (or must) think. I view the world with wonder, and do not feel comfortable being authoritative with others. I have heard often that "conspiracy theorists" are driven by ego, a need to be "in the loop" on everything. I find using this one off ad hominem tactic to dismiss a vide variety of ideas to be ironic.
      </p>
      <p>
       In accepting the label of "conspiracy theorist" I feel vulnerable to the associations that are too often thrust upon me by others. This is one of the problems with this term. I feel as though it is an example of doublespeak in it's finest form. Conspiracy is a legal concept. There is a sea of precedent that demonstrates how historically this tactic has been continuously employed by unscrupulous groups. Yet some segments of our society clearly associate the term "conspiracy" with unlikelihood, sensationalism, and ignorance. Once I have acknowledged that I am a conspiracy theorist, it sometimes makes it difficult to engage in a respectful and equal exchange of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you guys think about this label? Is it something that can be reclaimed? Should we continue to identify as "conspiracy theorists"?
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR : The term conspiracy theorists seems to have contradictory meanings. How do we address this?

       The derogatory usage of the term conspiracy theorist is probable a direct result of the dissatisfaction and questions which arose after the assassinations in the sixties.
      </p>
      <p>
       To stop such questions, the CIA has advised its media assets to ridicule and marginalize questioners and label them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is one such Orwellian CIA-memo which instrucst its media assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://mtracy9.tripod.com/cia_instructions.htm">

        Scanned document
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After this memo there was indeed a drastic change in the language of leading newspapers. Kevin Ryan examined the archives of the NYT and the Washington Post. Here is what he found:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This cultural phenomenon goes back to 1967. At that time, in response to questions about the Warren Commission Report (which President Ford helped create), the CIA issued a memorandum calling for mainstream media sources to begin countering “conspiracy theorists.”[13]
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 45 years before the CIA memo came out, the phrase “conspiracy theory” appeared in the Washington Post and New York Times only 50 times, or about once per year. In the 45 years after the CIA memo, the phrase appeared 2,630 times, or about once per week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the CIA memo came out, the Washington Post and New York Times had never used the phrase “conspiracy theorist.” After the CIA memo came out, these two newspapers have used that phrase 1,118 times. Of course, in these uses the phrase is always delivered in a context in which “conspiracy theorists” were made to seem less intelligent and less rationale than people who uncritically accept official explanations for major events.
       </p>
       <p>
        President George W. Bush and his colleagues often used the phrase conspiracy theory in attempts to deter questioning about their activities. When questioned by reporters about an emerging scandal in September 2000, Bush said the idea that his presidential campaign was flashing subliminal messages in advertisements was absurd, and he added that “conspiracy theories abound in America’s politics.”[14] When in 1994, Bush’s former company Harken Energy was linked to the fraudulent Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) through several investors, Bush’s spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, shut down the inquiry by telling the Associated Press — “We have no response to silly conspiracy theories.”

       James Corbett made an interesting podcast about how the term conspiracy theorist is used for stereotyping and ridicule and serves as a thoughtstopper and helps to silence dissident voices (ca. 50 min podcast).

       Well, there is also the historic coincidence that after WWII, especially in Germany and France, there was a philosophical movement to clear the fog about what happened 30 years ago. So the notion of a conspiracy was only then well established in academic circles. The political term escaped the courts in Europe and stranded as a social concept on the banks of mainstream.

       A conspiracy theorist is someone who attends a magic show and attempts to see how the illusions are performed.  However, we live in a world where we are told to believe the magician on stage is a real wizard.

       No, a conspiracy theorist is the guy who ruins the show by talking throughout about how the magician is deliberately deceiving everyone except for him.

       Yes it was a bad analogy.  Rather, a conspiracy theorist will try to figure out how the tricks are performed but will come up with idiotic stories about how the the lady floats in the air due to a secret technology that power companies hate.

       "Conspiracy theorist" is code word for "ridicule."
      </p>
      <p>
       Project Grudge solidified the formal strategy of obfuscation; a strategy designed to deeply ingrain the concept that anyone (especially scientists) who took the UFO subject seriously should be ridiculed. It's one of the most successful cases of social behavior engineering ever attempted, and today it is all-pervasive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "religion" is also similarly deeming.  The Romans enforced the idea that you're only "allowed" to have one. As opposed to the concept of God being an open philosophy.

       If you break down what the term "conspiracy theorist" means it is simply anyone that questions or doesn't believe what you are told by official sources such as the media or government.  It is nothing but a way of telling people to shut up and not question anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way to address it is to simply point out that all the person is doing is demonizing you for questioning things.  Why should that be?  Isn't that the behavior of a totalitarian society such as North Korea where you aren't allowed to question anything?

       The problem is not with the label, it is with the people.  People should be able to openly engage in free thought regardless of what labels you.  Needing to put people in a "box" because of their label shows a laziness of the mind and an inability to think on an individual basis.  If someone is unable to see past the label "conspiracy theorist" they do not deserve the time of day for intelligent conversation.

       The term is a PR, propaganda phrase used to demonize any opponent you want to frame. Framing someone with a term with negative connotations is a common political method. "My opponent, who has not denied he is a pedophile and baby-killing abortionist scum, has never managed a corporation!"   Opponent: "I've never been accused of being any of those! Where did this come from?"   Pol: "See! He still doesn't actually deny it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, all you loonie UFO-loving conspiracy theorists don't know what you are talking about!  The earth IS flat! Hur hur hur.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason, anyone who calls me or friends a 'conspiracy theorist' automatically tags himself as a bullshit artist in action. Though usually it's the known trolls and shills who do that anyway.  The same ones who shrill 'all theories must have evidence. You can't field a conjecture without proof!". At which point they spray blood from their nose and the demon pops out of their abdomen.

       I prefer 'supporter of alternative hypotheses'.

       I
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       refer to myself in this way or at all associate with the word.  I know it's used by the MSM to purposefully vilify those truth seekers unwilling to take TPTB's version of things at face value.  Heck, I wish this subreddit were actually called something different - like r/truthseeking or something - because that would actually be much closer to what's really the case.

       Keep in mind that the term "conspiracy theorist" was used when people came to America speaking of a Germany that was deporting Jewish people into "death camps."
      </p>
      <p>
       No one believed it until the day they found a "death camp."
      </p>
      <p>
       I used this logic to entertain, research and attempt to debunk a "conspiracy."
      </p>
      <p>
       I also approach "conspiracies" like I would a science project testing a hypothesis.
