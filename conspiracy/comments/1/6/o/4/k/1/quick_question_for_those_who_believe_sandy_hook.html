        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Personally I don&#39;t agree. I think that the government played absolutely no role in it and it was just a terrible, senseless act of violence. However, I always enjoy hearing from people with different opinions, so I&#39;ve read some of the threads on here and watched the video that&#39;s going around. I&#39;m just confused on how exactly people think this conspiracy went down. Do they believe that it was planned by the government, and they hired someone to go in and murder a bunch of random children who went to school there? Or do they believe it was staged by the government, and the people who were killed/their families were just actors, and nobody was really killed? I&#39;ve never fully been able to understand what exactly people mean by it being a conspiracy.</p>

<p>EDIT: I don&#39;t need people questioning me on why I don&#39;t believe it was a conspiracy, or treating me like I&#39;m an idiot because I don&#39;t. It&#39;s just my opinion, and it&#39;s not intended to be the main topic of discussion for this post. I&#39;m not questioning any of you on why you believe it is a conspiracy because it doesn&#39;t really matter to me. I&#39;ve seen the &quot;proof&quot; so I have an understanding of how people could think it was a conspiracy. What I&#39;m questioning is how you believe it happened. <strong>Say it really was a conspiracy. How was it pulled off? Were the children/teachers really killed? And if so were the families in on it? Or were the children/teachers/families all actors? And if so how would they have gone about that without making the other people in the town suspicious? I&#39;m not asking to be rude or condescending, but because I am genuinely curious.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think it happened at all.</p>

<p>I think the entire thing was completely made up and scripted.</p>

<p>So. Your turn. Why do you think it happened? Because you trust the government and media who lie to you over and over and over again? Does that seem rational? Is there ever a point where you will just get fed up with all the bullshit lying they do about everything, and just say - fuck it - i dont trust anything you motherfuckers say anymore.</p>

<p>If this government/media told me the sky was blue, at this point, I&#39;d have to stick my head out a window to doublecheck for myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just haven&#39;t seen anything that seems legitimate enough to make me believe it was all scripted. The &quot;evidence&quot; I&#39;ve seen is circumstantial at best. So as of now, I don&#39;t buy into the conspiracy idea at all. If new details emerge that seem to more solidly back this conspiracy idea, then I would absolutely become more skeptical. I don&#39;t blindly trust those that lie to me, I form my opinions for myself, and my opinion is that the proof offered is extremely weak.</p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t come here to argue my point of view. You have yours, I have mine. I simply asked a question trying to understand how conspiracy theorists think it went down as scripted because it interests me. All I want to know is what people mean - if its that the children/teachers were really killed but it was planned, or if the children/teachers were hired actors. That&#39;s all. I posted here because I&#39;m genuinely curious as to what other people think. As I said before, I enjoy hearing differing opinions. You&#39;ll get nowhere in life if you close your mind to opinions other than your own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>can you honestly say you watched the videos of the parents and they appeared to be in a state of profound grief?  Did you really find their performances genuine?

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s my place to judge if people seem to truly be in grief or not because everybody is different, and there is no way to tell how someone truly feels inside. My twin sister committed suicide our junior year of high school, and it was the hardest thing my family has ever gone through. Losing someone close to you is extremely difficult. So difficult that people may not know how to react. </p>

<p>For example, my mother didn&#39;t cry once at her funeral. She was laughing, smiling, and joking around with everyone. My dad took no time off from work after her death. My brother went to prom the day after her funeral, and in those pictures he looks just as happy as all the other kids. But that&#39;s not to say they weren&#39;t grieving. My mother cried herself to sleep every single night for at least three months. My brother spent half of prom crying in the bathroom, and came home and put his fist through a wall that night because he was so upset that my sister would never get to experience prom. My father&#39;s quality of work significantly decreased because even though he was showing up physically, mentally he had checked out because he could think of nothing but my sister. So my point is, just because people don&#39;t seem to be grieving doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t. They could be putting on a strong face and waiting to break down until they are in private. Or they could be in shock, which is extremely plausible in a situation like this. Sure, they could be actors. Anything is possible. But it is also possible, and in my opinion highly more probable, that one of the explanations I offered is true.</p>

<p>The thing I don&#39;t understand is why people keep questioning me on my opinion when that is clearly not the intended focus of this post. I posted because I wanted to hear how people think it went down, not because I wanted to debate my opinion.</p>

<p>Either way, it still hasn&#39;t answered my question. Do you believe the children were actually killed and it was planned by the government, do you believe that nobody was killed and the people were all actors, or do you believe it was a conspiracy in some other way? Clearly it&#39;s pointless to even ask you though, since it seems you&#39;re just going to continue being condescending rather than answering my question and trying to help me understand how the conspiracy would have happened.

    <div class="md"><p>The questions you posed in bold seem valid, and I personally don&#39;t really have great answers for them.  However, what seems even more damning to me is not so much the questions regarding <em>how</em> everything got staged if it <em>is</em> a conspiracy, but, instead, all the strange inconsistencies that legitimately exist with regard to the people and reported details surrounding the incident itself.  In other words, the question I ask isn&#39;t &quot;If it&#39;s a conspiracy, how did it exactly happen?&quot; but, instead, &quot;If it&#39;s NOT a conspiracy, then why the FUCK are there so many damning inconsistencies in the reporting of the events?&quot;</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, it doesn&#39;t really matter to me if I can or can&#39;t figure out exactly HOW whoever managed to stage the event.  The fact that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrngdgUixYg&amp;amp;feature=share">there are <em>so</em> many unanswered questions</a> <em>really</em> speaks of something VERY badly awry going on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to make any assumptions or jump to any conclusions, and this is not <em>at all</em> said in any confrontational way whatsoever (so please don&#39;t take it that way), but are you saying that you <em>don&#39;t</em> question the events or what happened or question what the MSM is telling you happened?  With regard to the public&#39;s own, independent investigations about the MSM&#39;s story/version of what happened, etc, and in the massive mountain of inconsistencies that the public and that independent investigators have uncovered and brought to light, you actually don&#39;t have <em>any</em> questions as to whether it was actually staged or not?  That&#39;s not something you&#39;re questioning?  Regardless of <em>how</em> it happened, there are a LOT of inconsistencies that it seems REALLY have to get answered and addressed too...and if they don&#39;t, then honestly that seems even <em>more</em> damning to me than &quot;how&quot; they did it, no?</p>

<p>I understand that the question you have with regard to <em>how</em> it could have been done is indeed a valid one - and I do think that it is very important to uncover the answer to it.  However, I think it&#39;s actually even MORE important for the public to simply grasp and come to realize that TPTB have been in the business of staging false flags attacks ON THEIR OWN PUBLIC for a VERY long time now, and this is how they further enslave the people.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DKOh1.png">It&#39;s gone on for quite some time now</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not it proves to be real, the point is (well, at least from my perspective after researching all of this controversy for a few days) the ultimate possibility of the government doing something like this to the people. It&#39;s very possible and it&#39;s very real that things are happening that we are not told. History repeats itself. It always has and always will until the &quot;end of time&quot; (that is, if there is such a thing as the end of time). The United States will not remain forever just as many other governments haven&#39;t in the past. Also, it is true that many Americans are narrow-minded. Our whole lives we have been told that America is the best, but why does everyone else hate the US while we&#39;re here basking in our &quot;glory?&quot; Anyway- my mind is all over the place, I apologize for the jumpy-ness of this comment.</p>

And yes, other towns and people would be curious, but do you (no insult, this is just a question) understand the power of money and the power of threat? If you understand how powerful the government is, how they can do whatever they want regardless of our faulty constitution, you can begin to understand why people believe this event has the government involved. Either way, whether you believe or not, you (and everyone else) need to watch closely at what is happening before you in this country and in the world. I&#39;m not saying you don&#39;t, it&#39;s just a general statement. I value your opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely know the government have done some very shady things in the past. I believe in some other conspiracy theories, but in this case I don&#39;t. Of course, like you said, there is the possibility the government did this. Probability of them doing it is another story though. I&#39;ve often questioned why everyone else hates America too, and I definitely feel like it comes down to having something to do with our government though I&#39;m not entirely sure what. I know the government is not to be completely trusted at all, but I also don&#39;t think everything is a conspiracy. And no worries for the jumpy-ness. I have ADHD so I know how that goes! Haha.</p>

<p>Yeah, I understand the power of money and threats. I just find it hard to understand how they would have gone about faking this. Really hiring a man to go in and kill all those children and teachers? That&#39;s just sick. Or hiring actors to play the parts of the children, teachers, and their families? That would be an extremely long job, because they would have had to live in the community for a long time in order to appear to be normal citizens of the town. And if the children were actors were they hired from birth to live in the towns with these families? That seems extremely hard to pull off to me. I definitely watch closely at what is happening in this country, and I think it&#39;s always important to question the information you&#39;ve been given. I like to look into things for myself. I form my own opinions rather than just blindly accepting what I&#39;ve been told, because I never trust anyone (helloooooo trust issues, haha). Like this, for example. I&#39;ve formed my opinion after looking into things for myself, and I&#39;m still looking into things even after I&#39;ve formed my opinion. I&#39;m reading about it, watching videos about it, and talking to those who believe it was staged, in order to try to better understand why they believe that, and to see if I come across any information that could make me re-consider my belief. I try to stay informed on all the possibilities, even the ones I disagree with. I think it&#39;s important to know why each side believes what they believe, because I think that ultimately will allow you to come to the best conclusion.</p>

<p>And for the record, I&#39;m not asking these questions in a rhetorical way. After re-reading my post, I realized people may see my questions as ridiculing their opinions or trying to push my opinion, and I wanted to make sure people know that&#39;s not the case. I&#39;m honestly just asking out of genuine curiosity to see how people believe the government pulled this off because like you said, there is always the possibility they did. And even though I don&#39;t believe they did, it is fascinating to me that there is that possibility so I&#39;m just curious to see how it would have gone down. </p>

<p>Sorry for the really long reply, by the way. I&#39;m trying to explain things and I feel like I&#39;m not doing too good of a job with it, haha. Makes much more sense in my head. I value your opinion too. It was definitely one of the helpful ones, so thank you for responding!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I can only tell you how I think it happened. I believe that there were 2 ways this could have gone down. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>There was supposed to be a mock shooting drill set in place by an organization to help kids cope with school shootings and a real shooting happened that day. This one is not as believable as the other (for me anyways).</p></li>
<li><p>The entire thing was staged by the government in order to gain leverage for gun control laws to take effect so that the up-and-coming generations won&#39;t be able to buy &quot;assault weapons&quot; and anything over 10-rounds per magazines.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There is more evidence for the latter, such as the &quot;parents&quot; obviously acting (there was an interview with Anderson Cooper where a family of two, just 2 days after their daughter was killed in the shootings, was laughing with him), a girl that supposedly died in the shootings appearing with Obama in a later meetings, there being only 1 ambulance for the entire 26 kids to be taken to the hospital, the &quot;primary weapon&quot; used by the shooter being found in the trunk of his car, even though he died INSIDE the school, and the medical examiner being extremely unprofessional (not answering questions, redirecting questions, studdering etc.) at his question-answering conference almost a day after the shooting. There&#39;s much more. </p>

<p>Search &quot;Sandy Hook debunking&quot; on YouTube. It should be a 30 minute long video and it elaborates more on these points as well as others. If there&#39;s anything I missed, please reply to me saying what they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just haven&#39;t seen anything that seems legitimate enough to make me believe it was all scripted. The &quot;evidence&quot; I&#39;ve seen is circumstantial at best. So as of now, I don&#39;t buy into the conspiracy idea at all. If new details emerge that seem to more solidly back this conspiracy idea, then I would absolutely become more skeptical. I don&#39;t blindly trust those that lie to me, I form my opinions for myself, and my opinion is that the proof offered is extremely weak.</p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t come here to argue my point of view. You have yours, I have mine. I simply asked a question trying to understand how conspiracy theorists think it went down as scripted because it interests me. All I want to know is what people mean - if its that the children/teachers were really killed but it was planned, or if the children/teachers were hired actors. That&#39;s all. I posted here because I&#39;m genuinely curious as to what other people think. As I said before, I enjoy hearing differing opinions. You&#39;ll get nowhere in life if you close your mind to opinions other than your own. </p>

<p>No, but you don&#39;t seem rational either. Determining that a shooting never happened isn&#39;t exactly an application of occam&#39;s razor in this context. </p>
