        He makes fun of the situation, laughing a few times. At around 1:50-2:00, he
gets lost in what he is saying; looks at a police officer to our right who then nods.

        Just "Happened" to be on Dec 14, the same day of the shooting? Well maybe. Wait.. Friday? A free,
Friday-only course? I don't think so. Also, there are simple things that don't add up.

Yeah, right. Coincidence.

       And you don't think the same thing happens here on Reddit? To control your population is to control the information. You think 'the government' really doesn't see the power of the internet and has their own force into place to counter the information stream of the truth?

       It would be much harder in reddit to do the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       First - no anon accounts. Second, visible and responsible mods in subs. Third, if a post is "removed" other mods see the removal and can re-approve the comment after removal allowing for a deeper check and balance.
      </p>

       it essentially buries the important parts of a thread. like a rock slide. a barrage of unrelated comments/pornography. unfortunately it kept it on the front page so the said "switch tactics" and suddenly the thread gets buried.

       Being the Devils Advocate here:
One of my family members had something bad happen to her that was all over the news for awhile. It was amazing how many times the News people messed up the story. They added "facts", left other facts out, got the order of events completely backwards, it was horrible. Sometimes it's not the government causing the stories to be changed, but the news media just being complete retards.

       I'm still waiting for a witness to come forward saying that they actually saw Lanza the day of the shooting. Until that happens, I remain skeptical of the entire ordeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statistically speaking, it seems nearly impossible that not ONE person has come forward saying they saw him that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, to me, is the one thing that makes no sense whatsoever and should be the only thing anyone needs to question the events/explanation/investigation of that day.

       Quit bringing in reason and logic to a thread that is hellbent on maintaining some solid level of ignorance and stupidity. Why is it that all of this opinion is taken as fact when there is, indeed, no proof of any kind of manufacturing of this situation.

       I guess at least you keep this bullshit cooped up in r/conspiracy and people realize the ignorance they're walking into when they come in here looking for some kind of 'evidence' or reason.

       All am saying is that the firefighters had pulled out of the building over concern that it was going to collapse. That's a fact. We can debate the how and why of WTC7 all day, but there were no firefighters near the building for two hours before the building finally went down.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The most important operational decision to be made that 
afternoon was the collapse had damaged 7 World Trade 
Center... It had very heavy fire on many floors and I ordered the evacuation of an area sufficient around to protect our members, so we 
had to give up some rescue operations that were going on 
at the time and back the people away far enough so that if 
7 World Trade did collapse, we wouldn't lose any more 
people.
       </p>

       OMG IT DOESN'T MATTER what the fucking time difference is, if it was live coverage or not. Fact: BBC reporter reports WTC7 had collapsed while standing in eye sight of the building still upright. So it doesn't matter if it took 10 seconds or 10 days for the recording to get back to the UK, they still received and reported on an event just minutes before it happened.

       Yeah but you can't prove if he was wearing a watch or not, and don't say cell phone because that doesn't count as a watch since you have to take it out of your pocket to see it. He couldn't possibly have seen his cell phone through his pocket...

       have you ever watched on the news when they have someone over a satellite feed. Have you seen how long it takes the person on satellite to hear what the person just asked them. Same idea here. The live coverage is not "live" live it's TV live. Which is delayed.

       I didn't know it was 20 minutes. But I seriously doubt that whoever is organizing a giant conspiracy like 9/11 would have all of the media networks in on it. It's just too many loose ends to give the info too. Okay you work in TV News has anyone ever told you, "hey we're doing this big false flag thing so please read this script but make sure you say it at the right time". I just don't buy them telling the BBC about 9/11 over the possibility that the wrong footage ran.

       The problem is that the BBC never explained why they prematurely announced the collapse of WTC7, which according to the official account was "totally unexpected" since no steel framed building had ever collapsed due to fire before.

       it's true them not making a statement is troubling. But I'll admit to not being really into the 9/11 being an inside job thing. Occams razor and all that. But I don't know I'm not omnipotent

       There is a tweet by megneverland on April 28th saying that Fox News was reporting OBL's death. OBL was not killed until May 2. There is no known way to backdate a tweet, so this tweet was made on April 28. We know that much for sure.

       Correction: he tweeted about something he saw in the Fox News ticker (the horizontal scroll on the bottom). He could have easily seen "Osama Bin Laden" and "dead" out of context, and interpreted it wrong. Come on guys, you must have better proof than this -.-

       Thats a tweet by some random guy though...He says he saw something on the news. This isn't even a third-person source, it's like 6th. Those tickers are usually misleading, especially if you miss a part, or accidentally mix two stories. Seriously though, how do you think this is proof? It baffles me that you (and sooo many others) are so naive.

       Apparently every single thing has been debunked officially and there's nothing to see here..

       Isn't this rhetoric getting old for anyone else?!

       Aren't people starting to get pissed at the fact that every time a tragedy occurs massive waves of legislation are put forth to strip more freedoms from the American people?

       Are people not

       intrigued by all of this?

       Or are we all just waiting to be ushered into our government centers after some national calamity?

       Our entertainment will be a constant live feed of the American military snuffing out any pockets of resistance (terrorists) in our homeland. Murdering innocent men women and children in the name of freedom.
While we idly sit by and cheer for the greatness of this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this what we're waiting for? Because it is rapidly approaching.

       That's the signal of a dictatorship.  Look at the history of Spain, Chile, Libya, etc.  The government considers anyone whom questions their rule a 'subversive' or a terrorist and ousts them.  This country seems to be headed down this road.

       Can anyone on this thread point to a piece of evidence that ISN'T a piece of easily manipulated digital imaging or a Youtube video that requires me to interpret the correct emotional response of another human being?

       It's a new era. MSM can't compete with a community as large and diversified as Reddit - with regards to speed of information. However, much of the info hitting Reddit isn't vetted and isn't entirely accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       People used to wait hours (and sometimes days) for journalists to gather information, vet stories, and present them in a straightforward manner.  In an era of instantaneous communication, everyone wants answers NOW and the rumors and errors of the first reports haven't been filtered out. And they go online immediately and become part of the information dump, despite being contradictory.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are going to see an increase in this tendency in the near future. There's no antidote, but we need to sift through with a little more diligence.

       Yes but the smoking gun is not the facebook page or the vimeo. It's the tweet that came out saying "Check out my video" that linked to the sandy hook video. There is no way to backdate or change a tweet so it is a fact that that tweet happened 4 days before the shooting. Although the tweet just said "Check out my video" so it is possible that the video was changed after the fact.

       Good people are on the inside trying to sabotage their plans and make their corruption public. The Dark Knight Rises stuff...that's beautiful. Proof that the theater shooting was planned all along and the Sandy Hook hoax had already been planned months in advance. Yes, it IS a massive conspiracy...and they got caught. Rejoice.

       You obviously don't understand, the vemeo video was shared on creation day with a tweet about the newtown massacre. Both timestamped. Along with a Facebook page of Ortiz. Several days in advance. Also the fundraiser page. Debunk them all right now or shut your shill ass mouth!

       You're all missing my point.. why not create all those things AFTER the shooting?

       If I where to executive a conspiracy like this I wouldn't create those pages beforehand, that makes no sense at all! The only reason I can imagine is to cause confusion. Make people doubt the official reason and sound like nutcases to the sheeps.. that way I could distract attention from something else.

       So you're saying people smart enough to orchestrate a vast conspiracy involving not only a shooting at an elementary school, but apparently dozens of media people, are not smart enough to realize that things made on the internet are dated on the day they're actually made, and that it might be a bad idea to tell people that there's going to be a shooting four days before it actually happens?

       I am not sold that it happened like that in this situation, however, the people who claim to be of the nature you describe follow laws of Karma.

       Science sure got a boost over "magic" in the 16th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Atheism movement that resulted is very interesting. No Atheist could ever be a magician in the old sense of that word. Perhaps the group in question was eliminating competition. Religious dogma of post-reformation christianity also prevent magic, as if they too were trying to eliminate competition.

       This also denies the distinct possibility that TPTB are trying to force a civil war, which would benefit them for thousands of reasons.

       Best way to start a civil war is to convince a healthy portion of your population that you are a lying sack of shit bent on world domination.

       Maybe that's the only way they figure they can weasel out of their debt, and still retain power. If the U.S. corporate government came out and said "we're broke", the world's answer is then going to be, "okay, what are
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       going to do about it". If, instead, they provoke a civil war, they can claim:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The situation was out of their control, and they are therefore not responsible.
       </li>
       <li>
        After the economic collapse, assert that they are the only ones in the country qualified to govern, as they have the experience.
       </li>
       <li>
        Rally the sheep around them in order to protect "the nation".
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       On point number three, picture in your mind a group of wolves protecting themselves from lions, by hiding deep among a herd of sheep.

       You claim it's the biggest but that doesn't make it true. Have you looked into the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations' involvement in education? Public education? Government funded and regulated education? You, I, and most commenters know nothing when it comes to the secrets the government keeps. Did you know the US used white phosphorous in Iraq? There's evidence to support that and that would be a war crime. Where's the news on it? History is shrouded in conspiracy.

       Haha you fucking idiots. I see you are a first day redditor. Then you wouldn't know what a r/conspiritard  sockpuppet account is now would you? It's funny you have only been on reddit one day and you already know your way around. Found this on r/conspiritard.

       Woo, you're good! With these Nolibs skills you must be the newest sockpuppet of a moderator? If so would you please remove my ban from r/conspiratard? I promise I will be a good little boy! I swear to tow the government line, sing the songs of Rachel Corrie's murder, and  shill shill shill.  Pretty please?

       They were so fucking smart to dupe the public into accepting Mitt Romney as the Republican nominee and let Ron Paul fall out of the race largely unnoticed and uncontested. The mainstream media would not even utter the name Ron Paul, even while he was winning caucuses and polls. Most people only watch 1 news channel for all their news, and if you only watch FOX NEWS or CNN and rely on that for all the truths in the world of news, you are going to get duped and lied to on numerous accounts.

       Probably the same logical reason why they hired actors to play the parents of the dead kids rather than use the real parent's authentic responses.

       They did a real good job. Convinced me, for sure, at first. Hell, I'm still not 100% convinced the official story isn't true. Lanza's the exact type of person you'd assume would do something like this (if not the government). A crazy dude with Asperger's on psychotropic drugs.

       What always bugged me in every news report was that people that knew his mother said she mentioned frequently that she was scared of him and that he could turn violent at any moment. She then proceed to arm him with a high power rifle and train him to use it efficiently. That's like having a child who loves to play with matches, fearing that he might burn the house down, and then buying a flamethrower and teaching him how to use it. Why? It makes no sense.

       She was probably just looking for ways to bond with him. Either she was dumb and didn't see the obvious problem she was making or she was pretty bright and realized that even an untrained person can kill with a gun in close quarters.

       My cousin has autism, he is pretty high functioning similar to what I've heard this Lanza kid was. It would definitely paralyze him with fear, with the exception of possibly slapping his head in distress. All I'm saying is it may be something to look into. I have no idea if all of them exhibit this reaction. I do know its like turning up the gain on all ones senses. I will learn more. 
Edit: seems some have the opposite effect, although those with low sensory effects may not be high functioning. Wiki;  They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli;[

       Can I get a definitive look at Sandy Hook somewhere? All's I've seen is weak circumstantial evidence and hilariously stupid hoax actor stuff that's probably put out by feds. The only actor stuff that's worth looking into so far is that guy who was laughing and then got real serious as soon as he was about to go on air.

       Best one I've seen so far - it caught some good stuff - like how the guy that was arrested running in the woods was placed in the FRONT seat of the cop car, and how the car that the shooter drove in was moved at the crime scene - that it was tampered with, clearly. And that the news reporters clearly try to slip passed an agenda, their forced accepting of their narrative - like at 6:10-ish where the reporter says that the nurse said that Lanza's mother was "the best teacher ever", though she never worked there....And it even has something I didn't see the other day as this is an updated version - those kids "determining the types of gunshots" - hahahaha, that's the biggest load of horse shit I've ever seen.

       What about the Zionism and Jew loving? How does that mesh up with Nazi control of America? Or is it the Babylonian rituals at bohemian grove? Or the discarding of religion for an anti Christ? Or what about the devil worshiping? I'm not trying to attack you but I'm using your post to show that so much of this is unbelievable rambling trying to scare people using which ever group the person choses to hate. For the sake of credibility conspiracy theorists need to pick one scapegoat.

       It's fact that America brought on Nazi scientists after WWII, first of all. Look up Operation Paperclip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I don't understand the need for a group to blame. Consider the bigger picture. Bi-polar domination of the globe couldn't last forever, someone had to win. America was the public victor. But that wouldn't automatically and unilaterally eliminate power structures wanting dominion over man from elsewhere in the globe overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I think it'd be a fair argument say that America has become the apparatus from which the control schemes of various groups work their plans. After all, America is the military from which all non-aligned states are crushed, and all participating players are rewarded. For instance, American tax revenues ARE paying to protect poppy fields in Afghanistan, yet another demonstrable fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is more complex than you want it to be. And I don't claim to know the whole truth, I don't think anyone can know that and not be directly and intimately involved. But saying things like "So who will it be?", if not an overt smear tactic only serve to help you limit your view of what's going on. Even the divisions you mention are just distractions. And I think that was your point. So in that regard we agree, but I in the broader sense and you in the limiting sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does any of that make sense to you? You can't pick one because it's not just one. All involved players are cooperating with one another AND trying to eliminate one another at the same time. There's competing spheres of influence in every corner of the globe, surely you can see that.

      <p>
       While I don't believe conspiracy theories in general, I appreciate your response. Your view is definitely one that I could understand better than most as it does not appear bigoted. As for the Nazi scientists, I don't believe they are controlling anything, they were merely scientists who could have been raging Nazis but knew secrets and information beneficial to the United States. I would not guess for a second that the ones with clear party ties were not followed every day to keep them out of Soviet hands.

       Well, that's pretty much my point. The Manhattan Project was so black that no one out side of those actively working on the project knew about it until Hiroshima/Nagasaki. Not only is that a demonstration of Nazi tech with American funding/backing, but also a demonstration of the government's true ability to keep a secret. Moreover, there are camps that state it was a double conspiracy, and that the damage to the two Japanese cities was done by hundreds of planes dropping tons of napalm, as you can see concrete buildings still standing at the epicenter of the 'atomic' blast zones even to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazi scientists aren't in control of anything, on that you are correct. There were controlled and manipulated into a position where they would be most beneficial to whatever agenda unfolds outside of the public sphere. Much like America is now being manipulated into doing the bidding of the Zionist state. It's not ZOMG JEWS in control, Most Jews are like most Christians, simply trying to go about their lives and pissed about the direction of their government and angry at the constant larceny stemming from the financial sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the overall agenda is, it benefits immensely from a global war centered on Iran. This is clear when you monitor the geopolitical chessboard with any focused level of scrutiny. For instance, an American insurrection would hinder a global war with Iran, but fleecing the American economy to arm all players is essential and so must continue. But how do you keep Americans from revolting against the power structure? Well, you must remove their weapons and watch over them like a hawk (eagle). But if Americans think you're violating their rights, they will revolt anyway. So you must make Americans think it's their idea to give up their rights. How do you do that? Well, Americans have been programmed to value life, especially young life. So you must threaten their young and tell them the only solution is to give up their rights. Have a shooting where kids are killed. Have another. Have a few more. And once you've got them in an emotional frenzy, tell them that a solution is on the way. Tell them experts believe that giving up their guns will make the hurting stop. Watch them 'be patriots' and adhere to what people they believe are smarter than their gut tell them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they don't comply, have the shootings continue until they are left with no choice but to comply with the laws imposed upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they have no guns. Then they cannot stop Martial Law if it's necessary. Then they will have no say in the direction of their government. Then they risk their lives and well being and the well being of others if they protest the global war with Iran or the re-appropriation of their food and resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how the world works, not because of Nazis or Jews or America or China. This is how the world has worked for EONS, and it's because of the Nature Of Man being influenced and gamed by the Psychopath. THAT is the true enemy, and you'll never hear that on the Corporate controlled media outlets.

       Again I'll agree with you on some points. The way I see it is that the world and our country, along with many others, are all a bunch of high school sophomores trying to be the toughest in the school when it really doesn't matter as the graduates know. This country, does not stage attacks like Sandy hook. Rather it is just the liberals using that to push their agenda because they don't understand guns. They fail to see that each attack happens because the person was sick. Maybe they are right that it was easier to kill a large amount of people with "assault" weapons but as we know that's not the issue, he could have just as easily made a fertilizer fuel oil bomb, or poisoned the lunch line. The liberals in power would not like to take over America, instead they, like the conservatives want to maintain certain rights while ignoring others. The problems come when issues like the second amendment come under attack when there is absolutely no justification. Mental health needs to be fixed.

       Takes a couple of seconds at most. Specifically in Chrome, its just a matter of highlighting the area you want to edit, right click, "Inspect Element", expanding the &lt;p&gt; tag associated with that area, typing in the edit you want, and hitting enter. Job done.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the links provided in the OP were edited this way. You can manually navigate to them yourself to see the originals. Specifically Facebook timelines should always display as "Joined Facebook December 10th, 2012" with the year showing. The guy who took the screenshot simply was being over-enthusiastic and accidently deleted the year.

       I don't know how you would edit Google Cache though, unless theres some trick being pulled with the URL.

       The Dec 10 fundraiser isn't on the site any more, but if you search for "fundraiser for the families involved in the tragic newtown", it still appears in the search results and Google's date for the document shows Dec 10. Very odd.

       I'm pretty sure the date Google shows is the date their web crawler crawled the link. If that's the case, then this isn't due to the date/time being wrong on the youcaring.com website.

       Maybe...

       It could be also the last-modified headers...

       I have a website that appears on the first page of google, it was in test phase since a month more or less. It shows no date at all at the page, and it's a standard wordpress blog. It could be also one of those tags that google crawls..
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways this is pretty interesting stuff.... IMO even if it really happened, the guy was some sort of CIA op hypnotized type of shit. If it didn't happen, it was a scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way the clear motive here is that they want to take the guns. Watch out guys because there are gonna be more and more shootings, just wait for it. Maybe they will switch from the school shootings(or not, because it touches the emotional).
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have to remember that all they do we give our permission to it. So the media acts as an opinion former so we beg that what they intend to do happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I may have sounded arrogant on the "front page on google" thing, but I said that because you would expect that the front page websites have some more attention or updating or whatever.

       I didn't say it was when google last crawled the page, I (and the Google employee in the page I linked) said it was when it first crawled the page. And yes I saw that cache date too, but it doesn't answer the question.

       You didn't say "first crawled", by the way.

       , as part of Snopes debunking this, they've also put up a page on the Sandy Hook shootings that comes up in Google with a date of Dec 11th, 2012. You'll see many more results in that search that come from earlier dates, so either there were many sites that reported on Sandy Hook months before it occurred, or the dates Google gives are not accurate.

       Your right, but I meant first crawled, since that google date is the "publish" date, which subsequent crawls wouldn't affect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are various dates on the site and elsewhere. None of those points address the question: how does google derive the "publish" date on it's results?

       You are correct, the date displayed appears to be pulled from the the page itself, it's not when Google last crawled the page. This is so easy to prove, though I've been ignored every time I've pointed this out on

       I still don't follow. So if it came from the page itself, instead of Google, that doesn't really change the mystery at all. Why is the page itself giving a date prior to the 14th? Can you please elaborate a bit?

       Bah this is a trick a group of no more than 3 people using proxies could do in an hour or so. My friends and I used to spam various threads with gay porn and pictures of Sarah Palin. Then knock entire threads off the front page by generating a shit ton of traffic on empty threads.

       Why would the government tip off charities and get them "in on it" when their normal response would be the same? Seems like a needless risk to me and a huge potential leak source making it just not worth it strategically. This thought causes me to think it's just a result from the Google page cache methodology.

       government and NGO's are both smokescreens for corporate rule. Just look at the 12-12-12 benefit concert, sponsored by Chase. In that case, the funds were aggregated under the Robin Hood foundation (look up the board of directors) who use the guise of charity as a kind of financial shell game

       I'm big into primary research so I checked out the charity with the help of
       <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;amp;orgid=4402">
        this overview page
       </a>
       . The charity actually seems to be extremely transparent and garners high ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there I dug deeper into the original financial documents when I discovered you can access their
       <a href="http://www.robinhood.org/sites/default/files/2011%20RHF%20FS.pdf">
        <em>
         audited
        </em>
        financials for 2011
       </a>
       (with 2012 to come as soon as they're finished). In that document you can find that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Robin Hood’s Board of Directors, through their personal contributions, fund the 
unsponsored costs of events, all staff salaries and benefits, and all other non-personnel operating expenses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because Robin Hood’s Board of Directors pays all overhead costs, 100% of all unrestricted donations from the public go directly to organizations helping New Yorkers in need.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So while there are a number of big, big CEO guys and their likes on the board of directors, this seems far from a financial play. I imagine the most uncouth thing they do is use it for charity tax write-offs.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that in mind, I started digging through their investments in other funds (page 13).
      </p>
      <p>
       Their largest investment ($7 million) is in the Brevan Howard Multi-Strategy Fund Ltd which is a massive hedge fund of over $2.3 billion (and part of the $27 billion Master Fund) but does not seem to have any direct connections to any board members. Elliott International Ltd is another hedge fund that I could not connect. The investment in the The Children’s Investment Fund lost money (which is appropriate). King Street Capital Ltd. is another giant hedge. My vetting became much less rigorous after this as it's a lot of information to dig through.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one interesting investment was Viking Global Equities III Ltd. (held by Morgan Stanley Fund Services) which turned $674K into $4.2 million (provided I'm reading this right) though that seems to just be a $674K increase in the amount of funds they have previously invested. Apologies to those more financially savvy than myself who see errors in my interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, the amount of money they are investing in these multi-billion dollar hedge funds (no more than $10 million into any of them) is nothing more than a drop in the financial budget and far less than the grants and direct donations the organization gives.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Looked into the Robin Hood Foundation and didn't find anything out of the ordinary.

       Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but I've been seeing a lot of Sandy Hook conspiracy posts, and what I've gathered is there's a lot of information supporting the theory that this wasn't just a freak accident. I've seen "actors" who are supposed to be the parents of the deceased, relief pages posted early, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What am I supposed to make of it? I'm reading the information but it's getting jumbled in my head. What does it mean? Were all of those children ACTUALLY murdered? If so, where were the real parents and where did the kids come from? Was it all staged? Where does the use of actors come into play and why?
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY? Why would this be a conspiracy?, is my question. Don't take this as me trying to question that it IS one, I've seen plenty of info that says the shooting (and the Colorado one as well) were "inside jobs" I guess it would be called, can anyone explain WHY that would be?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know they're trying to instill fear, but for what purpose? I've seen stuff about FEMA camps, etc. The only thing I'VE gathered would be that these shootings were placed to alter the public mindset surrounding gun safety, but the public is SCREAMING "BAN AUTOMATIC WEAPONS". I feel like that would be the opposite of what they want from us. Is it to put armed officers around the country? Is it just to scare us?
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR IF this is a conspiracy and it was some sort of inside job, WHY?

       Becuase the federal government wants an excuse to take away our 2nd ammendment rights (eventually, and cleverly) in order to create a police state. '
      </p>
      <p>
       The undeniable proof that it was staged for me is threefold: 1) the 2 other shooters fleeing the scene, of which there is footage. One of them ended up  in the "front seat of a nearby police car" 2) the lack of photographs of the scene (compare to other mass shootings) or footage of inside the school, as the principal had recently install security cameras throughout 3) how Adam Lanza was pronounced dead the day before the event, no one knows who he is, and his parents have never given a statement. He also "fell off the map" in 2009. too convenient.

       Compare all of these details to columbine and virginia tech. it's pretty scary.

       The only agenda i can see would be to allow the goverment to swiftly pass laws and bills on a wave of public hype instead of allowing due process. Isn't it bizarre that the media is pushing legislation when there haven't even been any autoposies or ballistic analyses released?

       Most people would say to inact gun control, because that is what the national debate became immediately after. However, all the "evidence" is either that the news story wasn't 100% correct within the first few hours(Duh, lots of news organizations were reporting on whatever info they could get their hands on). Or they just point to someone and say if I were in that position I would have at least 2x the tear frequency and 1.5 voice trembling, obvious actor. There is no proof, people can piece together conspiracy theories from anything, but there is nothing substantial in this one.

       I don't personally think there's much to the theory that its fake, but I'm more or less curious as to what people who truly do believe it's a conspiracy think is the reason for said conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe this is a conspiracy, for what reason do you think it happened. Most would say gun control but Obama just did 20 something executive orders, couldn't he have done that without slaying children? I'd like to see where the minds of the people who truly believe this are at.

       because look where they are being discussed on reddit. the people associated with that lunatic who yells through a microphone. they account for the few that will question and the many that will follow blindly whatever they say. then the many call the few lunatics and everyone goes back plodding away at their debt and mortgage. the important things.

       A cliche that is almost always false.

       "They laughed at the Wright Brothers!"  Yeah, well, they also laughed at the (Groucho) Marx Brothers.  Being ridiculed or opposed does not have any bearing whatsoever on whether what you are saying is factually true.

       Statistician?  No, it's called elementary logic.  I'm speaking about the use of the "appeal to ridicule" fallacy, the illogical conclusion that any ridiculed or opposed theory is correct, by virtue of it being ridiculed.

       <strong>
        even if sandy hook shootings were done by our government
       </strong>
       , do you really think some barely known fundraising website had exclusive access to such information??? Why would they even bother setting up a page for that? To make money? How much money could you possibly make from that? The risk is extremely high and rewards are very low.
This is simply an error with Google. I run a popular website and use Google's services all the time. Their inner software does make mistakes.

       1) Make a random facebook account / page.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Wait till someone dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Change your account's name to 'RIP person who died'
      </p>
      <p>

       Here's one thing that doesn't make sense... by posting to a thread on 4chan, you're essentially "bumping" the thread. Not posting on a thread makes it 404 and die. It would seem, if they were trying to expire the thread, they were doing it the wrong way. Thoughts?

       There are definitely more and more unanswered questions about the Sandy Hook event. This post has some great stuff. But in an effort to keep people on the right track, here's my two cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand how google works, but as someone pointed out, this link shows that the fact a page is being showed about Sandy Hook days before the event doesn't mean anything.
      </p>

       Regarding the 4chan thread, I've been around that site for years. Everything in my gut says that the forum slide wasn't the result of any shills, but just of some sick fucks who trolled us, and trolled us well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, everything about this event stinks like 9/11.

       The supposed Facebook page created before the shooting doesn't seem to be real. The URL just redirects back to the Facebook home page and the actual page titled "RIP Victoria Soto" was created on December 15 as you can see:

       Days since you have been directly called a shill probably 0 as well. I see you constantly, and have one question. Why do you give some much effort to your life mission if that's what it is? Did a conspiracy theorist kill your parents in a dark alley after seeing the cinema? Now you troll the Internet in a cape to discredit and disinform? What is your motivation to constantly do this?

       If you looked through my comment history you would find that the majority of my comments spanning over a year are in subreddits I mod, askreddit, SRD and some defaults. You'd also find that I'm a libertarian who supports loosened gun legislation and owns 11 firearms. I doubt even the government has the foresight to grow an account like this in preparation for some sort of propaganda tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in all honesty, if someone approached me and asked me to do this shit for a paycheck, I'd totally take them up on it.

       However much I dislike the fact that they do that, that's their decision. Lots of them know that I'm a libertarian and that doesn't affect their attitude towards me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I have with some of them "trolling" libertarians is that they have the viewpoint that all libertarians are insane doomsday conspiracy theorists. That stereotype is propagated by some high profile libertarians such as Alex Jones as well as certain online forums in which many of the conspiracy theorist members are libertarians. There certainly is a correlation between being a conspiracy theorist and being a libertarian, but the entire political ideology should not be attacked because of it.

       So you are just getting close to them so you can expose what it really is? Or you are unaware of their real motivation? maybe just one that prides himself on facts, but Rolls with the the same guys that put out an all out assault to derail your most recent presidential hopeful? That's like getting slapped on the ass while standing on the opponents sideline. Not to mention catching a sweet pass or two. You are intriguing... I must say.

       So it was posted on the internet then edited, it should still exist in cache. Find it and prove that it existed, because saying that you saw it (which I doubt) is about as much proof as me saying that I can stick my thumb up my ass on Wednesday's and fly.

       There are a shit ton of these. You are telling me it was a vast conspiracy by conspiracy theorists? Well I have to say I have been out matched. The possibilities some of you come up with are more loony than all these so called loonies. All we need to do is figure out who's theories are more loony then? I'm just here to troll trolls. Excuse me, I need to get back to it.

       We really need to get these facts out to the mass population. We need to create a viral video that explains the evidence in a way that will make them NOT associate what they are seeing with "those nutty conspiracy theorists", which is what is currently happening. Not saying that we're nutty, that's just what everyone assumes we are.

       i can honestly say that i'm not sure how to feel about the shooting, but what i can say is that this is some compelling stuff that is worth considering.  It is not fact.  It is only speculation, but speculation can lead to fact, and in that regard this stuff is worth its weight in gold.

       If you think that TPTB are coordinating their tactics in public on the actual thread they are "sliding," you really need to rethink this whole thing. The Soto Facebook page could have easily been renamed from a previously created page, and in fact someone on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       already proved this was the case.

       Is it possible the Victoria Soto facebook page was just renamed?  Some clown created a fake memorial page on Dec 10th and then decided to name it after Victoria Soto after the shooting?

       This is just sad. You guys will take a tragic school shooting and twist it into a plot about the government trying to come after you. It's sad and disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent 20 minutes looking at this stuff and I was disappointed by the lack of common sense around here. Here's just what I noticed with a quick look.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Seriously, a bunch of screenshots spliced together from some image board with someones comment cut out. What does that show? Nothing
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fishiness? It's just someone making a video confused over how google tracks dates on their search engine.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Actor? Looked like someone who was very nervous.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Outtakes and bloopers? Sure, a blooper most likely. The lady says she got a call from an automated system, she then says she got a text from CBS. Most likely she got a text from
         <strong>
          ENS (CT Alert ENS - Emergency Notification System)
         </strong>
         but she was being interviewed by CBS so a simple brainfart = illuminati?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Medical examiner what? I don't see any signs of joking or laughing or anything you're wanting to see.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Facebook page. I can create a facebook page right now and wait for a tragedy and then change the page to be a memorial to it. Woopty.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         URL's with a date showing before, that's just google fucking shit up. Someone probably had a blog that had the wrong date written down and it picked it up.  Ya, it was probably the youcaring blogpost with the wrong date. That date/time format isn't part of the youcaring structure, whoever wrote that blog post manually entered a date and time. I don't think this was intentional since the images and links to CNN are all date appropriate.

       If you go to any of the other blogs on that site you'll notice a big difference. No date timestamps. Whoever made that blog did it oldschool editing HTML, mistakes were made obviously.

      <p>
       Edit: Actually it's more likely he copy/pasted the format from one of his other blogs or another site.

       I also would want to know why NO OPEN CASKETS. Not one. Nancy Lanza was buried at undisclosed location, then they said cremated. If no children died, - scary and shocking and disgusting as anything. However, IF CHILDREN DID DIE this is the worst tragedy and is utterly horrific because I see no evidence to show that it was NOT planned/orchestrated. I am so.... scared and shocked and uncomfortable. The lies haunt me...

       Insane production and absolute﻿ 100% conjecture-free proof﻿ that Christopher Manfredonia (the man in the woods) was﻿ Adam Lanza's next door neighbor!!!:

       No conjecture, this is real. This is a break in the whole understanding of the event, and everyone has to save as much evidence as possible before it gets swept up further. They already withdrew Rodia's registry and are saying it's bunk, but﻿ this is solid fact, see for yourself.

       Yes, you can create a page today and next week change it to be a tribute to some recent tragedy. You'll have your very own conspiracy as people point to your facebook as proof of your foreknowledge.

       More power to you man. I used to believe in all this conspiracy stuff. I stopped after people started believing the world was controlled by fucking lizard men. They look at this tragedy and say "Hmm I bet the government did it!" and then fill in that predisposed mindset with whatever shit they can for it to be true in their minds. They look for patterns that aren't there. They'll take the alternative argument but not the one from legitimate news sources or experts because they're supposedly ALL paid by the fucking CIA or some shit to lie to us, which is unbelievably insane. When something disagrees with their "logic" they label it as misinformation while they all get duped into buying end of the world shit and purified fluoride-free water from greedy Alex Jones who feeds them dates of shit is supposed to happen but never does. They're all paranoid and like the feeling of being in the club of "people who know things that you don't because ur sheeple."

       What's your beef with fry cooks? Ever work an all day shift on Sunday at bob Evans? That takes skill and talent to run 30+ tickets and keep KP on their toes so you don't have customers whining about no more roasted chicken. The way you generalize conspiracy theorists is the same way whites generalized blacks back in the 40's, Its rude and shows how ignorant you truly are.

       All you do is attack people. It seems  you're also familiar with the neighborhood skinhead but do not readily post in r/conspiratard. That's rather odd. Hmm 19 years old, it looks like you fanatically post insults to racist. I'm still looking. I'm not fully convinced this isn't a sockpuppet Hasbara account. You seem to know immediately when someone posts something that has a hint of anti semitism or anti black. It's a respectable sockpuppet account. If you aren't associated with JIDF I respect your opinions.

       Cool! I put a lot of this information together over the last week or so. Sandy Hook is definitely a hoax and now that we know how this works it's bringing into question the Giffords shooting as well (for me at least). The /pol/ board on 4chan is the best place to go on the internet to have a frank discussion about all this. Please join in and do your own research. We will not be fooled!

       I know our government can be really evil.  And I know our government can be really stupid.  But if they were being this evil, they would never be stupid enough to announce their plans to charity organizations for the purpose of fundraising.  That's just not rational.

       It appears there is a massive coverrup- there is substantial evidence of multiple shooters.  Additionally an armed off duty SWAT officer was caught at the scene with Lanza and the media will not report except the local Newtown Bee newspaper.

       Nigga plz ive yet to see anything real on the Libor thing, thats a red fucking herring if you ask me. What trial is this referring to because the libor trial (slap on the wrist for those dirty fucking banksters they should all be shot in the face publicly) was weeks before even aurora.

       I dunno what happened at sandy hook, they will however use it for their agenda. Columbine, Tucson and other shootings have a lot more weird shit going for them than this. Its probably too early.

       4chan is constantly being monitored by the feds. Its used as a way to bait child pornographers and identify possible domestic terrorists. They like it because it allows users to feel anonymous while leaving a huge watermark on everything they post with their IP address. Since most people who use 4chan have no idea how proxies work, they can easily be traced if they post anything incriminating. It actually leads back to a few years after 4chan was created when the Feds threatened to shut the site down for CP if Poole didn't cooperate with them. They basically have a watchful eye on /b/ all the time now and act as shitty mods to deal with CP. So if someone noticed a conspiracy thread in 4chan they could post a few short statements and have a bunch of other people from their network shut down whatever they needed to shut down.

       This also denies the distinct possibility that TPTB are trying to force a civil war, which would benefit them for thousands of reasons.

       Best way to start a civil war is to convince a healthy portion of your population that you are a lying sack of shit bent on world domination.

       Edit: Also the part about protecting the poppy fields is wrongish. I don't entirely know your intent with the statement though. I cannot say more than that because of my security clearance.

       While I don't believe conspiracy theories in general, I appreciate your response. Your view is definitely one that I could understand better than most as it does not appear bigoted. As for the Nazi scientists, I don't believe they are controlling anything, they were merely scientists who could have been raging Nazis but knew secrets and information beneficial to the United States. I would not guess for a second that the ones with clear party ties were not followed every day to keep them out of Soviet hands.

       I didn't know it was 20 minutes. But I seriously doubt that whoever is organizing a giant conspiracy like 9/11 would have all of the media networks in on it. It's just too many loose ends to give the info too. Okay you work in TV News has anyone ever told you, "hey we're doing this big false flag thing so please read this script but make sure you say it at the right time". I just don't buy them telling the BBC about 9/11 over the possibility that the wrong footage ran.

       , as part of Snopes debunking this, they've also put up a page on the Sandy Hook shootings that comes up in Google with a date of Dec 11th, 2012. You'll see many more results in that search that come from earlier dates, so either there were many sites that reported on Sandy Hook months before it occurred, or the dates Google gives are not accurate.

       Takes a couple of seconds at most. Specifically in Chrome, its just a matter of highlighting the area you want to edit, right click, "Inspect Element", expanding the &lt;p&gt; tag associated with that area, typing in the edit you want, and hitting enter. Job done.

       All the links provided in the OP were edited this way. You can manually navigate to them yourself to see the originals. Specifically Facebook timelines should always display as "Joined Facebook December 10th, 2012" with the year showing. The guy who took the screenshot simply was being over-enthusiastic and accidently deleted the year.

       I don't know how you would edit Google Cache though, unless theres some trick being pulled with the URL.

       No shit, Sherlock. But why would a group who's behind such an event unnecessarily draw suspicion for a bit of money by putting up a fundraiser page days before the event?

       There is a tweet by megneverland on April 28th saying that Fox News was reporting OBL's death. OBL was not killed until May 2. There is no known way to backdate a tweet, so this tweet was made on April 28. We know that much for sure.
