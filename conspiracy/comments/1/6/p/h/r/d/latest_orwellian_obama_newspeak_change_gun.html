    <div class="md"><p>Well it seems more in line with what the new gun laws are going to be about. Not about controlling guns, merely making gun ownership safe for both the owner and the people around him.</p>

<p>Here is the immediate action being taken by Obama</p>

<ol>
<li>Issue a Presidential Memorandum to require federal agencies to make relevant data available to the federal background check system.</li>
<li>Address unnecessary legal barriers, particularly relating to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, that may prevent states from making information available to the background check system.</li>
<li>Improve incentives for states to share information with the background check system.</li>
<li>Direct the Attorney General to review categories of individuals prohibited from having a gun to make sure dangerous people are not slipping through the cracks.</li>
<li>Propose rulemaking to give law enforcement the ability to run a full background check on an individual before returning a seized gun.</li>
<li>Publish a letter from ATF to federally licensed gun dealers providing guidance on how to run background checks for private sellers.</li>
<li>Launch a national safe and responsible gun ownership campaign.</li>
<li>Review safety standards for gun locks and gun safes (Consumer Product Safety Commission).</li>
<li>Issue a Presidential Memorandum to require federal law enforcement to trace guns recovered in criminal investigations.</li>
<li>Release a DOJ report analyzing information on lost and stolen guns and make it widely available to law enforcement.</li>
<li>Nominate an ATF director.</li>
<li>Provide law enforcement, first responders, and school officials with proper training for active shooter situations.</li>
<li>Maximize enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime.</li>
<li>Issue a Presidential Memorandum directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence.</li>
<li>Direct the Attorney General to issue a report on the availability and most effective use of new gun safety technologies and challenge the private sector to develop innovative technologies</li>
<li>Clarify that the Affordable Care Act does not prohibit doctors asking their patients about guns in their homes.</li>
<li>Release a letter to health care providers clarifying that no federal law prohibits them from reporting threats of violence to law enforcement authorities.</li>
<li>Provide incentives for schools to hire school resource officers.</li>
<li>Develop model emergency response plans for schools, houses of worship and institutions of higher education.</li>
<li>Release a letter to state health officials clarifying the scope of mental health services that Medicaid plans must cover.</li>
<li>Finalize regulations clarifying essential health benefits and parity requirements within ACA exchanges.</li>
<li>Commit to finalizing mental health parity regulations.</li>
<li>Launch a national dialogue led by Secretaries Sebelius and Duncan on mental health.</li>
</ol>

<p>The focus seemed to be on Mental health and background checks, nary a mention of removal of firearms in sight. Now some of the background check stuff seems arduous but none of it will prevent any citizen of the US from obtaining a gun they plan on using responsibly. The focus on mental care means that people who would use guns irresponsibly (And those who would give excuses to take away rights from responsible users) are heavily checked which is how it should be.</p>

<p>These actions are less about the guns and more about the people. If you really believe that guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people than we should focus that those people get help and not easy access to firearms. Now gun safety versus gun control is all semantics but to be honest it seems more about safety than it does control.</p>

<p>Edit: Because posting some facts and explanation means I&#39;m a shill right? You want to know how the people doing this are justifying it? Well I&#39;m telling you.</p>

Obama has also noted a review for mental health practices with regards to guns (the part above where a doctor can ask if you own a weapon) and has taken steps to ensuring that affordable mental health care is available regardless of income or employment.</p>

People kept crying out for mental health care reform and background checks, ways of helping the gun issue that don&#39;t involve restrictions on gun use and Obama makes some tangible headway and its still too radical apparently.

    <div class="md"><p>Does this need Drudge sirens in adjective form? Isn&#39;t this the same issue reframe we&#39;ve seen since the War Department and Ministry of War did a quick s/War/Defense?</p>

<p>The key to fighting back against this sort of thing, if that&#39;s your wont, isn&#39;t to simply point it out every time it happens. Awareness only goes so far, and what&#39;s being pointed out here is a trick that&#39;s been well-known since Orwell wrote his famous scathing satire. For most of us, that&#39;s our entire lives. Hell, many of us grew up with 1984 directly on the English curriculum- we get this context already, the fact that governments and corporations of all stripes do this is as old hat as Bob Hope golf jokes.</p>

<p>What I want to see is more depth on this beyond the one-line MSM slam. What does this mean for the future of the issue? What are the negative points? What about the positive? They exist, even for things that you might disagree strongly with- it&#39;s important to consider these when trying to understand an issue. It doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re waffling, it doesn&#39;t threaten your position, and it can fortify you with enough wisdom to get your point across more effectively.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m the only one that thinks this subreddit could benefit from an encouragement of depth and discussion, and a discouragement of downvoting based on opinion. If you vote with your gut on Reddit, you end up with hivethought. But if you vote based on the quality of the post, you end up with a lively cauldron of organized dissent- and this is what I&#39;d like to see: non-mainstream ideas explained and defended with the understanding that we all live in our own reality tunnels.</p>

Do you truly believe, in the year 2013, that civilians have the RIGHT to own and use 50-caliber machine guns, grenade launchers, Apache helicopters, tanks, ICBMs, hydrogen bombs?  Constitutional-fundamentalists are no better than strict Bible-fundamentalists.  The Constitution is a LIVING document and requires change and interpretation as times change well beyond what one small group of men could ever imagine.  Our founding fathers knew this and wrote it as such, allowing for Amendments.  Now maybe 250 years ago at the time of their writing their intention for the citizenry to match the government in fire power was possible.  Today?  Really??  </p>
