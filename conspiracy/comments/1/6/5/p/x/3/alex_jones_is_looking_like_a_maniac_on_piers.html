People accuse him of being a zionist shill and  at times like these even if he isn&#39;t he might as well be.</p>

<p>Why wasn&#39;t he told he just needs to act calm, coherent and state statistics? </p>

<p>The petition against Morgan got so much traction because Piers came across as a loud mouth cunt. Alex learnt nothing from that and is behaving even worse! </p>

<p>He&#39;s frankly too stupid and over emotional to have the platform he does. He has the potential to taint all the truthful information found on boards like this because people will associate his insanity with it. He&#39;s basically seen as the sole representative of the conspiracy world so he could single-handedly destroy everything so many people have worked for...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ventura did not do a good job in his debate. He mostly resorted to saying things like &quot;how many people are with me?&quot; and &quot;I was the governor!&quot; instead of providing pertinent accessible information. Both he and Alex are bullshit artists who capitalize on people&#39;s fears. It&#39;s like they both squandered their opportunities to reach a different demographic by acting like it was their own broadcasts. What that ultimately means is that the people who were watching the Piers Morgan program and have no real idea about what 9/11 truth or gun advocacy, etc. are all about, now have good examples in the forms of Ventura and Jones, who are both shining stars of academic, credible research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see it that way, it seemed that Morgan was attempting to manipulate the conversation by using limited and deceptive statistics and refused to move onward logically in the debate regardless of the fact that Jones had addressed the violent crime statistics.  I would have probably become agitated at that point as well realizing that there was no intention of it being a fair debate.  </p>

<p>He may have made a poor choice or two in how he presented himself, but he went all-out and got as much said as he could, just like Morgan would have.  Given the context we can&#39;t hold Jones above the tactics of the host of the show.  We have to be honest what we are discussing here, especially the personality of the two people involved.  This was actually a pretty good outcome all things considered. </p>

<p>And I admit I wasn&#39;t talking directly about you, but the general consensus that Jones is &quot;insane&quot; without any evidence supporting that, just because he behaved like Morgan, whom many defend and attempt to garner sympathy for.  When you are going into the ring with a boxer you bring gloves, when you are going into the ring against Piers Morgan you bring your loud, domineering, self-righteous voice, and if that doesn&#39;t work throw in a good heaping of pretentiousness to drive your point home. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go on Morgan&#39;s show personally.  I have more respect for Alex Jones now that he has if only because that takes some tenacity.  He held his own against Morgan, and made some points which few here seems remotely interested in actually addressing the merits of.  </p>

<p>It is almost as if a group of people all got the same email saying to go to reddit and call Alex Jones insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit of a correction, but the Stratfor connections have more to do with their downsizing and the fact that they are both based in Austin.  Having lived in Austin long enough to have known Alex when he was broadcast only in this city, I&#39;m going to have to agree with the amateur-hour assessment of his live broadcasts.  Contrast his prepared work, like documentaries or what-have-you, and I think the quality improves markedly.  I think he just sucks at having to fill hours of live content every day, and certainly has a huge problem regulating his emotions and ego.</p>

<p>Tempering that, his aversion to damn near anyone else in the &#39;conspiracy community&#39; (William Cooper most notably) is really suspect, as well as his dicey handling of anything Israel related.  In any case, he is broadcast on two of the radio stations here in Austin that I listen to, so its hard to not to tune in -- after over a decade of listening to him pretty solidly, I really don&#39;t know if I can assuredly say he is COINTELPRO or just ridiculously amateur.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just saying its not a stretch for someone to find a job in the same city as their old job.  I imagine (if they were hired before the  leak) they&#39;d be an easy hire too, he&#39;d feel like he was playing spy and getting privy to inside information - classic AJ-ego feeding.</p>

<p>As for his production team, I think that emotional ego is again coming into play.  I cant imagine he takes well to negative feedback from his subordinates, and would probably react rather angrily back to them; especially now that he could claim all the statistics about his audience, his length of broadcasting experience, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I touched on that in my first post.  There are many elements I don&#39;t like about him, but I was providing my experience of having been a semi-regular listener/watcher since he truly was amateur here in Austin.  I don&#39;t buy that he was implanted as a black-propogandist nearly 10 years before he had a substantial audience.  Certainly now I believe his program&#39;s leads and sources must have loads of mis-/dis-info given the &#39;significant&#39; audience he commands.  As for Israel, I think the key has already been explained, he doesn&#39;t want to offend his wife and only provides criticism of Zionists when they already all over the MSM.</p>

I listen to his show regularly, as I think it&#39;s a good place to hear news without the MSM slant, and he acts this way every time there is a disagreement.

<p>Its not the &quot;globalist&quot; or the &quot;new world order&quot; its Israel. But he will never say that, he will never put a face or a name to them - despite the pure obviousness of it. He will just try to steer you off into fantasy land by demonizing the police, schoolteachers, unions and whoever the hell else he feels like directing your anger at. </p>

<p>He is complete bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s your argument to why alex is some black agent, disinfo, shill? Really?</p>

<p>Ehl oh ehl.</p>

<p>If Israel is what you say they are that means they ARE the NWO. They ARE the globalists. Just because he doesn&#39;t mention them by name doesn&#39;t mean he actively avoids them. He calls them by the name that most conspiracy researchers will understand and recognize, by the names that if googled would pop up easily to get more info on, and he gets people some seriously important information in an entertaining way. If his rants and info don&#39;t convince people to look beyond what he&#39;s saying and do their own research it&#39;s not HIS fault they don&#39;t find out about the Israeli stranglehold on the planet.</p>

<p>And you have to know it&#39;s not JUST Israel. There are members of many different countries in on this shit.</p>

<p>Honestly it would probably be very dangerous for him to specifically mention Israel especially with the influence he&#39;s gathered over the past like 15 years he&#39;s been on air.</p>

<p>He may be some small percentage of bullshit... But certainly not complete bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Alex did exactly what he should&#39;ve done during the interview. He yelled a lot and got emotional sure, but that&#39;s just Alex... It&#39;s what he does... And IMO he used it well to get his point across, he didn&#39;t let that fuckhead moron Piers say a goddamn thing which is AWESOME and treated him like he should&#39;ve, like a shit reporter on a shit network who says shit things and brings up shit points to push a shit agenda. The guy is a puppet and a fool and Alex called him out on it on live TV.</p>

<p>Alex doesn&#39;t like Piers at all, and for good reason, and I honestly think the way he treated Piers was excellent. He brought up the sponsorship of pharmecutical companies and mainstream media which is spot on, they&#39;re STILL ignoring the connection between antidepressants/antianxiety/psychotropic drugs and mass shootings in the mainstream media, and not once did Piers even act like he heard Alex bring those points up. He got the statistics on violence across even when Piers tried to shift the conversation away to &quot;How many gun murders in Britan were there vs America,&quot; and I really respect that he treated the whole show as BS. Because it is BS and you know the news execs were standing in the background shaking their heads because they didn&#39;t expect him to act like that on national TV. People expect a certain decorum when they see people on tv, unless it&#39;s for some despicable reality show, and AJ just flat out didn&#39;t give a fuck about &quot;the norm&quot;.</p>

<p>The majority of the people that watch that show aren&#39;t bright to begin with and you have to understand that no matter how Alex acted Piers was going to make him look insane/wrong/extremist/conspiratorial either way, it&#39;s his freakin job to do JUST THAT. There was nothing he could&#39;ve done. Alex just took it into his own hands, pulled the &quot;fuck it&quot; card, and did his thing regardless of what people will think about him later.</p>

<p>He overreacted during a time when overreaction IS necessary. This gun thing is really serious, moreso I think than most people recognize, especially considering what&#39;s been going on with laws being passed and how our government&#39;s been acting and with the economic shit we&#39;re dealing with in this country. Every other interview I&#39;ve seen with Piers on the gun debate he did EXACTLY what Alex did to him during this interview. He gets mean, talks louder, interrupts, resorts to name calling and making fun, and just generally steers the conversation back to his narrow, pin sized, moronic (and funded) viewpoint.</p>

<p>Alex might have made a fool of himself but the man got his fucking point across and gave Piers a taste of his own medicine while he was at it. Alex already knows he&#39;s got a solid audience no matter how he acts, and he knows he&#39;s got a solid stream of haters no matter what. Really it seemed like his only intent was to get the truth out and put Piers in his place.</p>

<p>His fake accent might&#39;ve been too far, the NWO accusation was probably a bit much for most people (but honestly probably not far from the truth), but there was a lot more to focus on during this interview and I think THAT&#39;S more important than how he acted.</p>

<p>Fuck Piers Morgan and the people he works for and props to Alex Jones for doing what he did.</p>

<p>And OP this interview will only paint conspiracy theorists in a bad light to people that already don&#39;t think much of us. People who really know what&#39;s going on and do their research and that are activly &quot;awake&quot; shouldn&#39;t really give a damn how he acted. If you truly are questing for the truth and know your shit how do his actions effect your journey at all?</p>

<p>TLDR... Alex treated a shit man like shit, got his point across, got the facts out there, and did it while doing exactly what he always does. He didn&#39;t fuck up that bad, relax errbody and soak in what he said, not how he said it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought what he was saying was PURE GOLD! </p>

<p>His beginning rant with 1776 happening all over again made me crack up laughing. It was beautiful and its what we need right now. This shit is getting serious and I think people needed a wake up call and for someone to actually &quot;break the ice&quot; so to speak..</p>

<p>He spoke with emotion and he got a lot of great points across. He shut piers morgan the fuck up and calling out the New World Order... I like it. </p>

<p>Props to Alex Jones disinfo or not.</p>

<p>Edit: even if he is a shill/troll/black agent meant to lure us in...it doesn&#39;t matter at this point. He is doing more good for us right now then for the order imo. He just spat emotional fire while he pimp slapped the first born child of cnn. It&#39;s what we do from here that will seal our fates. I think we can all agree with what A.J. said...and that is the point. He was speaking the truth and no matter what will come of us...it will still be the truth and we have an obligation to continue pushing for truth whether it makes us look crazy or otherwise. </p>

<p>Guys I am sorry but it&#39;s not like fucking batman is going to ride in on his little motorcycle and save us all from tptb. Shine his fucking bat signal in the sky so everyone knows the ultimate battle is on. Every day we sit by and watch this country crumble is another day lost. It&#39;s time people started getting passionate. It&#39;s time people started rallying together. If not over the 2nd amendment then when? After? Too late then..</p>

<p>I am not talking about signing up for info whores here or becoming a regular of prison planet...but what I am saying is use what A.J. said last night and run with it. </p>

<p>Talk about the fact that after Sandy Hook the largest gun distributor in the world sold 3 years worth of magazines in 3 days. Talk about the fact that more soldiers are dying from suicide then from actual battles(huge factoid that really open&#39;s people&#39;s eye&#39;s). Talk about the fact that doctor&#39;s kill more people accidentally then gun&#39;s do purposefully. Talk about the fact that you are more likely to be killed by a cop then ever by a terrorist. Hell if you even want to...talk about the fact that most of the terror plots in this country are led by an fbi informant. </p>

<p>Talk about something. Most are too scared to voice the truth while others like A.J. go off the walls. We need a balance of people pushing the truth and we need it now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Amazingly well stated. </p>

<p>Piers reverts the attention back to something so narrow and insignificant that everything Alex said prior almost disappears if you&#39;re too caught up in the rhythm of it. It becomes less and less effective throughout argument but he keeps trying. While Alex is laying down the law, Piers is constantly spouting &quot;Alex... Alex... Alex... Let me speak Alex,&quot; treating him like a child and trying to make him look like a moronic blathering idiot. He&#39;s not trying to get a word in. He&#39;s trying to keep Alex&#39;s mouth shut as long as possible and he obviously didn&#39;t do very well and probably had no chance to in the first place. Alex shed light on a mountain of information in a very short amount of time and it was his emotion and conviction that allowed him to do so. This wasn&#39;t an argument but a mental boxing match and Alex destroyed Piers. </p>

<p>I feel like there&#39;s a lot more to be said so I&#39;m glad you had so much more than I&#39;m able to offer. </p>

<p>On a side note, this was very entertaining. The part at the end where Alex changed his accent was hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To even call this a &#39;debate&#39; is ridiculous. </p>

<p>Believe me, I&#39;m no fan of Piers Morgan, but Alex did not let him get a word in edgeways. You can&#39;t try and debate someone by <em>not letting them speak</em>. Just because he was speaking louder does not make the shit he was spewing any more valid. As soon as Piers tried to ask a question or make a point, Alex would either interrupt him or ignore the question and continue blindly with his enraged soliloquy. And why shouldn&#39;t Piers treat him like a child? He was acting like one. It was utterly cringeworthy.</p>

<p>Two more things;</p>

<p>Firstly, how was proposing a boxing match in any way going to advance the debate? It just made him look like a violent sociopath. If he came to me asking for a gun license, I certainly wouldn&#39;t give him one.</p>

<p>And finally, how can you accuse Piers of &quot;treating [him] like a child&quot; when Alex <em>spent most of the second slot mocking Piers&#39; accent??</em></p>

<p>That is a ridiculous argument. We&#39;ll never know what Piers was going to ask, because he couldn&#39;t get a word in without being interrupted by some childish moron. </p>

<p>Actually, that&#39;s not quite true. We heard the start of some of his questions. Like when he asked about what weapons were used in the recent mass shootings. And when he asked about homicide rates in the UK and US.</p>

<p>You noticed, I&#39;m sure, how Alex avoided both of these by shouting about a) great white sharks and b) boxing -- despite Piers&#39; questions being much more relevant to the &#39;debate&#39; than Mao, or what happened in 1776.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where was a boxing match proposed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really don&#39;t want to watch the clip again, but he does. He <del>says</del> shouts something along the lines of &quot;If only there was a boxing ring here... I&#39;d be in red, white and blue...&quot;</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe me, the proposal is mentioned in both <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/alex-jones-v-piers-morgan-1524485">this Mirror article</a> and <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/07/us/piers-morgan-guns-debate/index.html">this CNN one.</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m all for making fun of politicians. Have I Got News For You is a great example of how that should be done.</p>

<p>But this is just stupid. Yeah, &quot;Nothing much&quot;, other than:</p>

<p>a) He could have actually had the debate he was supposed to be having.</p>

<p>b) He could have left. That would have been nice.</p>

<p>But instead, he decided to mock Piers&#39; (perfectly normal) accent, being &quot;hilarious&quot;[ly racist]. Seriously, that&#39;s possibly the most childish thing I&#39;ve ever seen a grown man do on television.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he&#39;d remained calm I don&#39;t think he wouldn&#39;t have had the chance to speak. If you&#39;ve watched any other gun debate interviews with Piers you&#39;d know that he acts NO different than Alex did. Maybe a little calmer, more presentable, but he pulls the same tactics.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t like letting people who ACTUALLY know the facts say anything. He shuts them up as much as possible, brings up the same asinine points over and over, and honestly deserved the way Alex treated him.</p>

<p>And those suicide pills are no joke... That shit is real. Alex was absolutely right in bringing them up the way he did. Suicide is the reason for an absurdly high amount of deaths in this country (especially among US troops) and on top of that a lot of those who went through with the suicide were ON those pills at the time.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the fact that nearly 100% of mass gun murders are carried out by people on or withdrawing from these drugs. They seriously fuck you up. If you know anything about the human brain and how these drugs work you&#39;d understand that &quot;suicide pills&quot; is a perfect term for them. Even Fox news ran a shamefully short piece on the link between SSRI&#39;s and mass shootings...</p>

<p>Fuck civility and manners. This isn&#39;t a debate that requires civility and manners. Do you ever listen to the conversations of people who get all of their information from the TV? Because I do, and I&#39;m not going to lie it&#39;s terrifying listening to them talk about these &quot;hot button issues.&quot; They literally say EXACTLY what the news says, they parrot it word for word and have no REAL stance on the debate outside of what they&#39;ve been told to have and when you question that worldview people get angry, they get mean, and mentally they shut down.</p>

<p>More people need to act this way when talking about this issue to people who don&#39;t understand the seriousness of it because the message doesn&#39;t get across anyway so maybe the sincerity in anger and emotion will get SOMETHING across.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Could you tell me about how these drugs work and why they should be called &quot;suicide pills?&quot; Are there any studies on Pubmed that you could link me to? According to the latest CDC data, suicide was responsible for approximately 1.5% of deaths last year, which does not seem to be an &quot;absurdly high amount of deaths.&quot; You can see the data <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_06.pdf">here</a> in Table B.</p>

<p>A big thing in logic and reasoning is that correlation is not causation. So simply because many of the individuals that perpetrate mass shootings are on antipsychotics or antidepressants does not mean that the drugs caused them to kill other people or themselves. A valid hypothesis would be that people that would have a natural tendency to harm other people are the people that tend to be prescribed antipsychotics, and people that have depression, which is a risk factor for suicide, would tend to be prescribed antidepressants. When they stop taking those medications or maybe in spite of taking them, they still have those tendencies. In this case, it&#39;s not the drug causing the action, it&#39;s the predisposition for which the drug was prescribed.</p>

<p>Suicide in US troops is very sad, but blaming it on antidepressants is overly simplistic. Troops that have seen combat, have seen their friends die, who come home with PTSD and in many cases injuries, and then can&#39;t get jobs when they come home are obviously at greater risk than the general public for depression and therefore suicide. Just because a person is on an antidepressant does not mean that they are not depressed or not at risk for suicide. Likewise, just because a person commits suicide while on an antidepressant does not mean that the antidepressant caused the suicide.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJoCfgAEuE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJoCfgAEuE</a></p>

<p>First link is just a short vid linking the murders to the pills, there&#39;s a bunch of them on youtube I thought I saved more links than I did but unfortunately that&#39;s the only vid I had, I suggest looking around yourself to find more vids talking about it it&#39;s very interesting. The second link is a study done on the rise of mental illness since the 50&#39;s (which is basically when the first antidepressant drugs came about). It doesn&#39;t have much to do with the link to violence, but focuses very heavily on the long term effects of taking psychotropic medications, how they work, short term effects, other studies done... Lot&#39;s of really interesting shit. Third link is from natural news, a lot of people on this subreddit don&#39;t trust them as they put out some fishy articles but it&#39;s just a simple infographic with decent info. Fourth link is a TED talk on how data gets misrepresented involving different drugs, also crazy interesting... Fifth link is called &quot;The Dumbing Down of America&quot; it&#39;s semi related but crazy interesting as well.</p>

<p>I understand that correlation does not mean causation, but the coincidences surrounding mass shootings, suicides, and psychotropic meds is very bizarre, and many people, myself included, notice a heavy negative change in people that start taking these medications. They may FEEL better for a little bit, but the effects wear off and when they do it&#39;s almost always bad. These drugs are the medicinal equivalent of rubbing deodorant on an armpit that already smells... It covers up the problem for a bit but in time you start to stink again, and usually it doesn&#39;t take all that long.</p>

<p>First off you have to understand that depression has NEVER been proven to be a chemical imbalance in the brain, it&#39;s a theory and it&#39;s the same theory they&#39;ve had since the mid to late 50&#39;s. True there are some people who have low serotonin levels during depression, but there also people with normal to very high levels of it that are depressed as well. And on the contrast some people with exceptionally low levels of serotonin are perfectly happy... The truth is there&#39;s no real way, no reliable technology, to test seretonin levels IN THE BRAIN, in the blood sure, they do a blood test and can see how much of it seeped into the blood stream... The problem with this is that serotonin gets digested quickly so by the time it reaches the blood who knows how much of it has been used up in the brain and up to that point.</p>

<p>Over long periods of time people on these drugs have had their brain chemistry/wiring almost permanently altered, the parts of the brain that are usually used to secrete and reuptake the supply of serotonin  (and whatever other parts of the brain these drugs alter)begin to atrophy over a period of non or misuse and that&#39;s where I think the problems really come from. These drugs have been known to be dangerous for a very long time now, and the only reason they&#39;re still sold is to turn a profit.</p>

<p>A very close friend of mine has been depressed for a while now and her therapist has put her on at least 5 different antidepressant meds since she&#39;s been going because they work for a little bit, then they stop and she gets depressed again, and they go, &quot;Oh... Well... Let&#39;s try this one instead&quot;. Do you know pharmecutical giants PAY extra to those that offer these drugs up to their patients? It&#39;s really a sick game they play. You&#39;re told it&#39;s a chemical imbalance in the brain which immediately tells most people that it&#39;s nothing THEY can personally control, which is the exact opposite of the truth. It puts you at the complete mercy of your depression/anxiety/whatever... and then they give you drugs to &quot;correct&quot; your imbalance or imperfection.</p>

<p>Since I&#39;ve turned my friend on to this shit she&#39;s stopped taking them and while she&#39;s still depressed she&#39;s doing much much better.</p>

<p>Have you ever paid attention during commercials for drugs like prozac? Do you listen to the warnings and symptoms? Shit, suicide is a MAIN symptom of antidepressant medications, especially when people decide to go off of them, because past a certain point you become addicted, the body, or moreso the brain, ends up needing the drug (which, ding, is the idea...) and if it doesn&#39;t get it bad things happen.</p>

<p>They warp your perception of reality as well, hell that&#39;s what they&#39;re supposed to do, right? Look up how these mass shooters felt after they went on rampages. Many of them say they felt like the were in a movie, or videogame. A lot of them felt like they weren&#39;t there at all, or weren&#39;t in their own bodies when it was happening. It&#39;s fucking weird. And creepy as hell, too.</p>

<p>SSRI&#39;s are not the way to go. And mass shootings have increased dramatically SINCE the advent of these drugs, it was quite rare from what I&#39;ve read to have seen anything like this happen before these things hit the market. If anyone has more info on this or would like to correct me go ahead I honestly haven&#39;t read too much into mass shootings before the advent of psychotropic meds I&#39;ve only heard about in a few places...</p>

<p>Anyway, with the troops, I understand that they&#39;re more prone to suicide than almost anyone else due to what they&#39;ve seen and what they had been made to do, but their problems are covered up the same way everyone elses are... They just throw broken medication at them. And do you know how the army wants to solve this suicide issue among troops? They want to take their weapons -_-</p>

<p>Nothing about the drugs.</p>

<p>To further cement the fact that we know these drugs are only still around to turn a profit, there have been quite a few studies done recently on how MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, etc. help those with depression and PTSD and they&#39;re EXTREMELY helpful, yet still illegal, and likely will be so long as big pharma exists.</p>

<p>If I come across any more links I&#39;ll send em your way, otherwise you&#39;ve got quite a bit up there to read and watch. Have fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t really know how Alex Jones was before, I&#39;d heard the name and knew he was somehow political but that&#39;s about it.  I wouldn&#39;t have recognized a picture of him or anything.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not particularly fond of Piers Morgan, not signing any petitions to deport him, but he seems like kind of a tool.  Really, if anything I am predisposed to agreeing with Alex Jones if I entered into the episode with any bias at all.</p>

<p>He absolutely made himself look batshit crazy. I woulda given the guy the benefit of the doubt, but....come on.  The British accent at the end literally made me cringe in embarrassment. </p>

<p>If I were a guy like him, who sincerely (or not, I guess) believes that he has the real truth and everyone else is lying, I would view that interview as a huge opportunity, and he blew it.  People who aren&#39;t familiar with the guy and his views certainly are not going to be more inclined to agree with him now. I mean, people don&#39;t see a screaming poorly behaved man who is yelling &quot;SUICIDE PILLS&quot; in a fake British accent and say, &quot;I want to hear more of what that guy thinks.&quot;</p>

<p>To the casual and uninitiated, he made himself look like a crackpot, Which is kind of damning when you&#39;re trying to convince people that something very difficult to believe is true.  The last thing you want to do is give them the &quot;mental out&quot; of saying, &quot;Well, the person I heard it from was crazy so can&#39;t be true.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex is always getting emotional and yelling and saying bizarre shit, it&#39;s his schtick, he&#39;s even gotten teary eyed on his show a few times talking about how braindead most people are.</p>

<p>Idk a lot of people call him a shill, a disinfo agent, bunch of shit like that but personally I think the guy is genuine, he fucks up, makes mistakes, plays the fear card a little too often, but for the most part he seems like he&#39;s honestly just trying to shake people from their hibernation.</p>

<p>And true... I guess you have a point in saying the uninitaited won&#39;t take as much from this as they should, but then again I&#39;d be willing to guess most people that actively watch that show, only watch it to see Piers do his annoying thing. He&#39;s a big aggravating personality and people suck that shit up. They&#39;re not caring so much about the gun debate as being entertained.</p>

<p>Like I said I think he coudl&#39;ve toned himself down a bit at some parts, but for the most part the anger and emotion was necessary when dealing with a man like Piers. And nothing he SAID was really crazy, the whole suicide pills thing was very true, the NWO mention will put people off but come on... There&#39;s no doubt Piers is saying exactly what he&#39;s paid to say to sway mass opinion.</p>

<p>He threw around a few conspiracy buzzwords that people might&#39;ve heard before, and who knows, maybe he convinced a few people to google the New World Order or SSRI&#39;s.</p>

<p>Probably not =[</p>

<p>But I CAN HOPE DAMNIT!</p>

<p>And I thought the British Accent was hilarious. Too far perhaps... But hilarious nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres the deal guys, Alex isn&#39;t well composed, he isn&#39;t a well spoken debater,  and i don&#39;t even care if he&#39;s a shill, he&#39;s exactly what we need right now, a loud, rude, obnoxious gorilla with his middle finger in the air on cnn. Either way love him or hate him, he&#39;s drawing attention to areas of concern. He&#39;s discrediting our cause? Are you fucking kidding me? Our cause is the goddamn truth, we don&#39;t have to worry about it being discredited. It will shine through the darkness as it always does. So don&#39;t worry about Alex, the fact still rings out, despite Pierce&#39;s &quot;gun deaths&quot; bullshit, i as a human want to lower murder rate, i could give a fuck whether its with an assault rifle or a sharpened carrot, and the fact is Britain banned guns, we didn&#39;t, and their murder rate is higher per capita and ours is lower per capita. Done. Elementary statistics, come the fuck on people. Go ahead and rip me apart but i for one found it refreshing to see the immature tongue out spitting in the face of the controllers. Who gives a shit how it made Alex look. It made my night. Oh and another message that Alex delivered is also true, try and disarm the American Public, and it&#39;s gonna get ugly...

<p>If you can show me some proper statistics for violent crime rates in different countries, go ahead. But according to Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The comparison of violent crime statistics between countries is usually problematic, due to the way different countries classify crime. Valid comparisons require that similar offences between jurisdictions be compared. Often this is not possible because crime statistics aggregate equivalent offences in such different ways that make it difficult or impossible to obtain a valid comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What statistics available are you referring to?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s work out the math to see what we could expect at a 2% crime rate if all of the difference was affrays/fist fights</p>

<p>Using some algebra, 2% of 315,000,000 people in the US = 6,300,000 American violent crimes including fistfights</p>

<p>0.47%, of 315,000,000 = 1,480,500 actual American violent crimes w/o fistfights based on available stats</p>

<p>The difference between these numbers is 4,819,500
Therefore you are suggesting that there are 4.8 million fistfights in the US each year in which no one gets hurt, <strong>but the crime is reported</strong>. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s more likely that about half of these 4,819,500 additional crimes committed would be burglaries, robbings, rapes, and other horrible acts. That&#39;s what we can expect if we give up our natural-born right to self-defense.</p>

<p>I checked the rape figures (2010 was the latest I could find). UK was 28.8 per 100,000, US was 27.7 - a fairly insignificant difference (UK 1.04 times higher).</p>

<p>Robbery (2010 stats). US 133/100,000, UK 137/100,000. Again, largely insignificant (UK 1.03 times higher).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, you could expect <strong>forty</strong> times fewer gun-related deaths. And <strong>four</strong> times fewer murders.</p>

<p>And, &quot;natural-born right to self defence&quot;? Right. The problem with that is where do you draw the line between a &quot;self-defense&quot; weapon and overkill?</p>

<p>For instance, it would be ridiculous if it were legal for citizens to own nuclear bombs, or bioweapons. An arbitrary line has to be chosen, and deciding where it should be is the sort of thing that necessitates continual re-discussion. It&#39;s not the sort of thing that can be set in stone.</p>

<p>Your &#39;natural-born right&#39; stems from a 221 year old amendment to your constitution, which was penned in a time when the most powerful weapon was a musket that could fire four shots per minute. How people believe it could ever apply to modern day weapons without serious re-amendment baffles me.</p>

This seems like a good plan to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I&#39;m watching it now.</p>

<p>Fair enough, Piers&#39; numbers were slightly off. The stats they talk in this clip about are the same as the ones I referenced above. The quote </p>

<blockquote>
<p>percentage-wise, Britain has a lower gun homicide rate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>rather spectacularly fails to capture the extent of the difference. We&#39;re talking <strong>40 times</strong> lower here. Not stating this fact seems to suggest some sort of bias. I&#39;m not familiar with US news stations to know which one this is.</p>

<p>&quot;1st in gun ownership vs. 28th in gun homicide&quot; doesn&#39;t really tell us much, other than that the US is wealthy enough to buy more guns than other places, and is not a war-torn country. If the UK is 40x lower than the US, it must be pretty low on the overall list; although that&#39;s not really relevant.</p>

<p>The violent crime rates I&#39;ve already been through above. I notice that they neglect to mention the differences in how these stats were taken. An easy thing to gloss over, I&#39;m sure. For rapes, burglaries, robberies etc. I have shown above that the rates of the UK are 1.03-1.04 times higher than the US. An insignificant difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm.. I like statistics. But to reduce dead children or dead family members to a statistic is downright insulting. Statistics are just numbers -- they provide no context or perspective which, I think, as human beings living in a society are vital. I am not arguing that all guns should be taken away from everybody. But it&#39;s fair game for it to be part of the conversation and it&#39;s fair game to say, &quot;we need to take a look at how we are handing out guns again&quot;. It&#39;s reasonable. And if you are a gun owner and we can take away a gun from an unqualified or irresponsible or volatile character, then it&#39;s one less person for you to defend yourself against. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the follow up after the Alex Jones segment w/ Alan Dershowitz began with him and Piers Morgan alluding that Alex Jones would murder either of them in his home if he disagreed with him, and going on to just blatant name calling such as unhinged and an exhibit.  Granted, i really don&#39;t think Jones did much of a favor for himself by just screaming for the majority of the time he was on air.  He did bring up a couple interesting points such as Piers Morgan leaving the UK to avoid the phone hacking scandal and being fired from the Daily Bell for a fake article, but any point was lost by his demeanor.  Alex Jones&#39; fans seem to think that he put Piers Morgan in his place and i suppose got what he intended to out of the situation, but to every other person watching who has never been exposed to Alex Jones or any of the views or perspectives he brought up, the general consensus seems to be, &quot;did you see that crazy fuck on Piers Morgan last night.&quot;  The content was completely lost due to the nature it was presented in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did not know about the follow up segment. Not really surprised tbh but still its just childish.</p>

<p>You do bring up a good point though at the end about how much of the content will be lost due to how Alex acted but I wouldn&#39;t say it was completely lost... just... mostly.</p>

<p>And even then only among those types of people who would&#39;ve been fooled into missing the point anyway. Though I guess it&#39;s a shame we&#39;ll never know if him being a little calmer or more presentable would&#39;ve helped.</p>

<p>Anyone with at least one eye open will be able to see past the silliness of his actions but it&#39;s very frustrating knowing that there are so many people out there who will get sucked into the shift of focus away from what he said to how he said it. I agree with a lot of the other posters here that say that if Alex could just keep his cool (even though I still think his outbursting during the interview with Piers was awesome) he&#39;d get his message across a lot better.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should let him know that somehow? I hear he&#39;s pretty open to listening to his viewers and I know he reads the comments and such that people leave on his videos and website. He probably has more influence than anyone else among the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; and even though I personally think his mannerisms and personality are funny and entertaining, and definitely second to the info he puts out, I suppose most people are too quick to judge to find him appealing right off the bat.</p>

<p>State the facts and state them plainly and speak rationally.</p>

<p>Anytime anyone speaks as if they are preaching you need to be aware they are speaking from the emotional and therefore not rational parts of their brain.</p>

<p>Banks want your money, that&#39;s what they do. They&#39;re banks. If they can make even 0.1% more profit by doing something completely immoral, but not quite illegal, then they&#39;ll do it without blinking. </p>

<p>If they&#39;re big enough, they&#39;ll just skip the legality issue altogether because they know they won&#39;t be held accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do I know? Let&#39;s see. </p>

<p>What is the purpose of a bank? As far as I know, and please correct me if I&#39;m wrong; the purpose of a bank is to make a profit from customer deposits through investments and other financial instruments.</p>

<p>Profit is measured in units of currency, AKA money. Therefore, banks seek money.</p>

<p>Can you see a fault in that logic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you do for a living? Do you act like an institution or a person?  If some high level banker (Rothschild?) realizes that they can make an insane amount of money by sponsoring governments and buying media outlets why wouldn&#39;t they do that?  Why are we in the predicament we are in if bankers just act like traditional bankers?  How about HSBC laundering drug money?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your example you are laying all the blame on &#39;some high level banker&#39;, but ignoring the culpability of governments and media outlets.</p>

<p>The high level banker you&#39;re referring to is a mirage, you won&#39;t ever find out who he is and you won&#39;t ever have an opportunity to hold him accountable. But yet that is where your anger has been directed. I&#39;m not saying some high level banker has not done what you&#39;re claiming, I&#39;m not denying your claim. I agree that certain actions of certain banks are immoral, illegal and cause great harm. But you have no way to change that without going through your govt and media outlets first.</p>

<p>If you spent your time getting angry at your govt and your media outlets, there is a method for you to change those. There is a method for you to hold them accountable. There is no method for you to hold a bank accountable. They are privately owned, they don&#39;t answer to you. They answer to shareholders. And shareholders say &#39;make me more money&#39;.</p>

<p>So IMO, while you should be angry at banks, you shouldn&#39;t put your efforts into trying to change them directly, because that will be a wasted effort. Instead, IMO, our efforts are better served trying to change our govts and media outlets, because <em>only they</em> have the power to change banks. You can&#39;t put a roof onto a house with no walls. The walls must come before the roof.</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;d say the only possibility of changing our government is throught violent revolt.  Did you know they&#39;re trying to take our guns now? Interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political representation that is not in line with what the powers that be wants is systematically silenced. The easiest method to do this is to consistently slander any other options than the currently existing one, so if you get political and have different ideas, you are at best slandered and at worst ignored.</p>

<p>Independent regimes and entire nations that do not want to cooperate with the powers that be are overthrown, usually by first imposing sanctions to destroy its economy and the health of its people, then by provoking violence inside the nation and using proxy terrorists groups to target key opposition leaders and to make the public demand a new right-wing regime capable of making the nation secure again.</p>

<p>These are common undertakings of any country or allegiance of countries that have the means to do it and the desire to expand their wealth and control of the world. The Western allies under NATO have admitted they&#39;ve done this numerous times, for example the stay-behind secret armies in Europe after WW2 whose mission was to ensure key European countries stayed in their control, such as Gladio in Italy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you feel hopeless, is that what you&#39;re saying? You feel like you should just give up? Do you feel there is no point in trying to change something because you&#39;ve seen how that has failed in the past?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that attitude is beneficial to you. I think that attitude only benefits &#39;the powers that be&#39; as you put it.</p>

<p>Power is given. It is us who give power to governments and police. It is us who give power to fiat currency. That power can be taken away by us if enough of us choose it.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe that then you leave yourself no option but to wallow in this conspiracy mire, to flit from one scandal to the next, calling out bogeymen and becoming more and more isolated from &#39;mainstream&#39; society.</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t benefit from that, &#39;the powers that be&#39; do. There are enough people who want change but they don&#39;t know how to create it. They ally themselves with movements that are manufactured opposition or those that become co-opted opposition. And they do that because their heads are full of nonsense, even though their hearts are not.</p>

<p>NWO, Illuminati, Masons, Jesuits, etc etc - those are all useful distractions. Every hour someone spends chasing those ghosts is an hour they could have used engaging with the political process. The effect of these conspiracies is to remove dissension from the political process. Those conspiracies make it <em>easier</em> for fucked up things to go on, not harder. They make it easier for &#39;mainstream&#39; society to dismiss any genuine criticism as just some paranoid theory.</p>

<p>Nobody is doing themselves any favors by consuming conspiracy to the point that they feel hopeless or have no control.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not perfect, but he&#39;s the best we&#39;ve got. Also, his documentaries - when he&#39;s cool, calm and collected - are fantastic.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like it when he screams and rants on air, either, but that&#39;s not going to make me shut off the truth. He attacks Israel when they&#39;re in the wrong, but he doesn&#39;t <em>IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE</em> and just laser beam lock on Israel and blame them for everything.</p>

Sure he&#39;s not packaging it in a nice little bow tie, and the low baritone voice of a news caster, bu it&#39;s still the god damn truth.

    <div class="md"><p>You are right...but if you don&#39;t see Jones for the Zionist apologist that he is you have a bit more learning to do.</p>

<p>Fact is...Alex is controlled by Zionists down the line. From his &#39;real&#39; employer (STRATFOR) to the owner of his show and the man that pays the bills (ultra-Zionist Jeffrey Smulyan) he is an utter apologist for Israel and any and all misdeeds perpetrated by anyone who happens to be Jewish.</p>

<p>Its clearer than day to me...and I&#39;m Jewish! You mean to say that you goyim here cannot see this or at least research it??</p>

<p>People need waking up all right. The man is a disinfo shill, plain and simple, employed by STRATFOR to discredit the entire &#39;alternative theory&#39; movement.</p>

<p>gas compression from the building collapse</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no compression from a building collapse if the building is still standing. The windows are blown out before the building collapses in a vertical riser starting from the bottom and going up, just as I said. All the other windows are fine, just the same window on every floor is blown out in synchronicity. </p>

<p>I have worked in buildings like this my entire career, they&#39;re massive. They don&#39;t just implode straight down at free fall speed. If anything, they would lean a little or crack. It&#39;s a preposterous argument. Seriously, if you want to debate your &quot;confirmation bias&quot; pick any of the hundreds of demolition experts, architects, or engineers who have said this is a demolition without a doubt.</p>

<p>You&#39;re in denial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I rewatched the video just to be sure, and the windows blow out while the building is falling, not before.  Also, from the most recent data, there are approximately 1.6 million architects and engineers in the US (it&#39;s a little hard to find accurate statistics on how many demolition experts exist), so if hundreds say it was a demolition, let&#39;s go big and say a thousand, that equals out to .0000625% of them believing it was a demolition, and 99.9999375% believing it wasn&#39;t.  I feel like that makes the architect and engineer community pretty solidly in the &quot;not a demolition&quot; camp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never understand the &quot;free fall&quot; claims people love to throw around. You can easily figure out how long it should take for buildings to fall using Newton&#39;s kinematic equations found in any elementary physics class. I did this a while ago, but the buildings all fell a couple seconds slower than free fall. You can do the calculations yourself and time the buildings fall speed on youtube yourself. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, here is a very thorough analysis from a PhD physics professor who represents over 1000 architects and engineers: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pL0M5ST8jY?t=14m">www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pL0M5ST8jY?t=14m</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve skipped right to the relevant point for you.</p>

<p>If you want to dispute it, go after the doctors of mathematics and physics professors with PhD&#39;s in my link instead of debating it on reddit.</p>

<p>This is the man who is speaking in the video:</p>

<p>&quot;Steven Jones earned his bachelor&#39;s degree in physics, magna cum laude, from Brigham Young University in 1973, and his <strong>Ph.D. in physics</strong> from Vanderbilt University in 1978. Jones conducted his Ph.D. research at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (from 1974 to 1977), and post-doctoral research at Cornell University and the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility.&quot;</p>

Piers had the whole first half to set alex up to seem the heartless one and pull the emotion card.  Then, when alex made legit arguments, piers did play the usual FACTOID game which is annoying as fuck.</p>

<p>Also I heard alex got harassed in Austin by the TSA which I know from my own experience puts me in a horrible mood.  Couple that with his feeling piers is a propagandist piece of foreign trash (he is!) and the result is not so surprising I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last night when passing through still somewhat Soviet Transnistria after staying for some days I was met with all kinds of shit and stopped twice to pay the penalty for overstaying since because of holidays they didn&#39;t give me the normal papers.  They were telling me that I was in big trouble.  After I point I just snapped and told them to arrest me and then I just told them that I didn&#39;t have a problem and the problem is their computer and that I was going to be home and they would be stuck with their problem.  Then at the border I was in a room with six guards telling me that I would have to go back to Tiraspol for some reason if I didn&#39;t pay them.  I just told them that I wasn&#39;t going to pay them.  Sometimes you just have to mentally be prepared to go to jail or to be seriously inconvenienced.  Of course once I didn&#39;t give a fuck anymore and was ready to bring it then I was pushed along.  Sometimes we just need to man the fuck up and to refuse to pay small prices when faced with larger prices.  At the end of the day I think that they even end up respecting it more since they are dealing with so many spineless pussies.  That is the problem, once you acquiesce to an unreasonable demand then you are no longer worthy of respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all - if you are forced to take off your shoes because of a false flag bomb threat with the &quot;shoe bomber&quot; then YES you are deeply violated for having bought hook line and sinker their deception that they can prevent suicide terrorism by forcing everyone to ridiculously take off their shoes.  Like I said - SECURITY THEATER.  You were deeply violated you just aren&#39;t spiritually awake enough to deal with that yet.</p>

<p>Secondly - YES forced patdowns.  If you are aware like me, you would refuse ever going through the cancer inducing microwave ovens designed to poison and kill the population...Which will prompt a TSA goon to give you a forced pat down if you want to fly on an airplane. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I work in a social paradigm that requires me to hold a job, so I put up with this tyranny for my job and nothing else.  But I hate every moment of it and if I were on personal time would not fly at all or if I did would do so only to cause trouble to the TSA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was too much to be said. If Alex was calm and &quot;civil&quot; it would&#39;ve been too easy for Piers to divert the attention to insignificant bullshit. Alex got wobbly several times but that&#39;s just because he had so much to say and Piers was doing everything he could to keep him from saying it. Piers acted condescending for this exact reason. People seem to think the most calm and collected person in the fight must be on top of the game. Piers kept treated Alex like a child and a blathering moron and continuously tried to undermine everything Alex was saying. Alex knows exactly what he&#39;s dealing with and got in as much as he could in the miniscule amount of time he had. The people who are going to shrug him off as a &quot;crazy conspiracy theorist wacko nutjob&quot; just can&#39;t or won&#39;t read between the lines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you are saying is that freedom of speech is conditional? Isn&#39;t fighting against those with power trying to impose rules on to what society feels is it&#39;s rights a fundamental of what this sub is about? Also, those conditions that you decided upon for deciding his worth are your own. What about gay members of society? Black people? Women? People who don&#39;t like spinach? What if someone decides that they believe these groups of people should not be allowed to express the freedom of speech? You&#39;ll accuse me of being ridiculous but thats equally how I feel about you suggesting that Morgan should stay quiet because he&#39;s a public figure. He&#39;s a celebrity, he&#39;s not an American citizen but why should his freedom of speech be worth any less than yours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical rude and arrogant disregard for reason or another&#39;s opinion that I expected with your tl;dr childness.</p>

<p>Fact is, the incident I believe drew Morgan to air his view was a sickening one and as a human being trying to find blame or reason in it he said what he has. </p>

<p>What he was concerned about what the safety of innocent lives and he had a right like everyone else to say his peace.</p>

<p>If someone made a post on here in a very public forum supporting an American&#39;s right to bear arms and it was removed by some disagreeing mod then the furore it would cause would have everyone running for cover. Sickens me that people like you come here tl take about agendas only when the goal of them is not also one of your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was so transparent. Piers knew exactly what he was getting into even before Alex got on the plane this morning. This was Piers&#39; &quot;ace in the hole&quot; golden nugget he needed to really ram his point straight home. Piers knew he would go ape shit and yell because they have heard Alex&#39;s show. Piers already had tons of &quot;opposition&quot; guests lined up who were solely there to reinforce Piers&#39; opinion and bash Alex for being the fucking insane neanderthal that he is. This is a classic setup and I can&#39;t honestly believe that Alex is stupid enough to fall right into it. It doesn&#39;t matter if anything Alex said was true because that is not what people are focused on when they see his wide eyed, completely out of control ass, behave the way that he did tonight.</p>

<p>I can give Alex a little bit of credit for the few months I listened to him because he gave me tons of leads which I could use to do my own research. With that being said I didn&#39;t know if I wanted to laugh or cry when that shit was going down. Three minutes into the interview I had to pause it and walk away because I could not believe the amount of irreparable damage he was causing to the rest of us. THREE MINUTES and the whole country, not to mention the rest of the world, believe that &quot;truthers&quot;, and indeed Americans at large, side with this prick.</p>

<p>If nothing else this will give rational, albeit ill-informed, Americans ammunition with which they can use to cast &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; in an even more ridiculous way. </p>

<p>This was exactly my feeling. He has so much power now as the leading figure among conspiracy theorists that he can make us all look terrible and undermine all the valid information. He&#39;s so fucking damaging to us right now, it&#39;s not just about him anymore.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, AJ had a very limited time window to get his argument across to the limited attention span of the viewers/consumers, If there was an hour debate AJ wouldn&#39;t be forced to be so determined to get his point across, the part where piers and the lawyer try to discredit alex after is also very propaganda-ish. The thing people need to remember if alex had done this debate with a passive, co-operative attitude he would have been given discrediting facts and made to look like a crazy conspiracy theorist. AJ will have a lot of criticism from this debate, but I think he did it properly, it was his only option in this setting to get the facts across really. </p>

<p>edit:  After the interview Piers said he knew exactly what Alex Jones was like and was expecting that.  I think Alex realized they were going to try to make a mockery of him to further their agenda, and Alex doubled it up making a mockery of Piers&#39; show.  They weren&#39;t going to give him a fair say, they were going to cut him off and switch the subject whenever Jones made a legitimate point.  Now Piers looks like a Jerry Springer.  &quot;That&#39;s exactly what I expected.&quot;  Well I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what your fans can expect of your content from now on.  Go back to England.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the most hilarious things I&#39;ve seen in a long while when Alex Jones is on Piers Morgan&#39;s show screaming &quot;YOU&#39;RE A HATCHETMAN FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER&quot;; &quot;YOU&#39;RE A HATCHETMAN FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER, BUDDY&quot;. </p>

<p>He&#39;s also hilariously self-sabotaging in the sense that he <em>does</em> and spends the whole show <em>doing</em> everything he accuses the guy who is basically just sitting there going &quot;..alex, ..alex.. please.. alex.. I&#39;m not trying to set you up, this isn&#39;t a trick, can we just have a real debate?&quot; of doing ...he sits there yelling, screaming, pointing fingers, rambling off irrelevant stats and &quot;arguments&quot; any time someone might contradict a piece of his rhetoric.</p>

<p>He&#39;s comparing a mass shooting(of ..children) to the movie Jaws. HAHAHA.</p>

<p>This guy is so HILARIOUSLY evasive(Alex Jones)..he&#39;s like a child. &quot;SUICIDE PILLS! MASS MURDER PILLS!&quot;</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t laughed this hard in years it feels like, or almost half a year. Thank you Alex Jones. Holy SHIT he is a zealot. He is TERRIFYINGLY ridiculous in that <strong>Alex Jones is a true believer ..of and in.. Alex Jones</strong>. Listen to how he says  &quot;that wikipedia is 10 years old&quot;. He truly believes he is like the banner-holder for all America and all things truthiness - he&#39;s like the real life version of Steven Colbert, without the class or sarcasm.</p>

<p>This is pretty terrifying and it can all teach us a lesson in/of/about ourselves: if you believe you&#39;re being attacked somehow, if you&#39;re utterly convinced of it, if you pre-judge and assume other people&#39;s motives and actions are hostile to you or your personal ideas/ideals -- you&#39;ll typically react in exactly the way you see yourself as being attacked, only you&#39;ll think of it as you &#39;being on the defense&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Piers came out looking a lot better than Alex who for most of the time relied on screaming to get his points across. I agree with Alex on the notion that guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people, but he just came out looking like a loon for most of it. Blaming video games, suggesting a boxing match, splurting baseless nationalistic insults... I&#39;ve never liked him from the start and I respect Piers slightly more for at the very least acting like a professional. </p>

<p>You are behaving like a &quot;loudmouthed cunt&quot; (your words) by posting so much vitriol and so little substance.

<p>No, what i&#39;ve said is true it&#39;s not just vitriolic personal attacks. </p>

<p>His behaviour was incredibly embarrassing, he does make himself look bad. I don&#39;t even think he is a zionist shill as so many say but it&#39;s true that his behaviour is working to the advantage of those he rails against.</p>

<p>Again it&#39;s absoltely true he&#39;s too stupid, emotional and lacking the presence of mind to act in a way that benefits his agenda. To point this out is not being a &#39;loudmouth cunt&#39; i&#39;m identifying his issues because I agree with him and want him to represent the message better. </p>

<p>He does taint the information he presents, again this is a fact. You can judge by the reaction on twitter that he came across as a nutcase which people will associate with what he says. There are thousands of posts calling him insane or words to that effect. </p>

<p>I stand by everything I said, none of it was out of spite or ill will, I simply identified real problems he has that work against his wider goals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We agree his presentation could use some work.  No need to call names. </p>

<p>A coordinated attack against his message is not proof of anything.  </p>

<p>You can stand by your vitriolic, unsubstantive blathering if you wish.  You have not criticized one statement he made or disproved one point he made.  You have nothing other than the fact he could work on his presentation.  </p>

<p>All of your statements of supposed &quot;fact&quot; are personal beliefs from your own perspective.  For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He does taint the information he presents, again this is a [very strong personal belief].  </p>

<p>It is a fact considering the general consensus on twitter and other websites. It&#39;s not just my opinion it&#39;s based on how the general public reacted to the interview. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have not criticized one statement he made or disproved one point he made</p>

<p>As I said to you in another comment I&#39;m not attacking his message, I agree with 90% of everything he says. What I&#39;m critisising is his presentation which we appear to agree on. The elite can so effectively present bullshit as reality which the public lap up precisely because of how they present information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we can&#39;t agree to the definition of the word &quot;fact&quot; versus &quot;an assumption that seems to be confirmed by circumstantial evidence&quot;, then there is no possible chance of a logical and rational debate happening between us.  </p>

<p>And now you claim to agree with 90% of what is said by someone you consider insane.  And you refuse to enumerate the 10% you disagree with, therefore, I must assume you consider yourself insane.  I do not wish to debate anything with someone who refuses to be bound by the plain English definition of words and considers their self to be insane.  To even agree to do so would be like agreeing to go on Piers Morgan&#39;s show.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about that 10% you disagree with or admit you were only intending to disparage the participants and distract from the conversation about gun control.</p>

<p>Just another reminder: Alex&#39;s show is owned by rabid Zionist Jeffrey Smulyan&#39;s company Emmis (Hebrew for &#39;truth&#39;) Communications. Mr. Smulyan cuts the paychecks and tells Jones what to say, when to say it, and what ads for shady gold vendors and ineffective diet products go in between his nonsensical rants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a post earlier saying how alex was attempting to control the narrative of the debate, ... which he did...for good or worse. 
I don&#39;t believe pierce morgan had any intention of a balanced debate, his questions were loaded and when highlighted, ignored. 
I have a very low opinion of PM, and only a slightly higher one of AJ, but AJ does serve as a great focal point for a disparate community, and he really does hit the mark in many areas.
The ranting used to really annoy me, but then someone pointed out how it does characterise how you felt when you first learnt of disagreeable things. If it is a marketing ploy, it is very effective on people new to the subject, by seeing other people as outraged as yourself bolsters you confidence to continue looking.
The AJ making money comment is almost fair, but the &quot;This is how conspiracy nuts come across to the rest of us though.&quot; and &quot; Everything Alex did last night was typical behavior of a conspiracy theorist&quot; betrays your dickish nature.  dick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry, I don&#39;t get it? Are you insinuating that&#39;s me?  </p>

<p>There was a bit in the interview when PM said we should ban the assault rifle because it was used in mass shootings and gun related deaths in usa was over 1100. Both statements are true, but unrelated in this context. AJ countered with UK violent crime rate and the fact that there are no guns. AJs argument was true, but poor. It would have been better by comparing deaths at sea to fatal shark attacks, would you ban sharks? I know this is wildly off but the sentiment stands. AJ, as much as i dislike him, was right.</p>

<p>This freedom to own a killing machine fascinates me. I think I understand both sides of the argument and moreover, I don&#39;t know what to think or who&#39;s right. I live in England and not exposed to the realities of everyone having guns, so my opinions are almost academic.</p>

<p>Do you live in America? How old are you? I&#39;m 30, terrified of guns, but also terrified of people in positions of power. dick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m almost afraid to watch this because with Alex Jones, I know what to expect and if anyone familiar with his show was expecting something different, you&#39;re fooling yourself.</p>

<p>I really doubt Jones is a plant or disinfo agent. He genuinely believes the agenda that he&#39;s pushing to the point where he no longer gives a shit that he comes off sounding like a nut. A show doesn&#39;t go by where he doesn&#39;t talk about how the Government/Obama/The NWO is out to get him. I don&#39;t know what all this anti-Israel stuff is about but there&#39;s a certain amount of truth to the fact that the Israeli Lobby has far too much power in this Country. Chuck Haggel is going through that right now. You can&#39;t say shit about israel without being accused of being Anti-Semetic and it&#39;s totally out of hand. IMO, we need to stop blindly supporting Israel and doing their bidding in the middle east before they drag us into another war with Iran. </p>

<p>Fuck Piers Morgan and I saw the Jesse Ventura interview and I think Jesse handled him perfectly. Jesse is atleast smart enough to say I don&#39;t know when he doesn&#39;t have the answers and not fall for Piers&#39; Baiting tactics. When he asked the studio audience who was with him on the 9/11 discussion, it showed that the tide is turning on the 9/11 Issue. The whole studio audience was in agreement that the Government Conspiracy Theory is bullshit. His show Conspiracy Theory is pretty bad though. Good Subjects but the format of the show is just silly. Especially this season with the addition of his douche bag son and Oliver Stone&#39;s kid. The topics have also gotten pretty silly. Lizard Men and Manimals?</p>

<p>Eh? People stick up for him? Is this a joke? I had no idea who Alex Jones was before today but he appears to have a very large fan base. That&#39;s the scariest part of it all. It just goes to show how many lunatics there actually is out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm.. I like statistics. But to reduce dead children or dead family members to a statistic is downright insulting. Statistics are just numbers -- they provide no context or perspective which, I think, as human beings living in a society are vital. I am not arguing that all guns should be taken away from everybody. But it&#39;s fair game for it to be part of the conversation and it&#39;s fair game to say, &quot;we need to take a look at how we are handing out guns again&quot;. It&#39;s reasonable. And if you are a gun owner and we can take away a gun from an unqualified or irresponsible or volatile character, then it&#39;s one less person for you to defend yourself against. </p>

Also, those conditions that you decided upon for deciding his worth are your own. What about gay members of society? Black people? Women? People who don&#39;t like spinach?

<p>You have more guns, and you have more shootings. It&#39;s that simple.
One would think that a long with a &quot;pro guns&quot; stance comes the realisation, that somebody will obviously get shot with those guns. I mean theoretically it could be would-be criminals that got shot (it&#39;s not), but that&#39;s the whole point right? To defend yourself.</p>
