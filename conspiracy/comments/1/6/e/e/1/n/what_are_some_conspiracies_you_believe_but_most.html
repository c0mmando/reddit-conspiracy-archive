       Please no bashing here. If you see someone believing a conspiracy that you think is a bit far fetched, then please just simply say why you don't believe it and move on.

      <p>
       But here are mine..
I believe Chris Benoit is innocent, reason being because so things just don't add up.

       Idk if I'm allowed to post links here but here is why

       One conspiracy that I'm not so sure about is the 27th club. I've read up on this and people out there believe they were killed by the CIA and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       And one I don't believe that I know people out there believe is that Michael Jackson still being alive. The crazies part is that I know about a video that I came across on netflix with a woman sharing on reasons why she think he still alive along with trying to convience others who have watched the movie to believe the same thing..

       I believe that sinking of the Titanic was a conspiracy. Titanic, made of steel, was sunk by iceberg? Don't make me laugh, steel is harder than ice. You can test this by using a simple ice pick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and really convenient that the supposed "iceberg" is now "melted", destroying the "evidence".

       I as well believe that, I think it was done as a insurance scam and went way more worse then anticipated, considering the facts that, the SS Californian was right in the area of the sinking(I believe it was intended to save the passengers). The Titantic and Olympia looked identical, look up Jp Morgans whole role in the thing plus the 10+ million that was awarded by insurance.

       I just stopped at the very first one, I will look at more but the simple explanation of those contrails stopping and starting is when they power off to change position and drop back. I already asked about that one, ask a fellow jet pilot yourself

       I am a pilot. Moisture or condensation from an engine does not last for hours and hours period. that is the excuse you will be given over and over and over. Watch the vid I posted I came across it last night actually. It is about the ARMY actually conduction contrails of harsh chemicals over the US in the 60's as an experiment.

       I read through a the upper ones and have of course heard of seeding clouds and who has not heard of agent orange. Obviously they are dropping shit out of planes. The ones over Norwich I had not heard of. I guess what I am saying is I don't see any that happen that hang around for hours but I am on the west upperside of Missouri(KC) area. But I will keep an eye out for anything odd

       I live on the West coast and it is crazy I have seen them being produced and last through the majority of the day. and rather than spreading and dissipating they expand and grow, covering more of the sky. When I was looking into it it is said that the chemical that has been captured from them is Aluminum and Barium. Odd. But supposedly it is a part of a government program to reflect the sun and reduce the effects of global warming. Supposedly.

       If it is true it is crazy. They crisscross the sky daily, morning, noon, and night. Usually large cargo plans leave the large trails. you can sometimes see passenger jets next to the plans leaving the trails. the trails they leave will only stretch a mile or so behind them and completely dissipate after that.

       I am still waiting for someone to show me where RFID tags are inherently evil, but no one has.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question for that topic goes something like this: Is it that someone may be able to track it? If "yes" then who? Someone convince me here. Give me the info I need to see it the way you (not the OP, but someone that is against RFID tags) do. Thanks for any info guys!

       RFID tags are only evil if we are forced to wear/implant them. Many religious groups refer to this as the mark of the devil with in revelations leads us to the end of demise. or whatever. I only consider them bad if we are forced to wear them. My phone has GPS and can be tracked anywhere but I choose to use it I am not forced to. That is why I will not buy a new Chevrolet, they all have GPS tracking and have black boxes like an airplane. My 2cents on it.

       Thank you! Someone that didn't down vote me and run off!

       Implanting them would absolutely be bad, IMO. Wearing? I dunno. For me, it would depend on things like where would I need to have one on? If it's just while at a certain place, I would be ok with that. If it was something like If I leave my house and I have to wear it, that wouldn't be ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the Texas school RFID case: If she just needs to flash her badge to open a door, fine. But if the school says she must wear it off site, then no, that's not good at all. Then again, how would the school enforce students wearing it offsite? Most schools don't have enough money for the proper hardware to track them offsite. That's why I don't see the big deal about the girl in Texas, and other students having to wear one.

       To my understanding they also use it to make sure kids are where they are supposed to be. literally tracking you and your movement throughout the day. I think being forced to comply is "like" the mark of the beast. I for one would never wear one I would give them the finger and get my GED. :)
In the first draft of the Obama Health Care Act it talked of every American who was on it to get an RFID implant. that was quickly stomped out thankfully. But we get tracked everywhere now from Bus transit to the Airport, they use photo and sound identification to track and follow people.  It is kind of the new American way of life I guess.

       I have had to use one to enter the building I work in, but it didn't bother me. They just wanted crowd control. Stuff started coming up missing, so they started that. Also, while onsite if asked to produce my badge, I had to. It never bothered me. But I can see how some folks would call it the "Mark" but really, don't we already have that with our Social Security Numbers? What about a Driver's License number? Those are unique to the person it was issued to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I will say you are correct about being documented everywhere you go. They seem to be really wanting to install CCTV cams everywhere. My question is: Who watches the feeds, and who watches the watchers?

       Good point! Work does not bother me at all it is kind of cool to have a badge. :) From what I understand is there is a computer system that documents everything and through identifiers it recognizes people and adds places and such to a profile of you into a data base. And if something arises they can look it up and see where you have been.

       At the risk of sounding "shilly" I'm gonna go ahead and say "If you haven't done anything, why the need to hide?" But, I really tend to stay out of trouble, so they can look me up all they want! LOL! The way I see it is, if they wanted to, they could trump anyone up on all kinds of charges if they wanted to, why go through all the trouble to keep track of you? They could "disappear" you whenever they wanted.

       There are many schools doing this so it makes it a bit more difficult to go to another. Plus if it really is against their religious beliefs then so be it. they should not be forced. I can see benefits of using this in a elementary or middle school but not high school. and all you have to do is cover them with foil and they can't track you. but that is not really the point. BTW having a rfid to get into your building for work is completely different.

       Technology isn't intrinsically good or evil, it's how it's used. Eg nuclear fusion gave you power and the atom bomb. RFID aren't bad but if used for privacy invading purposes purposes they could be perceived to be.

       nothing is inherently evil, but the ability to totally disable all you means  you have to survive if you even consider dissidence is probably as far as any definition of the world evil goes.

       Sure, I can agree with that. Is the potential there to do that, though? That's my question.
