    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree with this statement more. What end result is the government trying to achieve? It seems like more and more it&#39;s about taking away freedom from the people, forcing those that work to work long hours to pay taxes to support our &quot;wars&quot; and support those that are unable to work/too lazy to work/etc. The elite are living a grand life on the backs of many hard working Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;wars&quot; are not paid for with &quot;taxes&quot;.  In reality we couldn&#39;t put that kind of expense on the people, they would never bear that kind of burden.  Our &quot;general&quot; budget is everything except Department of Defense spending. Then we have the NDAA each year that authorizes us to just flat-out borrow the money and dump the tab on our national debt.  So, they are taxing the people to pay for the interest on our gigantic loan of our own currency back to us from the Federal Reserve.  To be honest I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s any more logical than the wars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate do do this but i have to correct you on one thing.</p>

<p>The misuse of the word conspiracy.  WMD lie is still a conspiracy, HOWEVER, it is not a conspiracy theory anymore, it is a conspiracy FACT.
Example
9/11 is a conspiracy fact no matter how you look at it.
Either you believe a handful of Muslim Arabs CONSPIRED to sneak in and attack Americans, or you see the the &quot;loose change&quot; conspiracy.</p>

<p>One of these is conspiracy fact, and one is conspiracy theory.  I think most of you know which is which as well ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they were not staged.</p>

<p>But the system is designed to serve the powerful interests, and they have an interest in disarming the masses while arming their armies.  see hitler.</p>

<p>The insidiousness of power is that it rarely acts overtly.  Meaning that it creates opportunities for situations that give it advantage to occur, and then takes advantage of them to increase its control.  see September 11/war on terror/etc.</p>

<p>So no, power didn&#39;t push the button, but it is using that power, i.e. the fascist media, to create the illusion that it needs more emergency powers. again see hitler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I think is a problem with this idea.</p>

<p>Speaking from a purely pragmatic view, governments should not be too concerned about citizens owning weapons. Especially the American government. People who aren&#39;t impassioned enough to risk breaking the law probably aren&#39;t impassioned enough to take up arms against their government. And those who are wouldn&#39;t let the government know that they have such weapons. I think, if we are to become slaves of the state, it will not be from a system similar to the USSR or Big Brother from 1984; I think it will be from gradual culture manipulation, intentional or not; something similar to  Brave New World. How much safer, and easier, would it be for a government, with all the technology of modern day, to control the culture, ideals, and motivations of it&#39;s people, than to engage in a risky war against it&#39;s citizens? If it were to take military action against it&#39;s citizens there would be a massive uproar; citizens would lose confidence in their government and become impassioned. No; if I were to want to control a people, I&#39;d want to gradually and gently push them into a hedonistic and consumeristic mindset. What danger can come from a people who don&#39;t care, who care only about the immediate, who have no desire to think? If I were to be aggressive, to make them think I were infringing upon their liberties, it would only make them more critical, more independent, less easy to control.</p>

<p>All said, I don&#39;t know if there exists an organization who wish such a thing, and I doubt it, though I think it would be frighteningly easy to control the public in such a way. I don&#39;t think that the current gun control discussion is an agenda of such an organization. And, I do think that citizens should be allowed to own guns, not because I think that they would ever help them defend against theri government, but because I think it helps to create a fundamentally good sense of independence, self reliance, and worth of the self.</p>

<p>Sorry if this doesn&#39;t make sense, I&#39;m drunk.
TL;DR if someone wanted to control the world, they would have found a way to do it, and no one would be able to tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a matter of whether they were staged and carried out in a manner that is the complete opposite of how they are described. Obviously the media will distort the stories but after reading that blog in the OP, it does not seem too farfetched nowadays to believe some of these events may be carried out to reap the benefits for the government. I use nowadays loosely too, because I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been going on for years, but when these mass shootings become commonplace in the states, where they typically never happened, it seems to draw a red flag. </p>

<p>By &quot;hoax&quot; I mean the use of crisis actors and others to dramatize the event to make it seem more serious then it was. Obviously a school shooting of little kids is a rather serious matter, but there are too many gray areas and questions left unanswered to think part of it was a hoax to promote their standpoint on gun control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that that is farfetched. I think if you argue that Lanza was supplied by the FBI, and maybe handled by secondary shooters, I guess that&#39;s possible (not probable) but everyone being actors seems crazy. Too many loose ends. When you&#39;re dealing with something like 9/11 you have undercover agents doing the job, but to put actors in connecticut and assume none of their neighbors would say anything is too much for me to grasp</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly possible, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s what is going on. There is know real way that the government could take guns away from the general population without a pretty big backlash. No amount of scare tactics are going to change that. At some point the government would have to come out and say &quot;We are outlawing citizens right to have arms, for X reason&quot;, no matter what that reason is, 90%+ of gun owners aren&#39;t going to let them go without a fight. </p>

<p>Gun owners are pretty unshakeable in their want to have guns, and those who don&#39;t like guns want tougher laws/outlawing anyway. There is only a small part of the population that is sitting on the fence that could be scared into wanting guns gone. All this staging of attacks (if they are doing it) is getting them nowhere. They would get the exact same reaction to outlawing guns for no reason as they would for having a reason, so it&#39;s pretty pointless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it interesting that r/conspiracy would take the stance that it&#39;s a ploy to take guns <em>away</em>. The effect has been opposite; ARs are sold out in most gunstores or prices have increased because of high sales.</p>

<p>Is the big arms industry suddenly your friend? </p>

<p>At the same time Obama has already realized that the assault weapon ban isn&#39;t probably coming back, and he&#39;s too scared to say it&#39;s the main thing he wants to do (so that when it doesn&#39;t happen, he wont look like a total failure). </p>

<p>Gun nuts fell for the Obama election 4 years ago, and now they did it again. Since O became president, Sturm and Rugers stock is up like 500%. When all else fails, follow the money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that there are government and military officials, as well as info on MSM programming that have confirmed the data in the link itself should serve as an indicator that there is veracity to the info itself.</p>

<p>Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. MacNamara himself has already gone on record and outright said that the Gulf of Tonkin incident that was single-handedly responsible for sending the U.S. into the Vietnam War (quote end quote) &quot;DIDN&#39;T ACTUALLY HAPPEN.&quot;  It was a false flag.  This is not some &quot;tin foil hat&quot; made up shit.  He said this on record, on TV while the cameras were on him and rolling.</p>

<p>There is indeed quite a bit of data documenting literally every single incident that is on the link&#39;s list.  The fact that I don&#39;t feel like doing the added leg work to look up the government docs for you shouldn&#39;t make you think that, because of this, they don&#39;t exist.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s realistic. Not because the people in government are so honest and forthright that they&#39;d never be deceptive - but a hoax (meaning nobody really died and it&#39;s all bullshit) of that magnitude is awfully difficult to pull off; and if it were a real shooting but with a Manchurian Candidate type shooter, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d let the shooters live long enough to potentially reveal the operation (cf. Lee Harvey Oswald). I&#39;m not convinced that we know how to do the Manchurian Candidate thing - but if we did, I don&#39;t know why they wouldn&#39;t have the guy kill himself at the end, or be killed by responding police. </p>
