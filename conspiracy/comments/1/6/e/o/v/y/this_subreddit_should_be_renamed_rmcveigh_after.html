       I saw the look of pure violence on Alex Jones' face, and on the faces of all the other rabidly pro gun folks out there. You all wouldn't lose a bit of sleep killing your fellow countrymen if it meant protecting your precious toys. The conservative global elites that ACTUALLY rule the world can see that their hold is weakening, they know they have to move against all the damn hippies before it's too late. NO ONE IS COMING TO CONFISCATE ALL YOUR GUNS! And all the while the elites laugh at the blood frenzy they've sent you on while you eliminate those in the Occupy, peace advocate, corporate justice, and secular movements. Of course, few will read this because this subreddit has turned into a mouthpiece for Fox News.

       What attacks? Gun laws have become

        less
       </strong>
       restrictive during the Obama Administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, and the 2nd Amendment isn't an "inalienable right." It's a legal right given to us by the Constitution. You don't have a right to guns through divine providence, but rather through the tools of the social contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       To step over the line, the government must take at least one step, which the Executive Branch has never done. You're not making a mountain out of a mole hill, you're making a mountain out of a conversation that you had about mountains you're afraid of.

       Attacks on my right to peaceably assemble, for one. There was and is a coordinated effort between the feds and banks to shut down Occupy Wall Street (source -
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/05/fbi-occupy-wall-street_n_2410783.html">

       . Whether or not you agree with them or their tactics, Occupy's peaceful gatherings were repeatedly met with violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I consider any law that makes it harder to get a gun an infringement on my right to bear arms (something the 2nd amendment expressly forbids). They may have become less restrictive, which is good, but it appears there are stricter laws in our near future. Not good.

       But you're exactly wrong. Those rights are enshrined in law. They can be taken away as the Constitution is amended.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't so long ago that the right to burn a flag was threatened to be taken away via constitutional amendment. I agree that you have rights under the law, but they are absolutely not inalienable.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what you opinion on the validity of these rights (I agree with you that they are crucial to our survival as a free people), they are in no way inalienable.

       You're only seeing the psychos that they want you to see (on both sides) and it appears you have drawn exactly the conclusion that they are aiming for.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is reporting on the positions of moderate gun supporters and no one is reporting the times recently where guns have been used exactly like they were intended (to defending the innocent).
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is presenting you with two extremes and factoring in the research that shows that you cannot make an informed decision if they present it this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your knee-jerk reaction is exactly the kind of response that they are trying to form to shape the future of gun control.

       These psychos are a vocal minority of the gun rights movement. They are mixing, in my opinion, both the first and second amendments in their arguments (i.e. "I think you're saying some dumbass shit, but it is your right to say it and my right to disagree.")

       True. We should make people pass a test and get a license before they are allowed to own a car. Then we should make everybody register their cars, pay a fee to the government to keep a database of them, and pay for insurance in case their car causes harm to any other person or their property.
      </p>

       But surely this would be a violation of our natural rights to private property, no?

       Piers rants and screams as well..just you tube him. Saying the new pro gun grabbers are more docile is also a blatant red herring when trying to make an argument for new gun laws.

       I don't personally know anyone howling to the moon on overthrowing the gov't. Is the governmet responsible for some pretty messed up atrocities? Yes and to deny that fact would make you a fucking moron.
      </p>
      <p>
       down votes for pointing out your flawed argument...cool story bro. Only on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say what ever you want, that's the beauty of the constitution, for now anyways.

      <p>
       I would love to see what this country looks like when guns are completely confiscated.  Can anyone say nazi, germany?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't find the continued indulgence of the surrender of law abiding citizens weapons a good policy initiative either. Didn't work in the u.k. where crime rate per capita is higher then the u.s. It won't work here and in fact the border states crime rate will sky rocket especially with the drug wars still going on. Good luck to anyone who lives along the mexican-american border.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise Ben Shapiro was pretty calm and he doesn't want guns to be taken away. So I am still wondering about this evidence you have that proves that constitutional law abiding citizens are terrorists..you sound like the government lol..I think American's are just passionate and tired of fake leaders who feed us bullshit like "we love the 2nd amendment"(obama), and then blatantly attack it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real evidence supports the 2nd amendment and the destruction of "gun free" zones. The teaching and practice of conceal and carry will always trump "gun free" zones. Clackamas, Maya 14 both stopped by people with conceal and carries. Get the fuck over yourself and stop trying to dump on the constitution..if you don't like gun laws...LEAVE!

       I don't personally know anyone howling to the moon on overthrowing the gov't. Is the governmet responsible for some pretty messed up atrocities? Yes and to deny that fact would make you a fucking moron.

       down votes for pointing out your flawed argument...cool story bro. Only on reddit.

       You can say what ever you want, that's the beauty of the constitution, for now anyways.

       I would love to see what this country looks like when guns are completely confiscated.  Can anyone say nazi, germany?

       I don't find the continued indulgence of the surrender of law abiding citizens weapons a good policy initiative either. Didn't work in the u.k. where crime rate per capita is higher then the u.s. It won't work here and in fact the border states crime rate will sky rocket especially with the drug wars still going on. Good luck to anyone who lives along the mexican-american border.

       Likewise Ben Shapiro was pretty calm and he doesn't want guns to be taken away. So I am still wondering about this evidence you have that proves that constitutional law abiding citizens are terrorists..you sound like the government lol..I think American's are just passionate and tired of fake leaders who feed us bullshit like "we love the 2nd amendment"(obama), and then blatantly attack it.

       The real evidence supports the 2nd amendment and the destruction of "gun free" zones. The teaching and practice of conceal and carry will always trump "gun free" zones. Clackamas, Maya 14 both stopped by people with conceal and carries. Get the fuck over yourself and stop trying to dump on the constitution..if you don't like gun laws...LEAVE!

       What you quoted is the text of the Wikipedia page, not any legal document. Whatever you interpret about my education, I have never mistaken a Wikipedia entry for a legal precedent.

       Returning to tyrannical rule such as England had over the Colonies is not progress.

       In looking back at my original four points, you've made it abundantly clear what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       want.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          You
         </em>
         want to be able to violently attack my family without fear of resistance or bodily harm.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          You
         </em>
         want to be able to violently attack my freedom without fear of resistance in order to enslave me to
         <em>
          your
         </em>
         will
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          You
         </em>
         want to be able to violently invade my home without fear of resistance or bodily harm.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          You
         </em>
         want to be able to violently deny any other of my inalienable rights as enumerated in the Constitution without fear of resistance.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Common criminals like you are one of the reasons the 2nd Amendment exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it is
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       that wants to violate the US Constitution then it is
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       that should "just usher yourself out".
