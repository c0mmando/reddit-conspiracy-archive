       Most of the internet newscopy source back to "his uncle Michael Wolf" or "his attorney" or "officials".  NYDN seems to have the scoop on the method, but it sources to "cops".

       Ah. I didnt see it when i first logged in then came to r/conspiracy and saw it half way down and thought it suspicious. Would have thought it would have been higher in both the front page and r/conspiracy and if it was i would have thought it would have been at the top longer. Just my 2 bits

       ok now i'm just learning about this JSTOR incident, but from what i know of  JSTOR is that it holds scientific and other types of articles.  i think most people here are under the impression that the conspiracy comes from some force trying to set an example or silence of someone trying to liberate information (that should be free for all) from the hands of those withholding it.

       keep reading this little thread we've got going.  for one, yes it's lolable that people are making this into a conspiracy thing. is it possible, sure. two, not everyone can access JSTOR without paying, the copyright issue is not the issue here. people are concerned that his death has more to do with ending an issue based on spreading human collective knowledge to a wider audience rather than those "elite" enough to be able to afford such.

       i'd say analogous to if the piratebay folk or the wikileaks founder mysteriously committed suicide.  just in a very different sense.  once more details into his personal life come up, this will be forgotten. unless people go into the whole, "the CIA is planting this information to make us think he was actually depressed and suicidal" thing.

       If you go to university or know someone that does you will almost certainly have access to JSTOR.  It's not secret or hidden or difficult to access.  Most all universities maintain subscriptions to it.

       What he did was illegal though there were lots of parts of the case(and the governments insistance on persecuting them) that were questionable. Though the sad truth is it's almost certainly about one mans attempt to appear tough on computer crime than any actual government conspiracy against Aaron.

       from what i understand he was not part of the university. i am not sure if people attentding a university are allowed to divulge these files, but regardless if he downloaded millions of files my belief is that he was trying to spread them/make them available for free to people who do not attend university or know someone that does.  this is my point, trying to convey how it can be seen as conspiracy.  the "man" trying to silence a man trying to increase the general populations awareness and knowledge, so that the "man" can maintain their status of control.  i don't necessarily subscribe to this belief, i was simply explaining my take as to how some people may be calling it a conspiracy, in relation to the parent comment.

       But it's not a conspiracy.  The government charging him with theft of service isn't a conspiracy when he actually stole that service.  What he did was definitely illegal no question about it.  The problem is JSTOR was originally claiming it was worth millions when the fact is so many people have access to it for much much less.

       ok....-facepalm- i'm not saying the conspiracy is that he was charged of it or whatever the fuck you're saying.. the conspiracy people are formulating is that a government agency staged his suicide, or even killed him, as a way to completely end the matter of distributing knowledge.  the premise here is that human collective knowledge should be available for everyone, not just those rich enough to afford university education, and that the government does not want this.

       So they have a case going which one prosecutor is really pushing for and no one else really cares about.  And this prosecutor somehow convinces the federal government that instead of taking this case to trial they should murder the defendant because he shared some files?

       Read them again.  Just because they have the JSTOR name doesn't mean they involve crimes against JSTOR.  JSTOR pulled out of the proceedings months ago and didn't consent to the criminal proceedings.

       HYCT is indeed a troll. A dim but persistent one. Never fails to be stubborn, stupid, and clueless. Either he's a good constructed persona, or he has some DNA damage. I always have to swat him with a newspaper but like all cockroaches he dodges and comes back.

       That question doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe this site is run by the feds for some reason(data collection) yet you still willingly use it to discuss whatever and provide it with information on yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either you don't really believe it or you don't care about what information the feds get on you.  Given your history I'd say the later isn't too likely.

       Why not switch user names or something? Or maybe finally swallow your gun? Might not be so bad, a nice dreamless sleep - and the rest of us could go on having discussions like adults without you trolling us softly.

       You value free internet yet you would threaten someones life because they don't agree with you?  Or in the case of a troll because they choose to express themselves differently?  You don't care about freedom.  You care about your own opinions.

       Agreed, and there is plenty of evidence he does that most of the time. All it takes is viewing a few comment threads. He intentionally, I believe, always ignores and/or deliberately misinterprets. He's said some truly ridiculous things elsewhere, and so silly they are clearly not accident but purposeful trolling. I propose that anyone who repeatedly, deliberately always (&gt;95% of the time) uses trolling tactics for everything be bannable on that basis. One troll or several, no problem at 1%. But always: a big problem, and forum trashing.

       What does that have to do with my question exactly?  Also the understanding the writer showed there is extremely limited. The loans they are referring to roll over daily.  So a $10b loan held for 10 days would go down as a $100b loan.

      <p>
       It pays a 6% dividend on how much they put in.  Given that they don't only hold federal debt however they have other sources of revenue besides the federal government.  Enough that each year they make more than the federal government pays them in interest by quite a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year the federal reserve paid the federal government $88.9 billion.

      <p>
       Given your response it's quite clear you don't even have a basic understanding of the fed.  Maybe you should go do some more reading because accusing others of ignorance.

       I think the reason people are so eager to jump on the idea of an external force in this is first because this guy helped found Reddit, and helped defend not only all of Reddit's freedom but the general freedom of US citizens, and  he took his own life, so they probably want to find a secret story of the noble internet knight defeating big brother. Not trying to make them all sound silly, I think it would be an awesome story too, but people like to paint that picture of greatness and general baddasery.
      </p>
      <p>
       And secondly I think it's because he did so in the middle of his trial, people think it adds a hint of 'mystery' to it. I think it's worth discussing to see if anything viable can be seen in it. However I do agree that going too far and making up stories and such is completely disrespectful, especially after all that he's done for us internet folk.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I can see, it does look like he had a sad situation and it's likely there was nothing behind it, so personally I'm going to be generally finished with the whole 'underlying mystery' thing now.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another note, thanks for everything Aaron. You were a brilliant visionary, and you've given us things that we (Reddit) along with the rest of the internet will not likely forget. RIP

       <p>
        This morning, a lot of people are speculating that Aaron killed himself because he was worried about doing time. That might be so. Imprisonment is one of my most visceral terrors, and it's at least credible that fear of losing his liberty, of being subjected to violence (and perhaps sexual violence) in prison, was what drove Aaron to take this step.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Aaron was also a person who'd had problems with depression for many years. He'd written about the subject publicly, and talked about it with his friends.

       How sadly ironic that in his suffering from depression, and his ultimate suicide, is his legacy of co-founding reddit; a site with an incredibly big heart with even a support subreddit for people
       <strong>
        <em>
         just like him, and his position:
         <a href="/r/SuicideWatch">
          /r/SuicideWatch
         </a>
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Having known depression, events like this are very sad.

       He blogged previously about having had problems with depression. Plus he was still being prosecuted for downloading JSTOR by hacking into MIT network.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I recall he gained entry to the campus through friends and installed a laptop in a closet. All for a good cause but by the letter of the law illegal. Think laws should be changed to allow open and free access to information for scholarly purposes? Me too.. all the same the law is the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you know he didn't just get dumped by a significant other or find out he was ill or...endless reasons why someone may kill themselves.

       Not everything is a conspiracy. Some things just suck.

       Lawrence Lessig, who heads the Safra Center at Harvard and had worked for a time on behalf of Mr. Swartz’s legal defense, noted in an interview that Mr. Swartz had been arrested by the M.I.T. campus police two years to the day before his suicide. That arrest led to the eventual federal indictment and financial ruin for Mr. Swartz, who had made money on the sale of Reddit to Condé Nast but had never tried to turn his intellect to making money. “I can just imagine him thinking it was going to be a million-dollar defense,” Mr. Lessig said. “He didn’t have a million dollars.”

       I think he was murdered. I just wrote a long comment, and it seems to have been deleted. The prosection didn't have much on Aaron; he probably would have beaten the charges. And he may have led the charge against the current version of SOPA. Aaron obviously pissed off some very powerful people; he was a brilliant hacker who was for freedom of information- just the type that the intelligence crowd hates.
The media is making a lot of his supposed depression, but if you look at it there's not much there. Probably all of us have felt a little despair at times... there's no real sign that Aaron was suicidal.
Murder under the cover of suicide is very common in U.S. political history.
Check out the case of Danny Casolaro, an enemy of U.S. political elites if there ever was one:

       Glenn Greenwald wrote a fine obituary on Aaron Swartz and the struggle Swartz had with federal prosecutors.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is from the official statement of Swartz's family:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts US Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death. The US Attorney's office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims. Meanwhile, unlike JSTOR, MIT refused to stand up for Aaron and its own community's most cherished principles."

       I don't know more than you.  But, I would also ask you why you and others dismiss the most likely answer: that this was a troubled man, who friends and family have both said suffered from depression and who had written publicly about it and death.  You may want to think you're on to some deep hidden secret, but what you do is dishonor the man's memory and legacy with nonsense.

       You know what really sucks about this? We'll probably never know. All of the suicidal posts people are finding from him are from 2007 and days within each other. When something like this happens, we can't definitively state that they are connected: we have no proof, only confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do know though is that he was a strong pioneer for freedom, and he is gone now because of assholes with too much power. That pisses me off. It doesn't matter if he did it, or they did, he's still gone because of his activism; trying to allow people to inform themselves and stand up for their rights (avaaz).

       On this one, I'm going with, he knew that no matter how noble his motives had been, he was going to be reamed and his life ruined.  I don't believe that JSTOR would commit murder over their level of profits, and besides, they had an overwhelming case against him.

       While this is a far better post than the pic of the guy saying 'hero', simply because you're asking for info, a good conspiracy needs a launching pad.

       He was a depressed kid who did not realize that problems today goes away tomorrow. Thats the story of suicide. Kids do not have the perspective that all things will pass. He was looking at 35 years in jail and it destroyed him.....

       I don't know more than you.  But, I would also ask you why you and others dismiss the most likely answer: that this was a troubled man, who friends and family have both said suffered from depression and who had written publicly about it and death.  You may want to think you're on to some deep hidden secret, but what you do is dishonor the man's memory and legacy with nonsense.

       ok now i'm just learning about this JSTOR incident, but from what i know of  JSTOR is that it holds scientific and other types of articles.  i think most people here are under the impression that the conspiracy comes from some force trying to set an example or silence of someone trying to liberate information (that should be free for all) from the hands of those withholding it.
