<p>What he did was illegal though there were lots of parts of the case(and the governments insistance on persecuting them) that were questionable.

    <div class="md"><p>from what i understand he was not part of the university. i am not sure if people attentding a university are allowed to divulge these files, but regardless if he downloaded millions of files my belief is that he was trying to spread them/make them available for free to people who do not attend university or know someone that does.  this is my point, trying to convey how it can be seen as conspiracy.  the &quot;man&quot; trying to silence a man trying to increase the general populations awareness and knowledge, so that the &quot;man&quot; can maintain their status of control.  i don&#39;t necessarily subscribe to this belief, i was simply explaining my take as to how some people may be calling it a conspiracy, in relation to the parent comment.</p>

What he did was definitely illegal no question about it.  The problem is JSTOR was originally claiming it was worth millions when the fact is so many people have access to it for much much less.</p>

<p>It pays a 6% dividend on how much they put in.  Given that they don&#39;t only hold federal debt however they have other sources of revenue besides the federal government.  Enough that each year they make more than the federal government pays them in interest by quite a bit.</p>

<p>Last year the federal reserve paid the federal government $88.9 billion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason people are so eager to jump on the idea of an external force in this is first because this guy helped found Reddit, and helped defend not only all of Reddit&#39;s freedom but the general freedom of US citizens, and  he took his own life, so they probably want to find a secret story of the noble internet knight defeating big brother. Not trying to make them all sound silly, I think it would be an awesome story too, but people like to paint that picture of greatness and general baddasery.</p>

<p>And secondly I think it&#39;s because he did so in the middle of his trial, people think it adds a hint of &#39;mystery&#39; to it. I think it&#39;s worth discussing to see if anything viable can be seen in it. However I do agree that going too far and making up stories and such is completely disrespectful, especially after all that he&#39;s done for us internet folk.</p>

<p>From what I can see, it does look like he had a sad situation and it&#39;s likely there was nothing behind it, so personally I&#39;m going to be generally finished with the whole &#39;underlying mystery&#39; thing now.</p>

<p>On another note, thanks for everything Aaron. You were a brilliant visionary, and you&#39;ve given us things that we (Reddit) along with the rest of the internet will not likely forget. RIP</p>

<p>This morning, a lot of people are speculating that Aaron killed himself because he was worried about doing time. That might be so. Imprisonment is one of my most visceral terrors, and it&#39;s at least credible that fear of losing his liberty, of being subjected to violence (and perhaps sexual violence) in prison, was what drove Aaron to take this step.</p>

<p>But Aaron was also a person who&#39;d had problems with depression for many years. He&#39;d written about the subject publicly, and talked about it with his friends.</p>

<p>Having known depression, events like this are very sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He blogged previously about having had problems with depression. Plus he was still being prosecuted for downloading JSTOR by hacking into MIT network. </p>

<p>If I recall he gained entry to the campus through friends and installed a laptop in a closet. All for a good cause but by the letter of the law illegal. Think laws should be changed to allow open and free access to information for scholarly purposes? Me too.. all the same the law is the law. </p>

<p>How do you know he didn&#39;t just get dumped by a significant other or find out he was ill or...endless reasons why someone may kill themselves. </p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy. Some things just suck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lawrence Lessig, who heads the Safra Center at Harvard and had worked for a time on behalf of Mr. Swartz’s legal defense, noted in an interview that Mr. Swartz had been arrested by the M.I.T. campus police two years to the day before his suicide. That arrest led to the eventual federal indictment and financial ruin for Mr. Swartz, who had made money on the sale of Reddit to Condé Nast but had never tried to turn his intellect to making money. “I can just imagine him thinking it was going to be a million-dollar defense,” Mr. Lessig said. “He didn’t have a million dollars.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he was murdered. I just wrote a long comment, and it seems to have been deleted. The prosection didn&#39;t have much on Aaron; he probably would have beaten the charges. And he may have led the charge against the current version of SOPA. Aaron obviously pissed off some very powerful people; he was a brilliant hacker who was for freedom of information- just the type that the intelligence crowd hates.
The media is making a lot of his supposed depression, but if you look at it there&#39;s not much there. Probably all of us have felt a little despair at times... there&#39;s no real sign that Aaron was suicidal.
Murder under the cover of suicide is very common in U.S. political history.
Check out the case of Danny Casolaro, an enemy of U.S. political elites if there ever was one:<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Glenn Greenwald wrote a fine obituary on Aaron Swartz and the struggle Swartz had with federal prosecutors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/12/aaron-swartz-heroism-suicide1">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/12/aaron-swartz-heroism-suicide1</a></p>

<p>This is from the official statement of Swartz&#39;s family:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Aaron&#39;s death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts US Attorney&#39;s office and at MIT contributed to his death. The US Attorney&#39;s office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims. Meanwhile, unlike JSTOR, MIT refused to stand up for Aaron and its own community&#39;s most cherished principles.&quot;</p>

<p>What I do know though is that he was a strong pioneer for freedom, and he is gone now because of assholes with too much power. That pisses me off.
