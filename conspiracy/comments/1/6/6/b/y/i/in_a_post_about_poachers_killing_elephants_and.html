        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The post can be viewed <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/165122/poachers_are_not_only_killing_elephants_but_also/">here.</a> </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m totally against poaching, and the people responsible for it should be stopped, but these people are saying the US should help out. People who are openly against the invasion of Iraq are openly supporting the US move into Africa for no real reason. The US has expressed interest in the past about getting into Africa, and it&#39;s certainly not to spreed love and peace. </p>

<p>What if something like this drummed up enough public support that the US and affiliates could actually do this. Once they are in I think it won&#39;t take much for the military to start &#39;helping the locals&#39;. </p>

<p>For the record I don&#39;t think this is going to happen, or that it&#39;s even a conspiracy. I&#39;m merely commenting on the willingness of people for the US military to become involved in things that they have no place being involved in. And these are the same people that are so anti the death penalty and so anti the Iraq war. It&#39;s truly amazing how easy it would be to convince the public that the US needs to be in Africa. It&#39;s rather unsettling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sheeple mentality. Kill the poachers. I can&#39;t stand the killing either, but as long as Africans are cash strapped to provide basics in life. Then there will always be someone to fill the vacuum of an illegal trade. </p>

<p>I wonder if those redditors screaming such would sell off all their little electronic toys to help out those poachers?</p>

<p>We&#39;re already deploying to Africa.  Under the guise of national security...just like the middle east.  But check this out, if you look at a globe, our troops will effectively have the oil fields of the middle east, and the respective shipping lanes surrounded.  The Iraq invasion was about oil, this is about oil, as well as other resources Africa is rich in (rare earth metals). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about the elephants for the military. They need an reason to go into Africa, one that has public support, the elephants do that for them if need be. But what happens from there? Do the military go in, kill the poachers and then leave? Doubt it. They would probably find out that the various African militant groups and armies all support the poachers, so then a war must be waged against them for the good of the world. </p>

<p>The elephants don&#39;t matter to the military, they never will. If they ever went to Africa under the guise of stopping poacher then you can expect a lot more than that.</p>
