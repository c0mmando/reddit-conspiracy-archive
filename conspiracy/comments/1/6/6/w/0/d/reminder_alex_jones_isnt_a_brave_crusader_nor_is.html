        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The only plot he&#39;s involved in is selling DVD&#39;s and bumper stickers to paranoiacs and the gullible. His demeanor is engineered to appeal to people who feel grossly unempowered and weakened by their day-to-day grind, and as a result fantasize about loudly and passionately calling out the powers that  they imagine to be. Shaking his fist at someone on television to the point of embarrassing himself will sell more DVD&#39;s than any calm and rational discussion he could have had, this was entirely intentional and all part of his character. </p>

<p>No conspiracy folks, just an old fashioned snake oil salesman.  Feel powerless, stupid, overwhelmed by this complex and seemingly nonsensical world? Have no fear, Alex is here to let you in on the big secret that it&#39;s all connected into one grand conspiracy that is conveniently easy to fathom and link to any news story just by reading the headline! What a smart, special, and empowered person you are, to be in on this secret too, buy another DVD so you can feel this even more. </p>

No, Alex Jones isn&#39;t a Mossad double agent black ops false flag CIA counter intel specialist like some on this subreddit suggest. He&#39;s a fucking dude from Texas who figured out how to make a decent payday peddling conspiracy stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the moment I think he&#39;s just misguided. To begin with he made a few good points and then it&#39;s almost as if he got carried away with his own voice. I would have to see his bank balance to assume what you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no way you can call Alex Jones &quot;misguided.&quot; Everything he does is with the intention of creating something sensational. He uses his &quot;crazy rant style&quot; so often, he should own the patent for it. </p>

<p>What he says and how he says it is all carefully constructed to be loud, outlandish and memorable. If the interview with Piers was conducted in a civilized, respectful tone, no one would be talking about him two days later. But bloviate about Americans starting another revolution if their guns are taken away and everyone will remember your name. </p>

<p>So now what&#39;s happening are people that may have only mildly have heard the name Alex Jones are checking out his websites and reading his articles and possibly buying his products. </p>

<p>It pays to be seen as crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, everything you have said I can get behind. I just don&#39;t buy into the &quot;he&#39;s in it for the money&quot; line. I think he genuinely but at the same time misguidedly cares about what he talks about. There are a lot of holes in what he says. Perhaps he can be accused of providing such weak counter arguments that everyone who is anti gun control will be seen on his level (perceived as crazy by yahoo etc.) but as I said earlier I would have to see his bank account to assume he&#39;s in it for the money, and I don&#39;t think he has his own jet... yet?</p>

<p>I see the stickers everywhere, can&#39;t tell you about the DVD&#39;s. I can tell you also that most of his radio carriers pay him a syndication fee. There are also speaking fees, quite substantial, as well as more run of the mill merch he sells there like tshirts and hats. He isn&#39;t funding his company with over 30 employees out of his personal savings.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Right, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s an entire media complex that millions of people tune into that has little or no substance to speak of. It&#39;s not like Rush Limbaugh and the like are wildly successful broadcasters in spite of the utter idiocy they spew.</p>

<p>Alex has a market audience.  Most of the people that browse this subreddit have no idea that Alex talks about those subjects daily with live call ins.  Who cares that he makes money doing it.  He&#39;s passionate about what he speaks.  He might embrace theatrics to drive his points home but so what?  Did he say anything anyone here really disagrees with?</p>

<p>Even when Piers went for the low-blow by bringing up 9/11 during a gun debate, Alex didn&#39;t waiver.  He brought up the facts that he could speculate on without blaming anyone.  He pointed the finger at SSRI&#39;s and how these pills are linked to suicide.</p>

<p>I think conspiracy needs to come to a consensus on Alex and that is that he is doing more good than bad.  He asks you to think.  Calling him a shill and a zionist is just paranoid delusions... </p>

<p>It&#39;s far less paranoid or delusional than you would have us think. Imho The man gets way too much air time on mainstream television for him to <em>not</em> be controlled dissent. I&#39;m pretty sure his wife is Jewish too. Then there&#39;s his connection to STRATFOR. Didn&#39;t he have an employee that was ex cia propagandist? These are not paranoid delusions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s a full on shill but his &quot;theories&quot; have a distinct kosher flavor wherein he never ever cites the many crimes and curiosities committed by Israel, Zionist Hollywood/MSM, AIPAC, Certain members of the US GOV... </p>

<p>He is a lousy gate keeper. But your right about one think. AJ has a market audience. I imagine it&#39;s comprised of chain smokers who&#39;ve given up on life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of what he is (Although there is some evidence that suggest he has some CIA dis-info ties), A con-man or a dis-info agent cannot and should not be trusted regardless. He does get a lot of stuff right, and actually I cannot recall any information he&#39;s actually gotten wrong (Granted, I&#39;ve only watched his show for about 10 minutes and do not follow him outside of seeing his posts about him here or elsewhere), but to accept what he says as gospel, or to even to go out of your way to support him, is only harming our &quot;movement&quot;. Fighting the NWO or whatever you&#39;d like to call it doesn&#39;t need a leader even if they are credible or good (which most would agree AJ is teetering on). And anyone with a decent sense of logic and any understanding of the CIA should know that there <em>is</em> disinfo out there and you <em>cannot</em> and <em>Should not</em> get all or even a significant portion of your information from one source if you wish to be truly informed. For this movement to succeed by any means, we <em>all</em>  need to be leaders, doing our own research. </p>

<p>every message board i visit can&#39;t discount what he says, merely that he shouldn&#39;t be listened to in any capacity because getting animated means you can&#39;t be credible. some of these people have concerns about how he conducted himself in that interview, myself included, but definitely some are disinfo agents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was intrigued by what he had to say, that is until I realized that he is just another over inflated gas bag, like some of the people on mainstream media.</p>

<p>He loves buzzwords like neocon, nwo, and Illuminati.  He loves to exaggerate everything he says.  And his articles are generally mindless and focus on one or two topics from week to week.  This week its 25 articles on gun control.  Next week he will be back beating the tom toms over the TSA.  Its almost kinda sad.  The man has made a career on being a lunatic.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be first to admit, he did change the way I saw things.  Hut his schtick is too much for me to swallow and I can&#39;t handle his moronic ranting and raving.</p>

<p>And stop trying to shove that tangy tangerine down my throat.  It tastes like shit and you are as fat as ever, stop saying that powered crap made you lose imaginary weight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can like Alex Jones or you can hate him. Just remember that what led you to him was your curiosity and need to know the truth. The moment you become more faithful to a means to information than to the truth itself, you&#39;ve lost your way. I used to be a big Alex Jones fan. Then I realized that I could still learn and research the world without being afraid or angry all the time. Quitting Alex was a good decision for me, but I try not to discourage people from seeking truth by completely denouncing him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Cooper has bullshitted more than Alex Jones has. In his book he claimed Kennedy was shot by the driver, &quot;you can see his nickel plated .45&quot; In the zapruder film. This theory has been disproved many times. He later on a talk show claimed the driver shot Kennedy with a shellfish poison pellet from a specially made plastic pistol. He claimed he read all this from the &quot;documents&quot; he saw when he was in navy intelligence. Now why wouldn&#39;t he put that in his book instead of saying the gun was a .45? On top of the fact that the driver theory is retarded. I have a hard time following along with anything Bill Cooper had to say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the IMF and World Bank have socialist agendas.  The framers of IMF were prominent members of Socialist and Communist parties.  I mean, socialist economics are named for the guy who started the IMF, John Maynard Keynes.  The transnational corporations are not capitalist either, because that would imply that they are pro-competition.  I think we both know that is totally untrue, as these multinational corps want to monopolize rather than compete.</p>

<p>I think Alex would be better off using different terms like collectivist because it has less connotations, but these powers that be most definitely are not capitalists.  They are collectivists who want to control all the resources and means of production, which is Marxist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree completely.  I would also note the collectivist vs. voluntaryist issue, because like you said those other terms really have no meaning.  They&#39;re all collectivist, and are ideologically the same.  We all are forced to support our govt&#39;s actions.  Participation is compulsory (through taxation and govt sanctioned punishments/violence).  </p>

<p>“The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.” -- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin</p>

<p>This is what Alex Jones is doing. This is the function that he serves. Where do you guys think he&#39;s getting all the money to do all this stuff? Ads? No, it&#39;s through his corporate handlers. The Ron Paul campaign for example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is evidence, but it seems thin to me.  I live in Austin and have regular contact with people who have known Alex and worked with him on different rally&#39;s in the past.  I even know the people in the gun rally video.  That&#39;s John Bush speaking and Heather Fazio standing next to them.  They&#39;re good people with real intent to spur change.  Also, a fellow who used to be a professor at University of Texas and used to work with Alex to hold different rally&#39;s.  All of them say the same thing.  That Alex is genuine, but he is a megalomaniac.  He want&#39;s to be the next George Washington.  He truly believes there will be a violent revolution and afterwards he will be seen as one of the best patriots in the history of the country for standing up to the bad guys.  Plus, the fact that Molly Maroney was an intern at Stratfor for 3 months hardly proves much.  It is suspicious that with all AJ&#39;s cointelpro talk that he would hire her, but at the end of the day I&#39;m still inclined to believe he is simply an egotist who needs to find a better way to deal with his emotions.</p>

His websites are actually great for news, but with the in house articles, the Nimmo &amp;Watson stuff, look for sources that dont just link to previous jones articles that reference yet more jones articles.

<p>That&#39;s interesting. Thank you for sharing this. </p>

<p>No why I&#39;m saying this about them is because this is about a lot more than just one incident. It more about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KalX0MJ5hQ">role</a> that I see Alex Jones playing in our culture. </p>

<p>He makes anyone who chooses to repeat what he is saying look like an absolute idiot. Especially after facts are checked. He consistently disseminates disinformation. If a fact checker was to try to fact check him they wouldn&#39;t even be able to keep up. </p>

<p>Maybe Alex Jones is just the right person for the job. Perhaps he is being manipulated himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I understand your stance.  I agree to an extent.  I said &quot;I&#39;m inclined to believe..&quot;  because I&#39;m still on the fence myself.  My arguement to these people that know AJ is basically he gets people riled up and scared shitless, then the only solution he has is, buy these fine products I&#39;m graciously offering so you can save yourself.  Oh, and don&#39;t forget to keep your guns oiled.  At times it appears he&#39;s doing little more than trying to scare people and incite violence while capitalizing on people&#39;s fear.</p>

<p>I doubt he is being manipulated, but he certainly could be a sociopath.  That is more than believable.  Whatever the truth is, I still don&#39;t like the guy.</p>

<p>It seems as though you might be having an emotional reaction to my post... I think you should calm down. </p>

<p>Molly Maroney is not the only issue here. Just look at who he is talking to:</p>

<p>&quot;Alex Jones and his team of reporters, writers, and producers routinely schedule, host and quote former and current intelligence officials such as Dr. Steve Pechenik (DOD), Wayne Madsen (NSA), Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer (Senior Fellow at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies), David MacMichael (CIA), Ray McGovern (CIA), and James Wesley Rawles (ARMY Intelligence) just to name a few. These intelligence operatives provide Alex Jones’ listeners with unique insights into political, economic, and military developments. Alex Jones and Infowars use live reporting, websites, podcasts, video streams, videos, books, iPhone applications and a host of other media to attempt to explain and make understood world events.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some of the biggest lies he&#39;s ever told come from some of these people myself. It&#39;s clear to me that this is not simply some sort of a coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m understanding your position.  We can argue all day about who Alex Jones is, but that would distract from the actual debate.  </p>

<p>Do you agree with the arguments that Alex Jones put forward or not?  If not what specific criticisms about his beliefs do you have, or what statements did he make that can be shown to be inaccurate.</p>

<p>Because he was either being deceptive, as you claim, or he was speaking the truth, and depending on which it is we can determine if he is selling items to fund the dissemination of the truth, or if he is deceiving in order to make a profit.  </p>

<p>In order for us to believe your claims you need to provide some evidence showing that Alex Jones was being deceptive, and then we can follow your conclusion that he is a charlatan.  If his statements are accurate and hold up to scrutiny then he is just raising funds to help promote the truth, but you haven&#39;t shown it to be either way, just talked shit about him without showing whether Alex is being deceptive or accurate.  Which is it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is on FOX for a reason. As the mouthpiece of the Republican party, FOX reaches out to ALL of the right wing in America. This includes the Patriot movement/Militias/Gun Rights organisations etc. Alex Jones&#39; show is aimed square at these groups. Once these guys watch Alex, they&#39;re more inclined (In my opinion) to watch other FOX content. And if someone on another FOX show briefly touches on an issue mentioned by Alex it sends out the message: &quot;The republican party is sympathetic to your beliefs&quot;, creating a new republican voter</p>

<p>Just a theory...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But then came the Italians:
“By the middle of the 12th century the Jews, who were leading money changers and moneylenders, had begun to make business loans. Because the business appeared to be lucrative, powerful rivals soon ended the Jewish hegemony. By the middle of the 13th century the Italians from Lombardy had taken over the leadership. They sometimes had the privilege of minting coins. They could solicit deposits, which the Jews were often prohibited from doing. They also managed to get around the church’s edict against interest. They did not make loans and charge interest but bought and sold bills of exchange payable in foreign currency. They were, therefore, merchants in banking who hoped by the difference in exchange to make a profit equal to the interest rate they would have charged for a loan.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand all that.  I&#39;m somewhat familiar with Bernays philosophies.  What I&#39;m asking for is something specific that points to Ft. Bragg or to the people involved with media manipulation.  This is one of the hardest points to get people to believe, that all media is controlled, so if you have some relevant materials that aren&#39;t youtube videos that would be fantastic.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I understand your stance.  I agree to an extent.  I said &quot;I&#39;m inclined to believe..&quot;  because I&#39;m still on the fence myself.  My arguement to these people that know AJ is basically he gets people riled up and scared shitless, then the only solution he has is, buy these fine products I&#39;m graciously offering so you can save yourself.  Oh, and don&#39;t forget to keep your guns oiled.  At times it appears he&#39;s doing little more than trying to scare people and incite violence while capitalizing on people&#39;s fear.</p>

<p>I doubt he is being manipulated, but he certainly could be a sociopath.  That is more than believable.  Whatever the truth is, I still don&#39;t like the guy.</p>
