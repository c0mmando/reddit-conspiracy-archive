    <div class="md"><p>Money is law when you think about it. You get in more hell for pirating a kids show than assaulting a kid. Worst part is it&#39;s partly our fault, every time we give the media money the higher the copyright punishment will get.</p>

<p>And now it&#39;s overpassing the law itself. Every generation is getting worse and it&#39;s our damn falt. Everyone pitches in for our humanity&#39;s fall from what used to raise us.</p>

<p>So to sum it up we need a new law plan or we&#39;re utterly fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Copyright is violated millions of times a day without punishment,  so  society obviously does not think it is that important.  Child molesters on the other hand are put in prison and everyone just accepts that they will probably be raped or murdered there.  </p>

<p>The post is talking about rapists not child molesters and, I assume, the activist Aaron Swarz who was not charged with copyright infringement, which is a tort, but with wire fraud, computer fraud, and unauthorized access.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument is totally vacuous and without merit. Our laws don&#39;t remotely reflect public sentiment, they reflect the agendas of a small ruling elite. People don&#39;t give a shit what happens to rapists and child molesters in prison, because they&#39;re scum and probably would have been killed outright in a simpler world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a culture of fear and an investment opportunity.</p>

<p>If rape gets classified as a psychological phenomenon and treated with therapy, drugs, time and community service, then yes the jail time will be lower. There&#39;s been research into the proliferation of free porn (yay!) and lower sexual abuse cases, but I&#39;m not sure how long and how conclusive studies are. I&#39;m just a paragraph of words and a silly username after all.</p>

<p>The other end of it is the Internet activists; a broad term. Some consider Kim Dotcom one, and some consider Brad Manning one and Julian Assange and the myriad of people in Russia, Belarus, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, China and everyone else who is alone and scared and hungry losing time in some smelly prison. Dotcom as every tech blog fastidiously points out is wealthy, wraps his pierogi like body at night in sheets that cost more than your last five paychecks and has a PR team that&#39;d make Andrew Bernaise&#39;s skull nod in approval from his grave. </p>

<p>These are intelligent people who made a choice to expose the inner machinery of the State. Other smart and not so smart people will reason it&#39;s safer to say nothing at all. The activists become outliers and one wonders why they even bothered when safety and comfort could have been had so easy. That is, if one remembers to think of them. Keeping the flame of their memories and deeds alive and more importantly WHY it&#39;s important is paramount.</p>

<p>In the post Arab Spring paranoia about the vulnerability of institutions to a well connected populace, more folks are going to be prosecuted. Copy right falls into this because once more get locked up for the crime, the reasoning is less will do it. It&#39;s not sound reasoning or even prudent, but I&#39;m not a judge -- just words and a username.</p>

<p>You seem confused. Mitnick was only forbidden from using computers during his parole, i.e. his sentence was still ongoing at the time the restrictions were in place. Swartz was offered a six month sentence, so as long as he did his six months his sentence would be over. </p>

<p>For that matter a large percentage of federal convicts are sentenced without possibility of parole, so it&#39;s not even option for them.

I participated all the same when I was young; It&#39;s not beyond reproach and you&#39;re silly for thinking these things are &#39;off limits&#39; until the controllers tell us what is &quot;true&quot;.

<p>Notice how neither of us are even talking about the point we started on tho? Keep trying to derail, this thread is too long by now anyways</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It will be interesting to see what they are charged with. To bring it back to where we started, do you think they will see more jail time than what &#39;hacktivists&#39; are receiving? we&#39;ll find out next month.</p>

All I was  doing is disputing the statement made by OP that hacktivists get longer sentences than rapists.

<p>That depends on the definition of &#39;hacktivist&#39;. Gary MacKinnon nearly got deported to the US despite never stepping foot in the country. Bradley Manning is in indefinite detention for releasing documents online. Are these &#39;hacktivists&#39; or whistleblowers? What is the difference?</p>

<p>Besides them, there has been Sabu and other &#39;Anons&#39; that have been caught. Often they are worth more as resources to the government than in a jail cell tho...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was never the point. The point is that often these activists are delivered trumped up charges to intimidate them, often being quoted longer jail times than those who do acts like rape or sexual assault.</p>

<p>Schwartz was being charged on downloading and releasing already free academic journals because the publishers were taking payment for the viewing of them instead of passing on those revenues to the author of the research itself. Does that call for a maximum 30+ year sentence? You keep shying away from this part of the argument....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t call for a maximum 30+ year sentence but some instances of the crime he committed do.  Computer fraud covers a wide range of crimes.  If someone committed computer fraud and cleaned out the retirement funds of thousands of retirees they would probably get the maximum.  His crime caused much less damage so he would only get 6 months, maybe even less if it went to trial and he had a good lawyer and a technologically literate judge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet that isn&#39;t what happened at all in the Schwarz case. He was delivered trumped up charges on top of more charges, because he wasn&#39;t willing to bend over and take the plea bargain. Is that how things should work? The government should be able to use trumped up charges to intimidate defendants into accepting plea bargains against their best interest?</p>

<p>Remember too, this Schwarz kid was a genius. He invented the RSS feed, among other things. Considering he was only sharing free academic articles to bypass a publisher&#39;s &#39;get rich quick&#39; scheme, should he have been facing 30+ years in prison for his crimes? Should the prospect of such a sentence even have been broached considering the non-severity of his actions?</p>

<p>We shall being with the narrative intent of the articles presumed to be at hand and in question.  To wit, the very notion that Aaron Swartz was not MERELY a Jewish scion of internet royalty, but was, IN FACT, the murderer of his own self in order to avoid a worse fate.</p>

<p>Now, Barbara Streisand up here, would have you believe that he knew FULL WELL the entire weight of the US government stacked against him was nothing but bluster and blather.  Because, as we all know, the government of the United States is about as weighty as a gnat... just ask any Mexican, am I right?</p>

<p>However, Mr. Swartz did not seem to agree.  In fact, he seemed to disagree enough to believe that being stone-cold dead was a preferable alternative.</p>

<p>First undeniably true thing you&#39;ve said.  I do NOT know that.  I am entertaining a reasonable suspicion.

    <div class="md"><p>He probably would have gotten around the same with a conviction.  A plea bargain is not a game of chicken.  It is to save both sides the expense of a trial.  The plea bargain is usually similar to what a trial judge would have sentenced.</p>

<p>edit:  or if he is truly innocent he could say  &quot;fuck you, I&#39;m innocent, I&#39;m not admitting to something I did not do, and you&#39;re the one who belongs in prison for malicious prosecution&quot;</p>

<p>What kind of world are we leaving for our kids?</p>

<p>Wait... does Reddit hate kids or not?  Post a picture of your kid, and/or talk about being a parent.  You get: &quot;this isn&#39;t Facebook&quot; or people crying about &quot;overpopulation!&quot;  If you really believe that, go stand in front of an oncoming train.  Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll wait... </p>

<p>Still here?  That&#39;s exactly what I thought.</p>
