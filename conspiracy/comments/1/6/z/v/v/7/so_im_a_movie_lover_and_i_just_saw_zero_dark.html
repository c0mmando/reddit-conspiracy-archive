<p>It has a 95 out of 100 on metacritic. That is unheard of. You could say Im a movie nerd and Im telling you guys this film was completely unremarkable. The script and direction were not great, and Jessica Chastains performance, for which shes won wards for, is not good. Its almost painfully bad. The critics who gave it these 4 star reviews HAVE to have ulterior motives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it is propaganda.  They intentionally imply that torture lead to the assassination.  Even the CIA admitted this was not true.  Ironically the director claims they didn&#39;t want to &quot;white wash history.&quot;  Which implying torture is anything but a barbaric practice only the most fascist governments would be involved in.

<p>Until his assassination, Bin Laden was on the FBI 10 Most Wanted List, not for 9/11, which they had no proof he was responsible for but for the Embassy Bombings.</p>

<p>I put this movie in the same catagory as Flight 93 and World Trade Center. Pure Propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like how right now people are all saying it&#39;s just propaganda and made for political gain.</p>

<p>But what if this movie is exactly what it should be? It shows very brief cases of extreme torture over the 10 years before his death. The lengths our government went to find this one man. And probably all for nothing. The raid was probably executed exactly how it was in the movie, because Bin Laden wasn&#39;t there. I think the scene at the end showed that, they knew they&#39;d killed the wrong guy but they just needed her word that it was him. That&#39;s why the body was dumped in the ocean soon after. It was a realization moment for her though when she saw that no matter how hard she tried or fought for it, her lifes work was for nil. </p>

<p>They spoke about how she had been recruited right out of HS to work there (wtf why wasn&#39;t I recruited) which is absurd but part of her character. How this was the only case she ever worked. This was her life. She started out a naive little girl in the desert and left a hardened woman. But that&#39;s the world these people play in, and it&#39;s normal. The war mindset of humanity is hard to wrap my mind around sometimes. </p>

<p>American history X&#39;s moral was don&#39;t be a racist fuck.
Fight Club&#39;s moral was don&#39;t just settle for what floats your way.
And this movie could be an anti-war movie, but i cant for the life of me even remember her name right now so probably not. The seductive redhead. Not very many memorable parts, or lines, or speeches. Over all it felt kinda rushed and choppy. But it had to be released before interest died down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my 5 decades of living. One thing I found to be true majority of the time. If critics laud a movie. It&#39;s usually because the movie sucks, so Producers pay critics with kick backs to make it sound great. Hollywood is just as corrupt as news media.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t bother going to a moive that critics rave about. Save your $10 plus bucks and $5 for rental wait for it to come on cable tv in a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another good rule of thumb, every instance of marketing you see for a film should make your expectations go down more. I&#39;ve been watching media blitzes for movies for the past decade, and I&#39;ve yet to be wrong since. </p>

<p>For instance, the second Transformers movie? Right around the time I was in the Las Vegas airport and looked out over the desert to see a transformers ad taking up one whole side of the <a href="http://www.geeksofdoom.com/GoD/img/2009/06/2009-06-15-luxor_transformers.jpg">Luxor</a>(I swear to God that&#39;s not shopped) I knew for sure the movie was going to be an abomination. </p>

<p>So that should give you a measure of how good a movie is when it&#39;s paying to get mentioned at the Golden Globes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something with a coherent script that doesn&#39;t tie unrelated terrorist events together to move forward a plot that could have been tied up in like 45 minutes of run time? Take out all the CIA jargon, bullshit drama where people act like the most unprofessional idiots, seal team moments where they move at the speed of senior citizens, language accuracy (the least of my quams)</p>

<p>Look, the history behind Argo is a lot easier to research cause shit has been declassified. The movie never answers why the Iranians were/are pissed (look it up and you&#39;ll be shocked. The US Violated all sorts of international laws in Iran), takes all the credit away from the Canadians who basically came up with the entire idea and has the balls to say &quot;based on a true story&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;d be like Britain making a movie about the defeat of the Nazis where they took Berlin and called said the movie was based on a true story. And this crock of shit got Best Movie... Keep your explosions you condecending cunt, I want facts that aren&#39;t skewed to glorify America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I&#39;m not even a fan of Bigelow&#39;s directing style, and even I can say I was thoroughly entertained watching this movie. I was a smidge irritated at her shaky cam business, but that did not hinder my movie experience. I agree, I didn&#39;t think Chastain&#39;s performance was overwhelmingly good, but it certainly wasn&#39;t painfully bad either. With that being said, there were some parts that felt extremely forced. I would give it an 8/10. I hate being the one to say this, but giving a movie of this caliber a 4/10 is an extreme injustice, OR you just don&#39;t have a good taste in movies. What exactly didn&#39;t you like about this movie?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I liked it. I wasn&#39;t completely sure how pro-torture it was though; I thought it was more about that one woman driven to find OBL, even though her CIA bosses (and about everyone else) were against it. If the movie was propaganda about Bin Laden, the man would&#39;ve appeared in it for more than 2 seconds. In fact, I thought that OBL was almost irrelevant to the movies progress. It wasn&#39;t about him. It was about that one agents obsession.</p>

<p>Also about torture, in the movie torture didn&#39;t lead to Bin Laden. They got some information in the start, but I&#39;d be surprised if torture didn&#39;t get any information at all in real life. If you watched until end, the characters actually realize that they cannot torture any more.</p>

<p>Have you seen Bigelows previous movie, Hurt Locker? That was anti-war and also pretty good. </p>

Frost never asked a follow up question regarding the claim that Bin Laden was dead.[161] Her interview could later be viewed on BBC&#39;s website, although it was initially distorted by the BBC as her claim about Bin Laden&#39;s death was taken out. But, once people discovered this and started posting evidence on YouTube, the BBC replaced its version with the version that was originally aired on Al Jazeera.[162]</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if that was the case, in the <em>movie</em> torture played a minor part. If you think about it, it was more about the movies arc than finding OBL through torture. </p>

<p>At first the agent is kinda green, she&#39;s shaken by the torture. She starts to gather information. Becomes obsessed. Finds OBL without further torture (towards the end of the movie, the torture doesn&#39;t help, and then is ended.)</p>

<p>If the movie was pro-torture propaganda, torture would&#39;ve been the key to finding Bin Laden. </p>

<p>Additionally, I don&#39;t think that the movie portrayed CIA in <em>that</em> positive of a light. If it wasn&#39;t for that one lady agent, CIA would&#39;ve dismissed the leads to Bin Laden. </p>

<p>The sad thing about this is that Alex Jones and fellow conspiracy theorists should be making noise about the worst crime perpetrated by the US government and CIA: torture. Instead of 9/11 WTC 7 placards they should be demanding people to fall for torturing other human beings. I&#39;m sure Cheney and co. are at the moment having a laugh; not because they got away with 9/11, but because they got away with torture. All the while r/conspiracy (and lots of similar thinking people) are more concerned about WTC tower 7s fall speed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it was far from the heroics of Saving Private Ryan, and brought the ambiguous nature of modern wars to focus.

<p>I thought that the anti-war theme was quite clear, but whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoyed the movie. Torture is necessary in some circumstances and I fully support it. None of us will ever know how much was gained from the actual torturing that happened. The movie to me was more of a &quot;Here&#39;s why we don&#39;t allow torture any longer&quot; movie. They make sure they let you know that the key to his capture was intel that was found without even questioning a sole. I find this hard to believe and think that Hollywood denied that the torture worked to discourage it and get the public to be appalled with it as a method of information gathering. I know that the threat of torture would make me spill my soul. I&#39;m not afraid to admit that I despise being hurt and would do what was necessary to avoid it. Luckily I was/have never been in that situation though.</p>

I think the movie ensured that you appalled torture, but I think it was to stop it and not support it. By making it sure they point out that it was/is unsuccessful. </p>
