       It has a 95 out of 100 on metacritic. That is unheard of. You could say Im a movie nerd and Im telling you guys this film was completely unremarkable. The script and direction were not great, and Jessica Chastains performance, for which shes won wards for, is not good. Its almost painfully bad. The critics who gave it these 4 star reviews HAVE to have ulterior motives.

       As someone who's seen it I came away sickened from the torture scenes. Personally I'd hope anyone who has seen it would be less likely to support "enhanced interrogation" when they see how barbarous it is.

       Humans have loved torture, murder, guns(swords), drug use, alcohol, cigarettes(hookah), degenerate sex, and car chases(Chariots?) forever. Look at any culture that has existed and those basic trends all apply. We are terrible animals that do terrible things to each other all the time. But we also laugh, love, create art and music and all those things are celebrated in Hollywood to.

       Im almost convinced at this point now that this movie is complete propaganda to stray people away from the truth behind 9/11 and Bin Ladens death. The movie also is VERY pro torture its ridiculous.

       The Hurt Locker was easily as terrible and she was even sued by the guy the film was supposedly based on. And then of course the studios made a big deal out of suing those who pirated it.

       Of course it is propaganda.  They intentionally imply that torture lead to the assassination.  Even the CIA admitted this was not true.  Ironically the director claims they didn't want to "white wash history."  Which implying torture is anything but a barbaric practice only the most fascist governments would be involved in. YOU ARE WHITEWASHING IT.

       Movies make it 'cool' to be all macho,super opinionated &amp; jaded. That way it keeps everyone indivdualized &amp; separated.

       You are now a powerless little peon (even if you are a tough guy), because all the 'cool' people definitely are NOT going to unite with you.

       I've been saying that for a while. Psychopaths run this world and part of their agenda is normalizing the psychopath in the social arena, the better to ingratiate themselves with the general public.

       Being a fellow movie lover I completely agree. I went into it thinking it may be a good movie, despite the obnoxious nationalism/propaganda. But it was really just a sub par film. Not good at all.

       I tried to watch this movie just to see what kind of propaganda they were trying to put out there. They know the majority of americans are fucking idiots and will believe that the events in this movie are fact.

       Until his assassination, Bin Laden was on the FBI 10 Most Wanted List, not for 9/11, which they had no proof he was responsible for but for the Embassy Bombings.

       I put this movie in the same catagory as Flight 93 and World Trade Center. Pure Propaganda.

       it's interesting that movies such as American History X and Fight Club became cult hits over time and were initially chastised with terrible reviews

       Like how right now people are all saying it's just propaganda and made for political gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if this movie is exactly what it should be? It shows very brief cases of extreme torture over the 10 years before his death. The lengths our government went to find this one man. And probably all for nothing. The raid was probably executed exactly how it was in the movie, because Bin Laden wasn't there. I think the scene at the end showed that, they knew they'd killed the wrong guy but they just needed her word that it was him. That's why the body was dumped in the ocean soon after. It was a realization moment for her though when she saw that no matter how hard she tried or fought for it, her lifes work was for nil.
      </p>
      <p>
       They spoke about how she had been recruited right out of HS to work there (wtf why wasn't I recruited) which is absurd but part of her character. How this was the only case she ever worked. This was her life. She started out a naive little girl in the desert and left a hardened woman. But that's the world these people play in, and it's normal. The war mindset of humanity is hard to wrap my mind around sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       American history X's moral was don't be a racist fuck.
Fight Club's moral was don't just settle for what floats your way.
And this movie could be an anti-war movie, but i cant for the life of me even remember her name right now so probably not. The seductive redhead. Not very many memorable parts, or lines, or speeches. Over all it felt kinda rushed and choppy. But it had to be released before interest died down.

       In my 5 decades of living. One thing I found to be true majority of the time. If critics laud a movie. It's usually because the movie sucks, so Producers pay critics with kick backs to make it sound great. Hollywood is just as corrupt as news media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't bother going to a moive that critics rave about. Save your $10 plus bucks and $5 for rental wait for it to come on cable tv in a year.

       Another good rule of thumb, every instance of marketing you see for a film should make your expectations go down more. I've been watching media blitzes for movies for the past decade, and I've yet to be wrong since.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, the second Transformers movie? Right around the time I was in the Las Vegas airport and looked out over the desert to see a transformers ad taking up one whole side of the

        Luxor
       </a>
       (I swear to God that's not shopped) I knew for sure the movie was going to be an abomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that should give you a measure of how good a movie is when it's paying to get mentioned at the Golden Globes.

       I don' know.. ..  A lot of shitty movies get rave reviews now-a-days. It is almost as thought the critics have been bought off... It is like they want to make money off of the movies.

       Something with a coherent script that doesn't tie unrelated terrorist events together to move forward a plot that could have been tied up in like 45 minutes of run time? Take out all the CIA jargon, bullshit drama where people act like the most unprofessional idiots, seal team moments where they move at the speed of senior citizens, language accuracy (the least of my quams)
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, the history behind Argo is a lot easier to research cause shit has been declassified. The movie never answers why the Iranians were/are pissed (look it up and you'll be shocked. The US Violated all sorts of international laws in Iran), takes all the credit away from the Canadians who basically came up with the entire idea and has the balls to say "based on a true story".
      </p>
      <p>
       That'd be like Britain making a movie about the defeat of the Nazis where they took Berlin and called said the movie was based on a true story. And this crock of shit got Best Movie... Keep your explosions you condecending cunt, I want facts that aren't skewed to glorify America.

       Honestly, I'm not even a fan of Bigelow's directing style, and even I can say I was thoroughly entertained watching this movie. I was a smidge irritated at her shaky cam business, but that did not hinder my movie experience. I agree, I didn't think Chastain's performance was overwhelmingly good, but it certainly wasn't painfully bad either. With that being said, there were some parts that felt extremely forced. I would give it an 8/10. I hate being the one to say this, but giving a movie of this caliber a 4/10 is an extreme injustice, OR you just don't have a good taste in movies. What exactly didn't you like about this movie?

       I liked it. I wasn't completely sure how pro-torture it was though; I thought it was more about that one woman driven to find OBL, even though her CIA bosses (and about everyone else) were against it. If the movie was propaganda about Bin Laden, the man would've appeared in it for more than 2 seconds. In fact, I thought that OBL was almost irrelevant to the movies progress. It wasn't about him. It was about that one agents obsession.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also about torture, in the movie torture didn't lead to Bin Laden. They got some information in the start, but I'd be surprised if torture didn't get any information at all in real life. If you watched until end, the characters actually realize that they cannot torture any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen Bigelows previous movie, Hurt Locker? That was anti-war and also pretty good.

         On 2 November 2007, Bhutto participated in an interview with David Frost on Al Jazeera, stating Osama Bin Laden had been murdered by Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who is one of the men convicted of kidnapping and killing U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl. Frost never asked a follow up question regarding the claim that Bin Laden was dead.[161] Her interview could later be viewed on BBC's website, although it was initially distorted by the BBC as her claim about Bin Laden's death was taken out. But, once people discovered this and started posting evidence on YouTube, the BBC replaced its version with the version that was originally aired on Al Jazeera.[162]

       9/11 and in case you didn't notice it was Saddam that was overthrown.  Why wait 8 years until Obama gets in before getting Osama the mad tunnel dweller?

       Even if that was the case, in the
       <em>
        movie
       </em>
       torture played a minor part. If you think about it, it was more about the movies arc than finding OBL through torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first the agent is kinda green, she's shaken by the torture. She starts to gather information. Becomes obsessed. Finds OBL without further torture (towards the end of the movie, the torture doesn't help, and then is ended.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If the movie was pro-torture propaganda, torture would've been the key to finding Bin Laden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I don't think that the movie portrayed CIA in
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       positive of a light. If it wasn't for that one lady agent, CIA would've dismissed the leads to Bin Laden.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad thing about this is that Alex Jones and fellow conspiracy theorists should be making noise about the worst crime perpetrated by the US government and CIA: torture. Instead of 9/11 WTC 7 placards they should be demanding people to fall for torturing other human beings. I'm sure Cheney and co. are at the moment having a laugh; not because they got away with 9/11, but because they got away with torture. All the while r/conspiracy (and lots of similar thinking people) are more concerned about WTC tower 7s fall speed.

       Well, it was far from the heroics of Saving Private Ryan, and brought the ambiguous nature of modern wars to focus. You can't know or see your enemy, meanwhile the main character goes a bit mental and cant relate to his family any more, but just wants to go back to get himself blown to pieces.

       I was in an elevator today, two middle agers get in, mention the new Texas shooting, and seriously... start blaming video games.
      </p>
      <p>
       I immediately asked the guy (sorry it was a man and woman, co workers, around 45 - 50 yrs old) if he like Zero Dark Thirty, to which the guy became wide eyed, beaming. "Oh yeah, it was awesome!" The lady looked at me sideways, but then said "Oh yeah?" and disregarded me when hearing his answer.

       The elevator opens and I just said, "yeah, it's video games that create violence."

       I enjoyed the movie. Torture is necessary in some circumstances and I fully support it. None of us will ever know how much was gained from the actual torturing that happened. The movie to me was more of a "Here's why we don't allow torture any longer" movie. They make sure they let you know that the key to his capture was intel that was found without even questioning a sole. I find this hard to believe and think that Hollywood denied that the torture worked to discourage it and get the public to be appalled with it as a method of information gathering. I know that the threat of torture would make me spill my soul. I'm not afraid to admit that I despise being hurt and would do what was necessary to avoid it. Luckily I was/have never been in that situation though.

       Aren't most Americans? I am not sure what that has to do with me thinking that torture has its place in gathering information. I hope the down votes are because I admitted that I would divulge information if tortured. I know it isn't the heroic thing to say and I hope I am wrong, but I plan for the worst and hope for the best.

       Yes.   It was just a curious way to behave.  It just made me think of someone whose (ancestral) country was currently being invaded by America or something and was self-compensating or over rationalizing or something.

       The down votes are because you are a troll.

       Honestly not sure how you get that. I consider a troll someone that goes above and beyond to harass the OP. I only stated that I enjoyed the movie, as many others did. I think the movie ensured that you appalled torture, but I think it was to stop it and not support it. By making it sure they point out that it was/is unsuccessful.

       I guess being older than the average redditor I don't understand the difference between trolling and having a discussion.

       was initially going to up vote you, but then I read the rest of your comment. Terrible grammar aside did you even see the movie?

       And so it's okay for America to embrace those things. Nevermind all that nonsense about holding ourselves to a better standard, that's what we tell the immigrants so they'll behave when they get here. USA! USA!

       The script was plenty coherent and the events weren't unrelated.  Bullshit drama? You don't like drama in a movie? So you don't want substance just Transformers or something?

       As for Argo that is completely off topic I don't know why you brought it up.
