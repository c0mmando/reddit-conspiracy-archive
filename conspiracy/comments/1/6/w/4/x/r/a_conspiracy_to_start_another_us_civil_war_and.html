        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Private interests are drumming up military support for a possible violent overthrow of the united states government. They completed phase 1 in 2010, during the mid-season elections. The Koch-funded Tea Party movement managed to install sympathizers and cronies into capital hill, but easily-manipulable politicians have been sliding into place since 1988 (including a sitting Supreme Court Justice). Those interests worked to keep the country in a recession by blocking all attempts to work on a solution; recessions are good for business and bad for employees. This created an environment where the populace was angry, and they needed something to take it out on.</p>

<p>Cue Fox News and the private corporation propoganda wing (with folks like Limbaugh, Alex Jones). Fox News was founded (as we know) by two real scumbags; Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes. Ailes is pertinent to what we&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>In 1988, he was involved with campaigning for the George HW Bush presidency, and got wrapped up in a lawsuit regarding illegal electioneering practices; essentially, a group called NSPAC released an ad maligning Dukakis, and the Dems sued, claiming that the Bush campaign illegally coordinated with NSPAC to produce the ad. The FEC eventually reached a stalemate 3-3 vote on the charges, essentially allowing Ailes a pass. It is pretty well-accepted, however, that the ads were produced by a man named Floyd Brown.</p>

<p>That name may not mean anything to you, but follow me here. Floyd Brown is a cofounder of the Citizens United SuperPAC, which we may recognize as the defendant in the infamous Citizens United v FEC decision in 2010. Here&#39;s a fun fact, and something I did not see come up often during the court proceedings: Citizens United, and Floyd Brown in particular, are considered key players in helping Clarence Thomas get appointed to the Supreme Court. Guess who was the deciding vote in that decision...? Of note as well is that Floyd Brown is an acknowledged Freemason... </p>

<p>Now, Brown worked closely with a man named David Bossie, who produced <em>another</em> ad that was the subject of major controversy. Bossie got appointed to an investigative committee in 1997; he was charged with uncovering whether or not the Clintons were guilty of illegal campaign financing (it should be noted that the man who appointed Bossie was later found guilty of accepting illegal campaign funds from the <em>Pakistani secret police</em>.)</p>

<p>Bossie was fired from this committee for tampering with evidence; he oversaw selective and fraudulent editing of Clinton recordings to make the family and one of their staffers, Hubbell, seem worse than they really were. Bossie resigned for the committee after partisan pressure from none other than... Newt Gingrich. </p>

<p>(On a side-note, the Representative responsible for appointing Bossie, a republican congressman from Indiana named Dan Burton, is rife with his own mis-steps. Apart from accepting campaign funds from a front for the Pakistani secret police (officially, the court couldn&#39;t prove he knew the source, but it is something to keep in the back of your head). He also went on a private golf game with the CEO of AT&amp;T only weeks after being given authority over $5bil in government telecommunications contracts... Even more, he only won his seat after some pretty heavy gerrymandering of his district in 1980)</p>

<p>David Bossie is currently a boardmember (and President!) of Citizens United, who famously backed the very same Gingrich in the 2012 campaign. Yes, you read that right; a man (two men, actually) tied up in FEC investigations for illegal electioneering and forced to resign over illegal evidence tampering... is now heading an organization that won the right to essentially carry on with those same activities, made possible by a Supreme Court Justice that was aided in installation by <em>that very same organization</em>.</p>

<p>Now we return to Roger Ailes. Now, it&#39;s generally accepted that the Republican Party owns the Fox News Channel, or it is considered a wing of the party. I posit that it&#39;s actually the reverse; the current Republican Party is owned by Fox News and the interests utilizing it. You see, Ailes and Murdoch run the propoganda arm of these private corporations. </p>

<p>All we need to do is look at the narrative Fox News has been pushing the last several years; words like &quot;socialism&quot;, &quot;fascism&quot;, &quot;tyranny&quot;, &quot;communism&quot; get thrown around and have become interchangeable words. Unfavorable comparisons to Hitler, Stalin, Mao. Connections to terrorists and Jews. Now, place this in the context of the environment we&#39;re in; a terrible recession, loaded with desperate citizens looking to something, anything, to vent their anger on. And vent they have; Obama has received death threats, jokes about assassination abound, a good 47% of this country is solidly against the president in a violent, irrational way.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s take a look at the NRA. The CEO is a man named Wayne LaPierre, as I&#39;m sure you all know. LaPierre used to be a political consultant before becoming a leading figure in the NRA. George Bush famously resigned his lifetime NRA membership after LaPierre compared all federal agents (incited by the disastrous ATF bungle at Waco) to jackbooted Nazi thug stormtroopers. </p>

<p>Well, the NRA was instrumental in taking away enforcement authority from the ATF, limiting their ability to act within their charter. I&#39;m not sure how you feel about the Daily Show, but here&#39;s a pretty concise summary of how they were involved in that. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/jon-stewart-nra-limiting-atf-law-enforcement_n_2495301.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/jon-stewart-nra-limiting-atf-law-enforcement_n_2495301.html</a></p>

<p>LaPierre also claimed, after Obama&#39;s first victory in 2008, that Obama&#39;s plan was to take away everyone&#39;s guns. It never happened (in fact, Obama made no mention of even wanting that), but people reacted anyway. Gun sales shot up (coincidence? Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if LaPierre is getting royalty checks from gun manufacturers).</p>

<p>So now we have a situation where people are 1) desperate 2) angry at the government, who they believe to be despotic, fascistic, tyrannical, and hostile to their own person interests 3) stocking up firearms and 4) more or less free from ATF interference.</p>

<p>Flashforward to 2012. First, it&#39;s Aurora. Then, the failed Portland shooting. Then, the disastrous, absolutely terrible tragedy at Newtown. I know the common narrative here is that the government staged it to gain support for a gun ban, but think on this...</p>

<p>What if the shootings were staged by, if not the NRA, other private interest groups, in order to flare up the debate over gun control? We have ample historical evidence that private corporations are not above funding terrorist cells, foreign paramilitary groups, or killing private citizens to advance business interests. They know they have the mind of the American people already flung up in a frenzy over federal overreach, and the 2012 presidential/congressional bid didn&#39;t go as well as they thought (despite voter suppression attempts and some pretty heavy redistricting). So they stage a major disaster to actually get Obama to do what they&#39;ve been claiming he wanted to do, and in the wake of that their propoganda arms get to work with &#39;THEY ARE OUR RIGHT, HITLER TOOK THE GUNS BEFORE TAKING GERMANY, FASCISTS ALWAYS TAKE THE GUNS, 1776 WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IF ANYONE TOUCHES OUR GUNS&#39;. </p>

<p>So, now we have a violently angry, armed populace, free from ATF meddling, primed to equate the federal government with tyranny, hearing words like &#39;only tyrants take guns&#39; &#39;they are our right&#39; etc. There have already been loud invocations for murder, and outright warfare. Those sentiments are echoed in the fringe.</p>

<p>The only thing left to do is hope the American people connect the dots and revolt, violently, to protect the right they&#39;ve been told is so important to their well-being. </p>

<p>And everyone is eating it up. They&#39;re buying the &#39;freedom&#39; rhetoric, because America is <em>all about</em> freedom. They&#39;re buying the anti-government rhetoric, becomes times are tough (despite the recession being caused largely by negligent and irresponsible private interests, possibly on purpose to foment the proper environment for revolution).</p>

<p>Moreover, they&#39;ve killed two birds with one stone; not only do they have a fiercely loyal, violent, hair-trigger base supporting them, they have also created an anti-plutocracy as a response to their machinations. This <em>guarantees</em> that there will be two sides in this war, and both believe they are fighting for their freedom. This ensures that each side will fight bitterly, and to the end; any form of quartering or concession means <em>losing freedom and liberty</em>, something Americans will DIE TO PROTECT. We are desperate, hungry, and broke; meanwhile, these businessmen continue to get richer and richer (recessions are GOOD for businessmen).</p>

<p>They are banking on the hope that the US government will hesitate to use lethal force against its own citizens (and if they <em>do</em> use lethal force... hell, those folks will be hailed as martyrs for the cause. It&#39;s a win-win). </p>

<p>This is how we are all being manipulated by massive business titans into fighting and killing each other, so that the remaining fat cats can divide up the scraps and rule as kings over a ruined wasteland of a divided nation.</p>

<p>So I ask you... is your hatred for the government so overwhelming you would sacrifice your agency, and allow yourself to be played like toys for the sake of private enterprise? Or do you value your <em>own freedom</em>, and making <em>your own</em> choices more?</p>

<p>edit: as a side point to the failure of the 2012 election cycle, many people might counter that 2016 is the election cycle that counts. Sure, but think on this; the fringe running the show in 2012 drummed up their numbers by playing to hate, racism, and otherness. They were counting on the support of the extreme and/or religoous right, spurred on by racial or economic outrage. Basically, the Fringe was their bread and butter. They know that minority numbers are growing quickly, and that the vote of the extreme right white-man is no longer a surety in the future. Texas may soon become a blue state; if that happens, playing to the Fringe is no longer a winning strategy. So 2012 was more or less their last and best hope of making a strong showing. Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t strong enough. Which is why they&#39;re moving to Plan B; civil war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, have you ever heard of the Royal Institute for International Affairs or the Council on Foreign Relations or the Trilateral Commission?   Probably all a lot bigger in influence than Builderberg.  It&#39;s like they focus on Builderberg to keep the focus away from these other, much bigger, much more powerful groups.

    <div class="md"><p>There are probably even more powerful groups that we don&#39;t know about and that are never followed in the media.</p>

<p>As David Rockefeller said to the Trilateral Commission in 1991: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for years the press said nothing about them. What groups exist today that remain unmentioned while the Bliderbergers, CFR, and Trilateral Commission are now just decoys to keep people like you and me from noticing where the real power is. </p>

<p>Sounds like it.  Sounds like you don&#39;t have a clue how many high-level government officials actually attend those meetings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure you really understand the heart of the issue I&#39;m driving at.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to clear government officials of any wrongdoing. Instead I&#39;m positing that everything we&#39;ve seen so far has all been orchestrated by <em>private</em> groups to further <em>private</em>,  <em>business</em> interests. Any government official in bed with the Bilderberger&#39;s aren&#39;t there to advance <em>government</em> interests.</p>

<p>As I said, business sympathizers have been slid into position frequently enough already.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between Organizational Affiliation and devious intent. It is <em>true</em> that there are governmental officials there. but the implication of your comment is that they are there to further <em>government</em> interests, by virtue of their organizational affiliation. Is there proof of that, or are you running off the idea that &#39;government = bad&#39;? Who&#39;s to say that government officials haven&#39;t been installed by private interests?</p>

<p>When the foundation of your house is stricken by termites... do you destroy the foundation?</p>

<p>edit: I also wish to clarify that I do not believe the government is necessarily &#39;the good guy&#39; in this scenario, or even a saint in general. The current administration, and pretty much every one before it, has been rife with mis-steps and errors, and have made many mistakes. Just like every government to ever exist, it is not perfect. The people in charge of this plan are counting on these blunders; every single one gets taken, expanded, exaggerated, blown out of proportion, and twisted into a validation for all anti-government sentiments.</p>

<p>It&#39;s as simple as going through common conspiracy theories or criticisms of the government, and finding how many of them are <em>demonstrably</em> false or exaggerated, and then comparing that to how many people <em>believe</em> those theories or criticisms. </p>

<p>People are sheep. There is no argument from me here. But the black sheep, the sheep who fancy themselves smarter, feel they&#39;ve identified the shepherd. Truth be told, that shepherd they are rebelling against is a straw man that the real shepherd is driving you towards. And when he&#39;s done, he will skin you alive and sell you to the highest bidder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In part, yes, it was.   Many of the attendees of the Constitutional Conventions were men who had been given incentives to create a new system of control over the burgeoning colonies.  That is why they began passing laws to curb criticism of the government, as early as the second President...the system was corrupt from day one.  It was about the same thing &quot;government&quot; has always been about -  professional scam artists making excuses to leech enormous amounts of wealth off of productive people.  Everyone else who attended was basically caught up in their myths.  </p>

<p>What they came up with is a document that says &quot;here are the human rights our organization will NOT violate.&quot;  It left out a couple (i.e., PROPERTY rights).  And now they&#39;re violating the ones they said they wouldn&#39;t violate, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if I&#39;ve got you right, you&#39;re saying government is a puppet being controlled by private interests? So rather than attack the source of the problem (the hand up the ass), you spend your time fighting a sock puppet?</p>

<p>So private interests have infiltrated government and turned it into a distraction arm, you&#39;re admitting to knowing this, and still you choose to attack the government?</p>

<p>Again, this doesn&#39;t change my argument; you&#39;re just doing what those private interests want you to do. You&#39;re attacking their carrot on a stick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s get it straight - my target is the very mindframe that allows a society to work like this.  All interests are &quot;private&quot; in some sense - the problem is when one group of private interests begins to run roughshod over all the other private interests, as you say.  </p>

<p>&quot;Government&quot; just gets a lot of flack because they&#39;re doing so much of the dirty work.  It&#39;s not a type of institution that should even exist - it&#39;s the most oppressive tool of those private interests.  You have to take the bullet out before the wound will heal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And they have a politically stable government, a strong central economy that is supporting the countries around it, a booming export market, and a high happiness index. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have a mean (effective) income tax rate of what... 40% on the low incomers, 10-15% on the higher-level brackets?... and we are rife with political partisanship, economic instability, growing wealth divide, diminishing civil rights, and a general hatred for each other...</p>

<p>This is only an acceptable example if you can show how income tax is equatable with diminished civil rights. As it is, the tax rate of a country and the overall well-being of that country do not seem to be reliable indicators of each other.</p>

<p>What&#39;s correlated is a tax rate and the rate of decrease of the overall well-being of the country.  You took calculus, I hope - you understand the difference between a function and its derivative?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You greatly underestimate what it is, exactly, taxation is meant to be. It sounds to me like Germany is a pretty strong example that taxes don&#39;t kill economic systems.</p>

<p>As to your previous point... &#39;chances are good their economy is just better overall and can handle the extra load&#39;</p>

<p>This is a central tenet of Keynesian economics. When the economy is strong, increase taxation and decrease government spending. When the economy is weak, decrease taxation and increase government spending. If anything, Germany is an example of why Keynesian economics is the dominant school of thought, and that taxation is good for an economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice theory, but does it really matter?  The current administration, like the last, is no friend to liberty or the constitution.  Their actions are enough for me to believe that they should be removed from power.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t condone violence and I don&#39;t encourage anyone to take up arms for a revolution or whatever you want to call it.  However, I do realize how volatile the current political situation in America is, and because of this I do encourage my friends &amp; family to be prepared for the worst.  I don&#39;t want to go to war.  I don&#39;t want to kill anyone.  But, if events were to happen that put the people I love in danger I would do my best to defend them.  </p>

<p>I am neither right, nor left.  First and foremost, I consider myself a Christian.  Try as they may, I am not particularly provoked by likes of FOX or any other quasi-conservative/Christian vehicles.  Despite my love of the Constitution and my longing for my country to return to its wisdom I believe it was more than well-thought-out rules that made this country great.  I believe it was the American spirit, and when I say spirit, I really mean the typical God-fearing spirit that permeated the country for a long stint of our history.</p>

<p>Whether or not you agree is not an issue as I am merely offering my point of view.  But, my spiritual beliefs have &quot;further-reaching&quot; consequences for my view of what&#39;s to come for my country and the world.  I believe the outline offered in this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/161638610X/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;me=&amp;amp;seller=">book</a> to be legitimate.  Nevertheless, I <em>feel</em> something nasty coming for the US.  In the thick of this nastiness there will need to be some light.  If I am alive and able I will do my best to be apart of that light.  I will not be going on some crusade against the atheists.  I will not be fanning the flames.  I guess I don&#39;t really know what I will do until the time comes, but whatever it is, it won&#39;t be rushing to stand in line behind whatever tyrant wants to rule the ashes.</p>

Certain political con artists (cough alex jones cough) have been building up a narrative about the guns like you where saying and now that the people support gun regulation (recent poll said 9/10 Americans) the government has no choice but to fulfil his predictions, or at least to make moves that can be spun by jones and crew to fit his predictions.  Don&#39;t forget that the military industrial complex wants to keep selling guns in America, also they want the American people armed to deter the ever growing enemies abroad...</p>

<p>Rep Nolan (D-MN) said, “Chris, I think it would be a mistake, however, to underestimate the kind of toxic effect that the NRA is having. I have never, ever in all my life feared for my security, and I’m not fearful of it now. But I’m a little more than I ever had been before. We’ve been getting a lot of not very thinly veiled threats and calls into my office. You know, things like, ‘you tell Nolan he better watch his back. Nobody has actually come out and said they’re gunning for me, but the messages are quite angry, vitriolic, and a little bit frightening to people at my front desk who have been taking the calls. So, I’m a little nervous about it. I’ve never been nervous before. They’re very toxic in the effect they’re having on the American public.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are interested in corporate controlled right wing conspiracy research, I recommend <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/554986.The_Family">&quot;The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power&quot;</a> by Jeff Sharlet.  It came out a few years ago and got a bit of media attention, but the &quot;liberal media&quot; only wanted to focus on people from the book who were caught up in sex scandals and didn&#39;t touch any of the very, very, very interesting things covered in the book.</p>

<p>A quick summary:</p>

<p>The founder of Goodwill Industries, Abraham Vereide, got together with business, political, and religious leaders in the 1930&#39;s to fight against FDR&#39;s &quot;New Deal&quot; and all the populist movements of that decade because they were hurting their profits.  They formed a secretive group called &quot;The Fellowship&quot; in 1935, founded on the philosophy that helping the poor has gotten us nowhere, so instead everyone should be &quot;encouraged&quot; to do everything in their power to help the wealthy and then blessings would trickle down to everyone else.  </p>

<p>They have been involved in many things over the years; helping Nazis, supporting foreign dictators, looking the other way during genocides, picking apart the American political system, and a whole bunch of other nasty things.  I don&#39;t want to speculate too much on why they do these things, but the one common thing tying all their activities together is money.  </p>

<p>If interested in hearing more, ask me some specific questions and I&#39;ll share what I know, I have been studying this group heavily for more than a year now.  The group has a very colorful history and is now one of the most powerful networks of elites in the world (though far from being alone). </p>

<p>To get you started, here are a few links:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYeGR7O1lKI">One of a handful of news segments about the group</a></p>

<p><a href="http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/damnation/jesus-plus-nothing-minus-somalia/">An excerpt from The Family</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.insider-magazine.com/christianmafia.htm">A frightening conspiracy author&#39;s research into the group</a></p>

<p>I keep trying to call attention to the group in this subreddit; it&#39;s actually what brought me to this sub.  I am pointing you in this direction because much of what you posted overlaps with this group.  If you know about the &quot;Business Plot&quot; coup plan of 1933... The Fellowship was something of a plan B for that, many of the same people were involved.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would also like to add that I believe the Branch Davidians, and the incident at the Mt. Carmel compound outside of Waco, were actually the first attempts at forming a paramilitary fringe revolutionary group. Alex Jones began being who he is by criticizing the ATF response to these &#39;peaceful&#39; (demonstrably false: read about Koresh&#39;s history with the son of the group&#39;s founder. His name was George Roden, and there is some serious movie potential there) people, and the NRA&#39;s ability to gut the ATF through legislative lobbying (see the link above) was made possible by the outrage spurred by the incident. These interests knew that if they wanted to try it again, they had to make sure the ATF would not interfere.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a lot of solid evidence that this is the case, but Benjamin Roden, the founder of the Branch Davidians, worked for an oil company in Odessa, Texas. I can&#39;t find anything about who it was he worked for, but it is an angle I am looking into. I freely admit that it is likely not to go anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a full blown civil war you&#39;d have an economic collapse. An inability to transport and trade goods nationally and internationally, even if you can find the workers to produce them. This harms all business interests. </p>

<p>I doubt any corporation would foment a civil war. I don&#39;t doubt political interests might, because they feed of businesses (taxes and bribes) and don&#39;t see the bigger economic picture. I believe a corporation would benefit from a coup, but definitely not a civil war.</p>

<p>In any conflict people will pick sides and will attempt to co-opt certain factions and control them. But in a civil war things are too dynamic and everything is subject to your &quot;soldiers&quot; wishes, to a certain extent.</p>

<p>In the end, I believe what you are uncovering is infighting between the elite. Remember, even Hitler had Nazis who tried to kill him, as did Stalin, and even the monarchs of Europe had siblings who tried to take power violently.</p>

<p>The coup already happened. The dollar is headed for a massive crash regardless, all that can be controlled is the speed with which it arrives. If Corporate decides the time is beneficial to them, and all of their ducks are in a row, you can bet the dollar would crash the next morning. </p>

<p>And WHEN the dollar crashes, you can bet the Corporate players in charge will be well positioned to profit from the resulting black market of guns, food, heating oils, and other sundry goods.

A currency can collapse but businesses can continue to operate if the modes of production are intact. They can just use another currency, work off credit, etc., until something is stabilized.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah so? The feds deserve it. I can think of no more likely yet favorable outcome for American society. Let the feds and tea partier nuts kill each other and fuck them. Both sides will be weakened dramatically and ultimately the feds will win. </p>

<p>But will the feds be strong enough to keep together non-party groups that want to secede? If the feds become weak enough it might even be worth it for them to let certain areas secede as neutrals so they won&#39;t have to deal with them. The idea there would be to annex them later when the feds become stronger and recover from defeating the militant secessionists.</p>

<p>Civil war in the US is inevitable. This country has shit all over it&#39;s founding and unifying principles and is held together now by nothing more than force and economic self interest. Since that economic self interest is being eroded more and more that leaves the government with force and oppression alone to hold the nation together. In that circumstance I would personally rather it fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can&#39;t be avoided. If it is avoided the only outcome left is a boot stamping on a human face forever. Reform in the US is impossible. If you don&#39;t believe me ask some of the Occupy Wallstreet people what they accomplished and how much pepper spray they had to eat for it.</p>

<p>The fact is the seeds of this civil war were planted in the last civil war. Lincoln never should have given so much power to businesses but since he did a nobility was created through business. As our empire grew these nouveau riche aristocrats gained more and more power. </p>

<p>Businesses connected with the growing empire grew so large and rich that nothing could stop them. They began to manipulate and scheme to gain still more power and in doing so took over the government. Now the elected offices in the US are distributed by businesses much as the roman imperial office was once distributed by the praetorian guards.</p>

<p>Factions formed and now those factions have to fight it out and frankly both factions are hostile to the common people of this nation. Both factions are leading us to ruin and so it is better than both factions work to obliterate each other. My hope is that while that is occurring or shortly afterwards a body of people can break off and make their own state. Since both factions are wicked the only real option is to produce and foster a third faction which can be made strong by feeding on the weaknesses of the two warring factions.</p>

<p>But enough of my postulations. I&#39;m curious how do you envision such a peace as you desire? </p>

<p>This has never been true. The moment the government has the power to compel people to do things against their wishes it is the people who become the pawns.</p>

<p>I think you are pretty damn naive about human history frankly. But more to the point there is no way in the world that we are going to be able to purge corporate interests from the government. The corporations are the government now. I&#39;m not blaming Obama or democrats for this. It has been going for awhile and both parties are guilty.</p>

<p>The biggest point about which you are being naive is your whole, &quot;WE&quot; ideal. What is this we? I hate the feds, their spying, their lies, their murders but a lot of poeple love them and support them. Especially if their particular political party is in power. I have no common cause with those fucking statists who support Obama&#39;s MURDER of US citizens. Nor do I have common cause for supporters of our unjust occupations of foreign nations!</p>

<p>But more to the point where was the WE when the poor started to rise up against Wall Street and both parties worked to shut the movement down and to put the people back in their places. Where is the WE while bankers can shipwreck the economy and get paid for it by US tax payers? Where is the we when the government panders to illegal immigrants to give them citizenship so that whichever party can give them automatic citizenship can gain more supporters and votes. Where is the WE when politicians talk about gay marriage is the civil rights issue of the century even though people go to fucking jail for smoking flowers!</p>

<p>There is no we! This country is horribly fragmented and each fragment is played against each other in the age old game of politics. There is nothing new under the sun man and this whole fucking game has been replayed in countless polities and always with the same outcome.</p>

<p>One more thing. We are all pawns in someone else&#39;s game. That is the lot of being a poor person (as in not a rich aristocrat) in this land. We have no agency and each day we must play the games that are controlled and benefit the upper classes. The only possibilities I can see is to gain control of an aristocratic faction of my own, walk off the gameboard entirely (off the grid) or bring my fist down on the board as hard as I can and knock over enough pieces that the game has to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welp.. I see it like this. I have been making plans for this civil war for 20 years. That is how long I have known it would come. I figured it out back in high school. </p>

<p>I have learned how to live and work in communities with my neighbors and we will support each other through whatever disasters must come. I am positioned to be a survivor. While these snakes destroy each other  I will stay out of their way and grow my family and circle of friends. </p>

<p>Frankly I don&#39;t give one single squirt of shit about the urban US population. Why should I care about people whose greedy lifestyles have brought all this fucking ruin on us in the first place? The young of my generation sought wealth and so they moved to the cities and as far as I am concerned they can die in them. For myself and mine I sought survival and sustainability. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t force people to vote for corporate candidate after corporate candidate to rule and ruin our nation. I even warned people and suggested they look into reformers. They laughed at me. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t force people to live lifestyles totally dependent on food stamps or grocery stores. I warned people to plant their own gardens and to have a source of fresh water. They laughed at me.</p>

<p>But if I have done my work correctly then it will be me laughing in the end. Well maybe not laughing. I don&#39;t take any joy in this shit but I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to stick my neck out to stop an inevitable civil war brought on by greed and a population of fucking sheep. When the tea party is dead and the feds are weak I&#39;ll be ready to rebuild from the ashes. That is the best I can do. The fire is coming and nothing will stop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elite don&#39;t control the government. They have a heavy hand of influence, that&#39;s for sure, but total control eludes them. No matter what, there will <em>always</em> be forces within the government (no matter how few) working against their interests. We&#39;re looking at Elizabeth Warren, Barney Frank, Al Franken, Alan Grayson... If they controlled it, don&#39;t you think things would look a lot different? Would Warren have been voted in at all?</p>

<p>If we oppose the US government outright with no quarter (i.e.; &quot;the government is bad <em>no matter what</em>. The word &quot;government&quot; is synonymous with &quot;tyranny&quot;. Taxation is theft and murder.&quot;), we are attacking a cardboard cutout created by the elite. They&#39;re training us like attack dogs; they create a caricature, a boogeyman, an exaggerated foe for us to attack and rail against and hate and burn in effigy. That way, when the war comes, we&#39;ll be too blinded by conditioning to recognize the foe for what he <em>really</em> is.</p>

<p>Flashforward to 2012. First, it&#39;s Aurora. Then, the failed Portland shooting. Then, the disastrous, absolutely terrible tragedy at Newtown. I know the common narrative here is that the government staged it to gain support for a gun ban, but think on this...
What if the shootings were staged by, if not the NRA, other private interest groups, in order to flare up the debate over gun control? We have ample historical evidence that private corporations are not above funding terrorist cells, foreign paramilitary groups, or killing private citizens to advance business interests. They know they have the mind of the American people already flung up in a frenzy over federal overreach, and the 2012.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how I explain the Boston bombings.  Fascist false flag attempt at coup d&#39;etat.  There are the same families behind it as the 1937 business conspiracy involving Smedley Butler.  Go forth and spread the truth, padawan</p>
