       The theory that the government is trying to impose gun control is a constant and ongoing theory of the American far right - the Birchers and many others have been saying that since the 60s.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think that it'd founder on the fact that we've had almost 30 years of steadily greater availability of guns, that there's a massive arsenal of privately held weapons in the United States, more weapons than have ever been in private hands in any other society in history - and that any restrictions that have been proposed are quite minimal, but people love the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst is that as near as I can see it, the politicians on both "sides" absolutely loves the gun control debate - because it gets everyone on both sides riled, there's never any real change, and because it allows the government to get on with the real work of looting the economy and imposing a surveillance state and an eternal "war on Terror" so that they can arrest or kill anyone, anytime, without due process.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movers-and-shakes quite correctly perceive that gun owners are more down with this than anyone else, as long as it's only being applied to Muslims and other undesirables.
      </p>
      <p>
       (By the way, Cooper also predicted that the extraterrestrials that had occupied Earth would have revealed themselves almost a decade ago now, so I'd recommend a grain of salt when reading his stuff.)

       I was thinking about this the other day.  Because of all the fear that gun legislation will pass, nearly ever firearms outlet is almost completely sold out of pistols, rifles, ammo, and magazines.  They have made a ton of money in the past couple of months.  Rifles that would normally go for 500-1000 are going at auction for 2500 and up.  The Mosin Nagant, one of the cheapest rifles available(100 average price)due to their overwhelming numbers and simplicity, have tripled in price(if you can find them).  30 round magazines that come in three packs for 50 dollars are now 50 dollars a piece(up to 100).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is all this astonishing to me?  There are currently more firearms and firearm owners in the US than ever before in history(due to the massive amount of sales).  Not only is this a major profit for the industry, if any restrictions are placed on sales(while grandfathering/keeping weapons already purchased), the main people really affected are those who will be aiming to purchase these weapons as young adults in the next few years.  Not saying that I want any form of gun legislation added that would restrict my "rights," but I would say any intention they had of setting this up to take away/limit citizens access to arms has completely backfired for now.

       Sounds like fast and furious, also the MOCKINGBIRD media keeps omitting the word TRACEABLE from that study that found that 70% of TRACEABLE firearms used by cartels are from north of the border (the mexican border).

       What bothered me about the book was that one section about a supposed leaked memo that was found in an old copying machine at an equipment sale. It was toward the first third of the book, but after seeing that I was like, "Right... How fortuitous." Then again, the entire book is a bit of a suspension of disbelief after a while.

       Heard this broadcast on JackBlood the other week too. Pretty interesting. A lot of things he's said check out and I'm really really curious about the whole thing with the moon. Don't know how far to go with what he said on that but hell, of course space is militarized already. So why not the moon too?

       I bought that book after reading about it on r/conspiracy.  I couldn't finish it after reading stuff like the voyager space craft had a nuke on board that wold ignite the atmosphere of (can't remember which planet) intentionally and then renamed lucifer.

      <p>
       Ideas like that are so crazy it made it impossible for me to take the other things he wrote about seriously even if he was right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say I am also highly suspicious of the secret document that starts the book.  The writing style reminds me of Cooper's.  No proof of course just saying.

       ?!  What's even more weird is that Venus is already known as Morning Star.
      </p>
      <p>
       Translation of הֵילֵל as "Lucifer", as in the King James Version, has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations have "morning star" (New International Version, New Century Version, New American Standard Bible, Good News Translation, Holman Christian Standard Bible, Contemporary English Version, Common English Bible, Complete Jewish Bible), "daystar" (New Jerusalem Bible, English Standard Version, The Message), "shining one" (New Life Version) or "shining star" (New Living Translation).
      </p>
      <p>
       This development has been decried not only by adherents of the King James Only movement, but also by others, who hold that the King James Version is correct and that Isaiah 14:12 refers to Satan under the name of "Lucifer",[15][16] or who hold that the reference to Satan is preeminent.[17]
      </p>
      <p>
       The term appears in the context of an oracle against a dead king of Babylon,[18] who is addressed as הילל בן שחר (hêlêl ben šāḥar),[19][20][21][need quotation to verify] [22][need quotation to verify] rendered by the King James Version as "Lucifer, son of the dawn" and by others as "morning star, son of the dawn".
      </p>
      <p>
       In a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase "Lucifer" or "morning star" occurs begins with the statement: "On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!"[23] After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues: "How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'"[24]

       His mind didn't wander anywhere, he was shown official documentation of extraterrestrials and UFOs, they were intended to make him spread false info on purpose and they succeeded until he determined what had happened.

       Whatever. I've read the book. It's half good and half complete shite and good luck figuring out which is which.

       According to your line - what makes only the UFO stories the misinformation? And how can you trust the rest if you know a good portion to be erroneous and purposely misleading?
