       I honestly believe some of their core people/personas are genuinely evil. The ones in the top five or so. Pathological, grossly dishonest, vicious, vindictive, destructive. They've pulled this fake name crap before, and they will again.

       Is it you or the fake account then who admits to not caring about truth, rather preferential to being a propagandist? I'll need to RES mark the accounts properly.

       You are right, I can't answer it because it's absolutely idiotic, it's literally one of the dumbest things I've ever heard, from anyone.... Anywhere........ Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be completely out of touch with reality to not understand why the truth is all that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how exactly am I supposed to have a debate with someone who openly admits they don't care about truth? It's absolutely silly logic. It's the equivalent of talking to a rock. It's self induced ignorance.

       You honestly don't even get it. (I'll point out here you are just deflecting more).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing you say has any impact, about anything. You admitted you don't care about truth, you care about propaganda against government. Literally your own words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether I believe anything about 9/11 or anything else, which, if you actually payed attention at all, you'd remember I already explained my position before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the point anyway, the point is, there is no reason to believe or care what someone says, if they don't care about truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       What possible reason should anyone take you seriously after you say you don't care about truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could stop asking stupid questions, that literally mean nothing anyway, and think for two seconds, maybe (I doubt it) you could see why you look like an unbelievable idiot all by only things that have come out of your own mouth.

       Well I am certainly not one of "you", and a select few of the others around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I am in the right place, since I actually have seen credible and rational people here. You know... those people that get in your annoying way by using critical thinking skills? If you don't know, critical thinking skills are what help most intelligent people decide not to create a massive post that is... basically nothing but ad hominem (while also calling out ad hominem in places where it isn't rofl...) and also it usually helps us not look like lunatics.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, this WHOLE SUB, is not full of lunatics... as you would like to progagate that I said (OHHH I see why you simply like propaganda, its cause you can just make shit up! It's so easy!)
However, you sir... are definitely a lunatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think you are in some 'elite' group. Oh you poor deluded guy :/
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh also, Make up more silly stuff about me though and post it like you know me, cause literally you got absolutely nothing correct. Well except that I do have one jewish friend. (Good to see that anti semitism coming from you too, you really just scream mature adult dont you?)

       Funny, cause I didn't 'get' anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I got was a guy who admits he doesn't care about truth, multiple times. Why he thinks anything he says is worth anything from anyone is beyond me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your little out of context quote mining and complete and utter deflection of literally every single thing that has been said by itself is enough to not take you seriously as well. Just keep piling it on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, attacking your utter lack of reading and complete disregard for honesty, isn't ad hominem, it's attacking the legitimacy of what you have to say, and you have zero credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you about done? You look more and more a lunatic everytime you post and completely disregard the fact that you stated... multiple times.. that you don't care about truth. Then all you do is deflect into "BUT WAT U FINK OF NIN LEVENS?!" it's getting boring that you have basically nothing to actually say.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have anything worth hearing, I'll be glad to listen, I'd start with how you can possibly defend prefering propaganda over truth rofl...

       Before you go off on yet another question asking spree, as if it even matters since you ask questions that relate nothing to the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you explain why you 'dont care about the truth when it comes to 9/11'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also why should I care what you have to say about anything 9/11 related, if you have no interest in the truth, basically saying all you care about is using the event as propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it flat out for you, since you have changed the topic about 19 times now. Why on earth, should anyone at all care what you have to say, when you don't care about the truth, and you admittedly only want to use the event as propaganda to suit your own purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't even answer that without going into quote mining, poor use of screaming ad hominem, and honestly... just misusing the term propaganda, then I really have nothing to say to someone like you. Aside from the fact that you've made up practically half of what you've said so far. heh

       Litereally everything you've said about me, calling me a kid, telling me what my stance of things is, anti-semetic comments about jew friends and such, all made up. Is it so hard to remember the shit you spew?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I did read your post and its weak and once again does not explain the questions I've asked, and now I grow tired of your constant deflection and inability to actually back yourself up with anything but nonsense.

       I have called a bunch of people lunatics on here, you're little out of context data mining has shown that and I haven't denied it, but you are most definitely the biggest.

       Honestly you make such little sense, and completely use made up definitions apparently, I can't imagine anyone at all listens to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask questions that bare no semblance of a point at all, half of which are utterly wrong assumptions or complete nonsequitors from what you think is sluething apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't seem to understand what antisemite even means, or you've made up your own definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim because you are clearly a lunatic that Ithink this entire community is nothing but lunatics. Which I've said more than once is utter nonsense but you seem to hold on to it for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've literally avoided giving a proper answer to why anyone should take a self proclaimed propagandist who cares nothing about truth in regard to massive historical events. Basically... Saying that you only care about 9/11 as a means of propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       What have you offered at all in this discussion? You claim you haven't made claims or assumptions about my stance and literally in the next 1 minute of typing... You again make claims on my stance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get your shit together man, you wanted this discussion about propaganda, so have a discussion instead of using insane out of context quote mining and avoiding every single topic by just asking questions about complete and utter nonsense. Who in the fuck thinks me being a hunter or having a motorcycle has literally any bearing on this conversation? Is it just you attempting to spew shit from my other forum post history as some kind of 'i know who you are' technique? Its ludicrous

       You failed to answer my question way more than twice.

       Let me just end it, you are a deflecting loonbird. Now I know you are just itching to propagate that into everyone on

       is loon. However they aren't. Many people here have critical thinking skills, and they actually use them. Too bad for you.

       I have no idea why I expected anything more than nonsense from a dishonest propagandist.

       Now pretend you can claim a win by fact of default because you drove me to literally hating the idea of trying to read the garbage that you can't back up, or even try to.
