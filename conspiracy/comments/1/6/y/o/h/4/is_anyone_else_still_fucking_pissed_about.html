<p>And in the coming year the Supreme Court will further be favorable to corporations because lawsuits will be heard about the disclosure that super pacs have to disclose right now. This corporate greed never ends, it&#39;s like appeasement. You give them a little, they keep wanting more and more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But corporations and everyone else has the right to donate their own money. </p>

<p>I mean corporations are made out of people, so when those people decide to donate through the corporation they have every right to do so. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree that its free speech, its private property though.</p>

<p>There is nothing conspiratorial about it, they were right. The big idiots were obviously those who pushed this to the supreme court as they should have known this would be the decision. </p>

<p>Congress can put limitations on themselves, administrative restrictions, and so they have. These pac&#39;s are not part of the campaigns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t a conspiracy, it is a bitch slap in the face to citizens from corporations. AIG was attempting to sue the government, because the bailout &quot;wasn&#39;t generous enough&quot;, despite their flagrant incompetence. It&#39;s kinda sad that we were sold out so easily, because now, any foreign corporation can donate an unlimited amount of funds to any politician, at any level. Think of the strings that can be pulled by China, Russia, or even Afghanistan. It&#39;s like they think corporations are people, and not just collectives of soulless execs bleeding the world dry...</p>
