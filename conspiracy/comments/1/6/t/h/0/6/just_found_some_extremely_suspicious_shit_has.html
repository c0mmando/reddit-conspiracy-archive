        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was reading <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2012/09/19/to-catch-government-workers-with-ties-to-child-porn-call-the-irs/">THIS</a> article about the role of the IRS in investigating the Pentagon child porn scandal, and noticed that the author claimed she had uncovered evidence of state-sponsored pedophilia rings in Maine and Vermont. As someone fascinated by the Franklin scandal this immediately caught my eye, and seemed like a strange thing to be reading in a Forbes.com article from September 2012. So I googled the author, Lori Handrahan, and was immediately blown away. The first page of results was probably 75% articles attacking her personally and basically calling her a paranoid psychopath. Long story short she was involved in a custody battle where she claimed her ex-husband abused their daughter, lost, and was ordered to pay him 750 grand. She also (I think yesterday) just lost her job as a professor at American University. Maybe I&#39;m just paranoid but the whole thing seems incredibly fishy. Some of the claims against Lori&#39;s character seem legitimate but if even a fraction of what she&#39;s said is true there is another Franklin/Penn St. scandal very close to being uncovered. Also based on the tone of the articles discrediting her I think it is very possible
her life has been ruined just to aid a massive cover-up. Keep in mind this is a trilingual college professor with a Ph.D from the London School of Economics, not your average loony toon. Does anyone here know anything about this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep an eye on this one, Lori&#39;s son now fits the profile for a school shooting perpetrator. </p>

<p>For me the jury is still out on ritualistic abuse, ya know, like the bafomet shit.  But any rational way to describe a potential network of child molesters fails me. </p>

<p>If we accept as fact the existence of a large network of child abusers the implications sicken me. But as another commenter said, we have to fight these Taboos and talk openly about it, so that, if they do exist, they cannot use it against our children. </p>

<p>Is the concept of ritualistic abuse that if properly done the abused gains pleasure through pain. The offspring of these rituals are then programmed to implement misery for the rest of their days in the name of some rationalized cause or belief that what they are doing is necessary? </p>

<p>Or is it just a result of sickness feeding sickness, attracting like disturbed minds like a prominent university attracts thinking ones? </p>

One other possibility is that elites put pedophiles in positions of power because these people are easy to control...imagine some middle manager in the Military Industrial Complex sees something he shouldn&#39;t &quot;before you go public with that here are a couple of photos of you doing things with little boys you should look at, then make up your mind.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not entirely sure that &quot;ritual abuse&quot; explicitly refers to some sort of eyes-wind-shut-candles-and-robes-and-shit-like-that thing every time the phrase is used. I could be wrong, but I believe it simply refers to a premeditated and systematic style of abuse. It also could be a phrase that can be used on different levels, but it really depends on the piece you&#39;re reading or whatever. I just wanted to share my two-cents on it because I know what you both mean about the David Icke idea if ritual abuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when it happens to you as a child, it turns into a fetish. That&#39;s why treatment for pedophilic urges is of the utmost importance. Many resist their urges, with the use of material. A lot of the time people like drawn depictions due to the lack of damage to a child. </p>

<p>it&#39;s just another part of our prison industrial complex though, arresting people for drawn depictions of children. Their offences do not state that though, and people usually get killed over this in jail. </p>

&quot;A homosexual prostitution ring is under investigation by federal and District authorities and includes among its clients key officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations, military officers, congressional aides and US and foreign businessmen with close social ties to Washington&#39;s political elite. Reporters for this newspaper examined hundreds of credit-card vouchers, drawn on both corporate and personal cards and made payable to the escort service operated by the homosexual ring.&quot;

<p>It&#39;s very long but helps develop an understanding of these types of networks. The article focuses mainly on Europe, however the same site did a follow up called  <a href="https://wikispooks.com/ISGP/dutroux_and_nebula/Beyond_Dutroux_part_two_Nebula.htm">&quot;Belgian Nebuleuse tied to child abuse networks, Iran Contra and the BCCI&#39;s Black Network&quot;</a> which delves into the connections to important people in the US.

    <div class="md"><p>Just looked it up and the Beyond the Dutroux Affair article does cover that a little. Here&#39;s an excerpt which is originally from a Swedish newspaper, showing how fucked up this shit is:</p>

<p>&quot;The pictures are unbearable for normal people to watch. Here are prolonged rape sequences with children begging to be spared. They are abused until they faint. Then they are murdered in front of the cameras... Yes, there are even scenes of actual autopsies on young people... In the &#39;product catalog&#39; of the pedophiles were pictures of a 10 year old girl who had been killed by hanging. A five year old girl with a grimace of pain as she is raped. An adult is killed by gradual crushing.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the early 2000s I worked for a social networking site that hit around 50 million users. It&#39;s since gone. We hired a guy, specifically, to find child porn. At the time we had around 15 people working there, his job represented ~7% of the workload (ridiculous). We even built tools to track and find the users. We reported EVERYTHING to the FBI. Every now and again the FBI would issue some legal proceedings and we&#39;d send them bucket loads of info.</p>

<p>It honestly was MASSIVE and we weren&#39;t even that large. You&#39;d find groups with members that never said anything, only uploaded albums of really disturbing stuff. Most of it seemed extremely organized, on some level. For example they had &quot;fashion shows&quot; with children practically naked on a runway. There was obviously money behind it, it had &quot;production value&quot; to it.</p>

<p>Nobody had the stomach to manage the tools, because you had to visually verify material that was flagged suspicious and then report it to some FBI site (the reporting was streamlined). The guy we hired didn&#39;t last long either. We even let him drink on the job.</p>

<p>I left soon after, so I have no idea what happened.\</p>

<p>But yeah, I left with the impression that it was HUGE and organized. To me it seemed some users produced material and others consumed it and maybe even some users were auctioning off the children. And yes, the FBI has agents that specifically deal only with child porn stuff. It must be a terrible job.</p>

<p>I&#39;m leaning towards the latter, simply because she couldn&#39;t find a doctor that would agree that her child was actually being abused; and she apparently tried 21 times. Her personal story kind of falls apart there, and it&#39;s easy to see how it would influence her research into stories like this.</p>

Jimmy Saville who was besties with Prince Charles and then the Franklin scandal which is disgusting enough, involves banks, big wig corporate CEOs and at that time as well those late night White House &quot;tours&quot; or those late night Washington, DC parties reportedly involving little boys?! Or how about the whole catholic church network with the priests and shit? the vatican maybe? Jerry sandusky all of it.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy for the IRS to concoct an excuse to open a criminal investigation over taxes.  They just tickle the computer a little and it spits out an investigation.  Even if they &quot;turn out to be mistaken&quot; in the initial &quot;concern,&quot; any other evidence of wrong-doing that turns up is handed over to the FBI.</p>

<p>If the FBI were to attempt the same thing, that would be a &quot;fishing expedition&quot; and the evidence considered &quot;poisoned fruit&quot; in court.  So the IRS is very useful to various law enforcement agencies who are trying to assemble a case.  In particular, when the FBI can&#39;t legally collect evidence they strongly believe to be &quot;out there,&quot; they telephone someone at IRS and question if the subject has any tax issues, &quot;at this time.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of off topic, but my fellow conspiracy theorists should not discount the role of occultism in these things. Satanism is a major aspect of the inner core of &quot;the&quot; conspiracy. One of these days I&#39;ll make a post about it and include a lot of links, because there&#39;s a lot of very good evidence for it. The only reason it escapes discussion is because people have been trained to disregard religion and spirituality in this modern age, and thus don&#39;t take the time to look into the role that the occult has played in the upper segments of society. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all aware of the influence of freemasonry on the top levels of government in the Western world, as well as elite connections to groups like Skull &amp; Bones, but there&#39;s many other groups as well as a wealth of information on the beliefs and practices of occult groups such as these. It&#39;s all very fascinating, and represents a major section of the rabbit hole that is conspiracy theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, Lori Handrahan created all her lies about Pedo-rings just to get back at her ex-husband. When 4 DHHS investigations, Supreme Court, Maine Ombudsman didn&#39;t believe her lies, she started screaming pedos, child traffickers, but she didn&#39;t have any proof. After exposing her daughter as a poster child of sexual abuse, posting her address, medical records, daycare address, she tried to kidnap her. DHHS find that she did a major psichological damage to her daughter and judge awarded sole custody to a father in a hearing Ms Handrahan didn&#39;t even bother to attend. She tried to use Anonymous, but after they did  research they were so mad, that they did a Dox on her. Federal court awarded her daughter and husband 750,000, she must pay this amount for the suffering she put them tgrough with her lies. You can read the story at <a href="http://www.savingmila.com">www.savingmila.com</a>, all original documents are linked to the each page od Mila&#39;s Story.. And for God sake, she has a daughter, not son! Also you can read this piece about why she was fired. <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/2013/01/17/update-lori-handrahan-fired-by-american-university/">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/2013/01/17/update-lori-handrahan-fired-by-american-university/</a> There is no conspiracy theory, but there are so many children that are abused. That is why we need false accusers be ignored, because they discredit the cause. 1 in 4 little girls and 1 in 6 little boys will be sexually abused by the age of 16 in US. This is terrible. And cover ups do exists. But if you want the truth don&#39;t read  LH  articles.

    <div class="md"><p>I have communicated with Lori thru social media for almost 9 months. She is a very intelligent woman, but many things she claims didn&#39;t add up. I&#39;ve read ALL of the material Lori has provided to back up her claims. I have also read ALL the material provided by supporters of her daughter.  After doing so things seem to become clear, and now I have cut off communication with Lori. I believe Lori is truly mentally ill. Maybe she has seen to many horrible things in her work, but she needs help. I pray for her and Mila, that she someday will get the help she needs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very long but helps develop an understanding of these types of networks. The article focuses mainly on Europe, however the same site did a follow up called  <a href="https://wikispooks.com/ISGP/dutroux_and_nebula/Beyond_Dutroux_part_two_Nebula.htm">&quot;Belgian Nebuleuse tied to child abuse networks, Iran Contra and the BCCI&#39;s Black Network&quot;</a> which delves into the connections to important people in the US. Both articles are quite detailed and appear to be very well researched. I highly recommend both for people willing to jump down this rabbit hole.</p>
