       I've been working as a support staffer on an ambulance crew in upstate NY.
       <a href="http://i.minus.com/jH36Nuwq3sB3H.jpg">
        Here
       </a>
       is proof of my certification. Most of my calls have been pretty typical (car crashes, heart attacks, sick old people, etc) and before last night I had never had a call that was in any way this terribly out of the ordinary, but here it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sitting around our base last night, just dicking around with one of the other staff members. Our pagers went off, and the dispatch tells us that we have a call for a standby at a house about 15 minutes away. He says that we have a possible EDP (emotionally disturbed person) and a possible gunshot wound, but the details aren't in yet and the scene hasn't been cleared by the cops yet so they want us to standby at a staging area around half a mile down the road from the house where the cops were making a makeshift control center. It should be noted that this is a rural area, so half a mile down the road means that there will be at most one more house before the target house. Basically, we're in the middle of fucking nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get to the staging area and wait around for about an hour. Given the nature of the call, we expected it to take a while for the police to clear the scene. They had to wait for a lot of backup to arrive including helicopters. The whole thing was really cool to watch. Naturally during this time we were listening to our police scanner to hear what was going on. There were a bunch of police logistics, which was cool to listen to, but something stuck out to me. The county dispatch told the cops that when a call went out at this house, the address had been flagged by the Feds and that nobody was allowed to move until they showed up. By that I mean that the police were allowed to enter the house, secure the scene, apprehend any suspects, and give them to us for medical treatment, but nobody was allowed to leave the scene until the feds arrived. This was odd but I was really pumped on the adrenaline of a call and didn't think much of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, the suspect came out peacefully, the cops entered and cleared the house, and found the dead body. I heard on the dispatch that the feds wanted a picture and description of the dead body. The police sent it to them via a secure channel, so I don't know the description. Once the feds saw the picture of the body, they put out an order not to move the suspect to the ambulance, and not to let him talk to anyone. The cops actually said over the scanner that they wanted him gagged, so the cops actually put tape over his mouth. I didn't know they did that in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're waiting around for another hour or so when two helicopters appear. We're in a rural area, so they are able to land in a field with ease. Even in the dark, it was easy to tell by the noise and outline that these were military helicopters, kind of like
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/f8Qbk.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       . I don't know how many people were in them because it was dark and they landed a bit away. Whoever was in it though, they spent about another hour inside of the house. Now, by this point it's about 4am and I'm exhausted and just want to go home, and finally we're told to expect a single patient who we should be treating as a dangerous EDP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two men in black suits (they looked like secret service or FBI or somethng) show up to the staging area, surrounded by the cops, and are escorting a suspect whose hands are bound. They tell us that they want him taken to a hospital that we don't normally take patients to because it's about an hour and a half away. It's also very close to a military base. The cops help to restrain the suspect to the hospital bed while the men in black watch. Once this man has been completely restrained and literally cannot move, the men in black say a few things to the cops, and take off just as they came, in their helicopters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we're taking an EDP (and apparently an important one) three cops ride in the back of the ambulance with us. At first, the cops basically scream and intimidate at the patient every time he tries to talk, but over the next hour or so I guess they just got tired of it and let him blabber. Once the patient was finally able to speak, he spoke very frantically and honestly he sounded very off. He repeated the same few things several times.
      </p>
      <p>
       He kept saying that he was going to be set up. That he was in danger, and that he'd been trained to kill. He told us to look up MK Ultra and that he was just the latest victim. He said that the movie theater shooting and the Sandy Hook shooting were just small parts of something big and that he was part of it somehow. He was pleading with us not to bring him back to the "suits" (as he referred to them) because they would never let him go. He said that he had woken up from a trance and knew that the "suit" would be coming to put him in another round of their "therapy" so he killed him before he could be put back in the trance. He said it was torture and he had been taken out of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I just assumed that the guy was crazy. The whole thing was really weird but it was nearly 6am and I just didn't have anything in me to try to connect any dots or anything. It was easy just to think the guy was crazy. He kept pleading with us not to take him to the suits because they would kill him, but our crew chief assured him that he was just going to the hospital. Honestly, none of us really gave a shit what happened to this guy, although by then we all knew that we were on one of those rare calls that you never really forget.
      </p>
      <p>
       We finally get to the hospital, and the patient is just freaking out. We don't care. We just want to go to sleep and we have at least a half hour of paperwork and then nearly two hours of driving to get through before we can go to sleep. Our shifts were supposed to have ended at 3am but once you get a call you're on it until it's over, regardless of when your shift ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we're maybe a minute from the hospital, when we get a dispatch on the radio saying that they don't want us in the usual unloading section, and that due to the nature of the call they want us to park in the underground parking garage until the staff come to take care of it. I'd only been to this hospital twice, so I just assumed that this was the entrance to the psych ward.
      </p>
      <p>
       We wait around the garage for a few minutes, when two black suburbans show up. We're sitting in the ambulance when a group of four men in black suits show up and open up the back of the ambulance. They tell us all to get out and go to the front of the ambulance. One of the cops says that he isn't allowed to leave the patient with these guys as they aren't part of the EMS chain of command (these are out protocols as well, you are only allowed to leave a patient with a medical professional with an equal or higher level of certification than your own. The lead suit man looks at him, snarles, and says word for word "I don't give a fuck about your command, we're taking this faggot." By this point the patient is literally screaming for help and begging us not to leave him with them but we're in a vacant underground garage and nobody gives a shit. The cops and the men with suits stand off for a few seconds, before the cop tells his men to come with him and get out. I guess he figured that this patient just wasn't worth the trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all go over to the front of the ambulance while the men in suits gag the patient, remove his restraints, and throw him in the back of their suburbans. One of them comes around to the front and tells us not to worry about the PCR (the standard bureaucratic form you do after every call) because they've already taken care of it. We got back in the ambulance and drove back, dropped the cops off, and went back to base. Nobody spoke the entire time. It was just surreal. I went back and passed out until probably 3 in the afternoon. I woke up so confused about the night before, and I called up the crew chief and we got together and tried to piece together the order of events. What I've typed out is pretty much what we remembered and the order in which we remembered it. I've been checking local news, but there doesn't appear to be anything about the murder or who the victim was.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here I am, still dazed from last night, and wondering just what the fuck anything is anymore. Seriously, can anyone here try to piece anything together? I don't know who else would know more about secret government programs than you guys and I am just at a loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I just want to specify that due to privacy laws and my desire to maintain my own personal safety, I cannot get more specific on the location or identify of the patient. Patient privacy is an extremely serious matter and I would be violating numerous laws and ethical codes if I tried to be more specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit2: Thanks for the support, those of you who have given it. I think I've figured out what the next steps are. First, I do want to give this time. Considering that this entire series of events happened less than two days ago, I do want to give it some time for the local news to pick this up. Given the amount of cops that were at the scene, I'm sure that at least some local reporter is aware that there was a murder and is trying to get information. If nothing turns up from the media that can make this seem less suspicious though, I'm going to file a FOIA request to get the PCR that was filed for us and of any police records of the night.

       If they were THAT fucking worried about this guy, why would he be alive in the first place?  Why not get OP and his ambulance crew to leave (shit, have a fake military first aid crew show up, whatever), and then kill this guy, throw his body in the chopper, and dump it in the ocean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any time a story goes to ridiculously convoluted lengths to accomplish something that could be done much more simply, it's almost certain to be false.

       Except that he doesn't say that the feds called the ambulance, the local police department did. By the sounds of it, the local police assumed that this was just an emergency call out that required medical assistance, and didn't actually know what was going on, which is clear from the stand off that supposedly took place between the suits and the police officers. I'm guessing there's probably certain procedures that the suits have to follow as well.

       I'm 50/50. I also occasionally browse this sub (I just love a good conspiracy, even though I don't buy into 95% of them) and if I were witness to what OP saw I would come here and post my story as well but under a throwaway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't be surprised at all if I don't hear anything more about this. BS is most likely. But I find the story intriguing (and that surprises me as I don't believe mass shootings are part of a grand conspiracy. People are fucked up and fucked up things happen and details get twisted in the confusion).

       It isn't fake, it is most likely real. I work for the government and things like this have happened. They are real and how do you think we treat terrorist suspects. I have seen it with my own eyes. Even the media is barred from certain defense related occurances.

       If you're worried the government coming after you, delete this post, delete your account, download TOR browser, and start contacting the media through it.  It'd help if you could get video testimony from the officers later on and also try to remember more details of what he said before going through with it.
      </p>

       Edit: Concerned with the government finding your IP address through TOR?  Go to an internet cafe.

        This.

       Very good advice here.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Given the added information GitEmSteveDave pointed out regarding the apparent ability TPTB have to track user identities via "entry and exit nodes" in TOR, perhaps it would, instead, be a better option for OP to actually either simply never ever post anything again and hope that all this just goes away and it doesn't get traced back to him (not sure how likely that is, as TPTB would probably be able to track him easily enough with just this reddit data here), or simply lambast the interwebs with his identity, his face, and absolutely everything he can with regard to what happened to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, good luck, OP.

       Yes, calling attention to yourself by asking people to be video taped is a great way to stay below the radar.

       First of all, if you want to direct your overwhelmingly stupid comment anywhere, it should be at Warlaw, not me.  He's the one who said it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, regardless of who you direct the comment at...well, it's
       <em>
        stupid
       </em>
       .  I have NO idea what you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not even
       <em>
        thinking
       </em>
       right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen morono, I'll help you out a little bit here:  When you run into some heavy shit that you're NOT supposed to have seen and that you just MIGHT get killed for, you generally have two choices.  You either run and hide and spend the rest of your life running and hiding and living in fear, or you go as absolutely fucking PUBLIC as you can and let the WHOLE FUCKING
       <em>
        WORLD
       </em>
       know what you know, and you do it
       <em>
        FAST
       </em>
       .  Why?  Because the faster EVERYBODY knows what you know, then the more obvious it will be that you are telling the absolute truth if you then all the sudden go missing and end up dead in a ditch somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you tell everyone what you saw, and also say "I am NOT a suicidal type.  If I end up 'suicided', then know that it wasn't me." then it is MUCH more likely that you WON'T get offed than would otherwise be the case because - as evil as TPTB are - they are also very secretive and DON'T want to be found out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that helped your stupid ass.  Facepalm.

       <strong>
        <em>
         FUCK
        </em>
       </strong>
       are you talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment is telling him to go to a TOR browser, you stupid, inbred fuck.  If there is ANY search that is anonymous, it's THAT one.  That's why it's been upvoted so much.  Do you know ANYTHING about TOR or the internet?  Facepalm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, and as I already said, if you're NOT going to go the anonymous route, what you want to do is make yourself SOOOO overwhelmingly open and in the eye of the public that anything that happens to you will be a big huge warning flag to the rest of the public that something IS up.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you DON'T want to do is half ass it and be in the middle - i.e. go public, but not really so public that too many people are going to find out and where too much of a fuss WON'T be made if/when you go missing or end up in a ditch somewhere.  You don't want to do
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, nothing I've said is being contradicted, since I both say that 1) if you're going to be anonymous, then yes.  Go the TOR route.  However, 2) if you're NOT going to be anonymous, then you need to REALLY work hard at being as public as possible because that can be its own protection in its own way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man.  You need some
       <em>

       reading comprehension lessons. lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hide your comment?  How the fuck am I trying to "hide" your comment?  By downvoting it?  I'm downvoting you because you're a fucking moron! lol.  Hell, I wouldn't have a problem if EVERYONE read this stupid shit you're writing so that everyone can see just how far off base you are.

       So Delete, Delete, Download a browser TPTB are operating exit nodes on so they can trace your IP.  Exactly what a disinfo aent would support someone doing to track them before offing them.

      <p>
       Well, I tell you what.  If TPTB
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       indeed have "exit nodes", and CAN indeed track you via a TOR browser, then perhaps the better of the two options that I endorsed would be to go VERY public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally am not advocating what you just brought up here.  If you are correct in what you just said, then I admit it does sound like a good way for TPTB to "off" somebody and OP might want to be mindful of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       My intention is only to keep OP from being more of a target.

      <p>
       Really?  Okay.  Well, what about this as your proof that I am not doing what you're alleging:
      </p>
      <p>
       I hereby officially state that IF it is indeed the case that going through TOR would possibly make you even MORE of a target than
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       doing it, then I
       <em>
        do NOT
       </em>
       advocate going through TOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit my ignorance of this whole "tracing exit nodes" thing that you just brought up here.  Could you explain that further so that I and others can better understand and see if what you say is really viable and possible?  Since I'm not aware of "exit node tracing" and am ignorant of anything like that, perhaps you can educate on just how that would be possible - as I absolutely ALWAYS thought that using a TOR browser makes it extremely difficult to track one's identity.  It functions on a "cloud" system, no? so that the exact location of any one user cannot be pinpointed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain then please how it is that even under these circumstances one's identity could be tracked.  I am interested to know, so that if I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       ignorant of the fact that TOR browsers
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       as anonymous as many claim, I can correct this mistaken impression (if, again, it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a mistaken one int he first place).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of how much of a moron you might seem to me (or me to you), one thing is certain:  I am NOT some sort of "cointelpro" type as you allege.  If you really think this, go ahead and look at my posting history.  You'll see quickly that although I can be (and often am) a flagrant asshole that is in no way afraid to call somebody out on something, I am not some sort of cointelpro type.  I am VERY much against all the stupid shit TPTB are doing/have done.

       No, this is very bad advice. If what he is saying is true they already are aware of him and that he is exposing things they don't want exposed. He can't hide from them, his only chance is to publicize himself, put his name out there, call Alex Jones, Art Bell and every two bit kook that will have him on the air. It seems counter-intuitive but if he is telling the truth it is probably the only thing that will keep him alive.

       Tor encrypts data as it travels through the network, but the entrance and exit nodes see everything unencrypted.  It's a good idea to only send data that you've already encrypted - websites using SSL for example (https://) - but a lot of people aren't that smart.

       Seems like it's pretty recent compartmentalization works so that the feds who comb reddit trying to tell what shouldn't be let out may not have the full picture about what is truth and what is BS... I'd think OP could provide some other kind of proof, or at least go public in a more meaningful way. Sad part the actions of the feds in this scenario are completely legit under current US fed. law this needs to change and can only happen through electoral revolution

       Although unrelated, piggybacking a bit: If anyone really wants some insight into what is going on with MK Ultra victims, a lot of in-depth research and insight can be read in the so-called "

       I don't know, tbh. Some aren't wrapped too tight here, but that's not everyone. Maybe when you "attack" their theory they feel like you have attacked them personally. In some instances it's like some conspiracy theorists want their wild claims to come to fruition no matter how bad just so they can say "Told ya so!" Another reason why some are so hostile is it's the internet; bounty of assholes.

       Watertown is a 5 minute ride from the military base. So that doesn't match story. Its plausible that OP travelled from Watertown area (near a base) to one of the larger hospitals in Syracuse (about 60-75 minute ride down I-81) where several of the hospitals adjoin parking garages (at lest St.Joes and Upstate University)  IIRC, the larger hospitals there tend to treat critical cases from the surrounding rural areas that smaller hospitals cant accommodate, I'll double check with an ex that interned there.

        Hancock Air National Guard Base
       </a>
       is an old Air Force Base that was downsized big time. It iss now in use by the Air National Guard and possibly Army Reserve / National Guard / Naval Reserves because they all have buildings within a few miles of the base.  As far as Hospitals with "underground" parking go, I am not sure about that.  Syracuse has quite a few large hospitals.

        By this point the patient is literally screaming for help and begging us not to leave him with them but we're in a vacant underground garage and nobody gives a shit. The cops and the men with suits stand off for a few seconds, before the cop tells his men to come with him and get out. I guess he figured that this patient just wasn't worth the trouble.

       Here's where the story really falls apart. Your certification is toast. What did you put on your first care form? That you handed him off to some guys who seemed legit because they were in suits and had shiny black suburbans?

       Some states are different, granted, but not so different that first care forms can be ignored, and if you did fill one out, your ass is still in a sling for doing what you did.

       OP here, let me just clarify a few things:

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       This isn't true. We are obligated to bring the patient to any hospital that he requests "within a reasonable distance" of the scene. Working out in the goonies, this means any hospital near one of the bigger urban areas near us. It isn't that out of the ordinary to be transporting a patient for up to two hours to get to a larger medical center. Since the patient was an EDP and not legally competent, he could not give us direction, so we took it from the Feds, who had asserted authority over the situation. The hospital that they directed us to has a larger psych area than any of the facilities near us, so at the time driving to that hospital did seem to make sense.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       They told us to go to the garage. We assumed that this was where the psych ward was. This particular hospital is over an hour from us and none of us had been to the psych ward there, except for the driver who had dropped an EDP off there over five years ago.

      <p>
       We didn't fill one out. The Feds were very clear to us that they had already taken care of that for us. The crew chief still has the incomplete PCR that we were filling out. I have no clue what I would have written.

       You still have to have one for your own documentation. Hopefully you didn't use anything from your med box on him. You are supposed to have it to hand off to the next guy anyway. My dad is saying it doesn't sound plausible but that it's possible in the same way it's possible for a lion to tear the door off the ambulance and steal your patient.

       It's just that when it comes to EMS there's nobody I would trust more with questions than my father. Seven years wildland/EMT for my hometown volunteer fire department before becoming the first fully certified paramedic in the department, 10 years of firefighting/paramedic experience around southern Arizona, and the last 5 strictly working for an ambulance company as a captain. He was tutored by my grandmother, who has an award for EMS excellence named after her, so it's not small potatoes in my book.

       the only issue with this is...did you ask your father "have you ever had a situation where the feds have taken over control and asked you to do things out of the ordinary"?
If you did, and his answer was "no" then his experience doesn't really cater for this.

       I did ask him what his most similar situation was, and he said that once he picked up a "UDA" (undocumented alien) who had tried crossing the desert from Mexico. Border Patrol ran his ID and, without explanation, came back locked and loaded and said "this man is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       entering the country." Their badges alone wouldn't have deterred him from providing him transport to the hospital. His situation is a bit different, though, not only because of what I've said so far, but because he works with these same BP agents pretty much all the time when he's out there.

       If the reason was anything other than "somebody else will be badly hurt and/or killed" or "you will personally go to jail" then I'd let it come to fisticuffs before I let myself be bullied into anything. Even then it would have to be explicitly clear. No analogies, no vague references, and no letting me fill in the blanks.

       Plus legally, these people had authority over this situation, the mechanics of which seemed to occur at the site of murder. An official handover of jurisdiction took place there. So consequently, from that point on he was legally obliged to follow their orders, until transfer of the patient was complete. They being post-9/11 federal agents with complete authority, probably a variety of 'extraordinary powers' bestowed upon them for any situation.
I don't know if at any time they specifically said 'Do Not Discuss this with anyone!', but it was probably implied. Still, shenanigans like this should piss everyone off, if true. That's all being funded by your tax-dollars (&amp; probably by other things far less savory). Nothing better happen to this guy. He's being a far better American than what it sounds like these dark-suits are involved in.

       It doesn't work like that. You'd have to start point a gun at them to make it happen. He said the cops were riding in back. No amount of coercion is going to make EMS personnel lose their certification willingly unless their life is on the line.

       What I can say is a good friend of mine when to school for EMS and has his cert, but is actually a postman. So you can get your cert and not get an actual job as an EMS person for a while. SO it would be possible that in a largely populated state like NY it could take a while to actually get a job after you have gotten your cert.

       The comment you are replying to has more to do with a certain level of apathy raised in front of a risky scenario. I think you meant to comment on the dates I mentioned on his certification card, and yes, you're right. I didn't even think about that. I was just trying to say he wasn't exactly a probie.

        We wait around the garage for a few minutes, when two black suburbans show up. We're sitting in the ambulance when a group of four men in black suits show up and open up the back of the ambulance. They tell us all to get out and go to the front of the ambulance.
        <strong>
         One of the cops says that he isn't allowed to leave the patient with these guys as they aren't part of the EMS chain of command (these are out protocols as well, you are only allowed to leave a patient with a medical professional with an equal or higher level of certification than your own.
        </strong>
        The lead suit man looks at him, snarles, and says word for word "I don't give a fuck about your command, we're taking this faggot."
        <strong>
         By this point the patient is literally screaming for help and begging us not to leave him with them but we're in a vacant underground garage and nobody gives a shit.
        </strong>
        The cops and the men with suits stand off for a few seconds, before the cop tells his men to come with him and get out.
        <strong>
         I guess he figured that this patient just wasn't worth the trouble.

       Yeah, that's just not how "the fuzz" work. Police, in general, especially the kind who would be out at a call and riding in the back of a bus, would not, and I repeat, would not EVER give up custody of another human being to 'dark suits' calling people faggots.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'd probably draw on the guys before giving the patient to him. This is not how this shit works. These guys all know how this goes, you DO NOT do things like this, everything needs to be official because it's your ass on the line, and no one's inconvenience but the feds(people demanding you put your ass on the line) to wait a little while and make it proper, and even if in the end you transfer custody to the feds, you're going back to base first, with them, to talk with your(and possibly their) superiors.

       The part about not caring does make it hard to swallow at some points.  The Feds at the hospital would have had to of provided more than louder voices to be able to take custody of a murder suspect.  Could have been his friends trying to spring him for all they knew.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, you're right, they would need to be forms as well as a radio or phone call from a superior.  And Feds don't write OR reports or local forms for townies.  It just isn't done.

       That's not entirely true.  I worked in a more metro place, and the hospital we sent someone to depended on the nature of the injury or call.  Trauma, EDP and non-life threatening were usually sent to different hospitals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I had been involved in an accident in SD where a passenger needed medical treatment.  Nearest emergency center was 20 minutes away, but since the injuries weren't life threatening, they opted for Rapid City which was an hour away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying you're wrong, just that this case sounds like they decided it was a non-emergency transport which was then intercepted by the MIB in the story.

       I'm mostly concerned with the OP's disregard for protocol and unwillingness to cover his own ass. The fact that this thread exists is what makes me think twice in the first place. You could say that MK Ultra and the MIB have effected his judgement on the matter, but I'm not hearing the one thing that would have me listening to it more closely: "Holy crap, you're right! I'd better finish that form and make sure everything is documented." If not for exposure, then for his own well being.

       yes of course. like i said i am not saying you're wrong. as far as i'm concerned we're on the same side. but when mk-utlra came in to the story along with both sandy hook and aurora i just had a gut feeling something wasn't right. (not with his story but i mean, with the world). i just don't see myself being able to make something like that up when i don't even really know what mk-ultra is. (i do, i mean the ems guy)

       They'd still have to fill out the paperwork that said who they handed him off to. It's part of being accountable so your ambulance company doesn't get into deep shit. Just think about it. If you're on an ambulance crew and you have to explain what happened to a patient, what are you going to do? Shrug and say you don't know? That you just handed them off to some guys because they seemed legit and had badges and everything?

       No, he said that the feds filled out the paperwork. Maybe they wrote it out as the guy was never loaded into the ambulance.

       I just finished reading this, and I think I know the suspect because he has been missing, NY, and told a story similar that would lead to this situation. He isnt responding to his few friends and mentioned something I cant say that is parallel to this. I am too afraid to say anything though, from the things he said, the rabbit hole was way too deep and deadly.

       You do realize how much your comments support the idea of "shills" in this subreddit?  I don't read the sub often at all, and I don't (didn't?) believe that there were paid shills here playing mindfuck games... but you?  What the fuck are you doing?  How much do you get paid?  Creepy stuff.

       Exactly. I hate it when I see a reasonable, skeptic opinion by guys like him and then a couple posts later saying "Wait a tic... this guy's just saying 'Nothing to see here, move along' to
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       , never even thinking for one second that anything could ever not be on the up and up." He won't budge an inch. We say "Yep, that's a possibility" to what he says and he says "NOPE, NOT POSSIBLE! NO WAY" to everything we say.

       Are you a bit dim? This might well be a hoax, but the fact it was posted from a brand new account is hardly evidence of that, is it? A genuine poster would also use throwaway account with a story like this.

       That is a much better argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, a genuine poster would also be concerned about revealing too much information for fear of identification and possible retribution. This caveat is, in turn, mitigated by the fact that he has probably revealed enough info already to be tracked down, if the story is true, so why not just reveal something that could be objectively verified?
      </p>
      <p>
       My view (worth nothing at all) is that is a compelling story and likely fake, but not as yet debunked.

       I'm less afraid of being tracked down (I really doubt anyone important is reading this) than I am of breaching privacy laws and ethics. I take that very seriously, and especially when you consider that this is a crime scene, I really can't say everything that I know (which is a hell of a lot more than I've said.)

       I suggest writing down as much as you remember now, with as much detail as you can, and hide it somewhere safe (NOT on a computer, on paper). Maybe a bank vault. You may one day realize how significant this event is, and will wish you could recall all the details you remember right now. Perhaps when your job is no longer at risk. You might consider WikiLeaks, too.

       When you're trying to hide behind "privacy" laws to avoid giving a location where this supposedly occurred, that sends up massive red flags.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually work as a cops/courts reporter for a major metro newspaper, so..you tend to develop a good sense for how things work.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, if you had this kind of a protracted standoff, local (and likely national) media would be all over it. That there's not a single mention anywhere of a standoff/murder in the state at all is telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only do us media types rely on our police scanners to tip us off if something potentially interesting is going on, we also have contacts and sources inside police departments that would be on the phone first chance they got if something like that were going down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anticipating the "well, it was the middle of the night, no one was there/awake", even moderately-sized papers have either a "night cops" reporter or an "overnight" reporter for breaking news. TV stations also have someone present that can wake up producers/on-air talent if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a simple solution to resolve concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       All police calls are a matter of public record, including the "call sheet" showing CAD activity with the assigned unit and the cover sheet of the report that includes location, reporting party, suspect/involved parties and officer's narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand not wanting to identify yourself, so...

      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         I propose a simple solution to concerns of authenticity. Name the local law enforcement agency involved, and I'll jump through the hoops to get the relevant data, assuming this actually occurred.

       It shouldn't, imo.  OP claims to be an EMT, not a cop.  I have no idea what privacy issues cops have to deal with but I know from personal experience that health care workers are under CONSTANT and MASSIVE pressure to protect patient privacy.  There are significant ramifications for violating health care privacy laws like HIPPA, and employers and certification agencies take that shit very seriously.  Giving a location in a low population rural area, paired with the info the OP already gave, could potentially identify the patient.  There are a lot of things in the OP that don't ring true to me, but the paranoia about violating patient privacy is not one of those things.

       I could not disagree more strongly.

      <p>
       For one, run sheets are public record just like police call sheets are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, run sheets are handled more carefully because the department's PAO/PIO does have to insure that any medical information is redacted, but the basics of call time. engine/ambulance dispatched, address and transport status are all available as open records.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not even asking that he identify his employer. Just that he identify the responding law enforcement agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the patient was allegedly arrested, not only would the police report absolutely confirm the OP's story, it would identify the alleged "MKULTRA subject", as his identity is a matter of public record as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been doing this for quite a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can assure you there are no HIPPA/patient privacy issues involved here since obviously I'm not asking OP to divulge records of treatment received or clinical impressions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, honestly, if the individual actually existed, I wouldn't need a thing from OP. I could easily track down the records and identify him on my own, but....I thought I'd offer OP a chance to refute the allegations of BS that some have made.

       Yeah, thirded. As a volunteer EMT myself I can say that HIPAA/patient privacy is such a normal part of EMS culture that even in the most dire of circumstances, breaking HIPAA would be like a Catholic praying to Muhammad or some other sacrilege like that.

       correct anything that would be considered identifying info, name, address, phone, all private. about the only thing that can be said over the radio is age and male or female and current medical status when talking to the er. he could state the area or town that wouldn't be identifying.

       What you have claimed about police scanners is not true at least in my area. Their transmissions are encrypted and it would be entirely plausible that EMS would still have access to this system, while a simple news reporter would not. A lack of real time news coverage does not make this false.

       Actually, it's very true, in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Encrypted channels are extremely uncommon to the point I've only encountered them with the Secret Service field office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the local police do use encryption on one of the tactical channels used for ESU/SWAT, but the dispatch channels are clear as are the other "tactical" channels used when a major accident/incident is being worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's done that way largely because of limitations of encryption and due to interoperability with other agencies/jurisdictions from the way it's been explained to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a lot of reporters, it's also a moot point.
      </p>
      <p>
       At several of my previous publications, the cops reporter is often given office space in police headquarters/city hall which is convenient for a lot of reasons, but it means there's access to police radios rather than just scanners.

       Where I am, there is absolutely no longer any way for me to monitor police radio transmissions (despite being a ham radio operator even). I used to be able to, it USED to be like you described. It's like this in almost the entire state here. They have one big digital encrypted system now that encompasses a large portion of the state. They used to dual broadcast on an unencrypted motorola trunked system, but they shut it down a couple years ago. I used to always keep a radio scanner on for the hell of it, and I haven't been able to for a while now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the other day I witnessed a murder up the street from me (not directly witnessed, but saw the commotion, found out what happened), and it was never covered in any media I came across.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I recall correctly, we have a (now harris) M/A-COM OpenSky radio network around here. A simple search shows that New York State also was implementing this same system at least at one point in time. It's possible they have the same gear there as where I live.

       That's surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were some knee-jerk responses and a push for encryption a couple years ago when scanner apps became a big thing, as I recall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing ever came of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My understanding is it's been explored, but the beat cops absolutely hate it because if you're on the fringe of coverage, the encryption causes drop outs or garbled transmission to a more severe extent than clear channels did.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the bigger thing was it would be a nightmare with so many different agencies on their own systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I remember, I think the northern portion of California tried it not too long ago, with San Francisco heading it up and a ton of federal grant money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last I heard, the thing was a disaster since they went with a system that wasn't interoperable with anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just to settle the matter with regard to the claims here, New York state isn't a big fan of encrypted radio (with the exception of specific channels).
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance....There's some speculation that Watertown, NY might be the location here.

       Just because it's not where you live, doesn't mean it isn't where someone else lives. I live in a suburb of Houston and where I live it's trunked, in the 800Mhz range, and encrypted - and right in actual Houston it's still 400Mhz.

       Addressed in my comment to Synoid, but to reiterate...
      </p>
      <p>
       In my experience, encryption is uncommon and used primarily by the feds and by ESU/SWAT.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also point out that, that's only one tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any cops reporter worth anything would be getting phone calls from cops making sure he'd heard about it if anything remotely as exciting as a standoff went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that cops are like teenage girls when it comes to spreading gossip or news of whatever's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, they'll pick up the phone and call if they think the wrong person's getting promoted to sergeant. No joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...point stands as far as I'm concerned.

        The cops actually said over the scanner that they wanted

         him gagged,
        </strong>
        so the cops actually put tape over his mouth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since we're taking an EDP (and apparently an important one) three cops ride in the back of the ambulance with us. At first, the cops basically scream and intimidate
        <strong>
         at the patient every time he tries to talk
        </strong>
        , but over the next hour or so I guess they just got tired of it and let him blabber.
        <strong>
         Once the patient was finally able to speak, he spoke
        </strong>
        very frantically and honestly he sounded very off
       </p>

      <p>
       OOPS! I thought he was gagged? Should have put in the story

       Yeah this sounds way too Hollywood. Just to be the devils advocate, I think he said they removed the tape when they brought the guy in the ambulance. It makes sense that a few cops would tag along and it's more than common for cops to be intimidating under certain circumstances. So most likely the feds flew back to their base for something more subtle, but that they had to take
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       military helicopters seems a little off..

       The two helicopters seems a

      <p>
       If we're to assume FBI, we're talking probably the Albany field office, since they're a little closer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they flew, they wouldn't have used Blackhawks. FBI uses more commercial-type helicopters, so a Bell Jetranger or an MD 500/600 is more likely.

       More importantly, where did the Suburbans come from?

       FBI flew back and then drove back out when they remembered they forgot to take him along?

       The Buffalo field office wanted to fuck over the guys from Albany by stealing their suspect, so they drove out to intercept him at the hospital?

       Sir,
I was about to type out a whole bunch of questions. in the end I can only say one thing. You posted proof of your profession, I imagine you're being sincere. I would only suggest that you contact your local presses ASAP. Since other people heard him and saw all this, it is reasonable to say a reporter would have no to trouble collaborating the story. Go to your local presses ASAP or go to your City or Towns' blog and write it up. Get people in your neighborhood talking about it.
      </p>

       Did you by chance get any names or license plates?

       False. First responders go through many hours of training to get certified. It is considered the lever just below EMT-B.

       Many hours, yet aren't EMT's, can't drive an ambulance or do anything but give cpr (maybe with a BVM?), clear airways of obstruction, administer oxygen,  use blankets...

       Seriously... it's probably a 2 week course at most. You won't be using spine boards even. This guy wouldn't be working anywhere but security at a mall with that training. The next level up includes transport for occupations outside of 20 miles I think.

       In NH, first responders are absolutely allowed to backboard, suction, and provide other basic lifesaving skills. They are also allowed to have patient care (given that there is an EMT with them). Basically, they are EMT's who can't sign the report or have primary care without someone more qualified with them. In NH, you can be a certified First Responder at the age of 16.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for sitting around a base? I disagree with your assessment entirely. It is completely plausible that OP is a volunteer and may be sitting around the station on a shift or just hanging out with like minded people. When I was 16 and trained as a first responder, that's exactly what I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot confirm that NY has the same regulations but a First Responder course is definitely not a 4 day class.

       Yes, it's a first aid attendant certification.

       It's laughable because when people tell fake stories they always give great details about everything that isn't important. Hey guys, I wouldn't lie, I have a first aid ticket. Here's proof because all I do is provide verification of things I say.

       I feel like that is too obvious.  If they take him in a blackhawk from the scene, everyone knows something is up (all the cops, the EMTs, anyone else standing watching).  If he goes in an ambulance to a hospital, you cut the number of people knowing what is going on to 5ish (3 cops, OP, his partner).  Its a lot easier to make 5 people disappear than ~20.

       I meant, if 20 people start saying "a shooter was carried away in a blackhawk," its a lot more believable than 5 (in this case 1) saying "suits took him away in an underground parking garage."  Plus, they
       <em>
        can

       make 5 disappear easier than 20. OP could be lying, or he could be telling the truth.  We'll probably never know.

       I think this reveals board4life does, most likely believe it to be true despite also believing there's absolutely no way of telling either way; why else would they accuse someone who's not buying it of having an ulterior motive, namely a cover-up?
      </p>
      <p>
       This
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       cognitive dissonance, mind you, but it proves my point that conspiracy theorists (loose term) will believe virtually any story if it fits their pre-conceived notions, whether it's 'black helicopters', 'men in black suits', 'lizard people', 'NWO', 'shadow government' etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll go to virtually any lengths, invoking numerous logical fallacies to rationalise how it
       <em>
        could possibly
       </em>
       be true so therefore it
       <em>
        is true
       </em>

        some will go even further and say its implausibility demonstrates its certainty.

       When you believe something with no credible, justifiable reason for doing so: is that 'faith' or just being 'gullible'?  Are 'faith' and 'gullibility' reliable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats tragically funny about all this is if we don't hear a follow-up to this story anytime soon, it will no doubt be taken as "proof that the feds got to him".  If we do, I wager it has no verifiable claims once again and yet it will again be accepted as true.

       Also, the percentage of people who will a) care b) talk to anyone; is quite low. So out of 5?
       <em>
        Maybe
       </em>
       one. And they'll only take care of them if they're a real problem. Posting on reddit? With a couple hundred upvotes? They'd ignore him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, out of 20, say 4 were to care about it. They talk together. Some of the other 20 start snapping out of their comas, too. Now they all want to talk. Here, Facebook, to the press, etc. Your logic makes a lot of sense, though the question is a good one.

       Nice..  His story goes from "we" to "I" back to "we" constantly..  There are multiple cops who act like they are in on the conspiracy, but then they arent anymore when the suits show up??  Its a really small town but there are multiple hospitals around the town?  Also,  middle of the night but you can see a "blackhawk" helicopter?  With people in black suits

       I say either go all the way or go nowhere. Get the word out, make a vlog, go to the press, release names (was his name, Robert Paulson?), where and when precisely this happened. Start documenting things, particularly that you will in no way commit suicide and/or murder someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you identify this man by name, by face, by location? This man could be the next shoo-in for a staged shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr - Seek the truth. Record everything, go to the local press, make vlogs/blogs; so much so that your evidence of this event can not be smeared, shrugged off or ignored.

       You've got your priorities or probabilities backward, buddy.  There is no super-secret HIPAA enforcing agency of men in black suits.  There IS a super-secret secret enforcing agency of men in... suits, and ladies in professional dress.

       Like Bill Cooper said: he was physically attacked when he started to talk about some of the things he knew. Instead of backing down, he sent it to
       <em>
        TONS
       </em>
       of people. Then they left him alone.

       For a hot minute yeah..but only because he survived the car crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wasn't supposed to survive that.. and we saw more of Bill Cooper then we were supposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       He spent 30k in one night sending over 20k letters to people via the mail. Important high ranking people as he was pretty important himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once he predicted 9/11 and went full bore though it was done.

       If op is telling the truth then I hope he goes public asap or at least spreads the legitimate information he has among the supporting networks so we can get the word out.

       Well, scaredemt, assuming for the moment this is true(not saying it is) they know who you are already. The expiration date on your ID gives them a good data set parameter to pinpoint you, for starters. They will review who their people came in contact with, they'll know which officers were onscene and which EMT's responded. I'm not really buying this, but, just for shuts and giggles I'll play.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would speak to all your co-workers who were with you. Get audio/video. Get everyone together on this so it's  not just you. Contact alternate media with your assertions. I recommend veterans today(veteranstoday.com) those guys are ex-military/intel, and have the contacts to verify if this went down. Take this effort offline; posting this on reddit going forward is a fairly bad idea. Makes for an interesting read, though. Use TOR or a VPN of some kind(there are many) when communicating about this. Be smart. Learn about MKULTRA( which never stopped), HARRP, and so many other things. If you really don't know of these things, you're about to have your mind blown.

       Project MK ultra was a government project for mind control of unknowing US and Canadian citizens. It was officially "shut down" in 1970 due to many illegal activities. If what you're saying is true and men in black suits really did appear then I beg you to head my warning, don't go any further into this than you already are, that project still has some aspects that are highly secretive, just stop looking around and forget anything you saw or heard.

       Yeah, I looked up MKULTRA this afternoon so I know the gist of it, but didn't it get exposed and shut down? And this post on reddit is the only thing I've gone forward with about this at all. I want to be more careful but I just have so many unanswered questions and I doubt anyone involved is reading reddit.

       Publicly yes.  That doesn't mean shit, however.  TPTB (The Powers That Be) on this planet have what is called a "black budget" that is said to be AT LEAST as much as the current national debt.  Hard to fathom, but this is what many reports say.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have practically unlimited resources, power, and influence, and that kind of power and influence will NOT shut down something like MK-ULTRA fully.  They'll just
       <em>
        call
       </em>
       it "shut down" publicly - which is what they did.

       Er, I think the CDO/CDS black hole was supposed to be worth around 1,000 trillion, or 1 quadrillion dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The global drug trade has been worth hundreds of billions annually ever since the war on drugs began 40 years ago. I think I could mature a billion dollars into a trillion in 40 years' time. If you don't have to worry about taxes and antitrust and insider trading it would be really easy. I think 16trillion is feasible. But where is the money being spent?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my biggest question, what good is all this black money if the effects are not clear?

       My man, did you just read what he wrote above the comment I just made atop here?  If his last sentence is any indication, then your "surely" is kind of

       The problem with believing MK Ultra still exists is how incredibly stupid the program was in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the CIA can't be filled with the most level headed, rational and scientifically literate people in the first place, or these insane programmes and E.S.P. bullshit would never happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the official story that the program was bunk, that yes you could fuck up peoples minds with L.S.D, sensory deprivation and electroshock and make them forget who they are, but can't actually create something useful from those methods, sounds far more likely than them finding any value to the programme and continuing it until today.
      </p>
      <p>
       To actually reprogramme someone for a specific use surely would requite nanotechnology and a far more understanding of how the brain works, and I don't believe that the CIA is so good at science they are like centuries ahead of the rest of the world in these fields.

       I wasn't even talking about the political aspect of it, just the idea that certain factions under that big umbrella somehow secretly develop and wield technology far greater than that found in the public-sector. Any scientist or engineer can tell you how little sense that makes.

       I would think it is kind of hodge podge, you can make some interesting stuff when there is no questions of mass production or cost effectiveness. So public-sector is ahead in places where the tech is moving really fast and there are other areas where the government has some nicer stuff.

       However, mind control is pretty old now. It may be difficult to make an effective Manchurian candidate, but there are always uses for violent loonies, if you can push them in the right direction. Kazynski was MK ultra and there are thousands of people who get sucked up into crazy cults every year. Look into Patty Hearst.

       Mind control would be the ultimate weapon. Do you truly believe they gave up the effort because the public caught on? They sure didn't stop because they didn't find it feasible, they were simply exposed.

       And mind control (in the method your thinking of, propaganda is a form of mind control that works very well) is practically impossible too.

       I'm sorry, I didn't realize there was a finalized book of laws you had access to about the universe. I feel as though I am a rational person, and I fully disagree with you on each point. Unlikely perhaps... but impossible? No.

       Which thing in particular are you disagreeing with being impossible?
      </p>
      <p>
       E.S.P is impossible because it breaks the numerous conservation laws, telekenisis likewise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind reprogramming, I said was practically impossible. As in impossible in a practical sense, for the reasons stated in my first comment, we'd need a much much better understanding of science to do it.

       HAARP controlling the weather et al, again that's breaks numerous conservation laws, more glaringly conservation of Energy.

       E.S.P. is impossible? So there is no chance that my brain can act like a radio transceiver somehow? You have the manual and specs on that you can show me? Pretty large claim. Physics PROVES it is possible for data to be transmitted remotely, not disproves. Recent studies about particle entanglement further support such concepts like ESP being possible if not likely to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind control  and conditioning reactions and responses is easily plausible. We aren't talking about hooking them up to a remote control like a car, we are talking about acquiring a desired action given a certain stimuli. You've been conditioned to shit on a toilet, don't tell me you couldn't be conditioned to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       HAARP isn't necessarily controlling the weather, but it is clearly within our power to cause weather changes in local area (nuclear bombs exploding change weather). Sometimes all it takes is a a small force to gain a huge desired reaction . Like a light tap on a boulder to get it rolling down a hill. You can not prove with physics that weather control is impossible.

       The idea of "programming" and "brain-washing" is utter bullshit. You can never change someones core ideals by force. Sure, you can force them do something, or completely destroy them psychologically, but you can't force someone to change like that.

       reminds me of the post on reddit the other day about test pilot who flew the first jet plane wore a gorilla suit, so if any other pilots saw him flying a plane with no propellers, they'd say a gorilla was flying and no one would believe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       No gorilla's in OP's story though, so not sure if legit or not.

       sorry to burst your bubble, but "do it in a gorilla suit" isn't what we'd call good OPSEC.
      </p>
      <p>
       the actual story is that Jack Woolams, a stereotypically wild test pilot, bragged about flying a propeller-less aircraft and other pilots didn't believe him, not because he always flew in a gorilla suit, but because the test aircraft had a
       <em>
        fake propeller
       </em>
       .  the rumor is that he later played a joke on the skeptical pilot by flying near his aircraft wearing a gorilla mask and smoking a cigar.  probably just a pilot's tall tale, but you never know.
      </p>
      <p>
       i've been inside the cockpit of a P-59, and i assure you no one was flying it wearing a gorilla suit.

       I thought the old saying is the biggest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he didnt exist..  So wouldnt that mean the government is really not the bad guy, but the people who feed us these conspiracy theories are?  Think about it, most people have been screwed by local governments or regular people, not the federal government but there is so many conspiracy posts that MILLIONS of people believe.

       I'm surprised you didn't get called a shill for that! I'm not, by the way. I almost agree with you. But there ARE some weird things going on. Whether or not they are conspiracies is difficult to tell. The problem is, because conspiracy theories rarely get proven (absolute, accepted by all, proof) it breeds all sorts of wacky, nutjob ideas that do more harm to the cause than good.

       good luck to say the least. thats one hell of a fuckin story... cant say that ive heard many like it, except when regarding alien crashes and other paranormal stuff...
      </p>
      <p>
       if it were me, i would just wait and see what i could dig up on my own. i wouldnt involve anyone and i wouldnt show any of my findings to people i didnt already have 100% trust in. the internet has a lot of information, and ive always found myself surprised at what you can dig up on a person when you have enough of their info.
      </p>
      <p>
       im not telling you to share his identity or the location, but definitely keep your ears and eyes open. maybe try finding some background on this guy... it could be either really interesting, or really deadly. so its safe to say that either way you spin it, itll make for some interesting investigative work.

        plane crash

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A rural farmer in Lee County, Illinois reported that he saw a flash of light, heard an explosion and saw the plane fall out of the sky. This initial description of the crash was what the local newscasts in Omaha reported at first. In subsequent newscasts, without evidence to the contrary, it was reported that the plane exploded upon impact with the ground, not in the air. The deputy sheriff, who was the first to arrive on the scene, reported that there were debris and child pornography pictures all over the place. Then three flatbed trucks appeared and pulled into the field. A team of men got out of the trucks, picked up all the debris and pictures and then drove away. It is not clear who these men were.

       Good info. Can you find any info on his flight experience? Seems unlikely some small thunderstorm activity would take out an experienced pilot. Unless there was some sort of impact.

The whole Sandusky thing is nothing compared to this. Sick fucks. When you're done with that, I invite you to look up Jimmy Saville, the Elmo guy, and Jersey island pedo ring.

       I want to believe, but it's way too hard for me to with all of the keywords (mk ultra, aurora, sandy hook) thrown in. I also feel that a subject of mk ultra (If still in fact a tactic) is not going to know that he is a part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also hope it's not true, because I don't think it would be that hard to track down one of the 2 responding ems workers, especially with the picture of the ID in there for them to compare.

       I kind of agree. If MKultra was still in effect, wouldn't they rename the program to something else? I mean it was started in the 50's and its publicly known now, wouldn't they use a new name and revamp the program?

       As a licensed emt myself, how can you get in trouble for patient privacy laws if there never was a "pt". Who signed off on your report for the pt? I would talk to your medical director. Technically you have already messed up
Seeing that you didn't hand him over to medical staff. Really odd call might I add. I wouldn't search his name on your computer that's for sure

       So the conspiracy comes complete with helicopters, mind control, and men in black, but they don't have their own medical crew? Also, "secure channel" isn't really a thing, and OP wouldn't know about it anyway, unless he was actually trying to eavesdrop, tap, or bribe the communicators.

       ok I love a good conspiracy as much as the next guy, but this one doesn't make sense. The "suits" appear in 2 military choppers, take their target into custody, THEN for no apparent reason turn him over to a bunch of local yokels??? and with no escort and not drugged or gagged have you drive him to a location an hours + drive, just to take him BACK into custody??? Sorry bud, IRL once they had this guy subdued, they would have packed him in one of those nice military choppers, told you it was a false alarm, or a training exercise gone bad, or nothing at all. and flown away. Nice try, but I'm not buying it

       They cannot "take care of" your PCR.  That is a legal document which the attending personnel are legally obligated to fill out themselves.

       Also, the situation you described ends with you leaving the patient in the hands of an authority with less medical competence than yourself.  This is the very definition of patient abandonment, not to mention your utter failure to act as a patient advocate.  Additionally, no one else gets to decide where you take a patient, no one else gets to take over patient care without your permission, and no one gets to be abusive to one of your patients and get a free pass.

       why more discreet? This is a conspiracy website and only about 20% of the people actually believe him, with the majority either blatantly fighting to prove he is lying, or just saying he's lying....

       Assuming the story is based on an actual event, I think the question of who contacted dispatch is very interesting. So if it was just a psychotic person, he killed someone then called and turned himself in? If it was an actual MK Ultra victim, it could be plausible that he thought police would protect him, or at least serve as witnesses.

       Good point...if they wanted to "hide" the existence of this supposed MK Ultra puppet...WHY would they call the local ambulance, instead of just letting their guys take care of him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't the four MIB just have shown up to the house and taken him? That way no outsiders would have got involved. I don't like this sort of thing, because it makes conspiracists' look like fucking lunatics....

      <p>
       A professional Paramedic would not leave a patient in an underground carpark, with either the police or some strange dudes in suits. You are dedicated to protocol and the care of your patient...and that means handing them over to a certified medical staff etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally...wouldn't your dispatch want to know why their ambulance drove so far out of area?

       This was in Watertown? I live near there.. A few nights ago, we heard a huge boom that shook people's houses. But alas, they said it was some crazy guy that shot a ton of explosive targets, 3 boxes I believe. I wonder if it has any connection?

       Interesting story. What happened to the dead body? Was there a medical person to determine that they were dead? Would the body ordinarily be transported by EMS, or private mortuary, or coroner, or ..?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you think of any external references/citations to these events, e.g., media, police blotter/log, etc?

       The cops determined that he was dead when they got to him. I know that they did CPR but they still didn't want us going into the house because the scene was unsafe, so they declared him dead after a few minutes. I don't know the level of medical training that these cops had but I know that many cops are EMTs because you get a pay bonus for it. Usually the coroner takes away the body. I have literally no idea what happened to this body. Since it was a crime scene maybe they left it there? I just don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been checking the local media and I just can't find anything. I don't think that our police blotters are published online but I know that at the end of the month the publish the prior month's log in the police station. We also have our PCR copy (we filled most of it out on the way to the hospital before we were told not to finish) but even though it hasn't been submitted, those are extremely confidential. At some point in the future if nothing about this clears up I was thinking earlier today of filing a FOIA request for the PCR.

       What does your partner and any other witnesses think of this? Or your boss? Maybe contacting the PD that showed up and asking more through them. I personally don't think the go big or go home tactic would be effective here. What you perceive may be different than what actually happened, exposing everything without knowing exactly what happened could lead you to a world of shit.

       If your story is true, and I have no reason to doubt it, then it is very interesting. He could be nuts, but why all the fuss involving the feds? I would be nervous discussing the incident in public any farther if I were you. Sounds paranoid, but a lot of people have been disappeared lately.

       Yes, I'd be a little concerned myself.. I can't imagine it would be hard for them to triangulate this written account with an actual event that they can verify.. &amp; this place has definitely been under surveillance lately.

       Anyone who thinks this is legit is a fucking moron. The only way this story would be less believable would be if the OP said Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones got out of the helicopters with a talking pug.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this guy supposedly killed someone, presumably another "man in black" who was trying to take him for another round of MK Ultra mind control brainwashing classes. This also supposedly happened in some way out rural area where homes are a good mile+ apart from one another... So who the hell called the cops? The guy that did the killing? Why would he do something that stupid if he didn't want to be apprehended by the authorities? You could kill a man in a secluded rural area like the OP described and be at minimum a days travel away from there before anyone discovered the body. I see why the OP picked a secluded rural area for his little fiction though, it makes it easier for conspiratards to accept there being a convenient lack of witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if the MiB are going to show up in two military helicopters (which by the way, apparently took over an hour to arrive, despite the fact that the hospital the EMTs took this guy too was an hour and a half away and "close to a military base" - it would have never taken them that long to arrive by helicopter if they were that close by) why the hell would they then trust these random EMTs and yokel cops to escort this guy to the hospital? Why not just take over and load him into one of the copters and transport him themselves?

       As for conspiratards, sorry bro. I'm not saying everyone who believes in conspiracy theories is an idiot. What I am saying is that there are quite a few idiots who will buy into anything without giving it a single critical thought. Ignoring my post because I bothered to question the validity of this story (and provided plenty of examples as to why it is
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       bullshit - none of which your comment addresses) makes you seem like one of the idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a place for conspiracies, there is a lot to be said for questioning official stories, etc etc... But taking a story like this at face value and not bothering to apply a single ounce of critical thinking to it makes you a conspiratard.

       bullshit. All of it. Anybody's who's spent a lot of time on /x/ recognizes it. Some really creative people write shit like this all the time - creative people with way too much time on their hands.

       I've been reading the comments on this post for a while now. Everything is falling into one of two categories: people assume this is bullshit or people think it MIGHT have happened and you MAY be telling the truth. What gets me about the responses is the fact that so many people on this sub are willing to believe stuff that's ridiculous but never take any one persons first hand accounts seriously. If there is conspiracies, certain people in the general public will be involved somehow at some point. Why don't they come forward? Because everyone calls bullshit.  I am enthralled by your account and would really like updates and some proof of what went down that night because it sounds incredibly insane. I do, however, think its entirely possible that this indeed happen. Some comments mentioned it sounds like a movie or a tv show...but where do movies and tv shows get their ideas from? Some of their ideas are exaggerated first hand accounts from people who have seen the "suits" doing these kinds of things or from narcs and whistle blowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just keep us posted. Be careful. And I would blow the news up with this story. I work in healthcare and I know HIPAA is a monster but there has to  be ways around that somehow. You had people with you at the scene who can corroborate and it would be interesting to hear from them as well. I am looking forward to more posts/followups/whatever from you so we can actually determine if you're just a fantastic writer (I was totally immersed in your post and you have awesome literary skills) or if this did indeed happen. I am leaning towards it actually happening but it would be nice to have more information.

We finally get to the hospital, and the patient is just freaking out. We don't care."

       It's funny how all the information was realised only by the Police.. and it's strange that the deputy shot him instead aresting him... and how strange that the victim knew he will gonna die.
Looks like a well played covered-up assasination.
not to mention that both of those profiles which commented on the story are not real... o.0

       I'm guessing that since what OP witnessed is essentially a state sponsored kidnapping, there were too many witnesses at the crime scene and the "handover" or whatever had to be done somewhere more discreet.
      </p>
      <p>
       From some of the other stories I've read, and from what I've read about MK Ultra, I believe this. I actually think this sort of scenario happens way more often than you'd think, only this time it seems the subject got out of control, maybe killed his handler instead of the target he was programmed to kill.

       If this is true, they are doing a DAMN good job.  The recent Aurora and Sandy Hook "Conspiracies" have me questioning whether any of the alternative theories I've ever read have had any shred of truth.  I mean...if these people are the same people questioning JFK and 911, it makes the official accounts of those events look like gospel.

       SCOP-DEX is a combination of Scopolamine (0.4 mg) and Dexedrine (5 mg) tablets. They give it to astronauts. Scopolamine causes amnesia and loss of will. Dexedrine heightens psychosis. I can't think of a substance that would be more appropriate for coercing another to commit mass murder.

       anyone that upvoted this story is a moron.  op couldve posted his first responder patch, but instead he posts a simple piece of paper that he couldve made in MSPaint.   Also Richard Daines is DEAD and has been DEAD for almost 2 YEARS.  He has also has not been the health commissioner of NY since 2010!

       If you witnessed a kidnapping and you're fretting about HIPPA &amp; patient privacy, you are an idiot.  If you have offered up your HIPPA concern as an excuse to get out of providing confirmatory details you are, of course, a fraud.

       If the patient was awake, and unharmed, then why did they need you as an ambulance? If there were so many cops there, and the patient was not wounded (I can only assume because you didn't note giving him any medical treatment, which to me should be included), then why did they even need you in the first place, they could have put the dude in one of their helicopters, or black suburbans, or a regular squad car. I'm calling bullshit too.

       Searching for news around towns outside of Watertown, I came across this news article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oswego (WSYR-TV) -- The U.S. Coast Guard has ended its search for whatever may or may not have been in the waters of Lake Ontario Thursday night.
The U.S. Coast Guard says it began its search in the Oswego Harbor area of Lake Ontario after receiving a call concerning an object in the water.
The Coast Guard initiated an emergency response in the area, which included a helicopter dropping illumination flares.
That search activity and the flares being dropped prompted numerous calls to the Oswego Police Department from concerned neighbors claiming to see "fireballs in the sky." Police officials contacted the Coast Guard and confirmed they were related to the search. The flares did not pose any danger to area residents, police said.
Nothing was found during the search.

       The credentials look like they had been lost for quite some time, either that or you are a very grubby individual. The wear pattern and 
asymmetrical staining and de-lamination do not look consistent with a card that must be renewed often. The wear looks suspiciously consistent with something that has been exposed to weather. This is not the type of card that needs to be pulled in and out of a wallet as an atm card would, so the de- lamination is suspect,as is the coloration of the stain/dirt. EMT's are clean individuals for the most part, this is not sitting in the pocket of a brick layer. Also your language used is "baitish". But I commend you for your fictional writing skills and sincerity, I think you should develop it into a pilot.

       OP probably should covertly (face to face, no phone) get someone to act on your behalf if something happens to you. As may happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Identify the property where this happened and pass the data to someone who can eventually pass it to a reporter who could research who the place belonged to. I doubt the CIA owned it directly but it will be good to know who does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume all records of this will be scrubbed from police records under an order from very high up. If that happens, it will be clear this black op had high support. And no legit counter terrorism operation would require duct taping the guy's mouth shut to keep him from splillng to EMTs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was out in the country and isolated, who called in the cops though?

       Well it was his home, and the patient voluntarily gave us his name, age, SSN, and everything like that. In the rare instances where he was calm he was fairly cooperative. Most of the time though he was frantically blathering.

       The big question is: why didn't these suits take them in their helicopter to begin with? Makes no sense to make two EMTs and three cops bus a dude two hours away to a hospital only to be told to go to a garage where more suits take him away.

       This has happened to me a few times before.  Except I'm not an EMT.  Nor was I at a crime scene, and there weren't helicopters there.  Or guys in suits.

      <p>
       But the part about a bunch of guys in the car and ending up in a hospital parking garage at around 4 AM and someone getting called a faggot.  This has totally happened to me more than once.  Especially the end which is
       <em>

       I don't buy it, I wanted to but there's too many holes and like someone else said it seems to be a repost. HOWEVER, nothing in this scenario would violate the law, and likely plays out much like this except the entities involved probably have their own EMS vehicles in most jurisdictions staffed by "black suits" (though they surely don't always where suits, that too seemed a bit played out I felt like) anyway this scenario would be entirely LEGAL under current US law!!! I feel like it serves as a fictional reminder of the capabilities the law (drafted and voted on by our elected leadership) grants the powers that be to engage in malicious activities.

       I won't ask you to specify where in Upstate NY you are from, but here in Syracuse I have been seeing a LOT of unmarked vehicles, suburbans with full tinted windows and just generally shady seemingly secret-operations going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a marketer and product designer, I know that Syracuse is a huge test market for new products like food and drink. This is due to a very even-spread of all sorts of demographics. It wouldn't escape reason to think that these areas in and around Syracuse would be a test market for public reaction to secret operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could never be certain, because secret ops are, well, secret. Just thought I'd add some credence.

       This story could be bait thrown out to round up certain folks on here. Or a social experiment to see what kind of advice is given to provide insights into what "careful" folks are using to protect their anonymity online.

       So, why didn't the suits accompany the patient during the ambulance ride? I'm also very dissapointed that the men in black would use language that soundsvery much like it was taken out of the mouth of a typical 13 year old playing call of duty.

       You tell us this story but will not give any information as to where it occurred; however, you identity yourself as one of the EMTs that transported the individual. I imagine there was two or three of you. Thus, if this truly did happen, why keep the detail of where it occurred secret because the Men In Black know exactly who you are. It isn't against any laws to tell us information like where it occurred.

       I am agreeing with others here. I think this is BS. I would like for it to be real, since it is a cool story, but then again it is really scary if it is real. Also, people are saying you were in Watertown, and you had to drive 1.5 hrs to get there. I live about 1.5 hrs from Watertown, but to the south, so it could have been anywhere. This is really cool and interesting but unfortunately I am calling bull.

       You turned the patient over to a bunch of random thugs in a black car, but now you have the sensitivity to protect the patient's personal details? How nice of you.

       Sorry, but you violated both the law and medical ethics when you turned the patient over to people who a) had no apparent medical training, certainly not at a level higher than yours, b) were not affiliated with the medical system in which you operate, and c) obviously did not have the patient's best interests in mind.

       Hi scaredemt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been researching this subject for a few years now. Didn't really have a choice. Long story, much of which you can find here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://mccoyote.Wordpress.com">
        http://mccoyote.Wordpress.com
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       See especially the Black Boot Diaries, Squidgate, and NKINTRA tags.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give you an idea of what we are talking about, James Eagan Holmes' (shooter in the movie theater) father is Robert Holmes, a noted statistician in California. He was supposed to testify before Congress about the LIBOR scandal (several multinational banks committed tax fraud against the US) before his son, a NEUROSCIENTIST, went postal.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give you an idea of what else is going on:
      </p>
      <p>
       Thomas Drake, former NSA and whistleblower says that his former co-workers created phony threats in order to make money off of it. See Washington Post's expose "Top Secret America." We outsourced the intel/security sector pretty hard after 9/11. Of course there isn't actually enough for all of them to do, so some are creating their own troubles in order to pretend to be the heroes and rake in the Federal cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 itself was a false-flag attack. At the center of that and the shootings is a technology that has been around for decades, is not even classified, and yet hardly anyone has heard of it. Voice-to-skull, V2K, V2S, the radiowave or microwave hearing effect, and sometimes as synthetic telepathy. It works. It's real. And it is also capable of sending subliminal audio to someone's head. Subliminals work. Congress in August of 1984 held hearings on its uses and potential abuses. They had already found then that shoplifting could be curbed by using subliminals in stores. What we have here is the opposite, using subliminals to increase violence. They also do some psychological operations in order to harass the target first, to make them "crazy" and then push them in the direction desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some other things happening...
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh says that seven or eight generals, all of them neoconservatives and rather radical Catholics, have essentially taken over the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is preparing all US airports for drones. You know, those pilotless machines we use to spy on and kill Al Qaeda.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course more domestic violence than we have ever seen. Designed to frighten us into handing over all our rights to the very people responsible for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, several multnational banks have also been charged with funding terrorism and the international drug trade. Senate reports on both of those exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       DoD and CIA have both been dosing detainees with mefloquine, a supposed anti-malarial drug, but it also causes serious mental health issues. Combined with torture, the only feasible goal is to create false intelligence in order to keep the 9/11 cash cow mooing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they have essentially taken over Hollywood as well. Our supposed hotbed of liberalism now glorifies torture. I believe these entities have also tested similar drugs on US citizens. See the article on so-called Truman's syndrome at Huffington Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there were the eight or nine cannibalism events supposedly due to "bath salts."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the fact that these acts are so unthinkable that prevents most of us from accepting that it is being done. It is. See the document on OPERATION NORTHWOODS to get an idea what these people really think about US citizens. They planned to shoot down a plane full of US college students and frame Cuba for it in order to gain public support for invading that country.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the official record on MKULTRA, forget it. They ALWAYS do what is known as a limited hangout. See the new Bourne movie. Describes in various ways how they hide the big picture by exposing a small part, claim it was a small anomaly, that it actually made us safer. Shuts Congress up quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have to dig a bit on my blog. I tend to post regularly and sometimes just use dark humor to vent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be well.

       If it's fiction, it is very well-written fiction. I've editorially read a lot, tons, of fiction attempts and when people construct fictional events they almost always take certain shortcuts that can be seen.  The OP's accounting however rings very real. alt1's dismissal of it as poorly written is not justifiable.

       Although I find this interesting, I looked at the areas surrounding the bases that I know of in upstate NY - Watertown (near Ft Drum), Rome (near Rome Laboratories), and Saratoga Springs (near Saratoga Springs NSU).  Looking at the hospitals in those cities, it doesn't appear that any of them have an underground parking area based on how the road/driveways are around the building.  So, unless there's some base that I'm not aware of in upstate NY, the description of the hospital doesn't fit.

       There's also West Point, and there is a military hospital there as well as a civilian hospital on the other side of the Hudson.  No street view though. As far as basing it on the roads you see around the hospital, unless you go into street view (not sure if you did) you're not going to see the hospital driveways, just the roads surrounding it.

       OP should probably try and give us some more information. If this is true, the Feds are going to have him captured by today's end regardless of what he posts. All they have to do is put together the pieces of a very simple puzzle. They just need to find mention of a high-profile case in upstate NY last night where the suspect was taken to a hospital and then taken away by the MIB, and then figure out every EMT that was in that ambulance. They won't even need to find out which one of you it was, they'll kidnap all of you just to make sure.

       He's not an EMT.

       The card he posted was for a "certified first responder" which is someone who's taught CPR,some very basic first aid and how to take vitals.

       It's not unheard of for them to be on an ambulance crew, but in most cases they'd be up front, driving, while an EMT or paramedic was in the back.

       EMT here... Holy shit man. How exciting and terrifying. I'm glad you guys are ok, but file an incident report with your supervisor. You'll be expected to write a pcr too I imagine, as your company needs a record either way, even if its a dry run right?

       Well, what happened with the jewels or the tetrahedron..  Just enough information here to prod a good story..  What type of ambulance crew are you part of?  Fire,private, hospital?  Not many hospital crews left, most are private owned or through the FD.
      </p>

       Also, patient privacy has nothing to do with location..  I understand specific addresses but you can tell people what city/town and what hospital..

       the only thing we can do, is wait for something to happen. if the crazy man is the suspect and OP sees it; then it gets interesting. OP, come back after the next supposed false flag.

       Well if you dont post your details how is anyone going to protect you?  You should tell your family and friends this story.  If the Men in black are all powerful they know who was in the van with their man and all your details they got the plate number of the ambulance and all that.. sure you have a name tag?.  You posting this story you have already given yourself up and let them know what you told us. may as well put it all out there.

       Additional note. The part about being trained is probably BS. As I said, the subliminals and just repetition of having someone's voice in your head saying things over and over, using things in your life that have other explanation, etc. can make someone think they are an assassin. The subliminal audio message portion is a bit like hypnotism. In order to get someone to defy their internal moral code, to break their internalized social mores, takes something additional. If you can convince them that they have already killed, it becomes easier to overcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll find, should you read it, a chapter at the end of
       <em>
        A Terrible Mistake
       </em>
       by H.P. Albarelli, wherein he says he has been contacted by many people claiming to be "forgetful" hypnotized assassins. Yet not one can identify a single target they have killed. That's because they haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, most likely scenario (assuming this isn't all made up... "We're taking this faggot" is just too precious) is that this guy was drugged, harassed, and directed via V2K to do what he did. Apart from being hypnotism, it is also remote torture. None of it requires hands on conditioning and it can work on anyone pretty much. They ruin the target's life and harass him or her repeatedly over time until they crack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress provides no meaningful oversight of the intel, security and defense portions of our government. This is the chickens coming home to roost. It is not coincidental that Fort Detrick was peopled by Nazis brought in by OPERATION PAPERCLIP after WWII. We now have or soon will (depending on one's definition) fascism in the US. The unholy alliance of the DoD and multinational corporations who want to destroy this country and likely Europe with it in order to create a cheap labor, corporate controlled hemisphere. Only a matter of time before that is the whole globe.

       On the surface it would appear as if a man was taken away and made to disappear without too much fuss. If what you said is 100% true I am willing to bet the man who was shouting about MK-ultra and all that stuff knows what he was dealing with and in for. Its not the government itself that carries out these operations. Its groups that operate higher than the government. They can hijack your brain, re-program you and use you to cause mass panic. That's both sad and terrifying that people are conspiring to manipulate and control their fellow man through false flag attacks. I cannot even begin to understand how a mind becomes that evil. I know people arent THAT bad and we really want to try and get along but forcing violence to happen prevents us from living as one because I "shouldnt trust my neighbor."

       I don't see why this wouldn't be exactly what the guy claimed it was.  You have a guy claiming that he was part of MK-Ultra that is getting some kind of very bizarre special treatment.  Can you try to tell us as much of what he said as possible...even if it seems like gibberish.

       Argh. Even if this is fake, it can

       If anyone believes this, you should do some serious soul searching. You are either dangerously naive, or legally retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed a trend in recent years concerning conspiracies, starting with the 9/11 truthers: I think there is a concerted effort - a conspiracy, if you will - to 'spam' the Conspiracy Community with the most retarded drivel and easily debunked theories in order to discredit the ENTIRE community...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...maybe this HAS to be done because the N.W.O. are making their final push for complete control and they need Conspiracy theorists to be distracted and whipped up in a frenzy over red herrings.

       There are a lot of comments arguing whether this is truth or fiction, which is disturbing. I want to live in a world where everyone knows this is fiction without having to debate it.

       There's a software package that allows one user to pretend to be several. Intel agencies use it to influence public opinion. Some of those who out-of-hand suggested it's false may be one of those. They call it damage control. I call it cover-up.

       So. The guy who you took to the hospital, was being trained. He woke up mid trance and killed the trainer. He might be used for the next false flag, or he might be deemed a failure.

       So you report everything about a case which if real should be easy to verify with news reports(there aren't exactly a lot of military bases in upstate NY).  But you won't give the town or a link to a police/news report to maintain patient privacy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mate you've already fucked over patient privacy if what you say is true since it will take 0 time at all to cross reference a murder in upstate new york with your story given the events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily for you no such murders appear anywhere in the police blotters or news so you're probably lying.

       was "Question everything except for a fabulously extreme story from a new poster with no evidence to back it up, cause thats obviously true".

      <p>
       Lets see, he was in a house alone in the middle of no where with his handler and he killed him.  Who called the cops?  If it was the handler wouldn't he have called his buddies with the helicopter first?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second he was in the house with his handler and hes involved in a murder and they ask who the body is?  Clearly their handler would have let them know if it wasn't him yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       They scream and intimidate him.  Why not just gag him again?
      </p>
      <p>
       They show up in 2 black suburbans to collect him after having the ambulance drive him an hour and a half to a hospital before he can even go in.  Why not just throw him in the helicopter in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       They try to take patient, cop says no they say "We don't give a fuck what you say" and the cop doesn't try to stop them or demand clearance?

       If what you say here is true (and it seems to me like it is) then what we have here is a serious indication that the Sandy Hook massacre was very much what so many in this subreddit have a great, great feeling it was:  A false flag attack.  It apparently used MK-ULTRA influence to accomplish its ends and, very likely similar to Aurora, involved various MK-ULTRA subjects (some possibly kids) that were manipulated/brainwashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is some SEEEERIOUSLY deep shit, ladies and gentlemen.  We live in a VERY real world of very real fucked up, manipulated shit.

       I don't want you to freak out too much, but you need to be
       <em>

       careful in terms of how much of this you let out.  We here in this subreddit appreciate your information more than just about anyone in this entire website, but definitely don't go out of your way to give too much information that can cause anyone to pinpoint you anymore than is already the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, my good man:  You're dealing with an organization that is not only willing to slaughter dozens of innocent men and women in Aurora and entire classrooms of young children in CO just to further their agenda, but that is globally powerful and far-reaching enough in their influence to have pretty much full command of the MSM in this country so that they can get the talking heads on tv to say

        anything

       they want whenever they want them to say it.

      <p>
       How difficult a time do you think this kind of power would have in finding out about - and subsequently "dealing" with - an anonymous NY state EMT who they just found out might know more than he should about a topic they are currently trying to keep VERY controlled and that they are having to exercise a
       <em>
        GREAT

       deal damage control on?

      <p>
       I don't say any of this to overly scare you or be some sort of moronic fear monger.  No.  I

        do
       </em>
       say this so that you can be very mindful of your surroundings at this point though.  Don't just walk around in your day "blissfully unaware" willy nilly like.

       E.S.P. is impossible? So there is no chance that my brain can act like a radio transceiver somehow? You have the manual and specs on that you can show me? Pretty large claim. Physics PROVES it is possible for data to be transmitted remotely, not disproves. Recent studies about particle entanglement further support such concepts like ESP being possible if not likely to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind control  and conditioning reactions and responses is easily plausible. We aren't talking about hooking them up to a remote control like a car, we are talking about acquiring a desired action given a certain stimuli. You've been conditioned to shit on a toilet, don't tell me you couldn't be conditioned to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       HAARP isn't necessarily controlling the weather, but it is clearly within our power to cause weather changes in local area (nuclear bombs exploding change weather). Sometimes all it takes is a a small force to gain a huge desired reaction . Like a light tap on a boulder to get it rolling down a hill. You can not prove with physics that weather control is impossible.

       Actually, it's very true, in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Encrypted channels are extremely uncommon to the point I've only encountered them with the Secret Service field office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the local police do use encryption on one of the tactical channels used for ESU/SWAT, but the dispatch channels are clear as are the other "tactical" channels used when a major accident/incident is being worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's done that way largely because of limitations of encryption and due to interoperability with other agencies/jurisdictions from the way it's been explained to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a lot of reporters, it's also a moot point.
      </p>
      <p>
       At several of my previous publications, the cops reporter is often given office space in police headquarters/city hall which is convenient for a lot of reasons, but it means there's access to police radios rather than just scanners.

       I admit my ignorance of this whole "tracing exit nodes" thing that you just brought up here.  Could you explain that further so that I and others can better understand and see if what you say is really viable and possible?  Since I'm not aware of "exit node tracing" and am ignorant of anything like that, perhaps you can educate on just how that would be possible - as I absolutely ALWAYS thought that using a TOR browser makes it extremely difficult to track one's identity.  It functions on a "cloud" system, no? so that the exact location of any one user cannot be pinpointed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain then please how it is that even under these circumstances one's identity could be tracked.  I am interested to know, so that if I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       ignorant of the fact that TOR browsers
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       as anonymous as many claim, I can correct this mistaken impression (if, again, it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a mistaken one int he first place).
      </p>

       Regardless of how much of a moron you might seem to me (or me to you), one thing is certain:  I am NOT some sort of "cointelpro" type as you allege.  If you really think this, go ahead and look at my posting history.  You'll see quickly that although I can be (and often am) a flagrant asshole that is in no way afraid to call somebody out on something, I am not some sort of cointelpro type.  I am VERY much against all the stupid shit TPTB are doing/have done.

       I thought about this as well. I just kept reading "MK Ultra" "They still do MK Ultra". Well they might, but I doubt they call it MK Ultra anymore is what I was thinking.
