<p>We are living in an interesting time, though, when there are still a handful of people around who have a lot of money made during the computer boom, and who have not yet bought into the status quo of the &quot;evil&quot; elite.

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a given choice as much as by design.  It&#39;s a false dichotomy that you present.  We don&#39;t have to choose between fucking over the now living or the not-yet born.  To think that we can even choose is egotism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that we could DEFINITELY benefit from some help for sure, but in the end, it is <em>us</em> that have to do everything and figure things out on our own.  That&#39;s just the way it is and it&#39;s definitely one of the reasons - as some have wondered - why our &quot;alien space brothers&quot; haven&#39;t &quot;come down and saved us all!!&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because if we are this obstinate and ignorant and violent and stupid to have gotten ourselves in this mess to begin with, then using anything other than our OWN autonomous resolve to save this civilization would not cause us to learn and would ultimately do nothing but continue to lead us toward our own unerring demise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are we speculating on the idea of a benevolent group that is diametrically opposed to a &quot;Global governance&quot;... is that the actual question you pose?</p>

<p>Hmm, I would hope so but this isn&#39;t a comic book and I couldn&#39;t imagine that such a person/group would have the funds/power to do so. To have funds and power to oppose something so grand you would have to be part of the same system that produces the power and resources... Unless you believe in a purely benevolent entity such as Christ.  It is not a novel idea by any means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think evil exists and I don&#39;t think there is any clandestine group running the world as conspiracists describe. But it&#39;s an interesting question and it coincides with a thought I&#39;ve been stirring for a while.</p>

<p>If you go back a very long time there is some evidence of a group or groups of benevolent &#39;elites&#39;. Many societies on almost every continent claim that agriculture, astronomy (as it relates to seasons and growing food), hygiene etc were taught to them by a group of outsiders after a tremendous cataclysm. The evidence is very flimsy by scientific standards but it exists in so many unconnected records that it can&#39;t be completely dismissed IMO. Science does acknowledge that things like art, symbolism and sophisticated thought (i.e maths, logic, religion etc) seem to have come to humanity very suddenly and the evidence of their development isn&#39;t very strong.</p>

<p>So if we assume that these groups of teachers did exist (ten thousand and more years ago), and if we assume that they were not aliens (like some TV shows like to claim), then who were they and what happened to them?</p>

<p>Who they were is generally attributed to an Atlantis type civilization. Somewhere that had enough stability over a long enough period of time to value and develop scientific and artistic knowledge and urbanize their population. This is in comparison to how the rest of the world must have been living at that time, which was likely feudal, nomadic and survivalistic. So after much of humanity was wiped out in a cataclysm, only that one sophisticated society had the means to go and try to help the survivors.</p>

<p>Where they went to after their task was done is completely speculative but I can&#39;t help but think that <em>if</em> the stories of benevolent teachers from an ancient high civilization are true - then part of that civilization must have continued after the cataclysm. We&#39;re talking thousands of years in the past so for them to still be a group or organization today would be very unlikely - but not impossible if you consider the age of some religions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost convinced that these teachers did exist, but I&#39;ve never found anything about what happened to them afterwards. So if there is some benevolent group of elites out there today, I&#39;d like to think they have some connection to our very distant past.</p>

<p>But I really doubt it. IME people act from self-interest. There doesn&#39;t need to be a group of either bad guys or good guys for bad or good things to happen on a global scale. Just follow the money and the power, don&#39;t get sidetracked by stories of Illuminati running things. That&#39;s just a distraction. You can come to a very reasonable and informed conclusion by following who gets the money and the power. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there are no groups of &#39;bad guys&#39; or &#39;good guys&#39; because there certainly are. I&#39;m saying be careful who you give power to because if you give it all away you&#39;ll have none left. Power is taken from people, it doesn&#39;t grow from the ground, and it&#39;s not something you can be taught. Governments only have power because we give it to them, and it&#39;s the same story with police. But at least they are mostly accountable to us. If you give your power to shadowy organizations that you aren&#39;t really sure even exist - your life becomes a mess, you feel helpless, not in control etc. And who benefits from that, who gets the money and the power in that case? Not the Illuminati but the same govt, the same police, the same media companies, the same old groups that push this conspiracy agenda of world control by dark elites.</p>
