       First of all, noone was allowed inside school for hours, media was already there by the time they started to clear out. If there is a picture of Adam taken away like he's about to be hospitalized i don't think they stacked all those children in some cart like animals and took them all out so noone will notice, someone for sure would see those 20 bodies, it's a big number.

       Some of what is presented here might be useful evidence.  This is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       My assumption is that whoever it is is handling this case is at least as smart as I am.  Well, if I were handling it, the very last thing I'd allow people to see would be twenty little body bags coming out of a school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?  Because it's appallingly macabre.  Because it would instantly flood the wire services all over the world.  Because it would be unutterably traumatic for the kids in the class who weren't killed, and even worse for the parents of the kids who were killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be frank, I can't see why you are expecting this, nor why you consider it any sort of evidence.  For example, did we see body bags coming out of the Aurora, Colorado "Batman" massacre?  I actually had trouble finding pictures of body bags coming out of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       recent massacre - which I assume is just "law enforcement doing the jobs."
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: consider that there were almost no injured in the Jonestown Massacre where 909 people died, or the Waco, TX siege where 76 died...

       I wasn't being shitty to you, you found a pic at least! I didn't. I'm saying the perpetrators of this psy-op didn't show us anything tangible. The parents were only shown photos of their kids faces... They took the kids bodies out at night?.. Too many things are fishy

       Which evidence? His dead mother, the guns in his trunk, his dead body, the guns near his body and eyewitness testimony. All of this is a preponderance of the evidence, I believe.

      <p>
       And I got this information from police press conferences.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course initial reporting will be less reliable. They ignore the first rules of journalism in order to get a leg up on the competition. As time goes on, reporting strengthens and becomes more reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, the media is generally deserving of trust, and I'm saying that knowing full well you and your fellow "truth seekers" will dismiss me out of hand because of that belief.

       First, themandotcom's question - "How is a theoretical book from almost a century ago relevant to the specifics of this case?" is bang on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Few people who come here are under any doubt that the US government, and every government, makes heavy use of propaganda to try cause the rest of us to believe false statements.  I certainly believe that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's take that as a given, shall we?
      </p>
      <p>
       It still seems you're being completely evasive in your argument.  themandotcom asks you, "What evidence do you have specifically that the information we got from Sandy Hook is false?" and you direct him to a book from 1928.  He is understandably not convinced, and instead of providing actual, concrete information about
       <em>
        this specific case
       </em>
       you get more and more shrill about how this aging book is totally relevant right now.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why do you conspiratard trolls come on here anyway? Just for kicks I suppose.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When you use words like "conspiritard" I wonder how old you are...
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of people like me who are aware that a significant chunk of what we get from the media isn't true, and that we are getting systematically lied to by our own governments.  We come here to try to figure out what is true and what isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, we get very few facts and a lot of people saying, "Read this book from 1928!  This proves that this news story from 2012 is completely false! And if you ask me for specifics, I won't discuss it, but I'll call you childish names!"

       You write very well for a sixteen-year-old!  Had I known, I'd have been a lot more tolerant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key point is that pretty well everyone here has directly or indirectly understood the key lessons of Bernays - that governments use people's conformity and laziness of thought to manufacture consensus stories that have no basis in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, most news articles are going to be more or less true, simply because it's too much work and too risk to manufacture everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular, you need to remember that these people usually aren't that bright, and that they actually believe that they are doing the right thing.  Such people can justify killing brown people to themselves all day long - when it comes to killing American toddlers, particularly white American toddlers from an affluent neighborhood, they aren't going to be able to pull off the requisite level of double-think.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have to ask - what's in it for them?  What's the risk vs. reward profile?  Would it really be worth the incredible shitstorm that would occur if they were caught vs. "influencing gun policy" (which is pretty abstract)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take something like "the killing of Osama Bin Laden."  This is a prime candidate for "a conspiracy".  Considering you're talking about a compound full of Al Qaeda supporters, your average CIA drone would consider anything, no matter how vile, as morally OK.  And there are plenty of very juicy reasons you might want to do it - for example, if you'd discovered that Bin Laden was already dead, you'd certainly want to mount a fraud because otherwise "he'd have gotten away forever" - big black eye for America!
      </p>
      <p>
       So it scores low on the scale of "offending a CIA person", low on "risk" and high on "reward" - exactly the reverse of Sandy Hook!

       You mean there's no evidence on reddit? There were 2 wounded and numerous survivors who ran out of the school while it was going on. There are plenty of witnesses, they are mostly children and the few adults aren't talking to reporters. Can you blame them?

       The CIA are certainly evil, and have done all sorts of evil things under the banner of "national security" - and broken the law to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is quite different.  We're talking about killing 20 American first-graders - and for what?  To influence the political process?  Seems pretty abstract to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people in the CIA believe that they're being patriotic Americans when they commit their crimes.  This crime is not consistent with that idea.

       This conversation dies here because you don't have the necessary information to run these circles and have a decent conversation/discussion with me. That's not being offensive either, but its a waste of time for me to try and talk to you when you don't even know who William Cooper is.

       There are dozens of William Coopers, how am I supposed to know which one you're talking about? Anyway, some dude talking to the FBI doesn't show that the government killed the kids in Sandy Hook. There is no evidence that the government killed the kids in Sandy Hook, but you don't really care about that. You just want to believe.

       I know who William Cooper is - I have a copy of Behold A Pale Horse on my bookshelf, which I read for the first time over 20 years ago.  (I have to say that when I attempted to read it again recently, it did not stand up, at least partly because it was full of specific predictions for the future that have not in fact panned out...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Honest question for you - if you're not willing to provide information to help someone who is honestly interested in listening to what you have to say, how do you expect to convince your average person?

       I don't feel the need to "convince" anyone of anything. That's my point. I want people to start taking responsibility and accountability for themselves and learn for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not here to be your guiding light in the darkness. I want people to wake the fuck up and start making decisions and coming to conclusions on what they feel in their gut.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be interested in helping and discussing with people once they have researched up to a certain point. Like I said I am tired of trolls and conspiritards who know nothing of the conspiracy world then try and make fools of us. Its my vetting process so to speak.

       He asked you a perfectly reasonable question, "Which William Cooper do you mean?", and you proceeded to mount a personal attack on him and ignore all his other reasonable questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the book has almost nothing to do with this massacre.  Your argument seems to be that Cooper claimed the United States was going to bring in gun control, and that this massacre might be used to attempt to bring in gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, Cooper predicted a lot of things, and almost all of them haven't come true - and many of them had specific dates attached to them.  And thousands of writers have suggested that the US will try to bring in gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to discredit his argument because he hasn't heard of some specific writer mentioning gun control is illogical.

       "Okay, so what? I don't believe that this even occurred. I also don't know who William Cooper is." Is what he said first
      </p>
      <p>
       and this is what he said second
"There are dozens of William Coopers, how am I supposed to know which one you're talking about? "
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said ...there is 1 William Cooper in the conspiracy world. JUST 1...not 2 or 3 or 4 or even 5...JUST 1
      </p>
      <p>
       So he didn't ask a perfectly good question and I didn't ignore it and attack him..but nice job taking what we both said out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point STILL stands...For respect of others don't open your mouth when you don't even have basic info on a subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       This attack does have to do with Cooper because Cooper always talked about 2 things..Taking away our guns and taking away our freedoms.

       well the victims were CHILDREN they were small and could not take a bullet, this is similiar to to amish schoolhouse shooting a while back, except on a larger scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes perfect sense that in this case they would have more dead then alive.

       they were also shot at close range w/ an AR-15, i think the answer is a combination of the fact that kids were victims and weapons are getting more lethal. (also it was close range)
      </p>
      <p>
       Again this is similar to the Amish Schoolhouse Shooting a few years ago. (Tragic event in both cases)

       The round in an AR-15 has been around for 60 years.  It's not getting more lethal.  A .223 round is actually small compared to most rifle rounds.  But close range, high velocity and small target makes it not really matter.  I still think it's a hoax though.

       well to be devil's advocate and believe me I respect the loss of ones family, if it were portrayed that this is all for gun control cause kids being shot are a bigger thing, body bags being passed by media would really hit home for a lot of people. It is reasoned they didnt out of respect for the parents. it gets twisted when you really think about it. and again i dont mean disrespect to you friends family.

       This is the United States of America, not international news agencies which may be bolder or have no censorship laws or control boards like exist in the USA.

       How about the children that survived leaving the school? There is not one picture or video (even though the media was all over the place) of students/teachers/parents in the parking lot around the school. Out of 600 students, the only picture we are given is the single file line of ~25 students and two teachers.

       Give me a break. There were no students in that school on 12/14.

       I'm not quite sure why this is "strange".
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the claim that all the children's bodies had multiple bullet wounds in them, this would only indicate that the alleged shooter was more systematic than some others have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems pretty consistent with the story we so far get - "shoot a lot of people, finish off the wounded, shoot self".
      </p>
      <p>
       And in fact, "everyone dead" is quite common in smaller-scale massacres.  Look at the second Colorado massacre of a few days ago - four dead, zero wounded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questioning claims by the authorities that are dubious is perfectly reasonable - I don't see why this is at all dubious.

       I doubt a 5.56 or a .223 would leave a small child with much chance of survival. Even if ALS was there imediately, the damage caused by that round wouldn't leave much to work with, also, children bleed out much faster than adults.
