        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi everyone. How are you today? Great.</p>

<p>So very recently following the whole Sandy Hook shooting, I noticed a lot of people talking about how crazy Alex Jones is, and I wanted to point out...</p>

<p>If you were someone who knew the truth, and the truth was, that everything was a lie... wouldn&#39;t you yourself go a little crazy? That is, not to mention people constantly telling you &quot;NO, YOU&#39;RE WRONG&quot; when you are completely positive it is fact? Also, yes Alex Jones may have acted a bit weird, but everything he said was true, and he had FBI statistics to prove it. Somehow, this didn&#39;t matter to Piers, who i actually somewhat respected before that interview (and the one with Jesse Ventura, who the crowed seemed to be very for, not against to my suprise). So yes, gun crime went down... very well. But did crime in general? NO! In fact it went up, which is what Alex Jones was trying to say. Because now, more people will be getting robbed, since they can&#39;t defend themselves or their property. Someone can come with a baseball bat now. Kill you with that instead. Which is what seems to be happening in the ever growing crime in England. I&#39;m talking from a place where guns aren&#39;t normal in public (Toronto, Canada). Just wanted to share my thoughts on why Alex Jones is probably crazy (which I think he is). Crazy people though aren&#39;t usually wrong. In fact many crazy people are more intelligent than the average &quot;Normal&quot; person.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> forgot to mention that a majority of the gun crime (i would assume both in the UK and US) was illegal guns and gang related. Not legal, and regular working class citizen/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is not crazy. He is pissed off at the complacency of the Government and the people who don&#39;t care. He is passionate about what he speaks and retaining our liberties. As a result he comes across very angry and loud to the sheeple or the people who call him &quot;crazy&quot;. Morgan is is enemy and I am sure he had been looking for that format to tell him off for a long time. IMO he kind of blew the opportunity to come out ahead, but Morgan came across badly as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although he is a bit crazy and who could blame him for being so, especially when not every persons personalities are identical.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t really the issue. When something as big as being accepted to be interviewed on national television to discuss something quite controversial comes around; it&#39;s on the person to compose themselves as being reasonable, appropriate (especially in this instance) and it&#39;s required of the person to be as calm and precise as possible with delivery of information, not for us but for the general public who have no inkling of the goings on. </p>

<p>If you watch other interviews with Piers Morgan and guests when discussing gun control, the people are accurate with their information, calm and logical. Which, inevitably brought out personal attacks from Piers. Compare those with the interview Alex and with the mindset of the average person and you will understand why people would be raging over it. Heck, go look at interviews Alex has done in the past and you will see how different his composure is.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just this too; people have started to realise his link to STRATFOR &amp; his constant defence of Israel and their actions.  So it&#39;s only natural for one to raise a red flag on Alex.</p>

<p>The interview was just a tipping point, at least for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all good youngli0n. We&#39;re all here to find the truth. It&#39;s difficult to render what is truth and what is lies when the truth is so muddy. </p>

<p>As someone else noted, you should watch the Austin Gun Rally where he just barges in on their well organised rally and starts taking over, immediately ruining their intentions. The protesters there were outraged and were advocating, no, demanding his leave only for Alex to make out on his infowars show to be head honcho of the rally. It&#39;s absurd! </p>

<p>Alex is a profiteer of conspiracy theories who has, by the media, claimed crown and throne of all conspiracy theorists. This has a bad view on all genuine truth seekers out there like myself. CNN&#39;s goal, as was Piers Morgans, was to display Alex as an example to what all conspiracy theorists are like. Crazy and paranoid.  </p>

<p>Best of luck to you mate in the search of truth!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the only reason i didn&#39;t watch it yet (with sound) is cuz i&#39;m at work. Also I&#39;m well aware that is what CNN wanted to do. As they tried to with Jesse Ventura, but handled it in a different manner. He would even &quot;raise his voice&quot; without raising his voice (if you get what i&#39;m saying). I&#39;m not saying Jesse Ventura is the truth or anything like that, (which he may very well be). But he definitely did say what he wanted, and won the crowd over, making Piers look like a clown. And i will most definitely look that up. i feel weird not hearing about that before. but it could be because i was 10 in 2001. What i mean is i look up many things daily. Not just 9/11, flouride in water, sandy hook, alex jones.... but many others. thank you sir, for your very valuable input :)</p>

<p>Sorry, but there you are.</p>

<p>And gun crime rose in Britain after gun ownership laws were made stricter.   But this means absolutely nothing!  Ask any Briton.  No one had any guns but those with permits and criminals anyway and didn&#39;t want them and there is no sign that I know of about who was responsible for the rise in gun crime confidence.  But now Britain has one of the lowest gun crime murder rates in the world.  3 times less than Germany and 40 times less than America. </p>

<p>Of the 197 people charged with the crime of murder in 2011, 113 (57.36 percent) were black, 55 (27.91 percent) were White European, and 20 (10.15 percent) were Asian. </p>

<p>All of you together are animals basically and have and are <em>nothing</em>.  Not even the &#39;rednecks&#39;.  The key terms here is these lot <strong>together</strong> and the context of it being they who are the <strong>hucksters</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all good youngli0n. We&#39;re all here to find the truth. It&#39;s difficult to render what is truth and what is lies when the truth is so muddy. </p>

<p>As someone else noted, you should watch the Austin Gun Rally where he just barges in on their well organised rally and starts taking over, immediately ruining their intentions. The protesters there were outraged and were advocating, no, demanding his leave only for Alex to make out on his infowars show to be head honcho of the rally. It&#39;s absurd! </p>

<p>Alex is a profiteer of conspiracy theories who has, by the media, claimed crown and throne of all conspiracy theorists. This has a bad view on all genuine truth seekers out there like myself. CNN&#39;s goal, as was Piers Morgans, was to display Alex as an example to what all conspiracy theorists are like. Crazy and paranoid.  </p>

<p>Best of luck to you mate in the search of truth!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Please don&#39;t take my tonne for being harsh towards you, I just get these AJ fans who constantly harass me for my stance on the man, and I tend to be a bit harsh on my responses.</p>

<p>My favorite ad of his is the one of a hot chick that says &quot;Google Censored this Video, find out why!&quot; and you click on it and it&#39;s some guy trying to scam you into buying some piece of shit product.</p>
