       I live in the west end of Toronto, Canada.  This happened about 5 years ago.  I was driving northbound on Islington Avenue, and was taking an exit to highway 401 westbound (the incident happened exactly here
       <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/vbTeW">
        http://goo.gl/maps/vbTeW
       </a>
       .  In the middle of that "triangle" grassy area, was a white truck, flipped on it's side.  The truck obviously took the corner too fast, and flipped on it's left side.  The truck had no markings (other than the license plate), and I did not see a driver anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I DID see was very disturbing to me (I am from Canada, and weird sh*t just does not happen here).  I saw between 6-8 soldiers in full fatigues and automatic weapons standing around this truck guarding it.  I assumed that soldiers were Canadian, but in as much as I could see, I did not see any country markings on them, and no name tags (I drove by them on the ramp, I was going to the highway 401 as slowly as I could).  No helicopters (sorry)...  About an hour later, I was coming back in the other direction, no sign of anything..
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: The ramp as is shown now, is quite straight, at the time this happened, it was quite curvy there...
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - saw a white truck flipped on it's side, in quiet Canadian suburbia surrounded by soldiers (Canadian?) - this sh*t just doesn't happen here...

       Screams drug trafficking to me.  Not necessarily the soldiers but could have been a transport for the drugs. I know nothing about the roads up there(the hat) but it being so close to Buffalo and Detroit, that would be my main guess.

       If this did happen, MPs investigating a abandoned vehicle?  Seriously though, how did you see what each was wearing and the weapons while driving on a curving on-ramp?  Country markings?  You have very selective vision.

       Canadian soldiers have little Canadian flags on the shoulders of the uniform - the red maple leaf on camouflage uniform really sticks out.   I drove extremely slowly around the bend - it was definitely my life's biggest WTF moment.

       I drove slowly, the event I saw was completely unexpected and totally out of place.  I was so surprised, it did not occur to me to take a photo.

       In Canada (in Toronto anyway) we just don't ever see soldiers anywhere, so it was a huge surprise.

       I was so surprised, it never occurred to me to do it. It's probably not a good idea to point things at guys with guns. Lastly this is a busy ramp, and there was no place to pull over, and take your time on taking a photo.

       OP here - I've been thinking about this tonight, due to all of the questions folks are asking me.  This is one possibility I think...
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a few months ago, there was an interesting article
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=189189">
        http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=189189
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The location of this building is here:

      <p>
       The flipped over truck happened here:

       It seems that there is nuclear pellet manufacturing going on in the western part of Toronto.  So, this is one possibility:
      </p>
      <p>
       They manufacture these kinds of nuclear uranium pellets in a residential neighbourhood (WTF again??).
      </p>
      <p>
       They transport these pellets to some well known nuclear plants in southern ontario, which are all EAST of Toronto (the truck flipped over trying to go highway 401 eastbound) - Pickering plant, Bruce Penninsula plant etc.  To keep things low-key, and not panic locals, they use ordinary small trucks to transport the pellets to the nuclear plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truck flips over (too heavy? too many pellets?) - it was late afternoon, late spring, now rain, no snow.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all freak out, because it's "nuclear stuff", and to protect people from meddling, they decide to bring out military to protect the nuclear payload?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this a possibility??  Just thinking out loud..

       Cool find sounds like a good possibility.  My guess is something very much like that though.  Flipping on there is weird though.  That driver must have sucked or had a really top heavy load and not turned much yet.

       Yeah, it may be a possibility - I guess, I will never know.  The ramp at the time was quite curvy, much more so than it is now - now it's quite straight there.  The whole area has been reconstructed at the time google maps was done in that part...

       I think it's something that possibly didn't belong to them (otherwise it would have been a military truck?)..  I think maybe it's nuclear pellets (as per my later comment in this thread).

       The 401 is regularly used for military transports through Toronto.  Remember a year or two ago when they lost the tanks on there?
      </p>
      <p>
       They may have been going to the airport and getting off to go up and around to the cargo entrance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wouldn't call that area that quiet, your right in the middle of Canadas biggest airport, a former airforce base/airplane construction facility and a bit north of a military barracks.

       So they were on the onramp from the airport onto the 401 then?

       Actually no - they were going northbound on Islington Avenue, and they were taking the ramp on to the highway 401 eastbound.  So, they were leaving the western part of Toronto, away from the airport.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some cities east of Toronto that have a number of military bases - the towns of Peterborough, Kingston and other towns east of Toronto have a number of major military bases - so from that perspective, the trip makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does not make sense to me is:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why armed soldiers - automatic weapons in very aggressive stance - this is Canada WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why no cops?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not a military truck, but a basic white truck - the kind of thing you would rent when you move?

       What weapons were they?  How do you know they were automatic?

       You saw a few seconds of it.  You don't know that no cops had visited the scene.

      <p>
       Because it was there?  Because it was a civilian contractor moving something in their own vehicle with military support?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also your assertion that there are never soldiers around Toronto in other posts is just false.  There are lots of them around and tons in and around the 401 every day moving stuff.

       I am just saying what I saw. I've never seen soldiers in Toronto, perhaps I live a sheltered life. The guns looked automatic because they had long billet clips, they were not shot guns. Maybe I live a sheltered life here.
