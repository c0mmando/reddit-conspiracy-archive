       A frequent complaint is that the media isn't doing their job and digging up evidence on the Sandy Hook case, so why hasn't a single person in the conspiracy world taken it upon themselves to travel to the scene and conduct interviews, hire a private investigator, and lift the curtain on the conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the "crisis actors" conspiracy is true, then it would be staggeringly easy to expose it with real hard-copy evidence by just spending some time on the scene, conducting interviews, and having a private detective dig in for a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I've seen is a ton of "internet investigating," which, let's face it, has a next to 0% success rate.  If it were useful, then police and FBI would solve crimes using YouTube and blogs.  They don't, and that should tell you something.  I would assert that I've spent more time doing on-the-street investigation of my stolen bike than the entirety of the conspiracy world has done on Sandy Hook, and you'd probably have a hard time refuting that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's with the nonchalant attitude?  It's clear that you believe this was a coordinated move as a push toward your eventual enslavement, but what's your attitude toward investigating it?
       <em>
        Yaaawn, let someone else do it. It's too hard. It's too far away. Not my job.  They won't let us.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       A comic book fan will make it a point to fly to Comicon, but a conspiracy theorist can't make it a point to drive to Newtown and employ an investigator?  Does this mean that geeks are more interested in a Kevin Smith panel than you are in investigating your own enslavement?  Why is it just excuse after excuse?

       Why go and interview people when you can find all the evidence you need from the comfort of a computer chair? If you need someone to go and conduct concrete investigation for your own convincing, maybe you should be the one to go do that.

       But the "evidence" on display here isn't the kind of thing you can take before a judge or to force a Federal investigation.  It's fine for within the walls of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but people on the outside want to see something concrete and legally admissible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand the incredibly casual approach around here if you believe that your enslavement is imminent.  Isn't that kinda serious?  Why is the idea of doing hard work to stop your enslavement always met with a series of excuses?

       so instead of acting yourself and leading by example,
      </p>
      <p>
       you come here and criticize everyone else for 'not doing it'? on the internet?
      </p>

       honestly, this tactic is lacking. i agree it is probably the best thing anyone could do to get over there and spend time and money for the pursuit of the truth. but coming here with a colorful generalized description of what 'we' must all think and be like, and talking about your stupid bike is a less than helpful solution, imo.

       It's really not as easy as you make it sound...build defenses and attack at the same time. Sounds like over exerting yourself to me. I also don't know how many american's can afford a vacation. I certainly wouldn't waste my money trying to surf in hawaii. I am personally spending my money and time preparing for the worst hoping for the best. I don't have money to hire a private investigator or go to Connecticut. I don't have a savings as I don't use banks for anything. I am fighting the system but in a very different way then most..with my wallet and my brain.

       The actor angle would be a slam dunk, though, and remarkably easy to uncover.  It seems like the conspiracy world gets hit with a massive wave of apathy when it comes to putting down the computer and doing work.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not have vacation money, but a lot do (and live within easy driving distance of Newtown), and the idea that not
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       has decided to reallocate pleasure funds toward lifting the curtain on a conspiracy they believe is designed to enslave them?  That's incredibly odd.

       Newtown is a place any New Hampshire resident could go to for just the day.  Heck, anyone in New England, or NYC, could do it.

       We're talking $30 in gas, a
       <del>
        $5 lunch at McDonalds
       </del>
       $10 lunch at an organic produce stand, and a day's worth of video tapes
       <em>
        to uncover what would be arguably the most sinister government conspiracy of all time,
       </em>
       and no one will do it.

       It's proof that on some level they know this tinfoil hattery is bullshit.

       Maybe its an investment better suited for someone like you..since its so easy to divert funds to a rainy conspiracy day. Hell you can even hire me as the p.i. lol

       It's a logical fallacy to think that going to ct will save us from the end of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I interpret "you could expose and potentially stop the worst from happening" in your previous post as must be different then you. I interpret that as stopping a conspiracy. Which to me is still a bad investment for someone of my financial caliber.

       I should have clarified...  An on-the-scene report from a conspiracy theorist. That's a YouTube clip of CBS.  That's not independent reporting from the "truth" movement.

      <p>
       Fact: I've still done more on-the-street investigation over my stolen bike than the entire truth movement has on Sandy Hook.

       Are you sure he's not an actor?  Don't you think he's a little calm for that situation?  Didn't the words just seem to flow right out of him without hesitation or stress?  Isn't it weird how the news reporter
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       to ask him what the person was wearing and he had an answer ready to go?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I'm being ridiculous, but you see how
       <em>
        easy
       </em>
       it is to do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       But to answer your post:
       <em>
        that isn't an investigation.
       </em>
       Go to Newtown.  Stop making excuses.

       In 100% honesty, I think it would make a great documentary.  "Shill" and "truther" go to a contested conspiracy zone to see what's up first hand.  You won't believe what they find.  Rated PG-13.
