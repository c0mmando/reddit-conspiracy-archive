        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, here goes nothing....</p>

<p>The rant to end all conspiracy rants.</p>

<p>We see you.</p>

<p>Damn right.</p>

<p>We know who you are, we know what you are doing, and the end justifies the means methods you use to achieve your goals.</p>

<p>This is an open call to all Americans to open their eyes to the injustice and deception that surrounds their everyday lives.</p>

<p>Some of us are already awake to the psuedo-democratic-republic that you so graciously call a “democracy”.</p>

<p>We know that that is hardly what we are living in.</p>

<p>We see the police state,</p>

<p>We see the lies,</p>

<p>We see the torture.</p>

<p>And we see the manipulation.</p>

<p>We may be few, but our voices are powerful, and we are coming for you with every single non-violent means we have at our disposal.</p>

<p>We will not stop, we will not falter, we will not slow, until every single one of you is routed from your positions of power that you so dearly cling to and so hardly deserve.</p>

<p>I for one feel I have come to terms with the plutocratic oligarchy you have us entrenched in.</p>

<p>I understand it is enormous in scope and vast in its reach, I comprehend how it controls and manages almost every major organization reaching millions of people a day planet-wide. </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t understand however, is this.</p>

<p>To what end? What end could possibly justify the means of killing children, imprisoning whiste-blowers, and downright destroying the rights of a once glorious nation?!</p>

<p>I really would like to know, people like Goldman-Sachs, Bernie Madoff, George Soros, Rothschilds family.</p>

<p>Please explain to me how keeping people in jail under some absurd 3 strikes law for getting caught using marijuana recreationally makes sense...</p>

<p>Lay out of me how exactly the world is a better place with us forcing “democracy” down other countries throats, creating insurgents that we then have to fight in an endless cycle of terror.</p>

<p>Tell me how your use of fear and destruction to control masses of people will ever come to a positive end.</p>

<p>It wont.</p>

<p>You know why?</p>

<p>Because the ends doesn&#39;t justify the means, not now, not ever.</p>

<p>And as long as people keep accepting less and less liberty for fictional security, they will slowly lose both, and deserve neither.</p>

<p>Paraphrasing historical greats like <em>Benjamin Franklin</em> aside...</p>

<p>Honestly, I would love to know why the founders were so wrong in the Bill of Rights that you so readily stomp your jack-boots upon.</p>

<p>I NEED TO KNOW WHY YOU HATE THE IDEA OF FREEDOM SO MUCH THAT REDUCING IT SEEMS TO DRIVE YOUR EVERY INSATIABLE MOVE FOR MORE AND MORE POWER.</p>

<p>The only logical solution is that you are all completely and totally psychopathic.</p>

<p>Insane</p>

<p>Off your rockers.</p>

<p>This will not end well for the rulers or the ruled.</p>

<p>So why continue, why act as if the enemy you create is not your fault in the first place.</p>

<p>The strategems you employ are childish and yet ever so devious.</p>

<p>Higalean dialectec for instance. Or in laymens terms Problem-Reaction-Solution.</p>

<p>You create a problem, real, or otherwise, act as if its not your fault, wait for the public uproar and reaction, and then offer a solution that neither addresses the problem, nor assists the general public in any way, shape, or form...</p>

<p>Or Order through Chaos, the ultimate prayer you sing so often.</p>

<p>You create the Chaos, and we accept anything to restore Order.</p>

<p>ENOUGH.</p>

<p>WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH.</p>

<p>THE PEOPLE WANT THEIR WORLD BACK.</p>

<p>And so I come to my final point.</p>

<p>The people.</p>

<p>Throughout my banter you may have come to feel powerless over such lofty terms and investment firms.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I mean it, seriously don&#39;t.</p>

<p>These people and methods I have named.</p>

<p>They all rely upon me and you! US, We the people have always held the power.</p>

<p>Unfortunately our controllers direct this power toward useless things like Professional Sports, Endless Consumerism, and Unhealthy, Destructive Foods.</p>

<p>The true reason so many are depressed or anxious or downright mad, is the people mentioned above.</p>

<p>I would like to personally encourage anyone that recieves this message to find it in yourself to awaken the power you have always had, and direct your sadness, and fear, and anger, right back upon the makers of such false and empty feelings.</p>

<p>They made you that way, and they deserve to feel the wrath of those that are affected by the broken top-down pyrimidal system that the powers of the world adore so much.</p>

<p>The thing about a pyramid is, the peak cannot stand without the base.</p>

<p>And the base, again, is US.</p>

<p>Lets let the house of cards crumble.</p>

<p>Do everything you can short of harming yourself or others to show this power structure that its time is numbered, and its days are drawing to an end.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, have a blessed day, and remember, you have the power...</p>

<p>They just want you to forget it was yours all along.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thank you guys so much! Keep the discussion up, I know we can figure this out.</p>

<p>I was highly impressed, I thought this rant would get 10 replies at best and be blown to the wind</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely disagree. Where has non-violence gotten us? Look what they did to Occupy? Guys, the powers that be now know that the people are utterly complacent, ignorant, disinformed, and lazy. They can be bolder, and they ARE bolder every year - and they know they can be because we let them. Not defending yourself against violence with violence proves that they have won - that you have been subjugated into something less than human.</p>

<p>A violent revolution is the only, the <strong>ONLY</strong> thing that will save this country. Everything else is circling the drain. They don&#39;t care about your protests - they don&#39;t care about your petitions, they don&#39;t care about your opinions, they don&#39;t care about your polls, they don&#39;t care about your gatherings, they don&#39;t care about your votes, they don&#39;t care about where you put your money - because they don&#39;t <em>have</em> to. They&#39;ve largely won already, and it&#39;s <strong>BECAUSE</strong> of this passivity that is &quot;non-violence&quot;. That worked a long time ago because OTHERS had semblances of moral compasses and it pigeon holed them into feeling about their hypocrisy, but people are no longer that way - they don&#39;t give a shit about what happens to the guys protesting on TV, as long as something entertaining is on, and that they&#39;ve been relegated to the fringe.</p>

<p><strong>We have been marginalized, and we barely have any more common ground to stand on.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Throw everything out on the table. Gather as a people, electronically or in person, and first thoroughly analyze what is wrong with our government, society, and economic structure (we already know practically all of that) - then formulate how to change it - then demand it, unwaveringly, from the government - if it is not given, force it. Too long have we been deceived into the idea that made us forget that government serves <em>us</em> - and nothing else - not the other way around.</p>

<p>Other American&#39;s warped perceptions of honor, philosophy, morality, and this society that repulses intellectuality is just a giant step in the degradation of this country. It&#39;s like what Ron Paul said in his speech about how our founding fathers made clear that our entire form of government entirely depended on a virtuous and moral people - that is not what we are anymore as a whole..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not only non-violence, it&#39;s LOVE!  I think the means to a peaceful revolution is letting go of money, all the things that come from money and everything associated with it.  This sort of post seems hypocritical, but that&#39;s my personal goal in life and I wish more people would see it the same.  A money-free lifestyle with no reddit, no internet, no car, no job, no more short-term comforts.  Shack in the middle of the woods? You got it!  I think the absence of all these comforts would bring on the best, most simple thing in life... a peace of mind. Imagine the comfort of living on only necessary, basic means without the weight of money dragging you down.  It&#39;s a decision that seems ludicrous, crazy, anti-social, and downright dangerous, yet I think it&#39;s the decision that would begin the revolution against the fear that holds us captive.  It&#39;s being done everyday by some people but for most us, we&#39;ve been conditioned from the first day of our lives.  Imagine all the time in the day, minus an hour or two for gathering food, that could be spent on trying to unconditionally love every person. </p>

(in today&#39;s system everything we need, you must pay for with money... hunting license, fishing license, land deeds, water, food, etc) i don&#39;t enjoy relying on government to control our resources... i&#39;m pretty sure we can provide for ourselves, instead of being lazy and running to mcdonalds for a quick meal (i enjoy cooking) :) we don&#39;t need TVs, but creativity in movies/videos games/books, could express many ideas to create a new or better world. so i don&#39;t believe we should completely abandon technology.

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone thinks that there&#39;s something wrong with the world, a lot of people suspect they know what it is that&#39;s wrong with the world, and a very small number of people actually do know what it is that&#39;s wrong with the world. And then on top of that, if you are one of those people, it&#39;s very hard to actually say everything that you know in an accessible way. This was a great attempt at doing so.</p>

<p>A common thing that people say is that WE have the power. I agree, I think we do, but... what? What now, right? What to do? Because like anything, there&#39;s not really one good answer. Everyone has to do something specific that draws on their own talents, as I see it.</p>

<p>But maybe here&#39;s what we can do: we can focus our powers, so to speak, and agree on a target. Right? What would you propose? The financial system? Reclaiming television and information in general? What&#39;s the weakest link?</p>

<p>Remember this: America is a great idea, but it didn&#39;t emerge fully formed from the ideological womb. There were a lot of arguments, a lot of false starts, and a lot of dead ends before it started moving in one unified direction. </p>

<p>I think America is about to emerge into the Age of the Commune, each with it&#39;s own rules and ideologies. And I think that will be a great thing for the country, it needs a new direction. But we have to be willing to debate and be wrong and move in a direction we&#39;re unsure of if we ever want to get these greedy fuckers off our backs. </p>

<p>And what would make <em>your</em> fiat money any better than theirs? The new money you print would be as worthless as that dollar bill. The only way it would work would be to start minting silver, gold, and platinum coins. The money has to have real value which can&#39;t be devalued.

    <div class="md"><p>Amen.</p>

<p>How do you do it?</p>

<p>Easily.</p>

<p>Before you waste your emotions and thinking cycles on anything, check: Is it something you can change? If yes, change it. If no, ignore it.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Can any of your actions prevent a war? I don&#39;t mean prayers, petitions, demonstrations and similar bullshit - do you control the war-starting mechanism? No. So stop worrying about it.</p>

<p>Can you influence the outcome of any sporting event? Oscar? Lottery? Election? Weather? Then don&#39;t worry about them.</p>

<p>Does it matter if the world belongs to Rothschields or Gelbschwerts? No, unless you are one of them.</p>

<p>Does it matter if Alex Jones is a shill? No, unless you are Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Can you save undefined &quot;starving children&quot; somewhere out there? No, you can&#39;t even if you want to, so ignore them. Can you save a specific starving child? Yes you can, if you want. If you don&#39;t want - it&#39;s OK.</p>

<p>Do you have debts? Avoidable expenses? Stupid habits? This is something you can change, if you want. If you don&#39;t want - it&#39;s OK.</p>

<p>The key is to not be ashamed to embrace what makes sense to <strong>you</strong> and dump what doesn&#39;t makes sense to <strong>you</strong>, no matter how determined the society is to send you on a guilt trip in both cases.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t follow <em>anyone</em>, as every leader has an axe to grind, every &quot;I know the way&quot; guy is a predator. His goal is your energy, not your happiness. <strong>There are no leaders without followers</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first step is finding a leader that can change minds, or at least make people comfortable with acknowledging the increasingly unspeakable truths that shackle us all.  He or she must be extremely intelligent, charismatic and well protected because God knows the multi trillion dollar machine will employ its every minion to ensure self preservation.  Finally, but MOST IMPORTANTLY, he or she must refuse to sell out.  With the accumulation of the power against a crooked system comes a greater and greater value to be liquidated.  I have no doubt many politicians started in their careers with golden intentions.  The path of least resistance is to cash out when the value is high and it is difficult to find individuals who defy nature for the good of society absent some modicum of hidden self-interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>leaders dare not be killed, least not top of their game bc then they become a symbol, it will show the concrete evidence that the enemy is real and that is the last thing  opposition wants.  Leaderless is a good idea but it did not work for wall street. Though I am sure the opposition is ready for both kinds of revolution. It if we indeed want change a shift of power I can assure you it wont go with out violence of one kind or another. If one intends to utter the word revolution they must be ready to put hear soul and body behind the word because that is what it will take.</p>

<li>no shit sherlock!!!!!!!!, the &quot;idea must spread&quot; like a slang word</li>

<li>Once a currency has been printed, payed for for with volunteer time and soon to be useless rothschild paper, the next phase occurs</li>
<li>with the power of the slang word having spread, the LEADERS* of the movement will declare the day....dooms day for the evil ones</li>
<li>the day will be sometime in the future, with the goal of US predetermining the day of reckoning</li>
<li>this delay on time will allow for further spreading of the slang word of DEBT FREE currency to spread and give those who are on the fence about it time to understand....the CRUCIAL element and those who are of a priority to reach out to are those in the military...We implore them to do the right thing, we ask that they simply serve the good of the people and protect us from tyranny. We must have faith that our sons and daughters will not turn their weapons on us and destroy what it was they swore to protect. We need them more than anything in the world, I want to give them the choice, the chance to do the right thing in an honorable way....* in times of need leaders are not chosen, they just are....Leader are people who have ideas that are able to unify large groups of people in a way that reaches into the hearts of all men. There is no one person who can do anything alone. A leader is one who is valiant and inspires other men and women to join in a common cause for the good of all....You need a leader, a good leader, more than anything else in the world....</li>
