       And after watching the debate with Ben Shapiro he(Moran) scoffs asking Ben if he believed the government would become tyrannical.  A simple and yet recent event in our colorful history as a country would be to ask, why didn't the African-American slaves have guns?  Like Ben said, just because it hasn't happened to us now doesn't mean it won't happen in the future.  It's harder to rape someone if they can defend themselves.

       Makes me cringe when Morgan talks about "what we need in this country" The sad part about this debate is it looks like we give up rights on either side of the debate.... NRA is pushing for armed guards in schools. That may not take any of our rights away, at first, but any logical person can foresee the potential for catastrophe. Armed officials in schools will no doubt scare the kids into submission, all shootings aside.

       Never said I did, if I thought that I wouldn't have even responded to your snide comment and even up voted it or to this one.  You don't see Chevrolet telling Dodge how to run their business.  Nor do you see FIFA telling the NFL how to do theirs.  Hell this is one of the main reasons this country is here to begin with to get away with self-righteous twats like him.

       agreed.I'm an American...and it seems to me that we have been taught to think that we are above every other nation ....and that we have the right to do whatever we please,including invading other nations...God forbid if someone even discusses the Constitution if they weren't born here...but it's ok to kill innocent ppl with drones or whatever we like whenever we want.What makes ppl think the entire world revolves around US?

       How about instead of attacking him you answer his question. The Constitution guarantees everyone on US soil the rights to speak freely, not just the citizens. It's what gives this board the freedom to talk about conspiracies and for your right to debate why he shouldn't be allowed to discuss US politics. As long as the discussion is getting attention both sides will be heard.

       If Kim Jong Un was in the United States saying these things than, no I don't think it should be aired on National Television because it would be considered Propaganda and I'm pretty sure that goes against the FCC. Piers Morgan is allowed to say what he's saying because it's technically his viewpoint on a subject. I don't like him and wish that the US would deport him, but what he's doing isn't illegal and neither is deporting him if enough the citizens of the US are asking for him to be deported. Because remember this "democracy" is based supposed to be ruled by numbers of citizens not blocked by a single diplomat.

       I'm not attacking you or ganging up on you I'm just debating your point of view and trying to get you to think critically not and not just jump to conclusions. The media has a hold on you, if you don't give Piers the attention he wants than he loses his power.

       I'm afraid I really don't give him much attention, other than this post.  I read a previous post of yours and saw that you supported his deportation.

      <p>
       I'm not afraid of how he will coerce me but the millions of people that watch CNN.  It's a dangerous line he's crossing.  I hope he's aware of that.

       Piers Morgan is paid to air opinions, some of which might even be his.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume you want a new rule like
       <strong>
        'only U.S. citizens be allowed to speak their opinions while in the US of A'
       </strong>
       , or maybe
       <strong>
        'only people born in the US of A, to parents that were also born in the US of A, are allowed to air their opinions while in the US of A'
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't that sound a bit ridiculous to you? It does to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event that gun control laws are changed in any way (e.g. no assault rifles, cause everybody knows you all need assault rifles to defend yourselves against the gubinment/mexicans/communists/other americans) then i thoroughly expect the internet to be full of gibbering idiots banging on about how it's all Piers Morgans fault.

       So on defending the fact that it's okay to change the constitution, it will be okay to change the 1st also? What about the 5th? I mean since we're in there changing some of it why not all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fundamentally, once they change any part of it it allows changes to other amendments and we lose our rights piece by piece.

       [edit] and anyway, if your constitution was so perfect there wouldn't be any amendments. And amendments, as the name suggests, are changes to the constitution. By saying that changes to the constitution are bad, you're saying that any further amendments are bad, forever.

       Actually, this is very appropriate. The US used to be a British colony, and it is falling under more and more control from the UK as well as Europe. In 1945, the US was No. 1, but now the US has fallen behind Europe to the No. 2 spot in terms of GDP. The City also has a great deal of financial control of the US thru links to the Fed and various other private US banks. They want to disarm us to make us easier to control. That is all that this is about.

       The UK isn't the only country in Europe. It's unfair to start an argument talking about the UK and then switching to all of Europe half way through.

       However I think that you actually have a problem with the fact that he can reach a mass media. That I can understand and I agree somewhat with you. He shouldn't be advising US citizens about what laws should be passed he should be discussing the issue and leaving his view out of it. But that's not going to happen and he's allowed to speak his mind. I agree that he should be deported who cares if England will take him back or not. He'll probably move to Canada tho.

       Actually, I think it is fair to start with the UK and then switch to Europe, because the colonialist mindset is the same, and many of the European countries had colonies. The US had traditionally been against colonies, due to the fact that it knew what it was to be one. It basically supported the decolonialization after WW2. But had problems in the Phillipines South America and supporting France in Vietnam during the Cold War. There is less transfer of excess population now and more financial attack and control thru the IMF, World Bank, IBS, as well as other private banks like Morgan Stanley the Fed, HSBC etc. The European just want to disarm us to make us easier to control when they pull the plug on the country like they did in Greece.

       When did I ever say he didn't have a legal right to be IN this country. If he doesn't have a work visa or green card than he doesn't have the right to work in this country. My point is that he has criminal charges against him in another country and people are asking for him to be deported to face those charges.

       What criminal charges - I can't read your mind. It's not in the OP and it's you thats suggesting people shouldn't have the freedom to voice differing opinions so I'm not sure why you'd think it would be weird for me to disagree with such a concept.

       Ok maybe I may have misread the articles I have read but he was still a person of interest in a case about phone hacking. He fled the UK to get away from allegations. But I never said he didn't have a right to have a differing opinion than me. However he is attacking the 2nd amendment and people want him to leave the country. He doesn't have diplomatic immunity and the petition didn't infringe on his 1st amendment rights.

       It's not his criticism specifically that wass why the petition was made. It was because he is abusing his position as a national television personality to try to undermine the 2nd amendment. "Shall not be infringed" is written directly into the amendment and he's trying to infringe on said rights.

       I'm positive expressing a disagreement with the 2nd amendment in no way infringes upon the 2nd amendment - not as if that was a sensible point considering that he would have to infringe upon
       <em>
        your

       right which in this case is an even greater stretch for a descriptor of his actions.

       Fine you have a right to have a differing opinion than me. I feel like he's trying to tell people to give up their rights to defend themselves. As a citizen of a different country with a national audience in this country he should keep his opinions to himself about our constitution. And if a large enough group of people feel like he's overstepping his bounds as a journalist then they should be able to petition the government to get him taken off of national television.

       Calm down, sir. No need for that kind of language. I'm not saying he doesn't have a right to say what he wants, I'm saying that he's using his national television show and his journalist background to manipulate people into accepting an unconstitutional set of laws. Not only that, but he's using his journalistic background as deception to keep you from checking anything he says. He doesn't even acknowledge any evidence against his stance and has no journalistic integrity.

       You do know that you can petition petitions, right? There are probably a ton of petitions against stuff that I like and if any of them were to get to a point where the President may attempt to pass legislation against it I would sign or create a petition for him to change his mind. Politicians should listen to the people, not the other way around.

       Honestly, I've been sick of this little back and forth for a while and I'm just saying stuff because it seems to bug you. I don't like Piers Morgan and wish that he was back in the UK. I don't think that he should have been given a national television show in the US and really don't think that people should be watching him. If he really wanted to help this country get rid of all of it's violence than he would be supporting a reform in education not a gun ban that will turn millions of law abiding citizens into criminals. I personally think that he's hurting our country more than helping and that's why I support his deportation. For me it's not to take away his rights, since even if he were deported he could still say whatever he wanted about the US and our laws, it's about getting a negative influence off of the television.

       Ok well have fun trying to deport a US citizen. How exactly am I hurting anybody, I'm attempting to defend the rights of the people. Honestly, I don't watch much T.V., and I definitely don't watch Piers' show. But I do know that he attacks anybody with differing views than him, much like you. The difference between the pro-gun movement and the anti-gun movement is that the anti-gun movement is attacking a right and the pro-gun movement is defending a right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly I don't even know how we got to this point in a conversation and I don't understand why you're so angry, it's not like I attacked you personally. Unless of course you are Piers Morgan, in that case go back to Britain you spineless twat.

       Where is the expressed right to whatever form of weapon you'd like? There are limits on speech so it's not a stretch to think there would be limits upon our other
       <em>
        rights
       </em>
       as well. You don't make a sophisticated argument.

       "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." You see that part that says "shall not be infringed"? Telling me what types of weaponry I am allowed to poses is an infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
       But seeing as how there are limits on free speech what's to say that what Piers Morgan is saying isn't an attack on our national security? I'm pretty sure that undermining the constitution is an attack against our nation.

       So you should be able to have nuclear arms? You haven't described any rational application of what you quote, nor have you described how the context of the militia effects the statement you quote. Is it important? Is it
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       important? If you shot a man with a gun, and the police detained you and took your weapon - would they be violating the constitution? According to your dumb argument? Yes.

       Because such an argument a) does not make sense and b) is not consistent with any of the limits that

       exist on free speech.

      <p>
       Then we should lock the NRA up for lobbying the interests of arms manufacturers in the face of legislation legally passed by our congressman. But really, besides that - what a joke. Words don't undermine the constitution, it's a man's opinion of which the constitution goes to great lengths to describe how such actions are
       <em>
        perfectly legal

       .

       Whatever you say, sir. You claim that my arguments don't make sense while asking if an individual should be allowed to own nuclear arms.

       The militia and the people are two separate entities in the 2nd amendment. A militia is essential to the state in order to be free from federal tyranny just as each person has the right to keep and bear arms to protect themselves from the tyranny of the state and the federal governments.
