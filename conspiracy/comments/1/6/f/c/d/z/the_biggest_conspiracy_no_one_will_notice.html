<p>I&#39;m reading it right now and if it had already been posted before it is definitely worth posting again.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Ha.  Don&#39;t mean to hijack <em>my own</em> thread, but <a href="http://gagnauga.is/index.php?Fl=Greinar&amp;ID=234">here</a> is the link that I originally got the OP link from which in and of itself actually has some VERY relevant information in terms of a bigger picture, etc.</p>

<p><em>Additionally</em> (and this is where it might get even a bit more &quot;out there&quot; for some folks), after reading both the &quot;EDIT&quot; link I just posted right here and the original &quot;OP Link&quot; at the very top, I personally noticed a striking level of parallels between the additional link I just provided here and the info found in this <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018">HH</a> link right here.</p>

<p>It might, again, be pretty &quot;out there&quot; to some, but the info is consistent with the OP link (i.e. there are some interesting parallels in terms of just who is running things and pulling the strings on a global basis) and I think it&#39;s not a bad idea to at least include it here and allow people to have the chance to read it and simply decide for themselves how much of it is valid or not.</p>

<p>No.  He yells to make those interested in investigating covert and nefarious truth (AKA &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;) look crazy by associating them with his actions.  It&#39;s more so that those he is acting as a representative of look crazy.</p>

<p>I always looked at him as being a scary, crazy, uselessly screaming agitator type (agent provocateur) from the moment I first heard him even before I even knew anything really about conspiracy issues, etc.  He just always sat wrong with me.  Whenever I hear him, I just literally got/get a sick, queasy feeling in my stomach - like something is literally <em>wrong</em> in the atmosphere that he physically inhabits.</p>

<p>He corrodes shit with his very energy so that even when he is saying something that happens to be true or factual, his general energy (to say nothing of the disinfo he includes in what he says) really undermines the messages he spreads (for me anyway).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah.  One, they must pay him a really fat check.  Secondly, however, I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say that it&#39;s actually GUILT he has to live with.  You see, if you feel you are part of a greater plan or scheme that is actually something you happen to <em>agree</em> with, then you take on an &quot;ends justify the means&quot; kind of mentality that rationalizes your actions and prevents much if any cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>This is how, among other things, someone can &quot;value life&quot; and love and hug their cute pet kitten and puppy and yet still go out to KFC and order an extra large bucket of fried chicken wings to chow down while they&#39;re watching the Super Bowl without even a second thought.  This is how we can hug and love our wife and kids, and yet hop on a plane, go to another country, and machine gun down the wife and kids of entire groups of people. </p>

<p>Humans are beings that can rationalize and compartmentalize their actions on an <em>extreme</em> level.</p>

<p>This is the world we live in, my brother.  It is a very, very dark one...but <em>we</em> as human beings have light inside of us.

<p>To expose that understanding and divinity we all have inside of us and are often aware of on an unspoken, intuitive level is often the life&#39;s work we all have to undertake in one way or the other.</p>

<p>She was an <strong>INTERN</strong> there for 9 months, do you know what interns do? She is not the CIA super spy that she is portrayed out to be.</p>

<p>BTW he has done at least 4 different CNN and then 5-6 other interviews calmly over the past 10 years.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t know what his problem is yelling and screaming all the time in the new CNN interview with Piers Morgan, but if its evidence of anything, its evidence that he can not control his emotions anymore at all.</p>

<p>lol.  Calmly?  Well, even if you&#39;re right (and I&#39;m not so sure, as every time I&#39;ve heard him, he&#39;s screaming at the top of his lungs), it doesn&#39;t to any extent negate the fact that...well...the other 5,000 times he&#39;s in the public eye he&#39;s screaming at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had a super sore throat on the days you saw him when he wasn&#39;t screaming.  I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Well, I have not at all been a follower of him...but the little that I&#39;ve EVER seen of him...well, let&#39;s just say he&#39;s been screaming for as far back as when I first came across him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is more proof. Ben Shapiro tells piers moron that he is standing on the graves of the sandy hook children and Piers seems to get really offended. Alex ask him why dont you go back to the UK and face your phone hacking yada yada and piers doesnt even bat an emotion. Piers looks like he was told to shut up and take it and let Alex do his thing. </p>

<p>Now with Alex on Huffpost (  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/11/alex-jones-youre-in-danger-huffpost-live_n_2459055.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/11/alex-jones-youre-in-danger-huffpost-live_n_2459055.html</a> ) he is doing it again. why didnt she stop him and ask him any questions at all? She was also probably told to shut up and let alex do his thing. Its sickening. she&#39;s a babe too. at about the one minute mark, you can see something switch in Alex&#39;s head. He is thinking, &quot;shit i&#39;ve been talking rational for a long time now, I better kick the crazy into gear&quot; and then he starts yelling all of a sudden. What.A.Fucking.Shill</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad I couldn&#39;t ever stand this douche bag. I&#39;ll keep looking into conspiracies, but I wont listen to alex jones. If the evidence is there, I dont need alex to tell me about it. I&#39;ll find it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>another thing that comes to mind in how the institution may have (tried)  brainwashed many americans is a scene in the new Bourne Legacy movie. Its a scene where Jeremy Renner is talking with Edward Norton(whom I love as an actor) and Jeremy is pissed about some fucked up operation they did and edward consoles him by saying something along the lines of, &quot;We are the sin eaters. We do very sinful things so the rest of our organization can stay pure. We do the necessary evil&quot; If Alex really is a mole/shill operator working for the CIA to expose REAL dissenters, i bet this is exactly how they painted the picture for him. Seems like there is a lot of brain washing in the new Bourne Movie. Even Mass shooting and suicide. Its brillant. </p>

It has it all: Drones double tapping. Drugs to mind control people. Mass shooting. People Suiciding themselves. Its lovely. Its all there. They even try to make you think you could take on a drone one on one if necessary. So dont worry when they are flying over you. If you really want to, you could take one out. LOL. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go this far and say this, sir/ma&#39;am.  This is, after all, the internet/world wide web.  The fact of the matter is that there are a LOT of sites out there that have tons of information, and AJ is only <em>one</em> in a practically countless multitude of sources trying to expose information.  Matter of fact, given that AJ is a disinfo pied piper, the information that he has is actually WORSE than many of the sites out there that exist that DON&#39;T engage in disinfo.</p>

<p>So no.  I still wouldn&#39;t give him <em>any</em> credit whatsoever actually for &quot;being the first to bring many people&#39;s attention to the info&quot;.  They could have and likely would have done it anyway regardless with all the info that&#39;s out there and available independent of AJ - and these people would have likely ended up finding out info EVEN <em>BETTER</em> without the craziness of AJ to lead them astray off the trail of the REAL truth.</p>

<p>So no.  No credit should be given to him <em>whatsoever</em> for anything but being an evil disinfo pied piper of controlled opposition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what he does.  The squeaky wheel always gets the grease, right?  Well, he&#39;s made sure and made himself into about THE loudest, most annoying squeaky wheel imaginable...and people really do give him a <em>lot</em> of grease (i.e. attention).</p>

<p>Fuck&#39;im.  I say let him just keep yelling.  Pretty soon he&#39;ll turn around and realize that no one is following his loud, annoying, obnoxious ass and he&#39;ll shut up after a while.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I liked how he brought up certain things during the Morgan interview that were taboo in the corporate media and is not talked about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others could have done it and even better still.  He certainly has no &quot;unique&quot; quota on the truth.</p>

<p>Not saying you&#39;re saying this at all, btw.  I&#39;m just saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of harping on the shit we don&#39;t like, we should embrace the things he brings out that is otherwise not discussed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.  Again, fuck him.  Alex Jones IS a baby that could and should indeed get thrown out with the bathwater.  I see what you&#39;re saying in terms of taking the information that he provides that <em>is</em> factual, but 1) that factual information can be gotten from a multitude of other sources that <em>aren&#39;t</em> him, and 2) enough of those other sources <em>don&#39;t</em> mix in distracting shit designed to throw listeners off the real trail of truth (whatever that may be).  Additionally (and this is, I think, a REAL important one here) 3) his actual WAY OF BEING and comporting himself sends across the unspoken message that even if you DO have the truth, the way to expose or talk about or explain that truth is by being as loud and angry and aggressive and obnoxious as you can.</p>

<p>This is the WRONG message regardless of the possible truth or validity of the content.</p>

<p>AJ needs to <em>go</em> - 100%.  He serves NO purpose whatsoever that cannot be handled by another person (or people) in a manner that is significantly better than he for the purpose of the truth and empowerment movement.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my feeling on things, and I meant/mean no anger or aggressiveness toward you - so I apologize if anything I said might have come across in that manner.</p>

<p>Peace,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a blog? What are these other sources you refer to that would have brought these things to light?</p>

<p>I&#39;m all open to new sources of info.</p>

<p>People on this subreddit spend too much time and effort on Alex Jones, both pro and against.</p>

<p>Right now, particularly, I support what he has done is because a lot of info that would otherwise be no longer be easily available still is in part to his servers still retaining that information.</p>

<p>I had political web pages going back to 1996 that because I am so poor I had to use places like 
<a href="http://www.freeyellow.com/" title="Web hosting by FreeYellow">Web hosting by FreeYellow</a>  and  <a href="http://internettrash.com/" title="Internettrash">Internettrash</a> to build my back log of info.</p>

<p>I moved on to Blogger when it first started up and all those old web pages remained up until last spring when suddenly there was a purge of stuff like mine on the internet.</p>

<p>Now I can no longer find any of that info mentioned anywhere on the web, all I can do is try to recall what and who it was about.</p>

<p>An example, was during the Clinton Administration, one of his staff members warned about tanks on the streets in the US in the future. I think it was William Cohen, but it was so many years ago I can&#39;t be sure.</p>

<p>I had the entire article copied and reposted, as I doing in direct copyright violation. But back then I didn&#39;t care or worry about things like that. The web was still free.</p>

<p>Now everything is being more tightly scrutinized and controlled. Google searches are filtered and other search engines are limited.</p>

<p>Like him or not, once AJ is gone from the web, it will be a serious loss of information available at the click of the mouse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  Agreed.  However, while skepticism is a good thing initially and with regard to data you might not know much of anything about, it seems that many people here on Reddit and elsewhere make the heinous mistake of actually <em>priding</em> themselves in calling themselves a &quot;skeptic&quot; to the extent that they literally throw away info that&#39;s staring them right in the face even if it proves itself to be very valid only so they can continue pridefully claiming to be &quot;skeptical&quot; about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this unfortunate trend many times replete amongst many neophytes ignorant of what it means to be truly discerning and critical of information one way or the other.</p>

<p>Therefore, while I ultimately TOTALLY agree with what you just said here, I do think it&#39;s important to - in the course of that skepticism and cross referencing - make sure to stop and realize what information you come across that is worthy of acknowledging as actually <em>truthful.</em></p>

I particularly like the part where you talk about people calling themselves &quot;skeptics&quot; and then tend to throw out blatant out in the open evidence, things such as The Reece Committee on Foundations exposing that big-money foundations are funding social engineering projects worldwide to bring the world into a one world socialist government with their lackeys at the top, which has morphed into Agenda 21 and related goals of the UN.  This is something that has been proven over and over, yet the &quot;skeptics&quot; just attribute that to the &quot;Red Scare&quot; and say it was overblown.  </p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> have proof that the individual in question actually doesn&#39;t have any proof, then please provide it.  I think it would actually be very helpful to everyone, as it would help those of us interested in such to get even closer to the actual truth of things.</p>

<p>Really?  &quot;Because&quot;?  Why because?  What was it about her working for the CIA that made AJ <em>specifically</em> want to hire her because of it?  Regardless of what the answer is, the fact that there is a connection is none the less valid.</p>

<p>While it I wouldn&#39;t disagree that it shouldn&#39;t be looked upon as a smoking gun in and of itself, one would also be VERY remiss to discount this bit of information as quickly and off handedly as you seem to want to.</p>

<p>You also have to keep in mind that in the world of complicated and covert operations (psyops, cointelpro, etc), connections are almost NEVER spelled out for you.  You as a researcher have to be diligent about looking for and <em>making</em> connections that may indeed exist, but that may also be purposefully hidden from you.  Some of those connections might very well not be valid.  They may be cold trails.  They may be &quot;plants&quot; - disinfo.  This is all true.  However, the idea is to pursue as many avenues of possibility as one can, and (again) you would do yourself a disservice if the modus operandi of your investigative approach involved simply throwing away possible leads as quickly as you seem to want to do here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure to some people it will be enough to call for the death of Alex Jones though</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps.  I think doing that would be just as childish and ineffective, however, so since what you just mentioned in this sentence doesn&#39;t apply here, perhaps we can move past the comment as unnecessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is why I am enjoying this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem to me that if you think about this topic in the closed manner that you have already expressed here, then you are one who enjoys wasting their time.</p>

<p>Actually <em>enjoying</em> wasting your time personally sounds to me like a colossally and mind-bogglingly ineffective thing to do - something which seems MUCH less desirable than actually pursuing something that you might find worthwhile and valid.  However, if remaining on here helps you enjoy yourself - helps you &quot;get your rocks off&quot; as it were - then, by all means, carry on.</p>

<p>Why am I enjoying this? Because I think Alex Jones is a cunt who hurts innocent people by making shit up about them. A father loses his child and Alex accuses him of being a secret government agent who never even had children. Give Alex a taste of his own medicine I say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Of course.  These are all valid and good points.  Agreed.  I don&#39;t think the rabbit hole necessarily stops there, however, and - given the world we live in - I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad idea to be willing to be on the look out and keep your eyes open for any other types of connections that might be the case that you might not have thought about before or anticipated.</p>

<p>Seems like it&#39;s just better to be safe than sorry - especially when one is swimming in these types of waters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. I see that everyone was talking about it a month before this woman claims to have exposed it though. There&#39;s several sites who talk about it in November 2012.</p>

<p>You should email her and ask :)</p>

<p>We don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s the same person or just someone who shares the same name! lol</p>

<p>Edit: Ok, it looks like she was an intern for a company called Stratfor. Unfortunately I can&#39;t find anything that confirms Stratfor is a CIA company, it seems to have a rep among theorists but I don&#39;t see anything yet. Anonymous has hacked them a couple times and gotten emails etc, they don&#39;t make any link to CIA.</p>

<p>Wikileaks calls them a Wannabe CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the tl;dr</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s said that the energy/the being that created this planet and humanity along with it provided an oasis of sorts here on this planet, but because no conflict was provided and things were so easy here, those beings (humans) never had a need to search beyond the circumstances they found themselves in. They never came to realize that the place they were in (Earth), although pretty cool and nice and lush and had nice food to eat and nice places to rest and sleep, etc, was NOT the end all and be all of existence…and so long as this human creation stayed in this ignorant state of &quot;limited bliss&quot; - this state that it never needed to look past or outside of because things were so &quot;blissful&quot; and easy here - it would not evolve and become a more advanced entity. It would remain limited to its state of &quot;low bliss&quot; if you will.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while romantic, that&#39;s not true at all. Man was looking to the stars since the most peaceful of times - and especially in times when we were, as a species, closer to nature. We are engineers by nature - we&#39;re curious by nature. To say that people have to be destroying eachother for that to happen is...well - just flat wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say there is ample evidence and argument indicating this is nowhere near as much the case as you or others might think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about what you mentioned here.  It&#39;s not about Stratfor and Alex Jones.  It&#39;s about the extent toward which there is a group on this planet that&#39;s been said to have almost limitless control over things here - that controls Statfor, AJ, the CIA, and pretty much every other entity of influence - and that group uses that influence toward nefarious ends.  That much seems obvious to anyone with even half a critical thinking brain cell and it is certainly a fact that exists INDEPENDENT of any data in the HH link.</p>

<p>The connection lies in the tie between that uber influential group that definitely DOES exist on this planet, and who that group actually might be, where they might come from, and what purpose and reason they might have for being here according to the information in the HH link.</p>

<p>Is this <em>actually</em> the case?  I, of course, don&#39;t know.  Again, I&#39;m merely providing the information as definite food for thought for inquiring minds.  If you&#39;re not one or didn&#39;t get anything out of it, then that&#39;s okay too.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s called a shadow government, of which the most known alphabet soup group is the CIA. There <em>is</em> a massive conspiracy, and in the name of TRUE logic and reason I can&#39;t dismiss anything I do not know - including inhabitants of Venus and a...(trying to hold back laughter) Greater Galactic Council - but this seems like a classic example of someone making up something to attempt to explain that which they cannot. There&#39;s really not a lot to it - you give an organization unlimited resources, no accountability, and no transparency, mix that in with human nature - and you get what we have today - a shadow government. But none of this is anything new - it&#39;s just changed regimes and faces. <strong>There has always been people trying to subvert other people</strong>. In the case of the CIA, though, it&#39;s never going to change - ever. It&#39;s too far gone. Have fun trying to identify who, it&#39;s fun, but make no mistake, it&#39;s a waste of time. The human race is doomed. Passivity has killed us all.</p>

<p>In the absolutely best case scenario - we are going to repeat the same patterns of civilization, forever and ever: from bondage to spiritual faith - from spiritual faith to courage - from courage to liberty - from liberty to abundance - from abundance to complacency, from complacency to apathy - from apathy to dependence - and from dependence back into bondage. This has happened many many many times already - and it&#39;s not because of some Galactic UN.</p>

<p>That alone, however, is enough to end it all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, there is a twist. This guy, and all of his activities is funded and scripted by the CIA through a company called Stratfor. This is no longer just a theory. This is now a provable fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Author seems to not know the difference between Proof and Evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tila Tequila was asked to be on the Alex Jones show, but her appearance was cancelled at the last moment. The person who made this video complained to infowars that they didn´t let her on and got a response from a Molly Maroney, the editor in chief of infowars magazine. She decided to google the name and found out that this person had previously worked STRATFOR. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I listend to Tila Tequila and she makes unreasonable points also Alex Jones said multiple times he don&#39;t talks about fallen angels and aliens because its discredit his information.</p>

<p>The only real evidence that infowars is maybe infiltrated by goverment agents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He also generally gives the impression of someone in a volatile psychological condition. Here he starts crying, or more accurately he pretends to be crying, on air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>its called emotional breakdown.Which doesen&#39;t surprise me for a person who works 6 days a week for 15 years looking at this information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I then found this clip from Bill Cooper where he exposes how Alex uses blatant fear mongering and false reporting on the 31st of december 1999. (Y2K)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He apologized for this many times. Its called a Mistake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bill Cooper was then murdered by the police, eliminating his biggest competitor, someone who had tried to out him as a fraud and a fear mongerer, and the man who predicted that there would be a staged attack in the US to start a major war against civil liberties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Y2K again....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is pro Israel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He does critize them for foreign Aid and other Actions.</p>

<p>True is he doesen&#39;t talk about them everday because there is more important news.</p>

<p>To recap this Article the only real evidence is that Molly Morgan is maybe still working for Straftor undercover.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that Alex Jones himself is working for the Straftor/CIA.</p>

<p>The first passage &quot;The Script for World Domination&quot; is based on Alex Jones infiltration of the Bohemian Grove and the second &quot;Problem-Reaction-Solution&quot; on David Ickes Work.</p>

<p>And yes there is controlled Opposition as Example Glenn Back who is a light version of Alex Jones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they kill him in the aftermath it will only help to prove our point and if we make that clear they might not think it´s worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure....</p>

<p>For those who are still thinking he is working for Straftor/CIA i have 3 Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why did &quot;they&quot; let him infiltrated Bohemian Grove and how?</li>
</ol>

<p>Only let him trough the front gate doesen&#39;t work because he was with other british journalists.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why do they let him cover massive information like Bilderberg?</li>
</ol>

<p>They could instead give him wrong information and manipulate us or like Glenn Back mix truth with bullshit.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why didn&#39;t Alex Jones accept any offer for a TV Show on Mainstream Channels especially in the beginning of his career and instead did build his Alternative Media from ground up?</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>I started becoming suspicious of Alex when he started his campaign against the Zeitgeist films. His biggest concern was that he didn´t like the way the films exposed the christian religion as a fraud, and complained that it was anti-capitalistic and utopian. But mostly it was because when he interviewed Peter Joseph he was just so annoying.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence, she just googled Alex Jones editors name and saw that she worked for a company that was run by the CIA. I googled too and saw that this wasn&#39;t a secret, Alex hired her <strong>because</strong> she worked for the CIA.</p>

<p>But apparently this is enough info for the youtube lady in conjuction with Tila freakin&#39; Tequila to declare that Alex Jones works for the CIA.</p>

<p>Now, I am still reading the blog but facts like &quot;Alex Jones started in 1996 and Stratford started in 1996&quot; isn&#39;t proof of anything but both things happening in 1996. I&#39;m sure to some people it will be enough to call for the death of Alex Jones though lol</p>
