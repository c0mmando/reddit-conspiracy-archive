    <div class="md"><p>Well, I just spent the last 3 days reading &quot;Human race get off your knees, the lion sleeps no more&quot; by David Icke, so this subject is on my mind. Now..whether you believe in the &quot;reptilian&quot; part of David&#39;s theories, he makes a very convincing case about massive collusion between the bloodline families, and the various secret societies. His thoughts on the nature of consciousness are especially on point; My own experiences with entities not of this world, of a different vibration, bear that out. The thing is, whether YOU believe in illuminati, or consciousness, or alien conspiracies, etc is less important than the fact that THEY(meaning very powerful elites) certainly do, and by studying their beliefs, you can see what they want for the rest of us.</p>

<p>What they want isn&#39;t good. What they&#39;re after is literally the enslavement of all humanity, and they&#39;re not really hiding it anymore, it&#39;s in your face, if you are willing to open your eyes, and mind, to see.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; are betting that you won&#39;t until its too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the research that I have done, the illuminati do &quot;exist&quot; but not really in the way that books and movies would have you believe. </p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s followers of an ancient esoteric religion of nature and celestial worship. Not quite paganism, not quite satanism. </p>

<p>Esoteric teachings have been around for thousands of years, from secrets guarded by the priests of Egypt, to the cult of Mithra, to the Rosicrucians. There is a secret history of the world, guarded by intelligent men and women that is still pretty much in tact to this day. </p>

<p>Strange things to those who don&#39;t understand the teachings, like how mankind evolved in several steps from a finite non material existence, to a vegetable-plant like existence, to a more material existence we see today. </p>

<p>How our consciousness was more of a hive mind in the beginning, where we were aware of higher planes of existence and could see and interact with the entities that lived in them. To a time where our skulls became more solidified and our consciousness was split from the hive mind to individual thought. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183683.The_Secret_Teachings_of_All_Ages">See: &quot;The Secret Teachings of all Ages&quot; - Manly P. Hall</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re genuinely interested in the teachings of these societies and schools, you&#39;d have better results going straight to the source and checking out the works of initiates such as:</p>

<p>Israel Regardie, Dion Fortune, Alice Bailey, Aleister Crowley (his earlier work i.e. &quot;777 and other Qabalistic Writings&quot;), Eliphas Levi, C. G. Jung, Joseph Campbell, Gareth Knight, Hermes Trismegistus and Rudolf Steiner</p>

<p>It&#39;s a complicated subject which has taken up 15 years of my life, tireless research. I have met esoteric clubs, talked to a few Rosicrucians, an related to a 32 degree freemason, and have even met a couple satanists. </p>

<p>Most of these people are actually quite harmless, and do nothing to destroy humanity. </p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that the Illuminati is an easy way to blame the worlds problems on a shadowy non identifiable group of people. And I say, fuck that. </p>

<p>We know who the real problem makers are, the banking barons and their families, pedophile rings, human trafficking, Drug Cartels, War profiteers, neo-conservative leaders, and big agriculture and pharma. </p>

<p>The illuminati is pushed to make you believe that positive change in this world is hopeless. </p>

<p>And I say the only thing that stops this world from true progress are the actions of a few dominant men. And they definitely don&#39;t call themselves the &quot;Illuminati&quot;. </p>

<p>Rothschild, Rockefeller, Warburg, DuPont, Schiff - the list goes on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Posted one other time in this thread - posted here so it will get more readers:</p>

<p>Shamanistic societies in Africa gave rise to more largely organized theocraticly integrated societies in Abrahamic religion, evidently all oriented around the fear, confusion, and obedience generated by displays of power and their social fallout.  </p>

<p>Judaism, at some point, probably  at its creation, became a religion that had morphed into a bureaucratic system for malevolent control  (i.e.  tax being charged for entry to religious worship in Jewish temples, as recorded in the Bible).  Jesus came and protested this abomination, possibly with some strange beliefs of his own, but mostly a message of peace and anarchy, and was crucified to death as a symbol that anyone who should contest the people in power would be treated without mercy.  </p>

<p>This gave rise within 400 years to the Roman Catholic church, a <em>state-church</em> merger (due to the ruling powers&#39; notice of the threat to their power of <em>peace</em> and <em>anarchism</em>), which became the dominating power of Europe during the Dark Ages/Feudalist era, and their power was more or less absolute until the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, which taught alternative doctrines to the official doctrine of the &quot;Godhead&quot; (Father, son, holy ghost) and resurrection (dogmas cemented in place by the Nicean Creed and Creed of Constantinople, religious meetings to determine official Christian doctrine which were led by the Roman government).</p>

<p>Some schools of Protestantism, especially modern radical Christianity/Gnosticism, very closely approach(ed) the actual truth, and recognize(d) Jesus not as a <em>supernatural</em> figure, but as a symbol of persecution by those who would use evil to make society work in their interest, who had long since coalesced into a tightly hierarchical power structure (of which the Catholic Church is one of the many outlets of power, but which also included government and eventually corporate structures).  You will notice that modern corporations still pay tribute (&quot;corporate tax&quot;) to this power structure.</p>

<p>So the &quot;Illuminati&quot; - a term which they likely do not use for themselves, but which has entered the common dialect to describe them - have been a tight-knit group of people, in some form or another, for over 2,000 years.  Their modern form is considerably atrophied and weakened by the massive trail of evidence demonstrating their existence, and also by the ridiculousness of the institutions that they require to exist becoming increasingly apparent to the citizens of the world.  </p>

<p>tl:dr; the &quot;Illuminati&quot; has existed at least as long as Catholicism, and probably as long as Judaism itself.  Religion is a hoax used to distract from the evils of government by promoting the myth of inherent human ignorance and by giving false reassurances of divine approval of political power (i.e., the &quot;Pope&quot;&#39;s recent nonstop calls for a &quot;world government&quot;).  Essentially, two thousand  and plus years ago, a handful of people abused their knowledge of higher science (specifically, psychology and warfare techniques) to cast humanity into a two thousand year age of misery and ignorance (relative to the slightly more mild misery and ignorance they had before), which, thank god, is coming to an end with the advent of the internet.  During that time, they had firmly remained in place as the upper class of the world, being able to  constantly control events to their interest with endless sabotage, political coups, religious/political brainwashing, and enforcement of debts onto society through client rulers of nations.  Imperial feudalism replaced agrarian agricultural societies by forceful conquest under its military institutions - that&#39;s how hunter/gatherer, agrarian, and even more primitive urban societies collapsed into national Catholic-feudalism.  Their modern day form is a tightly knit group of corporations (focus points at the C.F.R. and Bilderberg Group meetings, among others) and government officials who pay tribute, through government finance and private transactions, to banking institutions who essentially launder money for the rulers of the world.</p>

<p>It is starkly real, a daily source of misery for anyone who knows about it while it still exists, and something that must never happen again.    It is way too stupid to be fit for mankind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Andrew Hitchcock&#39;s &quot;The History of the House of Rothschild&quot;, Jewish-born/Jesuit-trained Adam Weishaupt was entrusted with the creation of the &quot;Bavarian Illuminati&quot; by Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1770.  It&#39;s unclear when the Rothschild family adopted a monarchical rule over the system, but Biblical evidence (as cited in the same document):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I know thy works, and tribulation and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.&quot; (Book of Revelations)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>suggests that the center of imperial control, whether or not in that exact family (or that family <em>name</em> alone), was circulating somewhere in the Jewish community for thousands of years.  It is vitally important to read the word &quot;Satan&quot; as meant by its original Hebrew root - &quot;adversary&quot;, i.e., &quot;the adversary of mankind&quot;.</p>

<p>So, that evidence <em>suggests</em> that a formal organization known as &quot;Illuminati&quot; is only a few hundred years old - spawned as an outlet of an <em>existing</em> power structure.  The evidence around here is fairly hazy - it is difficult to demonstrate any organizational movements or even conferences of the &quot;Illuminati&quot;, compared to the more well-documented C.F.R., Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, and other more public organizations who likely share many of the same members of any existing modern &quot;Illuminati&quot; organization.</p>

<p>The sources used to produce that document, by the way (see the bottom of the page):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm">http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm</a></p>

<p>This.  I believe 2Pac said the same thing to prisoners venting about the Illuminati...something along the lines of: &quot;you&#39;re so worried about whose face is ON the money, you&#39;re not GETTING the money!&quot;  </p>

<p>The Illuminati conspiracy crap pulls attention away from the real issues and caters to Sci-Fi schizophrenic types (see: Youtube).  I&#39;d be more apt to believe the conspiracy theory itself was perpetrated by the world&#39;s evildoers than to believe the Illuminati are the root of all evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a stupid question. I don&#39;t necessarily BELIEVE or put FAITH into any of the random concepts and theories floating around on the internet. You also have to take into consideration what your definition of &quot;Illuminati&quot; actually is. People have a wide variation of just what exactly defines &quot;Illuminati&quot; for them. I personally don&#39;t think there is any concise, highly organized, secretive group that plots with malicious intent for the world behind the scenes with an ultimate goal. I BELIEVE that power structures of the world have gone corrupt and are being manipulated by influential people, elitists, and those who are in power to propagate their own agendas and further their own self wealth and importance with disregard for the rest of society. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there is some singular evil group trying to take control of the world, but it also doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t groups of powerful people that do manipulate society, and do take advantage of their power. </p>

What I do believe in are the energies that I feel day in and day out. The energy that I direct toward doing something or to someone I care about. What gets me is that to survive in the civilization &quot;we&quot; have created we have to use up so much of our precious energy getting money that we have little to none left to explore our minds, the inner depths of what makes us human and the questions like why are we here and where did we come from? No, after a long week of dumping our very life force into a job we fucking hate what do we want to do? Relax. Unwind. Forget about things. It&#39;s a fucking trap and it breaks my heart.

<p>Our want of these things doesn&#39;t create them. We aren&#39;t born with the knowledge of these things either. They&#39;re all man-made and with a purpose. I think that purpose can be easily manipulated to fit an agenda while using the original purpose to mask whatever the agenda may be.</p>

<p>The big picture, if there is one, is much bigger than most of us care to think about. The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Machine-Science-Surveillance-Culture/dp/1931498520">Welcome to the Machine</a> opened my eyes to the idea that the conspiracy, if there is one, is much, much larger than I first thought possible...if there is one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Illuminati&quot; is just street sland for &quot;the most powerful people who run the world.&quot;
<em>Obviously</em> there exists a transnational capitalist ruling elite, comprised of the wealthiest and most powerful people representing various corporate/financial interests. It&#39;s not monolithic; there are disagreements amongst these people, but they sit down together at the Bilderberg Group meetings and at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission and other transnational organizations, and they &quot;conspire,&quot; as it were, on how to advance the &quot;Empire&quot; of global capital for the long-term preservation of the system- how to continue to expand capitalist globalization while minimizing risks of revolution. 
It&#39;s pretty simple... just as &quot;industry consolidation groups&quot; groups exist or the good of the industry as a whole, transnational financial elites have a consolidation group. They plot how to keep their power and prevent seizing of political power by us barbarians (such as is happening in a few South American countries, like Venezuela and Bolivia, where there are ongoing revolutions).  They use tons of transnational groups and mechanisms like the UN and the WTO and the IMF as their tools, as well as the big foundations, such as the Rockefeller and Ford and Gates foundations. It&#39;s a system of multinational corporate hegemony, in which nation-states are less and less relevant. 
This is what&#39;s happening clear as day in front of us. If the question is about the &quot;occult&quot; nature of global political elites- well, there&#39;s obviously some of that out there and a history of powerful people using symbolism and imagery... but that&#39;s only one piece of the picture of political control. Crass political and economic means and the Drug War are the most overt tools of controlling us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The illuminaughty is 1 way to refer to the mystery schools. The mystery schools had many different forms of instantiation over the past several decades notably the Knights Templar the Free Masons The Odd Fellows the rosecrutions the skull and bones the Knights of Malta and many many more. What binds these differences societies is there belief in gnosisism humanism and Descartesism. As such the societies haven&#39;t heritage massive wealth and power simply by being capable of manipulating massive populations using other nonsensical tales I eat many centuries ago heaven and hell good and evil and today such mystical tells us as carbon based anthro progenic global warming a Islamic based military Giunta that executed the 911 attacks excetera. Despite the clear fact that these are totally blatant lies and can be completely disproven within a matter of hours even to a lay person, they still persist these are the students of the mystery schools these are what we now refer to as the enlightened ones or rather the illuminaughty even  graduates from the University when is referred to as an alumni in reference to the act of allumination that occurred at University. So it is not one small circular table of people but it&#39;s rather a huge chunk of society that is hugely intelligent and has lost faith in the average man and refers to them as cattle this faction of society runs everything.

<p>The above-named documents reveal as the real object of the Illuminati the elaboration and propagation of a new popular religion and, in the domain of politics, the gradual establishment of a universal democratic republic. In this society of the future everything, according to Weishaupt, was to be regulated by reason. By &quot;enlightenment&quot; men were to be liberated from their silly prejudices, to become &quot;mature&quot; or &quot;moral&quot;, and thus to outgrow the religious and political tutelage of Church and State, of &quot;priest and prince&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t, but I do not doubt that the financial elite and families with historic political power (id est, the Clintons, the royal family, the Rockefellers, et cetera) collude to keep and extend their power. But to the extent that these ties exist are probably not as fantastical as &quot;iluminati believers&quot; would think. In capitalist model it is only natural for a small group of people to dominate, and obviously once they do, it is only natural for them to cooperate (and occasionally fuck each other over) to retain their power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really quite simple. A family, group of families, or societies, control and profit from the issuance of our currency world-wide. They&#39;re secretive, they&#39;re powerful, and they&#39;ve been at this game for a long time. Their methods empower the ruling elites and impoverish nations. They&#39;re parasitic and psychopathic in behaviour. </p>

<p>And they really are screwing you, me, and practically everyone on the planet. In order to understand just how much you only need take a look at a country such as Libya before they managed to get their claws into it. Now you may thinking <em>Libya, Gaddafi, rogue state, human rights abuses etc. etc.</em> but just drop all of that conditioning for a second and <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MD14Ak02.html">take a look at what Muammar al-Gaddafi was able to do for his people without a global central banking cartel calling the shots</a> and ask yourself, why did the rebel forces invading Libya stop half way through their attack to set up a central bank? Libya is now just as fucked as the rest of us.</p>

<p>Do I believe in a secretive and powerful group of elites who are pulling the strings? You&#39;re damn right I do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back when Europe was run by Christian zealots, governments would send spies to infiltrate secular organizations. Sort of like how the FBI sends undercover agents to join the KKK today. To guard against this, secular organizations had to make their members do all kinds of weird anti-Christian rituals that no true believer would perform. </p>

<p>Of course that&#39;s really not necessary today. Governments have no reason to persecute atheists, and simply attending an elite university is often enough to plug you into the right networks now. College frats/sororities do weird initiation stuff mostly out of deference to tradition, but also because some of it is kind of funny and gives them a good excuse to do crazy shit. At the professional level, rich people just behave like rich people and the debauched ones just do what any debauched rich person would do. Anyone who reads anything more into this sort if thing is a probably a lonely shut-in.</p>

<p>&quot;The illuminati,&quot; if it existed today, would be anachronistic and pointless. Science and reason are acceptable now.
Senior policy makers no longer have to hide the fact that they do cost/benefit analysis instead of consulting priests and praying to jeebus for advice. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the fact that secret societies were originally established so that elites who didn&#39;t believe in stupid religious nonsense could do elite things without church intervention. That&#39;s no longer necessary because most governments are secular now. If David Hume were alive today he could be up front about his religious skepticism, but in the 18th century he could not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends how much you make of the symbols. Why the use them and not some other random symbol, maybe they just, like you say with the pagan goths. But symbols have a power in modern life even at a subliminal level. Brand identity is coupled to the symbol. People share a relationship to the brand. Maybe those people at Glastonbury share some common experience with that organization, and it&#39;s only clear to them. It&#39;s a big place where they have literally a population of a city, a lot of them are very rich. Some of them hid it better than others. In some areas you have very pagan-like pagodas and tents, even a full nude field. It&#39;s not even just Glastonbury, there are other gatherings all around that area at that time of year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shamanistic societies in Africa gave rise to more largely organized theocraticly integrated societies in Abrahamic religion, evidently all oriented around the fear, confusion, and obedience generated by displays of power and their social fallout.  </p>

<p>Judaism, at some point, probably  at its creation, became a religion that had morphed into a bureaucratic system for malevolent control  (i.e.  tax being charged for entry to religious worship in Jewish temples, as recorded in the Bible).  Jesus came and protested this abomination, possibly with some strange beliefs of his own, but mostly a message of peace and anarchy, and was crucified to death as a symbol that anyone who should contest the people in power would be treated without mercy.  </p>

<p>This gave rise within 400 years to the Roman Catholic church, a <em>state-church</em> merger (due to the ruling powers&#39; notice of the threat to their power of <em>peace</em> and <em>anarchism</em>), which became the dominating power of Europe during the Dark Ages/Feudalist era, and their power was more or less absolute until the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, which taught alternative doctrines to the official doctrine of the &quot;Godhead&quot; (Father, son, holy ghost) and resurrection (dogmas cemented in place by the Nicean Creed and Creed of Constantinople, religious meetings to determine official Christian doctrine which were led by the Roman government).</p>

<p>Some schools of Protestantism, especially modern radical Christianity/Gnosticism, very closely approach(ed) the actual truth, and recognize(d) Jesus not as a <em>supernatural</em> figure, but as a symbol of persecution by those who would use evil to make society work in their interest, who had long since coalesced into a tightly hierarchical power structure (of which the Catholic Church is one of the many outlets of power, but which also included government and eventually corporate structures).  You will notice that modern corporations still pay tribute (&quot;corporate tax&quot;) to this power structure.</p>

<p>So the &quot;Illuminati&quot; - a term which they likely do not use for themselves, but which has entered the common dialect to describe them - have been a tight-knit group of people, in some form or another, for over 2,000 years.  Their modern form is considerably atrophied and weakened by the massive trail of evidence demonstrating their existence, and also by the ridiculousness of the institutions that they require to exist becoming increasingly apparent to the citizens of the world.  </p>

<p>tl:dr; the &quot;Illuminati&quot; has existed at least as long as Catholicism, and probably as long as Judaism itself.  Religion is a hoax used to distract from the evils of government by promoting the myth of inherent human ignorance and by giving false reassurances of divine approval of political power (i.e., the &quot;Pope&quot;&#39;s recent nonstop calls for a &quot;world government&quot;).  Essentially, two thousand  and plus years ago, a handful of people abused their knowledge of higher science (specifically, psychology and warfare techniques) to cast humanity into a two thousand year age of misery and ignorance (relative to the slightly more mild misery and ignorance they had before), which, thank god, is coming to an end with the advent of the internet.  During that time, they had firmly remained in place as the upper class of the world, being able to  constantly control events to their interest with endless sabotage, political coups, religious/political brainwashing, and enforcement of debts onto society through client rulers of nations.  Imperial feudalism replaced agrarian agricultural societies by forceful conquest under its military institutions - that&#39;s how hunter/gatherer, agrarian, and even more primitive urban societies collapsed into national Catholic-feudalism.  Their modern day form is a tightly knit group of corporations (focus points at the C.F.R. and Bilderberg Group meetings, among others) and government officials who pay tribute, through government finance and private transactions, to banking institutions who essentially launder money for the rulers of the world.</p>

<p>It is starkly real, a daily source of misery for anyone who knows about it while it still exists, and something that must never happen again.    It is way too stupid to be fit for mankind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just one group as the media would have it but rather a multitude of groups/societies and cults formed into a hierarchy based on knowledge, or their knowledge as that&#39;s pretty much the premise of secret societies. They know something important that you don&#39;t and normally it resolves around scientific knowledge and the use of such knowledge and of course, religious truths and knowledges and how they manipulate that to twist religions and peoples perceptions of spiritual truth(s). </p>

<p><strong>Behold a Pale Horse</strong> is a quite intriguing read from William Cooper as he reveals some quite startling information on their end goal (and also on the names of the majority of all societies and their probable origin). Though, he is fully aware that the information he has gathered could be false, a hoax but from all his research and experience he can only assume it&#39;s true. Which means we too can also assume it&#39;s true, at least to a degree...he was killed off, remember? </p>

<p>It&#39;s really quite hard to discern truth from the lies, which is the way <em>they</em> would have it and to deter people from looking into such matters further which is completely understandable today.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you believe in what they do (they being brotherhood of the snake, illuminati, scroll and key, skull and bones, JASON society et cetera) their beliefs <em>will</em> effect you, because they are in power and have influence in every persons&#39; life today. </p>

<p>Their beliefs, concerning aliens is quite startling. Quite a burden if true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is a good assessment, the religious connotations to the word &quot;illuminati&quot; as in secret society of Freemasons and fucked up Vatican string pullers just fits right into the &quot;nutter/conspiracy theorist&quot; manipulation that they USED to lay down, now that they have seen it &quot;spread&quot; they take advantage of this in order to set up controlled oppositions in a &quot;pre crime&quot; manner....meaning this, lets say you are the guys in control, you own all the worlds currency supplies as a products but have all the stupid fucking sheep thinking that their government makes the currency, this is the &quot;goose that lays the golden egg&quot; it must be protected at all cost....so....as the unfortunate reality of the scam that is being run on your &quot;subjects&quot; becomes clear to your &quot;subject&quot;....it is important to take precautions in order to manipulate future events....so,they will propagate such catch phrases, let the soak into the general population, then the idea has been implanted....they want you to know whats up because they know that they will not be able to stop you from eventually finding out.....so that&#39;s when they start to form their controlled opposition guys, they get them in early in the game....Stratfor &quot;the view&quot; Jone&#39;s would be a good example....you must understand most all media, both mainstream and &quot;alternate&quot; is a division of the intelligence division of the military which is a division of the government which is a division of the central banking cartels that run your world by YOU granting them the rights to create your currency supply from thin air and then having you spend the rest of your life sweating your ass off to pay them 1/2 of your labor with &quot;real&quot; money.....its fucking brilliant, you just have to stand back in awe and look at the well oiled criminal machine....it&#39;s actually beautiful in a sick and disgusting way....like a dead bird</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They exists, who is part of it, to what extent and to what goal is rather unknown as there are conflicting reports.</p>

<p>I mean for example the triangle is supposed to mean the trinity, the eye is supposed to be the 3rd eye of enlightenment, the pentagram is supposed to be a seal for hell and not a hell door or hell endorsement.
Now all these are turned upside down.</p>

<p>What I worry is not one men or one family or few groups of individuals, what I fear is the people. If the people are good and virtuous and informed, no evil, no bad can rise. But we have an average population of slobs and empty vessels that will go along with any evil.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I believe they got corrupted somewhere along the way, and became what they were trying to stop. Instead of spreading information they withhold it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to choose something to put on money and ornament buildings with, is it really that surprising?  The eagle, for instance, which is found on money and all sorts of buildings goes back at least to the Roman military standard used to direct battle.  I don&#39;t think anyone believes the eagle is nefarious or means much. You also have to take into account that religious and corporate symbolism can&#39;t be used..that narrows artistic choices.</p>

<p>Just as a test. Give yourself a minute to see how many positive/neutral commonly understood symbols you come up with.  And remember, you can&#39;t use religious symbols, anything closely resembling a corporate symbol, and no text.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People Always say they&#39;re evil, they run the world, etc. IMO the illuminati are just the very top tier who run the country/world. I don&#39;t think those people would even call themselves illuminati, they&#39;re just people in the highest ranks/positions. Maybe I&#39;m missing out on something but I don&#39;t believe all that cult/satanic/evil stuff. No one in that high of position is gonna be dumb enough to believe and worship any religious deities. I know the masons are often discussed on the topic but I think people look too much into it. I wouldn&#39;t disagree with the idea of the top masons being in part of the global elite(illuminati to some) i just think people blow it outta proportion. And I think all the stuff people say they do with music is bogus. The symbols of the pyramids and eyes are just part of pop culture now to get attention. Altho I feel like the all seeing eye just symbolizes the illuminati because they&#39;re the top of the pyramid and are watching/controlling everything below.</p>

<p>You&#39;re telling me a bunch of stone masons hundreds of years ago didn&#39;t pick the square and compass because they were tools of their job that best represented them then add myth after?  But rather that they were chosen for some mystic reasons and just happened to be tools of the job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m doing close to that very thing.</p>

<p>Our want of these things doesn&#39;t create them. We aren&#39;t born with the knowledge of these things either. They&#39;re all man-made and with a purpose. I think that purpose can be easily manipulated to fit an agenda while using the original purpose to mask whatever the agenda may be.</p>

<p>The big picture, if there is one, is much bigger than most of us care to think about. The book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Machine-Science-Surveillance-Culture/dp/1931498520">Welcome to the Machine</a> opened my eyes to the idea that the conspiracy, if there is one, is much, much larger than I first thought possible...if there is one.</p>
