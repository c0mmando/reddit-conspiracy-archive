       I thought the illuminati was
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       in control of everything?  So, their agenda goes:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <del>
        Take over the governments of the world with a huge population
       </del>
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
       <del>
        Take over the media of the world.
       </del>
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Kill population we already control except for a few slaves because, meh, it'll be easier to manage.

       I think talking about secret societies and their symbols can be a bit of a distraction from what's going on in plain sight, with the banks, propaganda, and militarization overrunning everything here. I mean, what does an owl in the corner of the US dollar bill indicate other than some people in the art department of the fed are histrionic dorks who think ripping off pallas athena is funny? We should feel insulted to have them as rulers.

       It is far easier to hide things in plain sight than you might think. Keeping certain symbols in the public's view on a daily basis helps train the public to ignore them.

       I don't think they are as secret as you state.
      </p>
      <p>
       They operate right in the open.  They leave symbols everywhere.
       <br/>
       They get the US government go to war over lies.  They launder drug money with little to no recompense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans and other countries know we go to war for for oil.  Americans know they products they buy come from sweat shops.  Americans know that cops can shoot and kill you with no reason and get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans know that the financial institutions have been fixing the game for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most modern day people know all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       That fact that we know doesn't change anything because there really is nothing we can do to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's to far along now.  People have already given power to the ones who would dominate and enslave the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's to late.  Just live your life as best you can and try to survive and be happy as long as you can.

       The illuminati have compared themselves to wolves among sheep. They howl for all those to hear, daring those who hear the call to try something, while the ignorant do not see the howl as anything meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wolves stalk their prey, they don't just go in for the kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure they all have a good ol' time laughing about the clarity of their symbolism and the cluelessness of the masses.

       illuminati are hiding messages, so you can wake up from being mindless slave, going about your false driven daily life... like how a comedian just tells you the straight up truth and you'll just burst out with laughter, because cops eating donuts is SO funny

       What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
