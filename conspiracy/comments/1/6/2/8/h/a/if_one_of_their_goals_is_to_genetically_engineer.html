    <div class="md"><p>Go into a supermarket in a poor neighborhood (if they have one and not just convenience stores) and look for organic/ non-gmo food. Now go to a supermarket in a middle or upperclass neighborhood and do the same thing. You&#39;ll find pretty good, healthy stuff there. The &quot;elite&quot; are many times richer than the &quot;upper class&quot;, and even the upper class has access to the good shit. I think they&#39;ll be fine. Also, I think diMario is right.

<p>Please don&#39;t:</p>

<p>In regard to voting:</p>

<p>Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don&#39;t personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you&#39;re downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons. </p>

<p>Mass downvote someone else&#39;s posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don&#39;t go out of your way to seek out an enemy&#39;s posts. </p>

<p>Moderate a story based on your opinion of its source. Quality of content is more important than who created it. </p>

<p>Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don&#39;t upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster&#39;s username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content. </p>

<p>Report posts just because you do not like them. You should only be using the report button if the post breaks the subreddit rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I&#39;m buying food from a farmers market where I can talk to the people who grow it and ask them about how they grow it, I don&#39;t really give a shit whether or not they&#39;ve been certified as organic. When I go to a supermarket, which I am forced to do a few months out of the year, I can only get info from the label, and &quot;organic&quot; is one of the few things that actually means something legally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you assume that certified organic equates to good quality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I just used that as one example because it&#39;s the most noticeable. Even the conventional produce in supermarkets in nicer areas is higher quality. I would &quot;assume that certified organic&quot; is higher quality on average, but not in every single instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First let me start with a story (you know now this&#39;ll get a little meandering).  In Jr. High and Highschool (and on and off until the present), one of my best friends was the most powerful HS varsity and Junior varsity (college) competitor ever in those leagues.  One time we were talking about why he had so completely dedicated himself to it and he told me that it was largely so he could spend time as a live in roomer with some of the richest people in the world, which he did, and see what they ate.  What he came up with was essentially what my mom came up with after decades of dietary research, and what most dieticians will tell youi: eat the stuff that was growing (animal and vegetable and especially legumes) that haven&#39;t been fucked with in either the GM or pesticide way.  You know, the stuff we&#39;re evolved to eat...  I thought I had a second point, but I&#39;m tired of writing now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Monsanto GMO which I am guessing is your main target is a patent controlled seed stock made to be used with roundup. It being potentially dangerous is just a byproduct of their manufacturing process. </p>

<p>Organic is available Whole Foods( I know they sell GMO) are in the richer neighborhoods. If it bothers you enough start a garden. It is easy, and if you want to look at newer ways of growing organic food look up aquaponics (aquaculture mixed with hydroponics). Me and my friends have no experience and we are able to subsidize each meal with stuff from our garden.  </p>
