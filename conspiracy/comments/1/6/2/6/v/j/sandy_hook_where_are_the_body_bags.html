    <div class="md"><p>Your missing the point.  It&#39;s not about broadcasting it on CNN.  It&#39;s about the fact that no one knows where the bodies are.

There have been zero photos of bodies (not from helicopters, not from the media circus) showing bodes of the massacred children being moved from the school to a hospital or morgue.  <strong>Does anyone know where the bodies are?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I understand that the bodies were claimed but the way the bodies were identified were by photos taken by the medical examiners. From what I heard the funerals were all empty casket at that. That means the only people that saw the bodies first hand were the first responders and the medical examiners.</p>

<p>Secondly, the reports from the people in the school were of hearing enough gun fire that they thought multiple people were shooting. But not a single person has said that they saw the gunman. That&#39;s not to say that he didn&#39;t kill everyone that saw him, but it&#39;s unlikely as there were two victims that were wounded. And what of the man they found in the woods?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that nobody was killed, however there questions that need answering and there hasn&#39;t seemed to be any progress on the official story. Instead of answers we&#39;re just being fed anti-gun crap by the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve watched too much TV. Shows like CSI are all fiction. Local cop shops don&#39;t have the budgets to own labs or hire forensic teams. There may be one or two crime labs in every state at most. Sandy Hook was pretty cut and dry and didn&#39;t require forensics to unravel a mystery. ABC ran extensive coverage of Emilie Park&#39;s alleged death however she is pictured on Obama&#39;s knee after the shooting. Tribute pages for alleged victims were posted online up to three days before the event and a handbook titled &quot;How to talk to your children about the tragedy at Sandy Hook&quot; was published on December 10, 2012, four days before the shooting. Explain all of that, please, I want to know how things like this can happen. When you look at all the evidence, and lack thereof, this Sandy Hook story takes on the odor of a week dead fish. This isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve been lied to about a major event. It won&#39;t be the last.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your missing the point.  It&#39;s not about broadcasting it on CNN.  It&#39;s about the fact that no one knows where the bodies are.  Well, we know that Adan&#39;s dad claimed Adan&#39;s body.  That&#39;s all we know.  There have been zero photos of bodies (not from helicopters, not from the media circus) showing bodes of the massacred children being moved from the school to a hospital or morgue.   <strong>Does anyone know where the bodies are?</strong></p>

<p>I am not OP, maybe OP just has a dead people fetish.</p>

<p>However, in most criminal situations, it is very appropriate to ask to see the evidence of the crime. </p>

<p>I agree with your sentiment that the sandy hook thing has run away from even it&#39;s own insane self, even so, while I recognize why it is an inappropriate question emotionally, I think it is a very appropriate question politically.</p>

<p>If an event claimed to have happened changes basic customs of a culture, should that culture not be allowed to demand further evidence of the event? </p>

<p>Again, I know this is a sticky and emotional subject. I am just pushing the envelope because I like thinking about sticky stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. In this case, there is no trial to be had, so the rules of evidence just aren&#39;t applicable. </p>

<p>Without those responsibilities, it appears that that law enforcement is errring on the side of respect and solemnity for the victims and theirr survivors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of the political significance of the event, I think there is a line beyond which evidence is not required to be paraded in front of the world. Some forms of evidence are best left to the privacy that decency dictates. (Obviously that only applies to the general public who do not need to examine all forms of evidence themselves - I&#39;m not saying it should be hidden from prosecutors or investigators etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After the Columbine shooting there was evidence galore about the victims and the shooters. We saw the weapons used and the bodies of everyone that died. There are absolutely no questions about the shooters or the victims. Now compare that to Sandy Hook. There has been no evidence of weapons used, the shooter, or the victims made public. That either means that someone is hiding something or there is no evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve watched too much TV. Shows like CSI are all fiction. Local cop shops don&#39;t have the budgets to own labs or hire forensic teams. There may be one or two crime labs in every state at most. Sandy Hook was pretty cut and dry and didn&#39;t require forensics to unravel a mystery. ABC ran extensive coverage of Emilie Park&#39;s alleged death however she is pictured on Obama&#39;s knee after the shooting. Tribute pages for alleged victims were posted online up to three days before the event and a handbook titled &quot;How to talk to your children about the tragedy at Sandy Hook&quot; was published on December 10, 2012, four days before the shooting. Explain all of that, please, I want to know how things like this can happen. When you look at all the evidence, and lack thereof, this Sandy Hook story takes on the odor of a week dead fish. This isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve been lied to about a major event. It won&#39;t be the last.</p>
