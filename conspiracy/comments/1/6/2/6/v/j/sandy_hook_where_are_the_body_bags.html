       Seriously? They didn't show body bags so now the government is hiding something? Let me guess, next we are going to jump to saying Obama knew about the massacre and let it happen to forward his agenda to ban guns.

       Noone has seen bodybags taken out of school → there wasnt any bodies. Official story tells that noone was let into school for hours, later when media was there all the time, there wasn't any bodybags. I guess someone would notice the 20 bodybags, they are easy to spot.

       Your missing the point.  It's not about broadcasting it on CNN.  It's about the fact that no one knows where the bodies are.  Well, we know that Adam's dad claimed Adam's body.  That's all we know.  There have been zero photos of bodies (not from helicopters, not from the media circus) showing bodes of the massacred children being moved from the school to a hospital or morgue.
       <strong>
        Does anyone know where the bodies are?

       They've already had funerals and the parents did have to claim the bodies. Just because you didn't get to see the body bags, doesn't mean there is some conspiracy. They were respecting the families who suffered enough.

       They talked about the funerals every day they had them on the news. So you're telling me those parents are lying, that all those kids and teachers who heard all the gun shots were told to lie? What do you think happened?

       First off, I understand that the bodies were claimed but the way the bodies were identified were by photos taken by the medical examiners. From what I heard the funerals were all empty casket at that. That means the only people that saw the bodies first hand were the first responders and the medical examiners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the reports from the people in the school were of hearing enough gun fire that they thought multiple people were shooting. But not a single person has said that they saw the gunman. That's not to say that he didn't kill everyone that saw him, but it's unlikely as there were two victims that were wounded. And what of the man they found in the woods?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that nobody was killed, however there questions that need answering and there hasn't seemed to be any progress on the official story. Instead of answers we're just being fed anti-gun crap by the media.

       I don't have a source, but my understanding is that they took them out that night, or the next. Like they did in Aurora. They had to leave them there for a while. I don't know the reason.

       You've watched too much TV. Shows like CSI are all fiction. Local cop shops don't have the budgets to own labs or hire forensic teams. There may be one or two crime labs in every state at most. Sandy Hook was pretty cut and dry and didn't require forensics to unravel a mystery. ABC ran extensive coverage of Emilie Park's alleged death however she is pictured on Obama's knee after the shooting. Tribute pages for alleged victims were posted online up to three days before the event and a handbook titled "How to talk to your children about the tragedy at Sandy Hook" was published on December 10, 2012, four days before the shooting. Explain all of that, please, I want to know how things like this can happen. When you look at all the evidence, and lack thereof, this Sandy Hook story takes on the odor of a week dead fish. This isn't the first time we've been lied to about a major event. It won't be the last.

       I said nothing about forensics.  It takes a while to photograph and document the bodies as they were found as well as evidence gathering. All so they did not move the bodies until night out of respect for the parents, so the kids bodies would not end up on live TV.

       Some people need full disclosure. It has nothing to do with disrespecting the families if skeptics want to see everything, even the crime scene photos that are "sealed" AKA non-existent.

       Your missing the point.  It's not about broadcasting it on CNN.  It's about the fact that no one knows where the bodies are.  Well, we know that Adan's dad claimed Adan's body.  That's all we know.  There have been zero photos of bodies (not from helicopters, not from the media circus) showing bodes of the massacred children being moved from the school to a hospital or morgue.

       However, in most criminal situations, it is very appropriate to ask to see the evidence of the crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your sentiment that the sandy hook thing has run away from even it's own insane self, even so, while I recognize why it is an inappropriate question emotionally, I think it is a very appropriate question politically.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an event claimed to have happened changes basic customs of a culture, should that culture not be allowed to demand further evidence of the event?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I know this is a sticky and emotional subject. I am just pushing the envelope because I like thinking about sticky stuff.

       You are correct. In this case, there is no trial to be had, so the rules of evidence just aren't applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without those responsibilities, it appears that that law enforcement is errring on the side of respect and solemnity for the victims and theirr survivors.

       Regardless of the political significance of the event, I think there is a line beyond which evidence is not required to be paraded in front of the world. Some forms of evidence are best left to the privacy that decency dictates. (Obviously that only applies to the general public who do not need to examine all forms of evidence themselves - I'm not saying it should be hidden from prosecutors or investigators etc.)

       After the Columbine shooting there was evidence galore about the victims and the shooters. We saw the weapons used and the bodies of everyone that died. There are absolutely no questions about the shooters or the victims. Now compare that to Sandy Hook. There has been no evidence of weapons used, the shooter, or the victims made public. That either means that someone is hiding something or there is no evidence.

       Maybe because they were 16, SH's victims are 5?

       I don't need to "see" the bodies.  I would simply expect that there is a report that notes the location of the bodies.

       PS.  please don't ask me the same question a 3rd time.  i have addressed your question twice now.  will not address again.  (fool me once, shame on you.  fool me twice, shame on me.)

       So what's your point then? Other than the fact that there's a lack of photographs of the victims?

       This is what I suspected, but didn't really know for sure. I know it takes a long time to process such a big scene. Thanks.

       You've watched too much TV. Shows like CSI are all fiction. Local cop shops don't have the budgets to own labs or hire forensic teams. There may be one or two crime labs in every state at most. Sandy Hook was pretty cut and dry and didn't require forensics to unravel a mystery. ABC ran extensive coverage of Emilie Park's alleged death however she is pictured on Obama's knee after the shooting. Tribute pages for alleged victims were posted online up to three days before the event and a handbook titled "How to talk to your children about the tragedy at Sandy Hook" was published on December 10, 2012, four days before the shooting. Explain all of that, please, I want to know how things like this can happen. When you look at all the evidence, and lack thereof, this Sandy Hook story takes on the odor of a week dead fish. This isn't the first time we've been lied to about a major event. It won't be the last.
