<p>Milton William Cooper ladies and gentlemen wrote &quot;behold a pale horse&quot; and was the broadcaster for the &quot;hour of the time&quot; broadcasts which got him infamy as being one of the most dangerous broadcasters in the united states. </p>

<p>A man who died on his own front porch for his beliefs.. Called 9/11 before hand and spoke about it for a short period after. </p>

<p>A man who exposed Alex Jones for the fraud he is.. </p>

<p>A man who exposed The New World Order.. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not all...William Cooper died for all of us trying to expose the occult.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s hard to remember that not everyone knows what you know. And, likewise, others know things you do not know. We are all in a learning phase. Some are more aware than others; at different times, for varying reasons. As people were patient with you, you must be patient with others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I do, Maybe I don&#39;t...but there are some in this subreddit that think they know all and don&#39;t even know who Cooper is...</p>

<p>Imagine if you will an american historian who doesn&#39;t know all the founding fathers...Wouldn&#39;t be a very good historian and probably wouldn&#39;t have cred. THAT&#39;S MY POINT. Bill is comparable to one of the founding fathers of conspiracy research so if your here commenting you SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW WHO HE IS.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know who he is you should probably research a little bit more before trying to make comments on the subject.</p>

<p>Course trolls and tards don&#39;t play by those rules which is why I am fine with being an arrogant prick.</p>

<p>Your analogy is very inaccurate. It is more similar to a person with an interest in history not knowing a very popular historian. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got introduced to Mr. Cooper&#39;s research in 1990 by a friend who was a reporter for the Dallas Morning News on that fateful day in nov. 63.  His research into the assasination of JFK lead him to attend a seminar which Mr. Cooper was a speaker. 
After attending this event he wrote an article about this event which no major news organization would print.  He uploaded this story in a BBE file. This was prior to the birth of the internet we have today and the only avenue available to get this information to a more public forum.<br/>
I was given a copy of this file in late October in 1990 and my world view has changed permanently. The presidential election vote of George Bush Sr. was less than two weeks away and I had in my possesion a document which placed Mr. Bush as a prominent figure in the conspiracy. His part in the &#39;follow the money&#39; means of investigation are part of the overall picture.  The details of his involvement are documented in Behold a Pale Horse.<br/>
Mr. Cooper also explores the alien question from an angle I never considered.  The signing of a supposive treaty with et&#39;s and the true space program.  This is a secret carefully guarded and shrouded by disinformation. 
The means of control by our shadow government are more far reaching than one could ever imagine. Media control is only the start. Silent weapon technology and MK ultra are two of the means which attempt to manipulate our minds on a subconscious level. It is difficult for those unaware of these methods to perceive, let alone the explain. 
With all the disinformation and attempts to influence our mental environments, Mr. Cooper stated nothing short of a paradigm shift of human consciousness could we hope to find the truth of our world&#39;s reality. After some twenty years of research in seeking a path to this shift, I found a website which shows great promise in achieving this shift.
The Allies of Humanity opened the door to learning how to attain this goal.  It is not an easy path to follow, let alone explain.  It calls for practicing stillness and achieving an inner awarenesss.  Two things very difficult to comprehend by us who are so bombarded with media saturated with a fear motivation that occupies our thoughts.  Do not expect a quick fix or transformation.  It has taken a lifetime of this influence that has regressed our minds and hinders our growth as free individuals.  It may take the rest of your life to undo these distortions of manipulation.<br/>
I am eternally grateful to Mr. Cooper and his personal fortitude for sharing
 his life experiences.  The greatest American who gave his life for not only our chance at freedom but the world as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.davidicke.com/forum/showthread.php?t=84173">William Cooper</a> was shot dead by Sheriff&#39;s Deputies in Eagar Arizona in 2001, he fired first critically wounding one of their number, who was attempting to serve a late night warrant, after Cooper pulled a gun in a supermarket parking lot, and had allegedly acted in a threatening manner toward a local doctor.</p>

<p>The push to deify Bill Cooper who was touting terrorism, and who predicted a huge false flag operation that was going to be blamed on OBL in June 2001, eleven weeks prior, just like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Hk1-BpXO8">Alex Jones</a> did in July that year, is from the same Ziofascist disinformation machine, that says Bin Laden perped the 911 attacks!</p>

<p>Cooper refuted firm evidence of Jew wrong doing, totally neglecting the Put Option specs which made hundred$ of million$, that were traced to Mossad HQ in Yisrael, and the absence of Jews at the WTC on the day, who heeded warnings to stay away distributed at NY synagogues the Friday before.</p>

<p>He similarly neglected missile strikes at the <a href="http://s014.radikal.ru/i329/1102/51/ee7df9707ac5.gif">WTC</a> and at the <a href="http://s60.radikal.ru/i169/1003/f7/5dbc426c4403.gif">Pentagon,</a> and instead pushed the Jordan Maxwell / David Icke line, that extra humanid entities were the responsive parties .. he was a Zionist stooge!</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t call an occultation a supernatural event, would you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I would call it a perfectly normal celestial event which has no impact on our lives at all.</p>

<p>So which definition of occult are we using?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occult means hidden.</p>

<p>You are looking at Cooper&#39;s early career and taking it very much out of context. Cooper some time into his career realized that he was being subverted by the government and fed with heaps of disinformation. He then started pushing back and looking into the connection of secret societies and the government. He believed the ultimate battle was that of pushing secular humanism onto every person on the planet. Using the means of divide and conquer on religion, countries, and people. He believed that &quot;Mystery babylon&quot; as he liked to call it was the ancient religion of the illuminated ones. The Mystery babylon wanted the destruction of christianity/judaism/islam. He believed they were close. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we will agree to disagree.. I think it goes much deeper then ziofascism. </p>

<p>Plus if you listen carefully Bill does talk about ziofascism...but he connects it in a way where it pertains to mystery religions and secret societies. You have to listen to EVERYTHING of his. But remember he is just a man..so do your own work on the subjects and come to your own conclusions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I do, Maybe I don&#39;t...but there are some in this subreddit that think they know all and don&#39;t even know who Cooper is...</p>

<p>Imagine if you will an american historian who doesn&#39;t know all the founding fathers...Wouldn&#39;t be a very good historian and probably wouldn&#39;t have cred. THAT&#39;S MY POINT. Bill is comparable to one of the founding fathers of conspiracy research so if your here commenting you SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW WHO HE IS.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know who he is you should probably research a little bit more before trying to make comments on the subject.</p>

<p>Course trolls and tards don&#39;t play by those rules which is why I am fine with being an arrogant prick.</p>
