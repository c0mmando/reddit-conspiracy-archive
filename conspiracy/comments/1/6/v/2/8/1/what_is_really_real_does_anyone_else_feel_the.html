       It's been this way all the way through
      </p>
      <p>
       We're always heading into something
      </p>
      <p>
       It's how the Indians felt when the Spanish invaded.  How villages felt when the Vikings invaded.  How the world felt when the Black Plague was cutting its swathe.  How the old and their families felt when the Inquisitors denounced people as 'witches' because they had the misfortune to have a mole in one of 70 places on their bodies.  How the women of Berlin felt when the Russians committed weeks of mass rapes, leaving tens of thousands of unwanted foetuses in the wombs of women and girls of Berlin.  How people feel when they realise the cavalry isn't coming - that they're going to die like this, at the hands of some psychopath who's delighting in their fear and panic
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the world.  By accident or design, it's always been this way
      </p>
      <p>
       And every generation believes itself to be the last one, the most important and dramatic, the one which will see The End scroll up on the screen, lol
      </p>
      <p>
       It will continue this way, long after we're all dust.  Keep Calm and Carry on

       I thoroughly enjoyed what you had to say there, until you said "Keep Calm and Carry on"

       Maybe you're being satirical...? but keeping calm and carrying on is a very "sheeple" way of thinking.

       I feel you man. It's like we're heading for some big climax that is going to happen soon. Only thing you can do is keep living your life, and don't live in fear. Whatever happens will happen, not much you can do about a lot of things. Just keep spreading the message of truth and love whenever you can. Namaste

       I'm increasingly convinced that there will not be a climax.  Everybody is sitting back waiting for the right moment, but the right moment never comes.  The enemy just keeps inching slowly towards their goal and nobody notices, or if they do, they keep their eye on the enemy, and wait for them to make the wrong move.

       What you should be worried about is all that's being caused to happen while the people causing it to happen hire a few guys to herd all the people together over off-stage to the left screaming with signs that say "THE END IS NEAR", "THIS IS THE END OF x"!

       Sure, you guys love free speech, so long as it syncs up with whatever agenda your crew is pushing. It's easy to laugh at people falling in to your forum sliding threads, the ridiculous nonsense your team posts here to make the sub look like a bunch of complete loonie. The thing is, leader of this pack that you are, the fact that such a large group of people organized in such a relentless attack on this sub is evidence enough that some of the things we come up with here are ruffling some corporate feathers. Now open up your little propaganda book they gave you and type the appropriate pre ordained ad hominem retort to my statement. What am I saying, you probably memorized that book. Just recite it from memory.

       Then why are you and your little minions here, in such force? Using puppet accounts to game the voting system? Spending so much time and effort ridiculing free thought? For so many hours a day? Either you are independently wealthy, or are being paid for your work as no working person has this much time to dedicate to such a cause.

       Yeah but you better be careful of this movie. It can get you jailed, crippled or killed. It's like the Hologram deck on Star Trek. The safety protocols are taken off the scene.

       There's been a lot of ominous portents here on r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       To lighten up, think about the last time the powers that be actually prohibited your freedom in some way, censored something you wanted to post here, took your weapon away, tried to silence you from speaking the truth, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying .. life goes on as it ever did. Nobody has tried to limit what I can do. Sure there are dark predictions here - but Alex Jones, for example, has been spewing the same shit for 20 years. Meanwhile we still don't pay using the amero, there's no NAFTA superhighway, we still have our guns, etc..

       It's so good to see this view gaining popularity here. When I first came to r/conspiracy a few years ago (different username) , he was considered by most an infallible source of freedom fighting. Having saw through his garbage, I attempted to spread my findings, receiving  down voting and much off based ad-hominem ridicule. I do not take any credit, but still... Feelsgoodman.gif

       Same thing here man!

       I didn't join Reddit until about 9mos ago...but I have made it my duty to try to call out lies that I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agent Jones is a BIG lie that I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a Zionist-controlled STRATFOR-owned "asset" used for COINTELPRO...nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only people would use that wondrous thing...what's it called?? Oh yeah--GOOGLE--then maybe they too can learn what I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is an agent, plain and simple, used by the Zionists and the CIA to both divide the conspiracy movement and set us against each other and to make any and all 'conspiracy theorists' look like kooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, of course, to fatten up his wallet while selling his shitty DVDs and SHTF products (like "radiation pills," diet supplements, MREs, and seeds) to suckers who actually give the guy their credit card numbers--all the while storing up information about you (you know that both InfoWars and Prison Planet put tracking cookies into your browsers, correct? They do--and they collect your surfing habits AND your login information for every site visited) and giving it to CIA/STRATFOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idiots that visit or--worse yet!!--become "members" of his sites are now in a lot of very uncool databases.

       Thanks Agent Jones!

       Reality is what you believe to be true through knowledge and perception. Remember you are a highly evolved intelligent human fully capable of rational thought. You are in control of your mind and what gets put into it as well as in control of how you treat those around you. You are capable of creating a reality through the expression of love for yourself and your community through your actions. Likewise you are capable of creating a reality of suffering and fear in other humans around you. The choice and freedom is yours.

       Having spent the better part of my life studying quantum physics, life, the universe and everything, I'm convinced no one really has a clue what reality really is, so how could know what is not real?

       This is the Biblical Apocalypse.  I am becoming more convinced of that everyday.  Apocalypse is a Greek word that simply means "unveiling."  Does it not seem like something is being unveiled?

       If you are having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy, that's a pretty serious sign of a mental disorder like schizophrenia. I recommend seeing a doctor asap.

       Seriously, you're probably fine, but you need to check into that, especially if you're scared or confused.

       I'm not mental in any way. And if this was a fantasy I'd have wings!  And I'm also in no way scared or confused. It's just things are moving along in the most fucked up way you could think!

       If that's the case, the majority of the western world have mental disorders.  I think you may have been trying to be funny, but you actually hit the nail on the head right there. Excellent, unintentional contribution to the discussion
