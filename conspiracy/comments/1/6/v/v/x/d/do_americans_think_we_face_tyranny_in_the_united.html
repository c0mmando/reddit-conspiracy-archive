    <div class="md"><p>I always hear  people talking about China being a prison country but America locks up more of it&#39;s citizens than all the other &quot;free&quot; countries. Privatized Prisons trading on the stock exchange started under Reagan and he  conveniently started the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; at the same time which meant Prison Populations begin to rise dramatically. </p>

<p>We lock up Whistleblowers just like China. Susan Landeu, CIA Liason to Iraq started talking about the fact that Iraq was ready to give us whatever we wanted to avoid a war after 9/11. Total access to the country for inspections, exclusive rights to oil and business. The US cut off all ties at that point because they wanted war so they started that WMD propaganda and the yellow cake and centrifuge lie. They outed CIA Operative Valerie Plame and suicided her husband and locked up Susan Landeu. They locked up Bradley Manning for leaking the Helicopter Gunship footage and a bunch of other top secret documents. They&#39;ve relentlessly pursued Assange and the average American still believes America is all about Truth, Justice and the American Way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. apportioned taxation, sales.gas.property tax are examples of &quot;equal pay&quot; taxation, these taxes pay for the things you use. Your unapportioned income tax, you know the one where 40% of your pay gets whacked. That goes to &quot;federal things&quot; the primary ones are, government expansion geared towards controlling you, FEMA,DHS, an agency for every thing, war and most importantly the interest on the loan. What loan you say? Understand this and understand it good, your currency supply is not controlled by you, and you are paying dearly for using your usd. currently 17 trill. But what about Social security?....look, you&#39;re in the hole 17 trillion dollars,you have been living on a credit card for years, and that is just the national debt. The national debt is what you owe as profit to a group of banks.WHY ARE YOU BORROWING YOUR CURRENCY. A government can, should AND MUST create its currency supply at cost for its citizens. I appeal to your sense of NOT BEING A DUMBASS who like getting ripped off. Every dime that comes out of your check is robbery and is debt slavery. Understand what money as debt is and understand everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>question; if you owe the central banks that create your currency 17 trillion dollars for the privilege of using you currency. How are you going to pay off the, perhaps as much as 700 trillion in unsecured Us treasury bonds {iou&#39;s} that the banks have put you on the line for, that they have sold the entire world?</p>

<p>YOUR NOT!!!!!!!!!!all you need to do is stop using their money and tell them to fuck off. Tv puts your leaders in charge, tv is owned by the banks. It is your government that is controlled by these banks that is doing this to you. Stop thinking that these people or this system is going to work with you. Just unify and walk away from them, there will be 200,000,000 million of you, 100,000,000 hangers on, and 565 dingbats and their money masters sitting there holding their dicks. And soon after that, just the dingbats and their evil masters, alone, holding their stupid useless paper, their armies long since abandoned them, as their money was no good, the soldiers wanted to be payed with the peoples money. Soon after that, the sun began to set, the cold settled in, the bankers heard a distant wolf howl in the night</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that this has been going on/building up for so long, nobody notices. They clearly know exactly what they&#39;re doing, and whatever the end-game is (we can only speculate, but the way the world is going at the moment, i can&#39;t see it being positive), they know exactly what they want to achieve and how to achieve it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see it getting better - i think we&#39;re too far gone. Most people will literally sit in their house while their rights are destroyed, and watch their TV until they tell them that&#39;s not allowed either, and by then it&#39;s far too late.</p>

<p>Maybe i&#39;m being too cynical. But i genuinely think the best thing i can do right now is get some decent survival skills and be prepared to go live in the mountains, in some remote cabin somewhere, when the inevitable shitstorm hits - whether in be in 5 years, 10, 30, whatever. I think dropping off the grid entirely will be a very useful skill.</p>

<p>you&#39;re being duped and controlled into thinking the US is tyrannical. It&#39;s made missteps, but it is far from what one might consider &#39;tyrannical&#39;. Anti-government propaganda led by Alex Jones and Fox News is trying to get you to start a war.</p>

<p>Yes, actually.</p>

<p>Go ahead, read my post. I address that. All of this is being orchestrated, including the deep partisan divide and the accusations of tyranny. And you&#39;re all wrong about who&#39;s doing it; you all blame the government, but none of you seem willing to accept that that&#39;s because you&#39;re being <em>made</em> to by an extensive propaganda network owned and operated by Roger Ailes.</p>

<p>Do you recall the Citizens United verdict? Did you know Clarence Thomas was the deciding voice in that case? Moreover, did you know that Floyd Brown, <em>the founder of Citizens United</em>, was instrumental, along with his organization, in getting Clarence Thomas appointed to the bench?</p>

<p>edit: Beyond that, Floyd Brown is an open Freemason, admitting to getting into politics because of meeting Reagan at a Masonic lodge meeting. </p>

<p>The government is to blame because they are the group holding society by the neck and enforcing demands.  No other group has that power.  Sure, there are groups behind the government&#39;s public face  - Bilderberg, Trilateral Commission, CFR, whatever -  but their only power is being able to <em>use</em> the government.  Without their huge swarms of goons, they&#39;re just old men with a lot of hate in them.</p>

<p>No dispute on my part. Ailes has a long history with campaigning for government interests. </p>

<p>Ailes worked for Nixon as <em>media</em> consultant; he was already deeply rooted in private industry by the time he got hired on for the Nixon campaign. In fact, Nixon believed TV in politics was a gimmick and a non-starter; it wasn&#39;t until after appearing on Ailes&#39; program that he changed his tune and hired Ailes as TV Exec. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not refuting my point. In fact, you openly admit to Ailes being &#39;installed&#39;. So... who installed him? Is it too much of a stretch to suggest that Nixon was their first attempt at creating a pro-business president? After all, Nixon was notoriously rough on unions during his congressional career, definitely something private enterprise might want to... nurture.</p>

<p>Nixon was, after all, <em>appointed</em> to the vice presidency of Eisenhower by Republican officials. </p>

<p>Just like the brain controls the motion of the body.   The people who managed the hierarchy of force and oppression managed the society - and the way they got control was by gaining control of <em>money</em>.</p>

<p>The thing is, the evidence suggests those interests have been managing the federal government through its whole existence.</p>
