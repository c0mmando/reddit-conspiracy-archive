       I've seen it mentioned that Alex Jones is in cahoots with the CIA.  Anyone care to break it down?  I've heard it referenced a few times here.

       I have a friend who's really into inforwars and all that insane shit.  I'd love to be able to counter his conspiracy theory bullshit with other conspiracy bullshit about Alex Jones.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For many months, Pete Santilli has received tips from reliable, high level informants who have indicated that they suspect InfoWars.com may somehow be connected to Austin, Texas based Stratfor Global Intelligence. Informants have also revealed that Alex Jones requires anyone who visits his new production facility which contains his primary computer servers must sign a "Non Disclosure Agreement", prohibiting them from disclosing the exact geographical location of his high security facility. There is high speculation expressed by insiders that InfoWars servers are within close proximity to Stratfor, and informants have told us they believe Infowars.com may actually be selling user data directly to Stratfor.
       </p>
       <p>
        InfoWars.com has hired a former Parker Media and Stratfor analyst Molly Maroney, both organizations known to have close government intelligence ties including the CIA. When confronted by MsSherrieLea with the facts about Ms. Maroney, Infowars terminated all access to InfoWars, Planet Infowars, as well had various YouTube Accounts suspended.

       That's by no means damning evidence.  I can see why someone would do that.  I'm sure the topic has been beat to death and I wouldn't want false accusations of myself on my FB/Forums.

       does this prove alex is controlled opposition? it's contextual, at best, sure, but he could have addressed and dealt with what resemble otherwise dubious affiliations, even if he'd been unaware. but you figure it out. it doesn't matter to me what you believe.

       So this is the "spy" you were referring to?  None of the background you just gave classifies her as a spy.  Should I take that as a misuse of the word or am I missing something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is him hiring her seen as a connection between him and the CIA?  She had some very loose ties at a low level position for a short period of time to a company that is affiliated with the CIA .  It's not unheard of for someone to switch "teams" is it?  Maybe she saw something there that made her "see the light" or decide it was wrong what she was doing.  Maybe she just took that job as a way to pay bills and she sees her job at Infowars the same way.  Maybe she couldn't give a fuck less about anything Alex says or anything that Stratfore does.

        All in all it seems to me the only "evidence" (I use that word very lightly here) is that he hired a lady that worked for a company that has ties to the CIA?  Seems ridiculous to accuse him of being in cahoots with the CIA because of that reason alone.

       Simply because I didn't feel like engaging you in a discussion in another thread and instead choose to simply attack you isn't relevant to this thread at all.  I still stand by what I said in that post.  The only reason I went into that specific thread was to talk shit.  I had no interest in getting into a debate on that subject, at all.

       None of what I've said here is beyond the realm of reason.  I'm speaking the truth in all my posts and taking into consideration what everyone has replied to me.

       If you honestly think I'm trolling by writing out long ass fucking thought out posts that are relevant then you are deluded.  If this were a troll it would quite possibly be the worst fucking troll ever.  I'm spending a large amount of time responding in depth to various people's posts.  This just happens to be something that I really actually am interested in.

       I am interested in the subject, you are just seemingly nervous about actually engaging in this discussion with me.  Note the person whom I gave a detailed response to and engaged in a reasonable discussion with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post Weltall quoted here is from another thread in which I decided I wanted to simply talk some shit to some morons instead of having any sort of a debate.  I was uninterested in that subject, yes.  I find it ironic that you say I devolved into a homophobe and then in the same sentence call me a monkey because I'm black.  Much better and more mature huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've asked you time and time again to join me in discourse.  You continue to refuse and instead bounce around post to post not saying anything noteworthy.

       I have four responses from you at the moment.  None of them are addressing any of the points I've made because you're incapable of logical reasoning.  Status quo for conspiracy theorist.

       It wasn't because he smiled. It was the way he had a very light-hearted, joking demeanor one second, when he believed he was not on camera--  then took a deep breath and changed his entire demeanor to seemingly shaky and upset right before they "called 'action'," so to speak. (This is, in fact, how many actors prepare for "getting into character" in a scene-- deep breath and all)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I believe the crisis actors thing.... in fact I lean toward thinking that this was a real tragedy, involving real death-- even if it was set up for a reason, or heartlessly taken advantage of.  However, if you don't think his behavior in that vid was more than a little strange, I'm not sure I can reason with you.

       You don't consider the fact that Molly Maroney (Jones' producer) worked for Stratfor to be "evidence" of a connection?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the fact that the Alex Jones show was started in the SAME CITY in the SAME YEAR as Stratfor? Purely coincidental?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if that does not firmly establish a link to the CIA (and Stratfor HAS been linked to the CIA) then it strongly implies ties to STRATFOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, Alex Jones' own tactics indicate there is something rotten in Denmark, so to speak. He does have some good info, but he's also come out with some really bad info. And he "fear mongers" worse than just about anyone else I've seen. And he does some stuff that would make "conspiracy theorists" look pretty bad (pronounced "cray-zee" or "dayn-jer-us"). Especially recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it walks like a duck, and talks like a duck, and has confirmed ties to Stratfor.... it's probably working for the CIA.  ;)

       It might be in the interest of the CIA or another similar intelligence agency to make "conspiracy theorists" look crazy or dangerous, as this takes away from their credibility. This could hold value for them, considering how many theories involve "intelligence agencies," and "the government."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, casualreflection is right-- your comment came off as brash, hostile, and unnecessarily rude. If you care, you can figure it out or look this stuff up. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to intelligently speculate as to why this may hold value for them.

       Sorry but that's just the way I see most conspiracy theorist.  I'm not going to sugarcoat it.  And this post is kind of what I mean.  You make some gigantic leaps in logic and call the result damning evidence.  Sorry but that is very common for conspiracy theorist.

       He is over the top, doesn't make sense, and gives out a lot of misinformation.  That means he's in cahoots with the CIA?  I mean, that's is a huge leap wouldn't you say?

       You answered a question of mine, asking why people think Alex Jones is in cahoots with the CIA by telling me that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I was just trying to give the OP a very direct example of how little sense Alex Jones makes.
        <strong>
         The conclusion that you should draw by knowing this is what's damning about it.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You go on to say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Alex Jones' bread and butter is to perpetuate misinformation. He'll give you accurate info, but immediately send you in the wrong direction with it, usually towards dead-ends. Not only that, but he will also act visibly crazy, as well as say some things that are completely untrue, and so far out of the realm of sanity, that whenever he cites accurate information, most people write it off as bullshit by association.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't think it's a leap in logic to assume that you were citing all of this as reasoning in answering my question.  You know, considering what you were responding to.
      </p>

       If that's not what you were doing then it's a misunderstanding.  What exactly were you trying to do or say there and how is it relevant to my question?

         So I asked this question above to someone else. Using the logic you just gave, what is the CIA's goal with Jones?

       Let's please keep racial epithets out of this discussion, thanks.  Using the word "nigga" to respond to someone that's black is very disrespectful.

       Not only do you not know what you're talking about, but you're actually defending a flake like Alex Jones, which is just pitiful. Also, I seriously doubt you are black. Black people think Alex Jones is a whack honky.

       No I am not.  Only someone lacking any semblance of reasoning skills would come to that conclusion.  It's quite obvious to humans with any sort of reading comprehension skills that I'm being completely objective here.  I'm looking at facts and and taking all arguments into consideration and being a skeptic.  That's something that you as a conspiracy theorist should understand.  I guess if it doesn't fit your agenda you have to write it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal opinion on Alex Jones - He's a nutbag.  An idiot.  A fountain of misinformation and half truths.  A scumbag.  Someone that preys on weak-minded people incapable of thinking for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just am not convinced that he's in cahoots with the CIA.  That is what this thread is about.  Period.  Now move along child, I know that was embarrassing but it will be ok.

       That is what this thread is about.  I'm very sorry that you lack the intelligence to deduce that, it must be very hard for you to function on a daily basis without any reasoning skills.  It seems that everyone in here had a grasp on that but you.

       No this is simply a case of him misunderstanding me and me misunderstanding him.  The goal of this thread was very clear when the both of you came in here on your accounts that previously had a grand total of &gt;30 posts and one account which was brand new.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was already engaged in a discussion with someone on Alex Jones and the CIA.  Instead of following suit, you came in here and offered up nothing.  The other guy came in and responded but not to what I had intended the thread be about.  I misunderstood him and he misunderstood me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's do this:
      </p>
      <p>
       I resign that I didn't word the OP well.  I have reworded it to reflect my original intentions and what I was already discussing at the time of your entrance to the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's go from there and join me here:

       But all of that aside.  Let it be known that he did regardless of whether being CIA specific say
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The
        <strong>
         ONLY info
        </strong>
        that you should ever need in order to
        <strong>
         know
        </strong>
        that AJ is completely off of his rocker,
        <strong>
         as well as a shill,
        </strong>
        is that
        <strong>
         he ACTUALLY said that "Arabs run Hollywood."
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's what I responded to and said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What you just said does not in any way point to the fact that he is a shill. Citing something silly like that as damning evidence is certainly characteristic of you conspiracy folks though.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So regardless of whether or not I was under the assumption he meant CIA due to me thinking I worded the OP clearly enough to reflect that, my point still stands as valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not in any way shape or form damning evidence that Alex Jones is a shill, for ANY organization or person.  Period.  Care to challenge that?  I will assault you with logic.  Don't care to?  Move along buddy.

       I don't think you know what that word means.
      </p>
      <p>
       My premise is that I'm asking the people of this subreddit about a common conspiracy theory involving the CIA and Alex Jones.  There is at least one person in this thread that believes this and responded, I proceeded to challenge the evidence he gave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize now that I didn't word the OP very well, not well enough for simple folk to understand.  jesus_enslaves wasn't under the impression that this was about the CIA, Alex Jones connection.  I've resigned that point.  I've made an offer to have a rational discussion.  If you don't personally believe this CIA Alex Jones connection or care to argue it, then move on you are not needed or wanted here.  In my attempt to reboot this discussion I posted this, it applies to you as well.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        jesus_enslaves, let's start over here since you obviously misunderstood the OP and I was misunderstanding your answer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Are you a believer that Alex Jones is in cahoots with the CIA? If so, where is the evidence and what is the CIA's goal with Alex Jones?
       </p>
       <p>
        If not, are you aware of the conspiracy and the reasoning believers use to make the claim and are you ready for this information to be held up to scrutiny by myself?
       </p>
       <p>
        If you answered no to both of these questions, then good day, I'm sorry for abusing you.

       That said, yes I know there are many conspiracies out there.  There are a lot of stupid people with a lot of time on their hands.  The result can be seen in a variety of different conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't compensate for the general lack of logical deduction skills that were to be found here on this subreddit (my mistake, I should have known considering) so I have added to the OP a very clear rewording of the question.

       I'm not here to impress you with my attitude.  My attitude toward conspiracy nuts is very negative.  I don't think of you very highly and I doubt your sanity very much.  I don't think you are very socially adjust people.  Now that that's out of the way.

       I can assure you, you could not beat me.  I am an alpha male and would disassemble you within' a matter of seconds.  I would tear your arms off, beat you with them, bench press your torso a few times and then throw you through a wall, small man.

       Whether or not you are white is irrelevant and I couldn't care less.  The way you speak only points to your lack of a real point or relevant information on the topic at hand.

       jesus_enslaves, let's start over here since you obviously misunderstood the OP and I was misunderstanding your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you a believer that Alex Jones is in cahoots with the CIA?  If so, where is the evidence and what is the CIA's goal with Alex Jones?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, are you aware of the conspiracy and the reasoning believers use to make the claim and are you ready for this information to be held up to scrutiny by myself?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you answered no to both of these questions, then good day, I'm sorry for abusing you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you answer yes, let's talk.

       No, I think Alex Jones is an evangelical fear-mongerer who is possibly being spoon fed misinformation or just making it all up himself, with the help of his producers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand why people would make the connection, because the dots are there. Like with any conspiracy "theory" there is no one smoking gun that will prove without a shadow of a doubt that he is in fact shilling for the CIA, but I think it's safe to say he, whether purposefully or unwittingly, helps them more than he hurts them.

       The dots are what was mentioned previously in this thread?  The graphic artist that used to work for the company that worked with CIA?

       I don't know if that's really what I'm looking for either.  I'm more-so trying to understand the reasoning that the people who subscribe to this theory use.  I guess you wouldn't know since you don't believe and I think that may mean that our discussion here will be very limited.

       Can you elaborate although I think I may already know what you mean, I want to confirm that I'm on the right track with my thinking in this regard.

       Edit: I am still annoyed that you suggested I'm defending Alex in this thread.  Are we both clear that I"m not doing that?

       He makes it easy for rational people to associate ANY alternative thinking or conspiracy theory with a crazy, babbling old man. The general tendency of human beings is to dismiss anything associated with Alex Jones all together instead of examining the information in a sensible fashion.

       Yes that was what I expected and not something I would put out of the realm of the CIA's practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's just as likely that he's simply a dumb human being.  Or that he's a smart human being that knows there's a ton of money in what he's doing.  Maybe he just plays a character.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't think there's enough evidence in any of those directions and the CIA tie is the longest leap.  I think you feel the same way, I'm not implying that you don't.

       He's at least smart enough to know how to play on people's fears and from what I can gather watching him, I'd bet money that he's playing a character. His acting is pretty awful at times.

       Well the "troll" part isn't baseless. I give you: 2/10, would def engage again because it's funny watching you get ate up trying to troll r/Conspiracy. The bad part about all of it is that what you're doing has been done to death. We can see you guys coming a mile away.

       I wouldn't reply anymore either.  You struggle to address any of my points and instead yell "trollllllll".

      <p>
       It's typical of you moronic simple minded conspiracy theorist to avoid addressing the crux of arguments and attempt to shift the focus somewhere unrelated.  I've just never had someone do it by accusing me of "trolling".  Good shit though.  I'm sure all the other crazies in this subreddit are impressed and will take notes for the next time they need to avoid having to defend their alternate reality theories.

       What you just said does not in any way point to the fact that he is a shill.  Citing something silly like that as damning evidence is certainly characteristic of you conspiracy folks though.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So this is the "spy" you were referring to?  None of the background you just gave classifies her as a spy.  Should I take that as a misuse of the word or am I missing something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is him hiring her seen as a connection between him and the CIA?  She had some very loose ties at a low level position for a short period of time to a company that is affiliated with the CIA .  It's not unheard of for someone to switch "teams" is it?  Maybe she saw something there that made her "see the light" or decide it was wrong what she was doing.  Maybe she just took that job as a way to pay bills and she sees her job at Infowars the same way.  Maybe she couldn't give a fuck less about anything Alex says or anything that Stratfore does.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        from the Taylor link:
       </p>
       <p>
        According to STRATFOR, the company’s publicity list includes Fortune 500 companies and international government agencies, although their client list is allegedly confidential.
       </p>
       <p>
        STRATFORE WEBITE: “STRATFOR’s global team of intelligence professionals provides an audience of decision-makers and sophisticated news consumers in the U.S. and around the world with unique insights into political, economic, and military developments. The company uses human intelligence and other sources combined with powerful analysis based on geopolitics to produce penetrating explanations of world events. This independent, non-ideological content enables users not only to better understand international events, but also to reduce risks and identify opportunities in every region of the globe. The company delivers content daily on its Web site, in videos, e-mails and books, and an iPhone app.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So it's safe to assume that link you posted was only a link that delves into what STRATFOR is?  In that case I can avoid reading it as I don't find it pertinent to the discussion.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and choice words from stratfor's founder, indicating potential israeli allegiance:
       </p>
       <p>
        STRATFOR was founded by Dr. George Friedman, an admitted Zionist. In an interview, Friedman was asked the following: “Does being Jewish affect the way you view the world, I begin. “Being Jewish keeps things in perspective,” he says, smiling. “We lost two temples.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't find that at all relevant to the discussion at hand.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but you figure it out. it doesn't matter to me what you believe.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And it really shouldn't matter to you, I don't blame you for that.  I'm asking a question and if you feel like volunteering to answer, feel free, if not, nobody is forcing you.

       I don't think you should be happy with

        All in all it seems to me the only "evidence" (I use that word very lightly here) is that he hired a lady that worked for a company that has ties to the CIA?  Seems ridiculous to accuse him of being in cahoots with the CIA because of that reason alone.
