       Assuming that 911 was an inside job, it would have been an operation involving thousands of people. With hindsight, they would have seen how they took part in the murdering of around 3000 people with little justification behind it, even for the most hardcore patriotic of this world. Surely some of these people don't sleep well at night, and it seems impossible that such a large group could have been kept completely silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a lot of credible accounts have surfaced after 911, reporting sounds of bombs at WT1 and 2, or sights at the Pentagon or in Pennsylvania inconsistent with plane crashes. But these people are external witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anybody ever come across tangible accounts or evidence that someone would have taken part in the actual operation?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I am just trying to approach the question objectively, and really not pushing for a particular explanation when asking this - both the official explanation and the alternative ones require leaps of faith. But which side demands the biggest leap to be believed?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: it looks like a lot of people don't believe that 911 would have taken 'thousands' of people, so I though I'd my two cent's worth. But obviously we're all speculating here, so each person's estimation will be different and I completely respect that.
      </p>
      <p>
       On compartmentalization: It doesn't matter if people are fully in the know or not - we should count those who know enough or hold enough proofs to bring credibility to the 'inside job' explanation. If someone is asked to rig some explosives somewhere in the building, it's hard to argue that it's an art project, particularly with hindsight.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the number estimate: rigging WT1,2 and 7 with explosives is a massive undertaking. Just trying to imagine getting into walls, vent shaft or whatever to access the steel beams and instal hundreds of explosive on dozens of floors. Then there is the coordination of this, where you have to get access, clear whole floors, bring the materials, check for flaws, etc. Then you have to account for the planes: how much efforts and planning did it take to recruit the hijackers and how many interventions were necessary for them to reach their objective? The planes themselves could have been piloted remotely, as it looks like achieving these flight paths is beyond the reach of hastily trained pilots. And then the anthrax scare, the supposed missile in the pentagon.. We could go on for a while like this, and each time, the number estimate grows larger - and highly skilled people would have been needed for many of these tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, many fail to account for the communication resources that would have been necessary for this. The public opinion is directly influenced by reportages, and PR are the unseen efforts to provide information to journalists - or to influence public opinion in other way (like false testimonies for example). Believe me, without a massive PR campaign to channel the opinion away from 'alternative explanations', the public would have gone into panic mode by this time - no matter who was behind 911. To this day, IF this is indeed a conspiracy, thousands of office people are laboring away, in a global effort to maintain a specific discourse in the media, monitoring opinion, reporting it and devising appropriate responses. This takes work. Lots and lots of work - and many of these people would have to know that they are employed to undermine the credibility of the 'inside job' version of the facts.

       Military are trained to not question orders. Also it's very compartmentalised. Group A doesn't know what group B is doing even though they are working on the same thing. Only the person above them gets all the information. So you can see possibly how maybe hundreds of people doing things  will actually only boil down to a handful of people in the know. 
I'm not sure about 911 but the UK bombings were just shittily organised. Google a man named Peter Power. If you look you will find an interview he did and it will explain who he is. This will give you an idea of how the 7/7 and 911 was done if you so wish. 
....Only one who seeks truth will accept it.

       Thank you for pointing this out. It´s almost hard to explain the counter argument. But look at Hell´s Angels or the Mafia. How many members are there in those organizations? Do what they do count as conspiracies? Most of them are simply loyal useful tools, and only know right or wrong based on the organization´s leaders directives. They never ask questions. They only know that belonging to the group is the be-all end-all. Is it impossible that because law enforcement wears certain uniforms that it can´t be the same for them? How many members turn on the "bad" organizations? When they do they are offered protection from the government. But who would protect a government mafia organization member who turned? The government? If you strip away the belief that because law enforcement wear the right uniform that they are always good, it is much easier to understand how simple a thing like 9/11 would be to pull off. Just my opinion.

       Say you were part of the team the went about weakening the core supports of the WTC under some guise of maintenance.  Like a new paint job or a faulty beam. 9/11 happened before you finished the alleged maintenance. You see how your actions could of resulted in the collapse.   There was construction work being performed in the elevator shafts right before 9/11.  You could see you work as inconsequential or maybe you now see the full scope of the work you did.

       Say now you do believe you had a hand in a nefarious plot.

       Yeah. He didn't. He was running an exact same excercise involving the same scenario at the same time on that day. Same story they gave for NORAD, they were having a training excercise that day so they thought it was part of it and stood the fighters down. That's the fishy bit. Coincidence once maybe, twice?

       Except that there was no "exact same excercise involving the same scenario at the same time on that day" and NORAD staff were able to re-adjust to the real events in about 30 seconds:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         On 9/11, NORAD was scheduled to conduct a military exercise, Vigilant Guardian, which postulated a bomber attack from the former Soviet Union. We investigated whether military preparations for the large-scale exercise compromised the military’s response to the realworld terrorist attack on 9/11. According to General Eberhart, “it took about 30 seconds” to make the adjustment to the real-world situation. Ralph Eberhart testimony, June 17, 2004. We found that the response was, if anything, expedited by the increased number of staff at the sectors and at NORAD because of the scheduled exercise. See Robert Marr interview (Jan. 23, 2004)

9/11 Commission Report
        </li>
       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course, this is just sworn testimony from the official 9/11 commission report, so Im sure you will argue that its a lie.

       The 30 seconds bit is misleading. Throughout the NORAD tapes you hear people saying "Is this real world or exercise". Confusion was rampant because of the drills taking place that day moving airplanes away from the US continental airspace.

       Well, they're kind of making an example of someone who broke the secrets act at the moment  with mr manning...
Would you open your mouth knowing what they get up to? Secret prisons , torture, murder etc. don't claim to have the answers. Just know we don't have them all.

       Bradley Manning isn't a perfect analogy, although I get what you're saying. (He did actually break laws, whereas even if someone involved in 9/11 also broke the law it would be different if they were acting under orders from the govt.) If someone
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       involved, chances are that
       <em>
        somehow
       </em>
       they would have done
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       to get at least part of their story out there.

       We don't. They could well be.

      <p>
       But if that were the case, the government would have to ultimately be responsible for not only orchestrating 9/11 itself in total secrecy, but somehow disposing of everyone involved as well. All without
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       revealing anything about what was going on, not even an anonymous, unverifiable whistleblower. There has surely been enough investigation by 9/11 conspiracy theorists that would have uncovered the disappearance or institutionalisation of what would have to be a fairly sizeable group of government employees?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting that out of all the various 9/11 conspiracy theories involving the government, it's always an abstract reference to 'They' who was behind it, yet as far as I'm aware no-one has ever come out and claimed to be part of 'Them'.

       Not really. Look at the JFK witnesses. They all either recanted or died within a year or so of the assassination. About 22 people died as I recall. Including Dorothy Kilgallen a reporter investigating the case. But that was a long time ago. Our CIA and FBI are hundreds of times more powerful and efficient then they were then.

       9/11 was a conspiracy according to our own government. It was a conspiracy by a guy, who was a "former" CIA agent, planned from a cave in Afghanistan working with a worldwide network, that was closely monitored by our own intelligence community. We just didn't think they would really do it, according to our explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is very obvious the intelligence community has gotten very good at manipulating us.

       9/11 didn't need that many people to implement the plan.  The end result was huge messy and murderous.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it was was 4 jets and some explosives.  That's all it was.  How many people do you think are needed to carry a plan the calls for 4 jets, 15 guys with box cutters and some well placed explosives?

       The closest I've ever come across in years of research is Lloyd England the taxi cab driver on the bridge in front of 9/11[edit: I meant Pentagon not 9/11.]. He doesn't come right out and say he was part of the 9/11 conspiracy but does strongly allude to it. Also, be sure to watch the entire video of the interview with him. He lies to the interviewers several times even though they have photographic evidence backing up what they say.

       There was a testimony for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing... an FBI informant (Emad Salem) who said that the explosives were provided by the FBI. You could brush off these claims, except that this informant actually taped the conversations he had with his handler... and the tapes are available for you to listen to on youtube!!

       <p>
        October 29, 1993, Friday An article yesterday about accounts of a plot to build a bomb that was eventually exploded at the World Trade Center referred imprecisely in some copies to what Federal officials knew about the plan before the blast. Transcripts of tapes made secretly by an informant, Emad A. Salem, quote him as saying he warned the Government that a bomb was being built. But the transcripts do not make clear the extent to which the Federal authorities knew that the target was the World Trade Center.

       It sounds like a total screw up, not the inside job scenario that many suggest happened on 9/11, just that the FBI knew of the potential for an attack but just not the  execution or location... much like the 9/11 official story's background information.

       First of all, any overseeing group that's willing to off 3000 Americans by utilizing the most well protected airspace on the planet is powerful enough to make a whistleblower disappear without much effect to the overall agenda. More than a few people did on or shortly after 9/11 that might have been instrumental in exposing the underbelly of this beast. Go and watch

       Second, if you recall, there was some chatter about an organized group of whistleblowers organizing around Obama's first inaugeration. They had set a date of

       to speak on what they knew about the corruption within the Bush Administration. It was strongly hinted at that they had pertinent information about 9/11. The MSM reciprocated around that time with stories about how Dick Cheney had left sleeper cells of neo-cons littered about the Capitol to continue his agenda. Nothing ever came of it.

       Third, the common assumption is that the people involved feel at their core some allegiance to America as a country. Let me state that it is very possible they simply do not have that sense of patriotism at all, supplanted by a larger and more concrete power structure that is international and more stable than America as a nation. Or at least, that may be a firm part of their belief structure.

       Because of the nature of the agencies at play, if you have a working knowledge of policy, you can game the system without cluing those agencies in on your big picture plan if you sit in the right thrones. Soldiers don't know what the overall progress of the war is minute by minute, because that's not their part. They can't know if they're going in for the decisive victory or the sacrifice play,

       Silencing a group of thousands of people just sounds impossible to me. Also, there are ways to leak information anonymously nowadays. Yet to my knowledge not a single person came forward with such a claim or with any evidence.

       Even if such a testimony would be imposible to confirm, flimsy or incomplete, I think it would give credibility to an alternative explanation.

       I believe I would, if I were placed in that sort of situation. Not only because of the whole emotional side of having that sort of thing on my conscience, but also out of the basic instincts of fear and self-preservation. It would be a choice between living in constant fear that such a group of ruthless men could come after me because of what I knew, and getting to somewhere safe (abroad), assembling the necessary evidence and exposing them

       imo the inside job requires around 20 or 25 people who will follow orders to execute the plan with only 1 or 2 actually knowing what the plan is.

       This topic is funny to me people always say 9-11 was to big.  Someone would of came forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have one historical precedence that shows 9-11 was small in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Manhattan Project.  Over 40,000 people were involved in a international endeavor to create the first atomic weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whole cities were built and dismantled, mining, research, testing.  The public none the wiser.
      </p>
      <p>
       So 9/11 could of easily been perpetrated with less then 50 people in key positions of power and with compartmental security.
      </p>
      <p>
       15 hijackers, 4 jets.  Wired explosives with a team 10 with access to elevator shafts and in turn core supports.  Couple of financiers and boom, the greatest false flag in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11's end results was huge and messy, but when you think about the actual implementing of the plan it was small in scope compared to to something like the Manhattan Project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more so now with the owning of the major media outlets and the complacency of peace time.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR the planning and implementing of 9/11 was much smaller then most people think when compared to other covert OPS such as the Manhattan Project.  Building collapsing makes a huge mess and kills a lot of people.  Doesn't mean the plan needed a equally large set of assets to carry it out.

       If you are foolish AND greedy enough to think you can grab some financial gain by 'going public' and confessing your involvement (that likely was just within a blind cell with no idea of those above or under you in the hierarchy and performed just some small action in the grand scheme), you won't live long enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a high enough player on that day's performance, you are too busy profiting from the resulting events.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are an informed witness that happened to be at the right place on the wrong moment and genuineliy want to shed some light on the mistery, well, there have been some statements, not much has come off it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I half expect that, as age and illnesses move in, some actual key players might end up leaking memoirs or exposés of what developed that damn day. Either as a soul cleansing gesture (yeah, I'm foolish enough to believe those that planned that have some shred of conscience..) or a gloating flaunt. Maybe in 40 years, maybe in a hundred...

       No, it wouldn't. Most of the coverup is done using compartmentalization and control. NIST doesn't

       Most of the dirty work, such as the WTC explosives, likely involved the Israeli "art students." The people who remotely controlled the planes, for instance, we very likely Mossad officers who believed in what they were doing, and thus had a very low risk of ever going public.

       Also.. when some military guys wants to speak up, he gets notice about his transfer to some malaria infested place until he decides to clam up, then he discovers his transfer got canceled. When a reporter shows up, he doesn't know anything. Besides, even if he spoke up and lost his everything, none of us would believe him. Why risk it?

       No one walks up to a witness and says "I know you saw a missile but we really need you to lie and say it was a plane." They tell them something like "It was a missile they saw but we can't panic the people by allowing them to think we're vulnerable to missile attacks... and as long as the enemy thinks we think it was a plane, they won't suspect we're really searching for missile launching people, so... if you would help your country and help us catch these guys, help us keep them thinking we think it really was a plane" So the guy helps his country by telling everyone it was a plane. He thinks he's helping catch the bad guys, not cover them up. That's the thing about these guys, they will lie to you. The guy who shot the Pope thought he was helping his people, he had no idea he was set up to do the dirty work of others.

       Don't be silly. Of course they didn't do it to every single person driving by. It was a crude explanation of how those in a position to know things could be neutralized to keep from speaking up after the fact. I'm sure NORAD and a few others have plenty to say but even if they did... who would believe them? A guy could easily say "I was told to lie" but he would be quickly defamed as a liar, ex-mental patient, and child molester all rolled into one.... discrediting whatever truth he told.

       And yet we don't have a person saying they were told to lie, and then being defamed.  And the fact that you admit they couldn't stop every person driving by acknowledges exactly what OP is saying.  It would be impossible to keep every witness and co-conspirator quiet.  Simply impossible.

       Just becasue the headlines or CNN or fox didn't mention all of those who are speaking outdoes not mean people are not speaking out.  Plenty are.

       <p>
        October 29, 1993, Friday An article yesterday about accounts of a plot to build a bomb that was eventually exploded at the World Trade Center referred imprecisely in some copies to what Federal officials knew about the plan before the blast. Transcripts of tapes made secretly by an informant, Emad A. Salem, quote him as saying he warned the Government that a bomb was being built. But the transcripts do not make clear the extent to which the Federal authorities knew that the target was the World Trade Center.

       It sounds like a total screw up, not the inside job scenario that many suggest happened on 9/11, just that the FBI knew of the potential for an attack but just not the  execution or location... much like the 9/11 official story's background information.

       Not really. Look at the JFK witnesses. They all either recanted or died within a year or so of the assassination. About 22 people died as I recall. Including Dorothy Kilgallen a reporter investigating the case. But that was a long time ago. Our CIA and FBI are hundreds of times more powerful and efficient then they were then.

       Susan Lindauer is the closest to what I think OP is looking for.

       9/11 was a conspiracy according to our own government. It was a conspiracy by a guy, who was a "former" CIA agent, planned from a cave in Afghanistan working with a worldwide network, that was closely monitored by our own intelligence community. We just didn't think they would really do it, according to our explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is very obvious the intelligence community has gotten very good at manipulating us.
