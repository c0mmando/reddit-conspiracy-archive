       However, most of you will not make it. This is because you have been trapped in your mind by the paradigms of the past, by the logical stalemates that have been installed in your brain to prevent philosophical progress from occurring. And you will suffer consequences that you bring upon yourself for choosing to remain ignorant.

       Look man, we know the plan.   You pit all the religions against each other (happening now) which will escalate to a large-scale conflict.  Then your god (Lucifer) uses aliens/demons and his material agent the antichrist to present a new religion to humanity.....

       Man has the
       <em>
        potential
       </em>
       to cross-bond with the Immortal One but that is different from stating that man already is God.
      </p>
      <p>
       I term the Immortal One a plasmate, because it is a form of energy; it is living information. It replicates itself—not through information or in information—but as information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plasmate can crossbond with a human, creating what I call a homoplasmate. This annexes the mortal human permanently to the plasmate. We know this as the "birth from above" or "birth from the Spirit." It was initiated by Christ, but the Empire destroyed all the homoplasmates before they could replicate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In dormant seed form, the plasmate slumbered in the buried library of codices at Chenoboskion until 1945 C.E. This is what Jesus meant when he spoke elliptically of the "mustard seed" which, he said, "would grow into a tree large enough for birds to roost in." He foresaw not only his own death but that of all homoplasmates. He foresaw the codices unearthed, read, and the plasmate seeking out new human hosts to crossbond with; but he foresaw the absence of the plasmate for almost two thousand years.
      </p>
      <p>
       As living information, the plasmate travels up the optic nerve of a human to the pineal body. It uses the human brain as a female host in which to replicate itself into its active form. This is an interspecies symbiosis. The Hermetic alchemists knew of it in theory from ancient texts, but could not duplicate it, since they could not locate the dormant, buried plasmate. Bruno suspected that the plasmate had been destroyed by the Empire; for hinting at this he was burned. "The Empire never ended."
      </p>
      <p>
       It must be realized that when all the homoplasmates were killed in 70 C.E. real time ceased; more important, it must be realized that the plasmate has now returned and is creating new homoplasmates, by which it is destroying the Empire and has started up real time. We call the plasmate "the Holy Spirit," which is why the Rose Cross Brotherhood wrote, "Per spiritum sanctum reviviscimus."
      </p>
      <p>
       If the centuries of spurious time are excised, the true date is not 2013 C.E. but 138 C.E. Therefore the New Testament says that Kingdom of the Spirit will come before "some now living die." We are living, therefore, in apostolic times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dico per spiritum sanctum: sum homoplasmate. Haec veritas est. Mihi crede et mecum in aeternitate vive.
      </p>
      <p>
       We did not fall because of a moral error; we fell because of an intellectual error: that of taking the phenomenal world as real. Therefore we are morally innocent. It is the Empire in its various disguised polyforms which tells us we have sinned. "The Empire never ended."
      </p>
      <p>
       The phenomenal world does not exist; it is a hypostasis of the information processed by the Mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the universe is actually composed of information, then it can be said that information will save us. This is the saving gnosis which the Gnostics sought. There is no other road to salvation. However, this information—or more precisely the ability to read and understand this information, the universe as information—can only be made available to us by the Holy Spirit. We cannot find it on our own. Thus it is said that we are saved by the grace of God and not by good works, that all salvation belongs to Christ, who, I say, is a physician.
      </p>
      <p>
       The physician has come to us a number of times under a number of names. But we are not yet healed. The Empire identified him and ejected him. This time he will kill the Empire by phagocytosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Head Apollo is about to return. St Sophia is going to be born again; she was not acceptable before. The Buddha is in the park. Siddhartha sleeps (but is going to awaken). The time you have waited for has come.

       Okay, but I'm honestly asking for clarification as you understand it. Does your enlightenment contain living forever in the bodies we are in at this moment? Does it mean transcending the bodies we are in to live (live, as in consciously exist bringing with us what we know now) in a new, I don't know, dimension?
      </p>
      <p>
       What
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       does being free from the shackles of our biology mean in terms of death/no death?

       Start with the simple and obvious. You see through your eyes, hear through your ears, feel through your body, and think through your brain. But you are not your eyes, ears, body, or brain—these are just things you experience the world with. So then, what are you? Remember that anything that can be taken away from you cannot be you. Like your clothes or hair—without them you would be bald and naked, but you would still be you. 
Now take away your body and brain. Is there anything left?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that people have come back from being dead for a few minutes, remembering all they did while they were gone? Yes, sometimes they recall ﬂoating above their own lifeless bodies, seeing and hearing the doctors and nurses working on them, maybe ﬂoating away and exploring what’s around before being brought back to life.  Even without their bodies and brains, they were still alive somehow, aware and experiencing. This shows that they are not their bodies, and neither are you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of your body as a character inside a video game. To interact with the game world you need to play a game character. But you are not the character; you are merely controlling it from out-side the game. Same thing with your body. To interact with the physical world, you need a physical body. Through the body, your mind existing outside this world can play this game called life. A ﬁrst-person game where you look through the eyes of a character makes it seem like you are inside its head, but really you are sitting in front of the computer. Likewise, although you sense yourself inside your physical head, you are actually located far beyond it in another dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
       When your body dies, it is just like dying inside a game. Nothing happens to the real you since, if you remember, you are not your body. The real you, which is essentially your mind or spirit, gets to hang around for a little while, maybe quit the game for now, maybe start a new game as a new character. But in this life, you only get one turn, so it is important to stay alive as long as needed, to keep your health and energy at a good level while having fun with the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real you was born into this body, into this world, and has forgotten it is just a game character. It does not remember where it came from, where it’s going, why it’s playing the game, and what the point of this game is.  It has gotten all wrapped up in the daily experiences of life. But now you are learning what you really are: a spirit that cannot be harmed or killed even if the body is harmed or killed. And like a game, some of the things that happen are scripted, meant to happen from the very beginning.

      <p>
       11 Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. 12 And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
       <strong>
        13 He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. 14 And he deceives those[e] who dwell on the earth by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived. 15 He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or[f] the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

       Let the Lord GOD bear witness, Just I am his witness as well. I rebuke thee lucifer...little horn!

      <p>
       You and your false greek gods yet to be awoken.
I know ye worshipers of Baal and so does the LORD GOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       You torture young children so that they learn your wicked ways. Cruelty is your byword and lies your wicked and unholy "craft".
You are 1984 personified. 
You live off of negative emotions, hate and fear.
You abhor love and positive emotions.
In fact you want to turn humanity in psychopaths.
Inflicting so much emotional damage on your victims they go into disconnect with all life and you work in your demons to control them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You call it ying and yang but it is nothing but an absence of love tempered by STONE PILLARS OF REASON AND DECENCY
Without mentioning your draconian mind control
or the punishment you'll give anyone who does not follow your doctrines of demons and devils. (death)
      </p>
      <p>
       Your chosen flock who are deceived by fables.
FABLES.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are death's disciples. 
Your fate (and mine) are up to the LORD GOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       HE only PERMITS your world deception for his greater glory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your time as the false prophet and anti-Christ will be short,
very short.
compared to the two millennia you have waited and plotted in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your time it will be over in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only then will you understand your folly. But you have already lived it have you not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your edicts and pride as you gloat on your future plans does you ill-service.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are only permitted to do these things, nothing more.

       There is far more to this world than taught in our schools, shown in the media, or proclaimed by the church and state. Most of mankind lives in a hypnotic trance, taking to be reality what is instead a twisted simulacrum of reality, a collective dream in which values are inverted, lies are taken as truth, and tyranny is accepted as security. They enjoy their ignorance and cling tightly to the misery that gives them identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, some are born with spiritual immune systems that sooner or later give rejection to the illusory worldview grafted upon them from birth through social conditioning. They begin sensing that something is amiss, and start looking for answers. Inner knowledge and anomalous outer experiences show them a side of reality others are oblivious to, and so begins their journey of awakening. Each step of the journey is made by following the heart instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge is the key to unlocking our potential. It gives us the self-​determination, responsibility, and power necessary to cast off the chains of covert oppression. Knowledge is therefore the greatest protector, for it also gives us foresight to impeccably handle the challenges of life and, most importantly, to sidestep the traps on the path to awakening. The more you know of higher truths and apply what you know, the more you begin operating under higher laws that transcend the limitations of the lower.

       The Ten Major Principles of the Gnostic Revelation
      </p>
      <p>
       From Exegesis, by Philip K. Dick
      </p>
      <p>
       The Gnostic Christians of the second century believed that only a special revelation of knowledge rather than faith could save a person. The contents of this revelation could not be received empirically or derived a priori. They considered this special gnosis so valuable that it must be kept secret. Here are the ten major principles of the gnostic revelation:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The creator of this world is demented.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The world is not as it appears, in order to hide the evil in it, a delusive veil obscuring it and the deranged deity.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is another, better realm of God, and all our efforts are to be directed toward returning there / bringing it here
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Our actual lives stretch thousands of years back, and we can be made to remember our origin in the stars.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Each of us has a divine counterpart unfallen who can reach a hand down to us to awaken us. This other personality is the authentic waking self; the one we have now is asleep and minor. We are in fact asleep, and in the hands of a dangerous magician disguised as a good god, the deranged creator deity. The bleakness, the evil and pain in this world, the fact that it is a deterministic prison controlled by the demented creator causes us willingly to split with the reality principle early in life, and so to speak willingly fall asleep in delusion.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You can pass from the delusional prison world into the peaceful kingdom if the True Good God places you under His grace and allows you to see reality through His eyes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Christ gave, rather than received, revelation; he taught his followers how to enter the kingdom while still alive, where other mystery religions only bring about amnesis: knowledge of it at the "other time" in "the other realm," not here. He causes it to come here, and is the living agency to the Sole Good God (i.e. the Logos).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Probably the real, secret Christian church still exists, long underground, with the living Corpus Christi as its head or ruler, the members absorbed into it. Through participation in it they probably have vast, seemingly magical powers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The division into "two times" (good and evil) and "two realms" (good and evil) will abruptly end with victory for the good time here, as the presently invisible kingdom separates and becomes visible. We cannot know the date.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         During this time period we are on the sifting bridge being judged according to which power we give allegiance to, the deranged creator demiurge of this world or the One Good God and his kingdom.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       To know these ten principles of Gnostic Christianity is to court disaster.

       TWO SOURCE COSMOGONY: The One was and was-not, combined, and desired to separate the was-not from the was. So it generated a diploid sac which contained, like an eggshell, a pair of twins, each an androgyny, spinning in opposite directions (the Yin and Yang of Taoism, with the One as the Tao). The plan of the One was that both twins would emerge into being (was-ness) simultaneously; however, motivated by a desire to be (which the One implanted in both twins), the counter-clockwise twin broke through the sac and separated prematurely; i.e. before full term. This was the dark or Yin twin. Therefore it was defective. At full term the wiser twin emerged. Each twin formed a unitary entelechy, a single living organism made of psyche and soma, still rotating in opposite directions to each other. The full term twin, called Form I by Parmenides, advanced correctly through its growth stages, but the prematurely born twin, called Form II, languished.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next step in the One's plan was that the Two would become the Many, through their dialetic interaction. From them as hyperuniverses they projected a hologram-like interface, which is the pluriform universe we creatures inhabit. The two sources were to intermingle equally in maintaining our universe, but Form II continued to languish toward illness, madness and disorder. These aspects she projected into our universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the One's purpose for our hologramatic universe to serve as a teaching instrument by which a variety of new lives advanced until ultimately they would be isomorphic with the One. However, the decaying condition of hyperuniverse II introduced malfactors which damaged our hologramatic universe. This is the origin of entropy, undeserved suffering, chaos and death, as well as the Empire, the Black Iron Prison; in essence, the aborting of the proper health and growth of the life forms within the hologramatic universe. Also, the teaching function was grossly impaired, since only the signal from the hyperuniverse I was information-rich; that from II had become noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The psyche of hyperuniverse I sent a micro-form of itself into hyperuniverse II to attempt to heal it. The micro-form was apparent in our hologramatic universe as Jesus Christ. However, hyperuniverse II, being deranged, at once tormented, humiliated, rejected and finally killed the micro-form of the healing psyche of her healthy twin. After that, hyperuniverse II continued to decay into blind, mechanical, purposeless causal processes. It then became the task of Christ (more properly the Holy Spirit) to either rescue the life forms in the hologramatic universe, or abolish all influences on it emanating from II. Approaching its task with caution, it prepared to kill the deranged twin, since she cannot be healed; i.e. she will not allow herself to be healed because she does not not understand that she is sick. This illness and madness pervades us and makes us idiots living in private, unreal worlds. The original plan of the One can only be realized now by the division of hyperuniverse I into two healthy hyperuniverses, which will transform the hologramatic universe into the successfull teaching machine it was designed to be. We will experience this as the "Kingdom of God."
      </p>
      <p>
       Within time, hyperuniverse II remains alive: "The Empire never ended." But in eternity, where the hyperuniverses exist, she has been killed—of necessity—by the healthy twin of hyperuniverse I, who is our champion. The One grieves for this death, since the One loved both twins; therefore the information of the Mind consists of a tragic tale of the death of a woman, the undertones of which generate anguish into all the creatures of the hologrammatic universe without their knowing why. This grief will depart when the healthy twin undergoes mitosis and the "Kingdom of God" arrives. The machinery for this transformation—the procession within time from the Age of Iron to the Age of Gold—is at work now; in eternity it is already accomplished.

       He's might be doing what The Empire has taught him to do.  That is conceal what higher Knowledge you may or may not have while at the same time bragging about that knowledge in cryptic and vague ways.  This is one of the ways dark secret societies suck people in.  They take advantage of the initiate's longing for truth.  They dangle a piece of meat in front of your face but give more than breadcrumbs, they lure you into wrestling the knowledge out of their hands by becoming a ruthless psychopath.  It's not worth playing that game.

       but this person is just a troll. I somehow doubt that the illuminati would be posting under the same screen-name.

       yeah.. he might be a troll, or a lower level illuminati minion, or maybe even a genuine truth seeker who is just too afraid or embarrassed to finish the thread he started.  I hope it's the latter
