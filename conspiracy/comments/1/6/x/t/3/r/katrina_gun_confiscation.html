    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Unconstitutional&quot; is not the same as &quot;treason&quot;. Also, Katrina happened in 2005, and the Supreme Court&#39;s opinion in <em>Heller</em> (ruling that the 2A protects an individual right) wasn&#39;t issued until 2008, so it&#39;s tough to go after the cops now for failing to guess what the Supreme Court would say 3 years in the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I second that.  Any official, that has taken the oath to uphold the constitution, from the lowest to the President should and is held accountable to THE PEOPLE.  WE NEED TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION IN ACCORD WITH THE CONSTITUTION.  If we do not exercise our right then it will be taken away.</p>

<p>People, including it seems the President, thinks we live in a democracy. In a democracy the majority of the people determine law. Well we don&#39;t, we live in a republic and the U.S. Constitution is the law and it has provisions for how it is amended.  What we are seeing is a backdoor attack on the constitution by exploiting the loop hole... states rights.  Obama is a constitutional lecturer, he knows that he would need 2/3 of congress to alter the Constition... so instead you get the states to do it via the pretaxt of &quot;safety.&quot;</p>

<p>They alsio saw that when guns were seized after Katrina, no one tried to use the guns to resit the tyranny.  Needless to say it is not in our nature to want to fight our fellow citizens... the founding fathers had the same issue.  Many Americans sided with the British. We equally have tough decisions ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can I ask you a serious question? </p>

<p>Would you like a civil conversation or debate on a few topics?</p>

<p>I would love to hear your opinions on conspiracy topics such as:</p>

<p>1) 9/11  - Jet fuel didn&#39;t bring em down / WTC 7 / Pentagon hit by missle</p>

<p>2) Federal Reserve - isn&#39;t a reserve - is a priv. corporation.  defrauds us billions a year</p>

<p>3) Fema camps - they exist, they are not friendly, they are the enemy of freedom</p>

<p>4) Sandy hook -  Talk about all the contradictory evidence - false media reports - lies to us - why was lanza in Chris Rodia&#39;s car - why did he shoot his own mom 4 times in the head (bullshit) , why did they claim that an assault rifle was found in his trunk - why were all the news and ambulance crews at the fire hall and not at the actual school on the day of?   Why were the media interviews so sketchy? - look at the medical examiner, look at the victims dad laughing in another shot, then clearly putting on an act on TV , </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe any of this, I am wasting my time here.</p>

<p>If you listen to the radio scanner of sandy hook, you can hear clearly &quot;The teacher saw 2 shadows running past the gym &quot;  and a moment later you hear a scared/distressed cop &quot; They are coming right at me!&quot;</p>

<p>What about the man in the woods, dressed in black/camo, who was running away from the school, then got arrested.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think any of this is sketchy or is a conspiracy, I don&#39;t know what to tell you....  </p>

<p>IT IS PROVEN that the media only tells us what they want us to know, and it&#39;s proven repeatedly that the media has an agenda.  Why isn&#39;t any real reporting being done anymore?  BECAUSE stupid sheeple accept whatever bullshit the TV tells them!</p>

<p><strong>Is it really all so far-fetched that billionaire interests control everything, from politics to media, to the next disease, to the next economic collapse?   If you think it&#39;s all just coincidence you are seriously deluded.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So according to your flawed logic, just because some corrupt evil asshole who is voted into power signs laws he didn&#39;t even write, that makes everything &quot;A-Ok&quot; ?</p>

<p>They are trying to manipulate and control us people, and they are even actively trying to change (to their purposes of course!) the constitution that they are sworn to uphold.  </p>

<p>Although in reality it might be &#39;better&#39; for us scared sheeple to be forcefully dis-armed, I don&#39;t think any corrupt corporate controlled politician has any fucking say in my personal business (specifically in this case, being an American and owning a gun, which is a right!!!!)</p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s not like you can change a 2-party system when both sides are the same and controlled by the exact same corporations.</strong></p>

<p>So if you have only a say, by voting, which means nothing anyway, then what fucking say do you have?  You&#39;re an idiot, I can tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and it is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Legal&quot; looks more to the letter [form/appearance], and &quot;Lawful&quot; to the spirit [substance/content], of the law. &quot;Legal&quot; is more appropriate for conformity to positive rules of law; &quot;Lawful&quot; for accord with ethical principle. &quot;Legal&quot; imports rather that the forms [appearances] of law are observed, that the proceeding is correct in method, that rules prescribed have been obeyed; &quot;Lawful&quot; that the right is actful in substance, that moral quality is secured. &quot;Legal&quot; is the antithesis of equitable, and the equivalent of constructive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Toronto_Boy (sic) is demanding the letter of the law and not the spirit of it which martial law, confined as it is to where people&#39;s access to civil society and it&#39;s courts etc has been destroyed (and only to those places and durations), is trying to maintain the spirit of the law in order that the letter of the law will be reinstated as soon as possible.  </p>

<p>Which, of course,  after Katrina it was just as it was after the Civil War.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summum ius, summa iniuria</p>

<p>Law applied to its extreme is the greatest injustice</p>

<p>People who ballsed it out in Katrina might understandably keep crying about how they were treated but they, many of them who Mad Maxed it to the Max anyway even though they did not have to, were putting an intolerable burden on the limited resources that were available to the nation through their taxes to maintain the nation as best it could.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think martial law / state of emergency etc is just equivalent to being in / under custody.  Do you allow prisoners in prisons to carry guns? </p>

<p>On August 26, 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans was placed under martial law after widespread flooding rendered civil authority ineffective. The state of Louisiana does not have an actual legal construct called &quot;martial law,&quot; but instead something quite like it: a state of public health emergency. The state of emergency allowed the governor to suspend laws, order evacuations, and limit the sales of items such as alcohol and firearms. The governor&#39;s order limited the state of emergency, to end on September 25, 2005, &quot;unless terminated sooner.&quot;</p>

<p>Contrary to many media reports at the time, martial law was not declared in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, because no such term exists in Louisiana state law. However, a State of Emergency was declared, which does give unique powers to the state government similar to those of martial law. On the evening of August 31, 2005, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin nominally declared &quot;martial law&quot; and said that officers didn&#39;t have to observe civil rights and Miranda rights in stopping the looters.[28] Federal troops were a common sight in New Orleans after Katrina. At one point, as many as 15,000 federal troops and National Guardsmen patrolled the city. Additionally it has been reported that armed contractors from Blackwater USA assisted in policing the city.[29]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this case, Lambden Milligan, for whom the case is named, was arrested in Indiana as a Confederate sympathizer. Indiana, like the rest of the United States, was part of a military district set up to help conduct the war. Milligan was tried by military commission and sentenced to die by hanging. After his conviction, Milligan petitioned the Circuit Court for habeas corpus, arguing that his arrest, trial, and conviction were all unconstitutional. What the Supreme Court had to decide, it said, was &quot;Had [the military commission] the legal power and authority to try and punish [Milligan]?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Resoundingly, the Court said no. The Court stated what is almost painfully obvious: &quot;Martial law ... destroys every guarantee of the Constitution.&quot;</strong> The Court reminded the reader that such actions were taken by the King of Great Britain, which caused, in part, the Revolution. &quot;Civil liberty and this kind of martial law cannot endure together; the antagonism is irreconcilable; and, in the conflict, one or the other must perish.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Did this mean that martial law could never be implemented? No, the Court said. The President can declare martial law when circumstances warrant it: When the civil authority cannot operate, then martial law is not only constitutional, but would be necessary:</strong> &quot;If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course. As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power. Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction. It is also confined to the locality of actual war.&quot;</p>

<p>The people who think they weren&#39;t well treated during and after Katrina were given warning to get the hell out before hand.  They choose, by not doing so, to tax the limited resources of their state and nation to breaking point.  Resources it would rather expend on aiding those who were at the very bottom.  People who couldn&#39;t afford either getting out or having shiny guns.  Who were so low they had pawned all their guns if they had ever had any or were crippled (mentally or physically) while thieves who had looted homes and shops ran around with guns and had their fun with them.   You remember the accounts of children being raped left right and center?

    <div class="md"><p>So according to your flawed logic, just because some corrupt evil asshole who is voted into power signs laws he didn&#39;t even write, that makes everything &quot;A-Ok&quot; ?</p>

<p>They are trying to manipulate and control us people, and they are even actively trying to change (to their purposes of course!) the constitution that they are sworn to uphold.  </p>

<p>Although in reality it might be &#39;better&#39; for us scared sheeple to be forcefully dis-armed, I don&#39;t think any corrupt corporate controlled politician has any fucking say in my personal business (specifically in this case, being an American and owning a gun, which is a right!!!!)</p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s not like you can change a 2-party system when both sides are the same and controlled by the exact same corporations.</strong></p>

<p>So if you have only a say, by voting, which means nothing anyway, then what fucking say do you have?  You&#39;re an idiot, I can tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adolf Hitler was voted into office and began his sweeping political grab of power does that mean everything he and the nazi&#39;s did was legal and justified because they were elected in the beginning? the holocaust was LEGAL the soviet purges and the gulags that murdered millions of innocent people were LEGAL Mao&#39;s genocide was LEGAL</p>

<p>Legality does not mean jack shit there is only right and wrong and the handful of people who are willing to kill and die for what they believe</p>

<p>Like I thought, just bullshit from someone who wants to think everyone agrees with them. Thanks for the confirmation. </p>
