<p>Here&#39;s a question: This guy made a peer reviewed article
<a href="http://nielsharrit.org/">http://nielsharrit.org/</a></p>

<p>However according to this:
<a href="http://screwloosechange.blogspot.ie/2009/04/bentham-editor-resigns-over-steven.html">http://screwloosechange.blogspot.ie/2009/04/bentham-editor-resigns-over-steven.html</a></p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t properly reviewed.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s right on this matter? Any evidence you guys care to share?
Are there any other peer reviewed articles in support of the 9/11 &quot;conspiracy&quot;?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just a curious guy trying to get facts straight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our top security guys were having breakfast with the man who&#39;s office wrote the check to lead terrorist  Mohamed Atta, at the Capitol Building  as the planes hit the buildings. Talk about consorting with the enemy. The meeting was between Mahmoud Ahmad, of Pakistan&#39;s ISI Bob Graham and Porter Goss.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an overview of Mahmoud Ahmad.

<p>Here&#39;s where that meeting and other anomalies were investigated BY the participants themselves  Goss and Graham.</p>

<p>After Goss and Graham investigated themselves for the meeting ....</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_Goss">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_Goss</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Goss and Graham made it clear that their goal was not to identify specific wrongdoing: Graham said the inquiry would not play &quot;the blame game about what went wrong from an intelligence perspective,&quot;, and Goss said, &quot;This is not a who-shall-we-hang type of investigation. It is about where are the gaps in America&#39;s defense and what do we do about it type of investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Associated Press item dated May 30, 2002.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The morning of Sept. 11, Sen. Bob Graham and Rep. Porter Goss were
doing what the two intelligence committee chairmen frequently do -
having breakfast together at the Capitol. With them was then-Pakistani
intelligence chief [Mahmud Ahmad]. [General Ahmad&#39;s] task was to
persuade Afghanistan&#39;s Taliban leaders to hand over terror suspect
Osama bin Laden. As the three men talked over the knotty problem, an
aide handed Goss a note saying an airplane had hit the World Trade
Center. A few moments later the Capitol would be evacuated, and the
following month [General Ahmad] was fired.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We should find out if the check that paid Atta still exists. If not, what happened to it.</p>

<p>This movie presents a mountain of evidence that implicates Israel and many non-Israeli Jews in 9/11 and other false flag operations.  Watching all of it will leave you with no doubt about who was responsible for 9/11.  However, even watching bits and pieces of this film is highly educational and recommended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone could clarify something for me - how does this tie in with the first Zeitgeist movie? I know that the purpose of the two films are clearly different, and the actually 9/11 portion of the Zeitgeist movement is actually fairly negligible when it comes to the overall message, and also focused much more on the physical evidence of 9/11, rather than who was ultimately responsible.</p>

<p>I just wanted some clarification as to how the criminal motives highlighted in the two movies could be intertwined, if at all - or are they coming from different directions in what they believe to be the causes of these problems? </p>

<p>Cheers. I&#39;m only about 30mins into this &#39;Missing Links&#39; so far, but it&#39;s interesting and i&#39;m surprised that i&#39;ve never heard of it before.</p>
