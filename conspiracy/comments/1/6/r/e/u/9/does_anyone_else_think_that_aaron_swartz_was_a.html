       He was one of the first protesters of SOPA and he actively opposed the governments control over the internet. The site he was "hacking" openly admitted they weren't the ones who pressed charges or caught him, and he was forced to go to court instead of settling outside of court which would probably ensure he got years in prison rather than months.

       I doubt the actual suicide was because of SOPA or was a murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the zealous prosecution and the prosecutorial over-charging almost certainly had SOPA as a factor.

       I do not think someone who was struggling with depression and facing decades in jail would need to be "assassinated". It seems perfectly plausible that he took his own life. There is only one person who truly knows and he is now deceased.

       I don't think he was killed. He didn't have to be. You take a middle class nerdy american who spends their time and money on the internet, struggles with anxiety and depression and present them with death or 10+ years in prison they'd probably choose death in most cases. My thoughts are more around the unfair treatment of him for no apparent reason. He stood up for someones rights and was destroyed for it.

       I heard that Swartz was offered a 6 month plea deal, so I vote he was a massive pain in the side of the powers that want a blacklist over the Internet. Controlling what we think exists. If we can't find a site, does it exist? That's a huge power to wield. Shaping the thoughts of humanity. 
Swartz was able to move the masses into convincing their representatives en masse to flip flop their stance virtually overnight.
Power people saw him as a irritant.

       I think it's a case of a young man getting in over his head and taking the easy way out. The kicker is if he would have took the plea deal, he would have only got like six months in a low security prison. IMHO, of course. I mean no offense here.

       So what's the conspiracy? The federal goverment had right to prosecute with or without jstor. They did. What's the conspiracy? Making an example out of someone isn't a conspiracy.

       Actually making an example of someone is a conspiracy. That assumes that there's a power structure singling out someone with whom they disagree and conspiring to punish him as a warning to others who might step out of line
      </p>
      <p>
       I get sick of people who don't understand that conspiracies are happening all the time all over the place. The majority are harmless or even helpful. Just because it's not gvt top secret doesn't mean its not a conspiracy. And just because its a conspiracy, doesn't mean it's the doing of the M.I.C.

       He was being watched by the government because he committed a crime long before SOPA was concieved. This is an old case. By your standards, richard stallman would have been attacked by the government since he is way more outspoken over the past 20 years than aaron. But wait...stallman didn't commit a crime, aaron did.

       He got caught by a professor on campus,not the government. MIT went to the government to press charges despite jstor not wanting too. No conspiracy, just a kid who committed a crime and was made an example of. Trgic, but not conspiracy.

       I think we should step aside from whether or not it was a conspiracy of his death and ask if he should have been prosecuted for bringing academic information to the public for free. I personally believe that was a heroic move on his part. Yes it was technically criminal, but it was standing on moral ground for the progress of mankind. Free information, not withheld, is how we can advance.

       There was more than one person involved with prosecuting him and without knowing every communication between all parties involved it is impossible to say what the true motives were.

       His own father has publicly stated that he was murdered by the government. I'm guessing you have more intimate details about Swartz's thoughts than his own father.

       I don't know what happened nor will I speculate but your logic is horrendous.

       Who made you judge, jury and executioner? Without JSTOR pressing charges it would be hard for a jury to give someone the kind of sentence those prosecutors were seeking to give Swartz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because they could continue to seek charges against him doesn't mean they had to. Big difference. There was no victim to his alleged crime. Therefore there was some agenda behind doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've read any of the stories the prosecutors in this case were far from ethical and were outright harassing him because their case was falling apart. That's why people are questioning the story.

       It is still not a
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       . That is the only word I take issue with. It is common for law enforcement to make an example of someone, whether it be a street thug, drug dealer, or someone who steals millions of piad for documents in one fell swoop. He was guilty, he admitted that. He just was too young to realize how serious the charge was and its consequences.
