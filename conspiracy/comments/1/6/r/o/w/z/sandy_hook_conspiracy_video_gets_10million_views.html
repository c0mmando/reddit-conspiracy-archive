        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">375</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-01-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Walloftext4you.html">Walloftext4you</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Even if you are skeptical of this conspiracy you should, at the very least, find the overwhelming popularity of its stance fairly intriguing.  With over 10 million views in one week, this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx9GxXYKx_8">video</a> outlining some theories and inconsistencies tells us a lot about how the public perceives the media and the government.  The level of distrust is palpable.</p>

<p>In less than a month since Sandy Hook, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/15/us/new-york-gun-bill/index.html">New York</a> has found itself to be the first state to pass legislation for registering guns and limiting bullet capacity in magazines.  And many states plan to follow suit in the coming months.</p>

<p>&quot;It would effect a major change in the usual presumptions of confidentiality.&quot;</p>

<p>And almost simultaneously, there has been a national media campaign to discredit conspiracy theorists as delusional, paranoid, and insensitive people.  We saw this expressed in the views of Piers Morgan and Anderson Cooper. </p>

<p>As crazy as conspiracy theorists can be, they have some valid points that should be addressed.  And as we can see from what has happened in the weeks since this shooting, there are some glaring issues with what has been taking place.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reinterpreting the constitution in order to disarm Americans and write new restrictions for one of the most fundamental rights we have is not something that should be decided in the aftermath of an emotionally charged media frenzy.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to worry about&quot; argument is a slippery-slope and possibly borderline retarded. This is the same argument used by people who defend the monitoring of online activity, data-mining, and even the NYPD&#39;s now unconstitutional &quot;Stop-and-Frisk&quot; policy. &quot;Seriously, let me just frisk you real quick.. if you have nothing to hide then what&#39;s the problem?&quot;  As it turns out, you have a right to walk down the street without being physically inspected by the largest paramilitary police force in the entire country.  From this example you can see that sometimes our elected officials attempt to pass some crazy shit that we have to fight to correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Claiming that magazine size will &quot;deter&quot; psychopathic killers is wishful thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>Claiming that having to reload more often can possibly save a life or two in any given massacre may be true.  But.. it&#39;s..still a massacre.</p></li>
<li><p>The focus shouldn&#39;t be on what specific weapon was used. We should really be trying to understand the underlying causes for this type of homicidal behavior. More specifically, we should be asking what&#39;s going on that can cause three horrific massacres in the last six months, from individuals with no clear motive, no training, and whose actions were completely out of character. Also, maybe an investigation into the possible connection b/w psychiatric drugs and going batshit crazy.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe all the conspiracies relating to this incident. But it&#39;s pretty clear that the whole situation has been distorted and our attention has been diverted down a narrow path in favor of increased gun control.</p></li>
<li><p>There is fuckery afoot.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The pursuit of the truth outside of the &quot;official story&quot; is not disrespectful to the victims.  It is the one thing we can do to honor them.  Your opinion on what is tasteful and distasteful regarding this documentary is irrelevant, and is exactly the type of attitude which can paralyze the mind from conducting an honest analysis.   </p>

<p>The quicker you can become more comfortable with approaching taboo subjects, the sooner you can join the discussion.  I am not saying the allegations are true.  I only wish to point out that you will never get to the bottom of anything if your instinct is to discourage those who ask the questions you refuse to ask. </p>

<p>Are we to believe that James Holmes amassed an arsenal, rigged his apartment with explosives, and carried out this plan all by himself?  And if so, what was his motive?  Has that question ever been asked?  What was Adam Lanza&#39;s motive? We&#39;re just supposed to sit back and accept that for some reason now in our world people can go completely crazy and carry out a precise assault on innocent people while leaving no explanation as to why?   </p>

<p>These highly publicized attacks have left the public with far more questions than answers.  The incompetence of the media and the lack of any real solid evidence to support the official narrative of HOW the attack was carried out is alarming.   </p>

<p>Furthermore, the overt and immediate attempt to connect all of these attacks to gun control should be transparent enough.  The issue with people killing other people has never been about which weapon they used, but why they wanted to kill in the first place.  It is about behavior.  A killer is going to kill regardless of what kind of weapon they have access to.  It&#39;s clear that our perception of these incidents is being carefully controlled and directed to support some ulterior agenda.  So how about we start asking some questions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge list of questions NOT included in that video that need to be answered. There is also absolutely no real way to go about proving any of the debunking to be correct independently. The government has a history of killing, sponsoring terror, running guns and killing people all over the world. I am no too terribly trusting of anything they do. I certainly want to believe they wouldn&#39;t do this but the truth is we will never know, and I wouldn&#39;t put it past them. Aurora Colorado certainly seems strange. I think that one was probably staged as well as Sikh temple shooting. Saying that this one couldn&#39;t have been is like saying the government blew up building 7 but had nothing to do with the other 2 towers. I remain skeptical of both sides when it comes to Sandy Hook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the problem with conspiracy theorists. You accept questions as evidence and evidence as - not evidence. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t claim Obama is from Kenya and say well...his father is from kenya. Why isn&#39;t he in Kenya? Why wouldn&#39;t he want to be in Kenya? Isn&#39;t kenya a nice place? If you rearrange the letters in Kenya you get  &quot;Yekan&quot; sounds like &quot;Obama is a kenyan&quot; doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Questions are not proof. &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; things are not evidence. </p>

<p>You have no evidence and when people provide the answers for your questions you brush it off as not contradicting the claims you make based on nothing BUT questions. Questions are not evidence. </p>

<p>The government can suck. The government has been involved in terrible things. BUT you have no evidence which could suggest this is anything except a terrible tragedy. You are content to make huge assumptions and baseless conclusions and then attack the victims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Questions are good. Questions based on ignorance, shaped to incite fear and used as a form of accusation are not good. </p>

<p>When someone asks - Why does he look nervous, why is he smiling, why is he laughing, why isn&#39;t he sad!?</p>

<p>You are suggesting the person is lying. When another person comes along and gives a perfectly acceptable answer for your questions- e.g a psychiatrist states it&#39;s a perfectly normal reaction to this form of trauma. People start saying SHILL!!!!!!!!!! SHILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Most conspiracy theorists don&#39;t want truth. They want to be afraid. They want to demonize the government and other people in any way possible. If you want to actually do something then you should be working with organizations to fight government corruption. Not posting on your blog about how the NWO is about to begin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who is paying attention knows Obama is not from Kenya. It sounds as though for you nothing short of a smoking gun confession is going to convince you of anything. The government is definitely so trustworthy and we should just believe everything that they say unless somebody confesses otherwise. All of the things are nothing but circumstantial evidence and enough of that can make somebody very suspicious of what may be going on. That&#39;s not to say that, I know what&#39;s going on this is what happened. That&#39;s to say that I don&#39;t know what happened I want to know what happened and something stinks. We have no proof other than that to know that something stinks, it doesn&#39;t seem right, and the most untrustworthy group in the history of the world is the government, so it stands to reason we should be very skeptical. You try to discredit people by calling anybody that questions the official narrative in whatever situation it may be a conspiracy theorist. What I am in search for is the truth, whether it leads the direction I wanted to or not. In this case I am very partial toward it not being a government conspiracy. That would be far more terrifying than anything else. I just want to know what&#39;s going on in the world and that shouldn&#39;t be something that offends people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here the the problem you don&#39;t seem to understand. There is no evidence. Nothing you can provide can be define as anything in the same universe as evidence. It is not circumstantial evidence. It is not &quot;kind of&quot; evidence. </p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing. The only justification in your mind is paranoia. Everything presented in these conspiracy videos is accusations based on misinformation and ignorance. You are claiming 2+2=5 and therefore we need to be skeptical of the number 4. </p>

<p>Nothing &quot;stinks&quot;. A terribly tragedy such as this is not abnormal in the world. Gun violence is not abnormal. People getting upset about guns after a tragedy is normal. The government trying to respond is normal.</p>

<p>In reality, you don&#39;t want evidence because you take all the questions and accusations from these nutjobs as evidence. They don&#39;t offer anything real. They don&#39;t offer anything tangiable or solid. They offer accusations and assumptions about how a family is suppose to grieve. What a person is suppose to look like after losing a child. How emergency services is suppose to operate (sever hours after all the victims were evacuated). Were suppose to believe it&#39;s much more logical that Emilie parker is alive and it&#39;s not her sister who is the same age in the picture (they used a 2 year old photo of emilie for the comparison). </p>

<p>IT&#39;s &quot;odd&quot; that sally cox isn&#39;t a registered nurse but it&#39;s not proof that the school nurse is real when you find &quot;sally D. cox&quot; has been a registered nurse in Connecticut since 1974. It&#39;s not weird that the medical examiner is really telling the truth- the accusations that adam&#39;s AR-15 wasn&#39;t with him are entirely false and a shotgun was in the trunk (it&#39;s clear as day in the video) BUT WAIT THE MEDIA HAS FABRICATED THAT VIDEO TO DECEIVE YOU. It&#39;s much MORE likely Christopher manfredonia is a secret government agent than a man who works at Sandy Hook elementary school and is a parents one of of the children and the husband of one of the teachers. </p>

<p>The burden of proof is on you and you alone to provide evidence that anything is happening here. Not questions. Not accusations based on misinformation and lies. You need evidence, not everyone else who has gone beyond their necessary obligations and provided overwhelming evidence to the rational world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing I don&#39;t understand abou the whole Facebook thing is what about the comments? Ok, they made the page for an unrelated reasons and then changed it (which is weird but ok), what about the comments on the page asking why it had been created? And what about the comments on Emilie&#39;s page (I think, it&#39;s early) that express sadness over the loss of their daughter. These are comments on a page, not the page itself, sent before the school was even on lock down. </p>

<p>I agree that it&#39;s probably nothing, I just haven&#39;t been able to square it away. </p>

<p>Read the last bullet point. It explains how you could get something similar to what you&#39;re describing, through google. I imagine that there is a similar explanation for &quot;early&quot; facebook comments. </p>

<p>Think about how incredibly stupid it is to be suspicious about early pages and comments.

<p>No, what makes me right is common sense. I am aware that websites and algorithms, especially large ones, are inevitably going to have flaws. You seem to think that one should assume that Facebook dates for pages and comments are always correct, and that you can&#39;t change the title of a page or edit in other ways without changing the date.</p>

<p>Snopes answered the question, you&#39;re just so obstinately stupid that you refuse to acknowledge the fact that there is a similar explanation for Facebook.</p>

<p>There are two possible options. Either there is an explanation for Facebook dates that is likely similar to the Google explanation, or Facebook&#39;s date system is infallible and therefore the pages and comments were literally posted before the event happened. If you believe the latter, then you are a fucking moron.</p>

<p>Since no one has really taken the time to debunk this here you go:</p>

<p>First off I want to note - the main contributor of information in this video and around this conspiracy is Alex Jones. He is, in my opinion, a paranoid nutjob, as was pretty evident by his CNN interview - seriously skip to 3 minutes in and tell me this guy is sane. (My intent here is not ad hominem, just wanted to give some context as to the presenters of these &quot;facts&quot; and their origins) Now that that&#39;s out of the way let&#39;s look at the content of the video...</p>

<p>Theory 1: The first thing the video tries to allege is that there is a second shooter. They love to grab early media footage and then use that as &quot;evidence&quot; of their claims, as if the media&#39;s first reporting is somehow golden. Odd that conspiracy theorists distrust the media, then turn around and use its raw reporting claims as evidence. Anyway, you can easily google and figure out who the guy in the woods was.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=Y6C2YmOLWnM%5B2%5D">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=Y6C2YmOLWnM[2]</a></p>

<p>He is the father of a student there and the athletic director at the highschool. He was on his way to the school to help make gingerbread houses with 1st graders when he heard the shots. He was unarmed, arrested, detained, questioned, and let go. The story of the guy in the woods was a dead end, so the media dropped it. That is the problem with the 24 hour news cycle, they will report any lead they get before sorting out facts. However, this is hardly evidence of a conspiracy.</p>

<p>The video even makes the ridiculous claim that since the guy was sitting in the FRONT of the police car, that he must have some &quot;crazy&quot; credentials. Yeah, what is more likely...that this guy was a concerned father or that he was a man with some &quot;crazy&quot; credentials on a black ops mission to shoot up a school but he just didn&#39;t have the skills to properly vacate, and so he ended up getting himself captured by lowly local law enforcement, AND broadcast on national tv, potentially exposing his super secret black op? C&#39;mon.</p>

<p>Theory 2: The gun discrepancy. This can be chalked up to contradictory reporting, which is going to happen when the media competes with itself to be the first one to break any new details. There have already been articles clearing up the discrepancies: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/18/us/connecticut-lanza-guns/index.html%5B3%5D">http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/18/us/connecticut-lanza-guns/index.html[3]</a></p>

<p>Theory 3: The nurse is fake and does not exist. This is completely false, and has been debunked with evidence: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r61PvN4U3x0%5B4%5D">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r61PvN4U3x0[4]</a></p>

<p>Theory 4: The laughing/crying father. This means absolutely nothing. No one can judge how a father copes with the loss of his daughter, and it&#39;s offensive that people are criticizing him for it. I have been to several funerals, I have witnessed family members and friends switch in and out of laughter and tears. They think of fond memories of the one they lost, they tell stories, they laugh, and they cry. People grieve in different ways. To me it does not seem right to criticize his reaction here, and it&#39;s not evidence of a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Theory 5: Emillie Parker is not dead. This is the most absurd thing I have seen so far in the video. The video alleges not only that the girl is not dead, but that the parents were so stupid they brought out the wrong sister for the photo op. What? Do people honestly believe that? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTaC580hfPo%5B5%5D">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTaC580hfPo[5]</a> It&#39;s a picture of her sister. Obviously. They look alike because, you know, they&#39;re sister&#39;s. This guy uses the same photoshop trick as the conspiracy video and gets the same effect. Check out their noses in this picture for further evidence: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iSuf4.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/iSuf4.jpg</a> [6]</p>

<p>Theory 6: One piece of footage of the crime scene does not show many ambulances and shows no children. The author claims this means this was all staged. He goes on to say that only one ambulance was there the whole time and they quickly blocked off all exits. The problem with this is twofold. Firstly, there are several pictures of multiple ambulances (here are a few):</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/hb6kZ,XGWSd#1">http://imgur.com/hb6kZ,XGWSd#1</a> [7]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/connecticut-school-shooting-official-says-gunman-killed-85094.html%5B8%5D">http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/connecticut-school-shooting-official-says-gunman-killed-85094.html[8]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, this footage that the videos author is commenting on looks to be taken well after the shooting took place, which easily explains why there aren&#39;t a bunch of ambulances around and no one is panicking anymore. More things taken out of context because they fit the authors narrative.</p>

<p>Theory 7: Time stamps on the webpage set up for donations state the page was created before the shootings took place. Google search results do not always accurately reflect the date the content was published. Example) Here is a date restrictive search of sandy hook, listing all articles that appear to be published before the shooting took place. Well shit, according to google this there are articles and videos from these dates talking about the shooting: Jan 14, 2012 , Jun 19, 2012 , Sept 16, 2012 ..well before the shooting took place. Debunked.</p>

<p>Addition: People keep bringing up the facebook page that was made prior to the shooting. The creator of the page said they had made an unrelated page previously, it had no fans in it. After the shootings took place, she renamed the page to be a memorial for one of the victims. This changed the URL, but kept the original creation date of the group. Many claim this is not possible or this is not how facebook works. Here is proof that it is: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/U6wWH">http://imgur.com/a/U6wWH</a> [9]</p>

<p>Theory 8: There was a planned FEMA meeting scheduled 20 minutes from the time of the shooting which helped slow down the response time of first responders.(Added due to popular demand). I went to the emergency services website for CT to investigate this. This class is offered regularly. It was offered on 11/17, 11/27, 12/3, 12/6, 12/14, and 12/17</p>

<p>In fact, digging a little deeper you can see they have had training classes like these for a long time, such as this one way back on 4/2/2012 called Emergency Planning for Schools (2 day course):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/eventDetail_page.asp?date_ID=CACBCCCDCE83CDCACA%5B10%5D">http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/eventDetail_page.asp?date_ID=CACBCCCDCE83CDCACA[10]</a></p>

<p>These tragedies have been happening for awhile, and so has training people to respond to them. Debunked.</p>

<p>Other stuff: The people that made this video clearly have their own agenda, which is why they keep bringing up 9/11 and the London bombings (two completely unrelated events). Any time a large, tragic event occurs, many of these conspiracy theorists do their best to gather all of the media reports, then pick and choose to take the media out of context and create their own crazy conspiracy driven narrative for the events that took place. If you are skeptical of this video, you should be. It&#39;s crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to say that in Theory 4 (the only one you don&#39;t have a concrete explanation for) a possible explanation could be that police encourage victim&#39;s family to get really emotional when they go on tv to encourage the viewers to give up any information relating to the crime.

<p>The &quot;Man in Woods&quot; was actually a SWAT officer from another town and HAD A GUN!!! Read for yourself. Very last sentence:</p>

<p><a href="http://newtownbee.com/News/2012-12-27__14-58-27/Police%20Union%20Seeks%20Funding%20For%20Trauma%20Treatment">http://newtownbee.com/News/2012-12-27__14-58-27/Police%20Union%20Seeks%20Funding%20For%20Trauma%20Treatment</a></p>

<p>&quot;A man with a gun who was spotted in the woods near the school on the day of the incident was an off-duty tactical squad police officer from another town.&quot;</p>

<p>So which story is REAL? 
Gingerbread cookies? Or the SWAT agent &quot;dressed in camo&quot; with &quot;crazy credentials&quot; who was put into the front of a police car as per the story of multiple adult and child witnesses?</p>

<p>Now seriously ask yourself WHY this story was dropped from Mainstream news coverage.</p>

<p>AKA a one minute drive...</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve never worked on an ambulance before so listen up. Literally the first thing any ambulance crew member learns is that his first responsibility is NOT the patient, but is actually the safety of himself and the rest of the crew. It would be an enormous breach of protocol to go anywhere near any building that has had and may still have a gunman inside. I have been on calls where people have pulled (and not even used) a knife, and the police and crew chief do not want us going anywhere near the house. If it was a gun we&#39;d be even further. Ambulance personnel aren&#39;t interested in risking their own lives for the patients, no matter what the call is. </p>

<p>And, let&#39;s just go with your theory...he was an actor.  That means he didn&#39;t have a kid at the school, meaning 1. Someone hired him to act, 2. He agreed and did a terrible job, 3. No one in the community pointed out he didn&#39;t have a kid there.  4. None of the reporters attempted to verify who he was. and 5. All to do what????  Take your assault weapon?</p>

<p>Anybody remember this? </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_(testimony)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_(testimony)</a></p>

<p>Though not completely orchestrated by the U.S. government, our government was complicit in allowing this testimony to be heard in order to rally the U.S. populace around the idea that our presence was needed to put a stop to the savagery that was being perpetuated by Saddam Hussein and his regime. Here&#39;s how it worked back when George Bush the 1st was at the helm:</p>

<p>Problem: Baby Killers
Reaction: Nationwide Disgust
Solution: Invade Iraq</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure people around here are familiar with the Problem - Reaction - Solution method. Since then, it was found that this woman was ACTING. I&#39;m not necessarily convinced yet that this was done at Sandy Hook but I am fully convinced that hiring actors to put on a show for the media and our politicians HAS HAPPENED.</p>

<p>Her actual testimony can be found on YouTube. Haven&#39;t looked into how to post video links yet but should easily be found by just typing Nayirah testimony. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you and I&#39;m glad this post was the one to cause you to become more involved here.  :) </p>

<p>It is interesting to see that even with the knowledge of actual government conspiracy and deception, it is still hard for some people to accept this as a possibility.  Not absolute fact, simply possibility.  </p>

<p>This testimony explicitly shows us that our government is willing to use the false testimony of a child to pull at our emotions and gain support for their own agenda.  Your link, plain as day, shows just how far they were willing to go in 1990.  And yet, the current distrust for our government is somehow surprising to some people?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s crazier.. that we use instances of actual corruption to speculate on current motives?  Or that some of us are aware of past government deception, but are unwilling to believe it can still happen?</p>

<p>Our government <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/02/politics/02tonkin.html?_r=3&amp;amp;pagewanted=print&amp;amp;">withheld</a> key details regarding two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident">alleged attacks</a> on US Navy vessels in order to gain support for a military conflict with Vietnam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The News Media is basically using the Sandy Hook event for a full out Assault on America to ban guns...</p>

<p>Timeline:
- November 2, 2012: Feinstein met with ATF to finalize “Assault Weapons Ban”
<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/feinstein-rumored-to-be-pushing-semi-auto-ban-if-obama-reelected">http://www.examiner.com/article/feinstein-rumored-to-be-pushing-semi-auto-ban-if-obama-reelected</a>
- November 4, 2012: Presidential Election - News Media Elects Obama
- December 14, 2012: 5 Weeks later… Sandy Hook - News Media comes for your guns
- January 15, 2013: New York State Bans Guns and Magazines</p>

<p>Sandy Hook Questions Not Asked by the News Media:</p>

<p>-Arrested 2nd shooter? Apprehended man lying on the ground in woods? Other “Camo pants” man handcuffed and sitting in “front” of the police car? Video at 5:55 mark: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W6b-voc-Ds">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W6b-voc-Ds</a>  Did the news media report who these people were?</p>

<p>-Does there exist another mass shooting with more deaths than wounded? Has anyone seen even one video or picture of the dead or wounded?
-Responding officers don’t know the difference between used pistol and rifle rounds sitting on the ground at the crime scene? Any pictures exist of the “hundreds of rounds” of shell casings? Pistol or AR spent cartridges are very easy to tell apart.
- Are there any pictures or video of bodies coming out of the school? 
-Any pictures of broken glass from shooting his way into the school or any broken windows anywhere? 
-Who has seen video footage or photos of ANY of the damage at the school?
-What was Adam Lanza’s motive for the shooting? What was his connection to the school?</p>

<p>-Victoria Soto&#39;s class picture for 2012 shows 15 children.
According to official report:
6 children were shot trying to escape
7 children were found in closet by police
6 children escaped and were in Eugene Rosen&#39;s house
Total = 19 children. 4 extra children since the class picture?</p>

<p>-Sandy Hook Nuns? Police scanner: “One of them may be wearing a nun outfit, headed toward Danbury and Stoney Hill, purple van, unknow plates...” What is the box outline under the skirt of the taller nun’s dress?

<p>-School Nurse tells reporter that Nancy Lanza was a Kindergarten teacher? Nancy Lanza didn’t have anything to do with the school?
<a href="http://youtu.be/uHEs-XAJqfU">http://youtu.be/uHEs-XAJqfU</a></p>

<p>-Teachers listed as Victims NOT listed on School Website as Faculty? Screen shots showing Cameras are IN Newtown Schools. Who has the video from the school?

Gilles Rousseau, told Radio-Canada that he wanted to see his daughter’s body but was informed by authorities that it would not be possible.
 “They told me, ‘You can’t see (the body),’” Gilles Rousseau told Radio-Canada, the French-language CBC. “Because most people he shot, it was two or three shots in the face, point-blank.”</p>

<p>Why did so many of the victims recently move to Sandy Hook?
- Madeleine Hsu, within the last 2 yrs
- Ana Marquez Greene, moved from Canada this yr
- Avielle Richman, moved to Newtown last yr
- Ben Wheeler, moved to Sandy Hook April 2011
- Emily Parker, moved from NM to Utah, then Sandy Hook
- Charlotte Bacon, moved there in the last 4-5 yrs

- Dylan Hockley, moved to SH in Jan 2011</p>

<p>-“[My staff] and I hope the people of Newtown don’t have it crash on their head later.” –Connecticut Medical Examiner D. Wayne Carver II, MD, December 15, 2012</p>

<p>The news media is not asking questions because they want America disarmed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No real evidence is exactly our point, the lack of any real evidence that a shooting even occurred  besides filmed families of victims is really the entire issue. Every other time there is a shooting that isn&#39;t trying to be quickly covered up and exploited there is always footage of bullet holes, wounded people, not just one wounded adult on a stretcher. The photos would exist somewhere. All that anyone would need to debunk this conspiracy is just SOME footage of the school in any respect but of course there is none and somehow that sits well with you?</p>

<p>(AFP) – No video has been released of Adam Lanza entering the SandyHook school but the school had recently spent $300,000 on a new security system including state of the art video cameras and door locks. One of the big questions is how did Adam Lanza get into the school did someone let him in as he was carrying an assault rifle? Was the door left open? Did he shoot out the door? This is a key question from the event. No pictures exist of the crime scene. No one was wounded. No one survived. Out of 20 no one survived? Maybe because they blocked the road to ambulances?</p>

School faculty websites are usually accurate with their staff lists, especially if they are in the education business. 
They release videos of everything else on the planet and they can&#39;t show even 2 seconds of any video? Not even of the crime, but even someone entering the building? 
Adam&#39;s face is obviously photoshopped in the picture they showed everyone what he looks like. 
Intelius showing Robbie Parker and His wife at 59 and 77 years old is accurate because it shows all their previous addresses and also works correctly when looking up anyone else. 
There is no footage anywhere of the hundreds of students coming out of the school. Only 1 picture exists with about 20 kids. There are no pictures of 600 kids coming out of the school.
The parent clearly says &quot;CBS sent me a text message&quot;. You can call her a liar if you want. 
Adam Lanza hasn&#39;t been seen by anyone in the last 3 years, not just the neighbors. 
The cop is photoshopped into the picture. 
It is a coincidence that so many victims moved to the town in the last year or 2. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many questions and so little we know. I really do find it strange that there is only that one still image of the kids running out with those police officers(?) and absolutely no video of any teachers, parents, students running out of the school. Some use the shadows to explain the time of day and to debunk that &quot;no kids running out&quot; theory. What&#39;s even stranger is how someone could be a complete ghost for three years. Isn&#39;t that almost impossible? There has gotta be something.</p>

<p>Also, why not show the surveillance footage? No need to show the massacre to the public, but at least show something! There is probably some legal issues with this but come on. At least show Adam walking into the fucking school, show bullet holes, show broken glass, etc.</p>

<p>Every time there is an explanation to something, there is an explanation to that explanation. I just wish there was at least one piece of the story that we actually know and have evidence about that can&#39;t be disproven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It almost seems to me they didn&#39;t actually want to damage the building in any way whatsoever. When there is a shooting in my town you bet your ass the local news will be there taking footage of the bullet holes and of the crying people involved. They literally showed nothing in this case, and the &quot;shadows show what time of day it is!&quot; argument is crap since local news crews arrived while the shooting was still ongoing and were kept at the same exact road block shown in the aerial footage. They completely half assed this and they assume we really wouldn&#39;t notice, and the ones who do notice will just be cast aside as insane conspiracy theorists/terroists. Just goes to show how people will fight tooth and nail to believe that nothing is going on because how could they not know about it if it was?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google was running two distinctly different photos of the two nuns.  Both photos were supposedly taken shortly after the Sandy Hook Hoax.</p>

<p>In Photo One, the taller nun was wearing a thigh-length, dark coloured (black or dark grey) jacket</p>

<p>In Photo Two, the same tall nun was wearing a CALF length GREEN coat.  She also had a large handbag over her shoulder</p>

<p>So --- did they hold rehearsals for the shooting?  If so, were photographs taken AT that rehearsal ?</p>

<p>Do nuns rushing to an alleged multi-child massacre carry <em>spare</em> jackets in order they can be photographed in a variety of costumes ?  If so, WHY would a nun be photographed at the <em>SAME</em> scene in two distinctly different jackets ?</p>

<p>And in addition to the two different length, different colour, jackets -- one of those nuns appeared distinctly <em>male</em> in size and comportment <em>AND</em> very much appeared to be concealing something beneath at least one of the jackets</p>

<p>So where are the two nuns now?  Why were they wandering around, one of them looking distinctly masculine in different jackets, one of which was concealing something largish in the opinion of many?</p>

<p>Where are those &#39;nuns&#39; ?</p>

<p>Why were they there ?  What was their &#39;purpose&#39;?  Why did they appear so odd ?  Why the jacket change mid pandemonium?  Why did they wander around looking bizarre?  What was under the jacket?  Who were those nuns <em>really</em> ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More handguns are involved in more shootings than &#39;assault rifles.&#39; If the 2nd amendment has the right to bear arms, those arms need to be equal or sufficient enough  to use against those that might want to take them away. If the day comes, the army aren&#39;t going to have tanks rolling down the streets with fighter jets bombing towns and cities, it will be swat type teams with small arms which needs to be equaled and that is the reason the weapons that are kept now by law abiding citizens need to remain.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no good passing off the possibility as a crazy notion because the indications are there the government does not act in your interest, does not care and sees people with weapons as a threat to their power. They have passed laws so your communications can be intercepted, they have done the same so Americans or terrorists can be arrested without trial and detained indefinitely and they are proposing gun laws because they are afraid of people and the fact the base of knowledge about their corruption has the possibility of reaching critical mass. It&#39;s been seen before throughout history and its being seen again with those laws and steps being taken.</p>

<p>Why do people believe the same people who backup Wall St, spend tax payers money on wars for private gain and cause social and economic hardship to millions of people have suddenly started giving a shit when people get killed by a mentally unstable person? Most of the things they do don&#39;t point to them caring and if you think Obama cares about kids dying, then you should ask why he is sanctioning drone strikes which is killing children. </p>

<p>I seriously can&#39;t believe the size of that link but the shorter one (that could be deemed as &quot;credible&quot;) was a Fox news site and I&#39;ll just outright avoid the shit storm that would come from linking to them.</p>

<p>To summarize, this woman shot at an intruder after he found her and her twin children hiding in the crawl space, hitting him 5 times and he was still able to escape the house and get to his car. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve all seen the scenario in movies, &quot;He&#39;s only got one bullet left in that chamber! If he takes me out, I want you guys to hit him with everything you&#39;ve got!&quot; Let&#39;s say for a minute that this intruder wasn&#39;t by himself. Assuming that the second (or third or fourth) intruder wasn&#39;t scared off by the gunshots, she emptied the chamber of all six bullets in an effort to protect herself and her children, five of which hit the ONE intruder. I think we can all make a fairly predictable assumption as to what the fate of the mother and those children would have been.</p>

<p>All of that being said, taking mental stability and predisposition to crime into consideration, lawful gun ownership by reasonable people has never been an issue. It&#39;s when guns leave the hands of these reasonable people due to theft or improper care or storage that they become a problem. I am not a gun owner personally yet I have no problems with gun ownership, especially when it comes to protecting what&#39;s important to me. That&#39;s why drug dealers have guns, they are protecting what&#39;s important to them (drugs). Personally, I&#39;ve always wondered if our failed war on many drugs hasn&#39;t perpetuated the violent use of guns in areas where drugs rule the streets (that&#39;s a much bigger question that probably has its own subbreddit, monopolies are bad mmmkay). After all, drugs are illegal and they still seem to make their way through our country in vast quantities. Is everyone really proposing that the same thing won&#39;t happen to these &quot;assault weapons&quot;. Of course not. But then everyone says, &quot;But they&#39;re not going to touch handguns!&quot; Great, drug dealers and hardened criminals still get to have their smuggled in assault weapons, meanwhile i&#39;m bringing a teaspoon to a knife fight. But I guess it&#39;s not the citizenry&#39;s job to deal with hardened criminals and their assault weapons. It&#39;s the police and they still get to keep their &quot;Big Guns&quot;. </p>

<p>Which brings me to what I believe the writers of the constitution&#39;s purpose was in writing the second amendment. Though seemingly far fetched to most, the idea is that the population needs a way to protect themselves in the event that the government decides to stop coinciding with the wills and wants of the people. The reality is, the world of government and politics today isn&#39;t exactly as participatory as the world was in the time of the constitution. Everyone is EXTREMELY occupied in efforts to &quot;win their bread&quot; and to provide for their families in ways that I&#39;m sure were inconceivable to our forefathers. People don&#39;t have the same opportunity (time) to directly interact with their representatives in great numbers like they did in the past. Not to mention that when the majority does interact (interaction being defined as receiving information about candidates from various forms of media) with politicians, the interaction we base our voting habits on rarely culminates in politicians sticking to their plans. This is not an anti-Obama sentiment as it may be absorbed by some. I say this with regard to any politician that gets to the pulpit and ignores what got them there.</p>

<p>If we can qualify who might be a risk to own a gun, many would say criminals convicted of violent crime and people diagnosed with mental instability or disability. Let&#39;s focus for a minute on the former. Many people who are reduced to crime in order to make a living arguably lack the skills to make a crime free living and see it as more profitable to hurt, steal and otherwise cause pain to others in order to elevate themselves. Is this not due, at least in part to our educational system failing the children we are supposed to educate in one way or another? I know what is learned in school needs to be reinforced at home and in some cases that reinforcement is severely lacking, yet it seems that around the nation, cuts are being made to education in one way or another. Usually the first to go are the arts and other &quot;electives&quot; that don&#39;t necessarily rely on state sponsored books to teach. Not everyone excels at just the core curriculum and by eliminating the only things that some &quot;problem children&quot; relate to, we are defaulting them to the path of least resistance (in their eyes). Why don&#39;t we stop fear mongering a little bit and put some effort into the roots of what could, in reality, prevent children from feeling the need to turn to guns as a solution to their lack of a skill set. Imagine that, a country up to its gills in debt yet still feeling the need to spend, actually investing into the future of its youth instead of putting a band-aid on the problem that seems to be a result of the kids that missed out and decide a gun can fix that.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s get to the latter from the previous paragraph. Mental illness is obviously a very real problem. Many people who might be defined as mentally ill, I feel in some cases are just masking symptoms like depression that can&#39;t be fixed because of their unfortunate circumstances that are seemingly impossible to change. Some medications do help people, I&#39;ve known that to be true from people I am acquainted with. Others though have been medicated to make them more &quot;manageable&quot;. What&#39;s very interesting though is that SSRI&#39;s or similar drugs have been in the picture in A LOT of these massacres that keep coming up in the news. I don&#39;t really know how the government plans to police this with doctor-patient confidentiality issues in the balance. The only thing I&#39;ve ever heard that trumps that confidentiality is if a doctor hears directly from a patient that they plan to either hurt themselves or hurt others. I really don&#39;t know what the answer is but it&#39;s certainly not making my medical history available to some guy at a register at Walmart or at a gun show. I&#39;ve also wondered about the person who takes antidepressants in their freshman year of college because the love of their life just broke up with them. How long and how far does that paper trail of being diagnosed and medicated once follow this person? </p>

<p>The moral of the story to me is, most of the time people are blinded by baby steps in the now because they don&#39;t realize that the plan is to take many, many baby steps. I agree with many when I say it&#39;s very rarely the arrow but the person pulling the bow string that does the damage.</p>

<p>Are we to believe that James Holmes amassed an arsenal, rigged his apartment with explosives, and carried out this plan all by himself? And if so, what was his motive? Has that question ever been asked? What was Adam Lanza&#39;s motive?

</blockquote>

<p>These are good points.  In the past (Columbine, V Tech) the killers always made their motive clear.  They wanted the world to know exactly how they had been wronged, they wanted the world to know what why they were doing it.  In fact telling the world this was a big part of their operation - they made lengthy narcissistic videos and writings.  But interestingly these last two massacres appear to be motiveless.  Further more we haven&#39;t gotten the typical media feeding frenzy that wanted to find out as much about the killers as possible.  In other words not only have the killers changed their behavior from previous examples, but the media has too.  Why is that?</p>

I mean why else are there conspiracies for about every other shooting out there that has eventually gone nowhere? I mean if we clearly look at the Aurora shooting, there were conspiracies and guess where that went? Nowhere. The CIA clearly planted misinformation so that the ignorant masses would follow continuous dead ends until the next tragic event occurs. This one will be forgotten in maybe a month or so and like the latest internet fad constructed by your favorite local CIA agent, you&#39;ll follow a new misguided effort for some sort of conspiracy. So wake up sheeple!</p>

<p>When faced by a horrifying event most people try finding some solace in finding some reason or explanation for why that horrible event happened.  When there doesn&#39;t appear to be reason, they&#39;ll create one.</p>

<p>The first post in this subreddit about it being a conspiracy happened literally within hours without a single bit of evidence or reason.  Everything since has been an exercise in confirmation bias.  People believe it&#39;s true because they desperately want it to be true.  The stark reality of a psychopath snuffing out 27 lives on a whim is unfathomable to most.  There&#39;s no plot to unravel, no shadowy enemy to fight, just a collection of coffins and mourning families.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a CIA disinfo campaign, it&#39;s a coping mechanism trying to create an explanation when no explanation is possible.</p>

See I believe the real coping mechanism is people like you who seek to debunk these videos because they make you uncomfortable. You will claim again and again that it doesn&#39;t make you uncomfortable and how you are 100% correct in the matter without even taking time to even discuss it. Being so positively sure you&#39;re right is quite a bad thing. You really think people want to believe that no one could actually do something horrific? Have you fucking seen our world? I&#39;m pretty damn sure we know what humans are capable of. This is just the most convoluted bullshit I come across.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The pursuit of the truth outside of the &quot;official story&quot; is not disrespectful to the victims. It is the one thing we can do to honor them. Your opinion on what is tasteful and distasteful regarding this documentary is irrelevant, and is exactly the type of attitude which can paralyze the mind from conducting an honest analysis.&quot;</p>

<p>My honest analysis of this video is that this man claims men, women and children who experience a terrible tradgey are not the victims but perpatrators of a national conspiracy to infringe on the 2nd Amendment. </p>

<p>These people are not innocent but evil masterminds of the government. </p>

<p>Anyone, ANYONE can spend 5 minutes checking his statements and see that it is out of ignorance, laziness, paranoia and stupidity that he makes his claims. </p>

<p>He bases his claims first on the premise that the news media is infalliable, the beacons of truth YET they are liars and thieves in the back pocket of a national conspiracy. </p>

<p>Mistakes during the first run of news after the shooting during which time people were scambling like crazy to be the first to report, that is the time to choose statements and see &quot;what really happened&quot;. Therefore contradictory news stories are not mistakes made during an attempt at reporting a story BUT mistakes during the concoction of a conspiracy. </p>

<p>His claims concerning the weapons used- He shows video during which a shotgun is removed from the trunk of the vehicle. He claims it is an AR-15. He couldn&#39;t even recognize a shotgun compared to an assault rifle. Though after a couple thousand comments about it he retracts that statement. BUT CLAIMS THERE IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT VIDEO SHOWING ANOTHER WEAPON BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE TRUNK!. What the fuck. You can&#39;t accept you are just wrong?</p>

<p>His ignorance and misinformation therefore led to a mess of accusations that the medical examiner is lying, that he is &quot;laughing&quot; and acting strange. It&#39;s a lie that all the children were killed with an assault rifle because adam must not have had it with him (If they had found the assult rifle in the trunk that might have on some level made sense). </p>

<p>&quot;Sally Cox&quot; isn&#39;t a registered nurse in Connecticut. Sally D. Cox is and has been since 1974. </p>

<p>Time stamps are infalliable and entirely accurate yet I just took this screen shot the other day showing Sandyhookhoax.com was created before the shootings even happened. <a href="http://imgur.com/lfTdi">http://imgur.com/lfTdi</a></p>

<p>And now you are starting to get angry, you may have even stopped reading because you&#39;re &quot;evidence&quot; is being exposed as lies and misinformation provided by a man who is invested financially in providing convincing, yet poorly argued, poorly edited, poorly though out conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>But I must be a sheep and a shill. Here I am questioning evidence, checking sources and using critical thinking -NOT accepting the biased information of a conspiracy theorist whose job it is to fabricate lies on the internet. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t give me this bullshit about the victims. People like you are the reason Memorials are being flooded with hatred from ignorant people who can&#39;t seem to figure out how research works. </p>

<p>Check my post history for more info or one of the other 1000 extensive debunkings this video has spawned. Or since you guys love to research so much double check some evidence for yourselves. </p>

To believe they will simply be satisfied and stop here is an optimistic view, but probably very unlikely. Although this particular proposal may not be a &quot;big deal&quot; now, it unfortunately opens the door and sets the stage for further restrictions down the line.</p>

<p>The Patriot Act was once widely accepted as a necessity for our own safety. That is, until we realized it was actually kind of shitty. I think a pretty basic thing we need to do is not rush to pass legislation as a knee-jerk reaction to emotionally charged media events. Something like re-writing the constitution should probably be done in a slightly more rational manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you, yourself actually read these documents? Also, even people who actually believe the official reports have found an overwhelming amount of problems , blatant lies, stumbles and inconsistencies within the documents presented by the 911 commission. This isn&#39;t even bringing up the insurmountable amount of factual evidence poking holes in almost every layer of the 911 commissions reports. If an event as big as 911 holds even a shadow of doubt, it needs to be investigated until every avenue has been fully explored and exhausted. Senators, reporters, military personal, first responders, scientists, engineers, physicists, architects have for the most part debunked every layer of the 911 commissions report, does this mean they&#39;re truthers? No, does It mean they&#39;re nutjobs? No, it means the government needs to figure out what the fuck actually happened. I&#39;m not a truther, nor do I want to believe the government is cable of something this evil, but I do think they used 911 to their advantage and they were more worried about turning a war profit on it then giving us the truth. I also sure as fuck don&#39;t believe that planes took down those towers alone and tens upon tens of thousands of extremely educated individuals agree. The fact that the government cleared the evidence with out letting outside agencies investigate is proof enough that we&#39;re being lied to. </p>

<p>Yes. Look this is the problem. Bad things happen for no reason. There have always been mentally unbalanced people that have murdered others. It is peoples lack of capacity to understand and face the tragic and sad truth that things can just happen without logic or reason that gives rise to the need to then find a reason to try and make sense of these tragedies that then leads to these sad conspiracies gaining so much weight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like you&#39;re counting a couple fire trucks.  Either way, all of them are completely boxed in.</p>

<p>By the way, that&#39;s the fire station, not the school.  The school&#39;s parking lot doesn&#39;t go around the building:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you have no idea how emergency medicine works, since you keep harping on them being &quot;boxed in&quot;.  Once they arrive on scene, ambulances no longer do what is derisively called &quot;throw and go&quot;.  They stay on scene to offer care.</p>

<p>And the picture shows there was a shitload of emergency equipment being used for the tragedy.  Like I said, this is where a sane person reconsiders their position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, no.  They don&#39;t.  EMT&#39;s are not equipped to handle severe traumas as well as a hospital.  That&#39;s where there are seats inside the ambulance - to provide care on the way to the hospital.  That&#39;s why they have sirens, and backwards &quot;AMBULANCE&quot; written on the front, so they can get to the hospital as fast as humanly possible.  Anything that requires even precautionary hospitalization - especially an UNSTABLE patient - is going to make them drive to the hospital.  And they&#39;re not going to park the ambulances half a mile away at a fire station, especially not after the area has been secured.</p>

<p>You are going to sit here with a straight face and say that ambulances were providing on-scene care for a <em>mass shooting</em>?  That nobody moved cars out of the way for them to get to the goddamn hospital, and parked, what, 8 cars in front of them?  I don&#39;t know what world you&#39;re living in where that&#39;s something you&#39;ll believe  even once in a billion years.  And you say the medical equipment was being used, but I also don&#39;t see any evidence of <em>patients</em>!  </p>

<p>What is it you say - isn&#39;t that when a sane person reconsiders their position?  </p>

<p>We certainly have reason to doubt the medical staff we saw on TV - the psychotic, giggling, possibly drunk &#39;medical examiner&#39;.  The one who said that all the children were shot by the &#39;long rifle&#39;, which NBC can&#39;t even seem to decide was present at the scene or not.</p>

<p>Obviously you have no fucking clue what you&#39;re talking about.  I sat on the board of a fire/ambulance district and managed operations of the district for two years.  I know what occurs at a scene.</p>

<p>But, I can see that this is simply an exercise in moving goalposts for you.  Like I said, a sane person would have admitted their position was flawed and reconsidered, instead, like the psychologically flawed conspiracy kook you are, you double down on your flawed belief, and instead move the goalposts and demand new and different proof than before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You showed me a bunch of ambulances up the road, at a fire station.  <em>Completely boxed in by what, 8  cars?</em></p>

<p>In your probably made up experience, would ambulances get parked at the scene of a mass shooting, with a huge police presence, and then get boxed into a parking lot by a shitload of other cars, and have nobody intervene?   The police wouldn&#39;t <em>stop people from parking there</em>?  Or does the fire department just get its parking lot jammed up with cars every day?  </p>

<p>What completely insane scenario does this happen in, where the emergency response is prevented from taking the victims of a mass shooting to a hospital, and staged a thousand feet away from the scene of the shooting, even after the scene has been secured?</p>

<p>Here is something on Yahoo Answers from somebody who apparently, unlike you, actually has relevant experience:</p>

<p><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091128114034AA9uMUw">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091128114034AA9uMUw</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree most with EMTDAD and DrLove. I am in an ambulance, on average, 5 days a week. The MAJORITY of my patients I do NOT transport with lights and sirens. You&#39;re putting yourself, your partner, the patient, and other drivers at risk. <strong>Unless my patient has a life-threatening illness or they may go downhill quickly, I transport without lights and sirens.</strong> So someone who I suspect or know is having a heart attack, I will go lights and sirens. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Critical patients.  Patients that will go downhill quickly.  Like <em>gunshot victims</em>.  They don&#39;t stabilize gunshot victims on scene and then drive them to the ER with their goddamn sirens off, they stablize them and then get them there ASAP, as soon as possible, with their sirens on.  Everyone on the planet knows that.  You&#39;re talking about people who are losing blood by the MINUTE.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the worst person I&#39;ve talked to in months.  I can&#39;t believe somebody would just come here and lie like that - lying about you entire career, of all things - or if not that, then lying about what you learned from it, to try to bully your way through this conversation.  What kind of sick freak are you?</p>

<p>in the context of a conversation about a mass shooting.

All I can conclude is that you slipped and said something really stupid, exposing your dumb lying self.</p>

<p>So, we have apparently no more than 2-3 ambulances at the school, and I think about 5-6 a thousand feet up the road, at a fire station - boxed in by a shitload of cars, unable to move to a hospital.  That&#39;s just about all the available evidence, besides the, ahem, &quot;witness testimonies&quot;,  and police reports, that this shooting even happened.  Oh, and that there was a car with a weapon in it, the removal of which is documented on video.  Apparently there is absolutely zero evidence of actual victims of this crime, or of the identity of the shooter, or really anything of any importance.  At least not that I&#39;ve seen, in 30+ hours of trawling through this case.  Maybe the man in camouflage pants shot some children, for all anyone knows.  </p>

<p>And wouldn&#39;t those ambulances  already be at the fire station anyway?   I guess you would know!</p>

The medical examiner looked like he had a little to drink, and was laughing off what he had been told to say.  None of their reactions looked plausible at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know nothing about what happened off screen there or what was said.  Is it odd?  Sure.</p>

<p>He definitely put on a face for the cameras there but to jump from that to the fact he is a paid actor pretending to be the parent of a kid murdered is a huge leap.  It&#39;s more likely that someone told him something that made him smile then when he went to get on camera he realized how shitty that would look.  An actor wouldn&#39;t be getting into character on screen like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, we can only make assumptions about what happened off-screen by what we saw on-screen.  Which was, whether or not you want to admit it, a bunch of horrible actors.</p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t even mention that guy who supposedly found the 6 children at his driveway - supposedly with a huge pile of stuffed animals - who then took the children in at the request of a bus driver, didn&#39;t report it to anyone, and kept them for a few hours.  Gene something.  The video said he was a member of the Screen Actors Guild, and he definitely seemed to be totally full of shit.   This guy:</p>

<p>Looks like he couldn&#39;t pin down his character one bit.</p>

<p>Every one of these actors broke out smiling at completely inappropriate times.  You know, you can&#39;t really explain what got documented just by saying, &quot;oh, they were putting on a face for the cameras&quot;.  Yeah, they were, but it wasn&#39;t their emotions.  They had to put on faces and try to control their body language, to lie about what they were feeling.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s what all those videos show.  You disagree?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me just get this clear.  You honestly believe that a bunch of actors were hired by the government to pretend to be part of a school shooting for the media and not a single one has come forward to get more famous/attention/an actual acting career?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They wouldn&#39;t have acted in the fake scenario if they didn&#39;t think the government could control the resulting press.  </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that why the police chief threatened prosecution against anybody talking about alternative theories to what the police said happened?  Either way, that seems like a pretty radical claim  by the police that our free speech/free press rights will no longer be respected.  Pretty unprecedented, for that matter. </p>

<p>So yes, that&#39;s  the most likely conclusion, by a long shot, since there isn&#39;t a snowball&#39;s chance in hell that any of those people had actually lost a child, or even seen dead children (like the supposed &#39;medical examiner&#39; had).  They made a really shitty judgment, that people wouldn&#39;t uncover their piss-poor acting, and exposed their scam all over national TV.  </p>

<p>I guess you just won&#39;t admit it.  That just makes me think something is seriously wrong with you - that you come here every day just to try to bury what&#39;s obviously true.  I see you in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> every single day, but you never admit you&#39;re wrong about anything, no matter how high the facts are stacked against you!  Talk about bad acting.</p>

<p>See this is a common problem with your beliefs.  You&#39;re taking any little rumour you find and running with it like its the truth.  The police said no such thing at all.  They said pretending to be a victim, or associated with the crime would be investigated.  It was edited down to a fun sized soundbite for people like you to devour without questions.  You have the right to free speech but you can still be arrested for things you say if they break the law.  Threats for example.   Impersonation is another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parker and the others clearly had not lost children - you would say the same thing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of their reactions you can say they definitely didn&#39;t lose children?  Given how closely you&#39;ve investigated other parts of it you&#39;ll have to excuse me for doubting your investigative nature.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not impartial at all.  I am fully on the side that believes there was a real shooting and it wasn&#39;t a conspiracy.  I think I&#39;ve made that pretty obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the video of the police chief threatening prosecution against people spreading alternative theories on social media.   Not a &quot;rumor&quot;.  </p>

<p>I investigated it as much as I could, which has probably been 20-30 hours.  I&#39;ve put in no small effort to get to the bottom of what happened.  I think that&#39;s part of being a responsible person - determining the facts for yourself when there&#39;s doubt, instead of gullibly following the crowd.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think an honest person could investigate it and say that it really happened as we were told.    So you can imagine what that makes me think of you.</p>

<p>I say they didn&#39;t lose children because they did not act like human beings act when they&#39;ve actually lost children.  Plain and simple.  They acted like they were cheery about how much money they were going to get, and then struggling to get back into character for the cameras.  And I sure as shit know how to tell the difference.</p>

<p>One thing that&#39;s becoming somewhat of a concern and that is <strong>misinformation is being posted on social media sites.</strong></p>

<p>There has been misinformation coming from people posing as the shooter in this case, posing using other I.D.s, mimicking this crime and crime scene and criminal activity that took place in this community. <strong>There&#39;s been some things and somewhat of a threatening manner.</strong></p>

<p>It is important to note that we have discussed <strong>with federal authorities that these, these issues are crimes, they will be investigated statewide and federally, and prosecution will take place when people perpetrating this information are identified.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Again, all information relative to this case is coming from these microphones and any information coming from other sources cannot be confirmed and, in many cases, it has been found as inaccurate.</strong></p>

<p>So, I simply, that&#39;s the newest twist today that we want to make sure that&#39;s perfectly clear that social media web sites that contain information relative to this case are not being posted by the Connecticut State Police, are not being posted by the Newtown police, are not being posted by any authorities in this case.</p>

<p><strong>So, any of that information and people that are that are putting that information up there in any manner all right, can be construed as a violation of state or federal law will be prosecuted, will be investigated and prosecuted.</strong> Questions, I can take a few, understanding that we still are active in this case, OK.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, it&#39;s probably because of the PR campaign he went on after the shooting.  Having his children (some people think it was his supposedly dead daughter!) taking photographs with the President...in a room that looks alarming like it has some kind of <em>timpani</em> (you know, those huge drums that school bands have) in it...hey, you don&#39;t know where they took that photo, did you?   I tell you, if my daughter died, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be up for a photo op with Obama the drone-bomber,  I don&#39;t think my kids would be, either.  And that girl sure seemed happy in that picture.  Not a care in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the man in the woods?   </p>

<p>Central to proving any conspiracy theory is finding co-conspirators, which in this case means multiple shooters. Theorists have seized on helicopter footage of a man getting chased by police through the woods behind the school as evidence there was more than one shooter. Who is this man?</p>

<p>Answer:  It was Chris Manfredonia, the father of a 6-year-old who attends the school. He was on his way to the school to make gingerbread houses with first-graders when he heard gunfire and smelled sulfur, so he ran.</p>

<p>source: <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/14/nation/la-na-1215-newtown-school-shooting-20121215">http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/14/nation/la-na-1215-newtown-school-shooting-20121215</a></p>

<p>But there was another man in the woods (maybe): Eyewitnesses saw a second man in the woods wearing camouflage pants and a dark jacket, and said that he may have been armed. Must be a second shooter.</p>

<p>Answer: Actually, he was, according to the Newtown Bee, “an off-duty tactical squad police officer from another town” who heard the gunfire.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The question doesn&#39;t remain it&#39;s been answered extensively.  We even know his name.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there was a simple explanation to it I don&#39;t understand why it hasn&#39;t been addressed to rule that person out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was addressed then the media moved on because it wasn&#39;t interesting anymore.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They did cover it extensively.  But people that want to believe will ignore any explanation that doesn&#39;t fit the narrative in their mind.  </p>

<p>The people claiming this is a conspiracy are often claiming the media is involved in a big cover up.  Yet using the medias own reports as evidence that it was faked.  Seems silly to me.  If they were involved in a coverup surely they would warn the people in charge early on and get the story right.</p>

<p>The fact is in major events like this everyone wants to be the first to break a piece of news so every rumor they hear gets pushed out to the news.  Since stuff is moving so fast though they rarely feel the need to retract statements.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the overt and immediate attempt to connect all of these attacks to gun control should be transparent enough. The issue with people killing other people has never been about which weapon they used, but why they wanted to kill in the first place. It is about behavior. A killer is going to kill regardless of what kind of weapon they have access to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am sorry but you are missing the point of why this is a gun control issue. The point is that Yes, people will kill if they want to kill, however they can kill many more people a lot more efficiently with a civilian version of a military assault rifle than they can with a knife or their bare hands, so of course it raises questions about gun control. </p>

<p>Also. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A killer is going to kill regardless of what kind of weapon they have access to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have already stated in you argument that you cannot accept that someone would just go crazy and then kill others seemingly without motive, I would say this statement contradicts that by implying that someone can be predisposed to kill and will do it regardless, simply because it is in their nature. I would call that a crazy person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me get this straight.  </p>

<p>Obama wants to take your guns...because...umm....ok, he just does. What a dick!</p>

<p>So, Obama&#39;s like, we need gun laws, but no one will go for it unless we have a mass shooting. </p>

<p>Even though these seem to happen every year or two, Obama&#39;s all like, f that noise, I don&#39;t have time for a real mass shooting, let&#39;s make one up. Come up with a plan, FBI...Go!</p>

<p>The plan Obama settles on is something like this:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Send subliminal Manchurian candidate super-psycho cue to secret agent Lanza.  (Also send a second shooter?  Or maybe a team of agents dressed as nuns?)  Anyway, </p></li>
<li><p>bring in the cast of crisis actors we auditioned last week--these guys are ace!  ...yeah one of them kind of is cocky and likes to laugh, but I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be good enough.  </p></li>
<li><p>Threaten/bribe all the 100&#39;s of reporters and their crews.  Nah, don&#39;t bother with Alex Jones, that guy is legit, no way we get him to go along with...DAMN Alex Jones! Obama: It&#39;s one thing to slaughter 23 children, but no way am I willing to risk going after AJ....Bloomberg&#39;s mafia can scare him or something.  </p></li>
<li><p>Threaten/bribe/silence the families, friends, neighbors, co-workers, extended families, acquaintances of the 23 families.  And the state police, the Newtown Police, the FBI...the state medical examiner and office. </p></li>
<li><p>Get Anderson Cooper and Piers Morgan on the phone...stat!  This won&#39;t work without them!</p></li>
<li><p>Pay shills on Internet forums to debunk  and ridicule the Internet theorists who may trip us up!</p></li>
<li><p>Roll out the assault weapon ban to GOP controlled Congress.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Damn that clever Obama!</p>

<p>Either that or you&#39;re right, they use &quot;camping&quot; as a cover up to hide the fact that they&#39;re planning a world government to enslave every man woman and child on earth, in between their sadomasochistic rituals and human sacrifice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi - it&#39;s the crystal bell-like voice of the Englishwoman again - so ready yourselves for some pearls! If it&#39;s true that real-life events and The News are being organized by the authorities, it&#39;s likely that the conspiracy theories are being organised too. (Is that the meaning of &#39;shill&#39;?) The people directing us are the finest psychologists that governments can find! First they put out slogans such as &#39;Battle for Hearts and Minds&#39;, which they hope the lower orders will swallow (though anyone slightly raised  from an amoeba will realise that this is as effective as using an antibiotic against a virus), then they get on to the advanced stuff. I don&#39;t know what it is, but planting over-the-top conspiracy theories, controlling random people via the internet, then egging on a potential nutter to do some shooting, which they augment, could be routes. There are likely to be very few people &#39;in the know&#39; (actually at first I thought it might be many), because of course, such operations function on a &#39;need to know&#39; basis. So Real Life becomes Hollywood! &#39;If we create the Bad Guys, we can defeat them in the end!&#39; Forums such as this are like when, in &#39;The Truman Show&#39;, the character sails out to sea and touches the sky - which he finds to be made of cardboard. Is there any hope for a better world? Yes, because Top Dog Mind-Control Man will eventually want to spend time with his wife and kids. Although it&#39;s a very rewarding job, isn&#39;t it? All that power! However, one day he or she will look at a plant growing from the earth, and realise that that is more rewarding. Or events will change to another dynamic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me like this is the case with any sort of traumatic event, not only in mainstream US media, but worldwide.  The government preys on fear to exact their agenda.  Fear is powerful, because it is a strong emotion.  When something bad like this happens, the government can now say &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, we can PROTECT you!  Don&#39;t worry, we got this!  Don&#39;t worry, we have your best interests at heart, and we can implement CONTROLS to &quot;PROTECT&quot; you.&quot;  The sad thing is that because so many people are brainwashed by their individual country&#39;s mainstream media, they are conditioned to believe what they hear.  This is not a matter of whether or not the &quot;conspiracy&quot; regarding this event is true or not, but it has everything to do with the general populations inability to think critically.  We live in an age where we are conditioned from birth to do what we are told, think how we are told, and believe what we are told.  Only a small portion of the population actually takes the time to question things like this, yet they are labeled as crazies, lunatics, and conspiracy theorists.  Whether Sandy Hook was staged, planned, or used to fulfill an agenda seems to me to be irrelevant.  I think the real thing we need to be paying attention to and questioning is our own ability to think for ourselves.  We need to be questioning why we are subjecting ourselves to these various methods of social control.  I&#39;m sorry for sounding sort of off topic, but this is all I could think about when reading this post.  &lt;3 you reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, 10 million people watch a Youtube video and that somehow legitimises its information?</p>

<p>This post is slanted as all hell.  It&#39;s about the term &quot;official story&quot; - it&#39;s meaningless. There is no official story - there exists a large amount of erroneous reporting and an inordinate amount of YouTube sleuthery.  There are a ton of people who are coming at this with the certainty that a conspiracy is at play. Yet that strong belief is based on &quot;evidence&quot; that is flimsy as fuck.</p>

<p>MSM is not some monolithic entity, and the&quot;official story&quot; is simply the collected published reports of scores of individual companies and individuals. Any Redditor should understand that social media are now the vanguards in any fast-breaking story like this, and MSM is looking to us to provide the details - look at the initial reports of Ryan Lanza being the shooter for a perfect example of how MSM reported false information.</p>

<p>Now before people start in with the fucking &quot;sheeple&quot; comments, let me say this - I question everything any government says, and I know full well that governments conduct psychological operations, and occasionally disappear people, and occasionally abuse citizens, from MK Ultra, to Bradley Manning, to 9-11, to feeding radioactive materials to mentally handicapped children. Which is why this idiotic fucking story pisses me off so much - it dilutes inquiry and injures the community&#39;s ability to raise questions about REAL conspiracy.</p>

<p>As to the theory being espoused here - let me be frank - the idea of crisis actors portraying the parents of dead children is utterly retarded. Those 20 murdered children all had parents. Those parents would never remain silent at the death of their kids. Any &#39;actors&#39; would never be able to play another role in their entire careers - what actor would take that job? It simply doesn&#39;t make sense - and anyone who has worked with professional actors will tell you the same thing. What do these &quot;crisis actors&quot; do for a living once their entire country believes them to be parents from Newtown, CT!?  The idea is absurd.</p>

<p>Some here will label me a shill or a dupe - but the truth is, this fucking sub used to mean something and used to be about information. The Newtown Shooting Conspiracy is an attempt to derail the CT community and I, for one, will speak against it wherever possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of hate for the conspiracy theorists in the Sandy Hook case. So much so that Anderson Cooper (or whoever writes the stuff on the teleprompter) thought it necessary to address the issue. I&#39;ve also seen thousands upon thousands of comments, on Reddit, news sites, etc., from people hating on the conspiracy theorists. My point: In this particular case, the anti-conspiracy folks have been very vocal. Why wouldn&#39;t they also be vocal on the Youtube video? Surely if these people feel so strongly that Sandy Hook is not fishy at all, to the point where they write long winded comments on websites about it, they&#39;d be more than willing to thumbs-down a Youtube video?</p>

<p>Even Tom Sawyer knows a coffin can be empty.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, my point is that a funeral home can make a corpse look &quot;natural&quot; -- and every parent of a &#39;dead&#39; child could have had the chance to mourn their child properly and have a last contact with them.  Pictures to prove they are dead?  Pictures of the bloody crime scene, taken raw, in the act - and /that/ is what the parents were shown, &quot;photos of their facial features&quot; -- supposedly to assuage their grief they were spared seeing their child lying cold and dead.  Such pictures would be far more ghastly to view (if they existed, that is) than would a body that had been &quot;prepared&quot; for viewing by a funeral home.  Thus my point that no parent had to be denied the chance to &quot;say goodbye&quot; (and yes, it does give closure, don&#39;t be a nincompoop).  Yet, they ALL were forbidden to see their child.</p>

<p>A real parent would demand to see their child.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s your alternative explanation?</p>

<p>If only I had one.  Maybe they were kidnapped for government experimentation, forever to be locked up in a detention center (they do have swing sets).  Maybe they never existed.  THERE WERE NO DEAD BODIES.  NONE.  Nada.  Zilch.</p>

<p>NONE of those parents were <em>grieving</em>.  </p>

<p>Sandy Hoax rots to high heaven.  Exactly why the government has created such a sloppy psy op escapes me.  Obviously, the common man has noticed the details, therefore, they were meant to.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I mean. I want a full explanation of what happened. Who planned this? Why? When? Where? How did they pull it off? What proof do you have?</p>

<p>You have NONE. NONE AT ALL. You&#39;re inferring from some fucking photos of people crying that they&#39;re actors, and then concluding that the government set it all up. This is the most intellectually dishonest bullshit I have ever seen. You should be ashamed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is a blanket term used to label anyone who disagrees with what their told, right?  To the point where you don&#39;t even have to consider yourself a conspiracy theorist to have this label attached to you.  As long as you disagree, you will be called a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>The problem with that is people such as yourself have attached meaning to this arbitrary label.</p>

<p>To say that all people who disagree are also delusional, paranoid and insensitive is a bit of a loose connection once you take away the bias of a loaded title.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I were attempting to be both open-minded as well as skeptical, I&#39;d suggest that there may be more than just two possibilities to a given scenario. </p>

<p>However, if I were attempted to divide and conquer a thread, I&#39;d vehemently insist there are &quot;only two&quot; possibilities and demand that everyone pick which &quot;side&quot; they&#39;re on. Heck, I might also throw a little insult at the end just to make things interesting. </p>

<p>To quote my post from earlier today:</p>

<p>...maybe we can let go of the &quot;all or nothing&quot; mentality that seems to pervade the debates.</p>

<p>For example, just because there are so many fishy things surrounding Sandy Hook doesn&#39;t automatically mean that the deaths weren&#39;t real or that the people involved were actors. (Personally, I&#39;m not assuming one way or the other, either side has yet to be proven.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, let&#39;s assume for a moment that the deaths are all real and the people were not actors... let&#39;s entertain this possibility. (Any critically thinking person will not rule out the possibility simply because it doesn&#39;t emotionally appeal to them.) Even if this is truly the case, which it may be, it does not automatically mean that the whole thing wasn&#39;t set up. Real blood sacrifice is always more effective than fake any day... so ruling out the most seemingly popular theories of fake deaths and actors does not, in any way, disprove that it could be something more nefarious at work.</p>

<p>If the deaths are real and the people aren&#39;t actors, claiming otherwise would be the perfect way to discredit all the conspiracy theories. These could just be the straw men while the real issue isn&#39;t fake deaths or actors... rather it is some of the other information that points to another heavily coordinated operation (to push whatever agenda).</p>

<p>One supposed fact or another doesn&#39;t make the whole debate go away... but it could easily distract from what we probably ought to be paying more attention to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t address the essential issue, which is the logical conclusion of the point you&#39;re trying to make. If you accept the explanation that it may be a coordinated operation, that implies that not only are there coordinators, but that many people played along with those coordinators&#39; wills. This raises more than a few questions. Who are these people? How did they plan this? How did they enforce it? Who played along and who was tricked? Did the media know it was fake? If not, why are you using media information as sources?</p>

<p>You have no answers to these. You have no evidence. The possibility can only be thrown out. There is only one conclusion we can make at this point, which is that this is NOT a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it raises questions. Raising questions is exactly what this subreddit, and the quest for truth, is all about. That, and attempting to find the answers to those questions of course.</p>

<p>If there isn&#39;t solid evidence one way or the other, the &quot;only&quot; conclusion we can make is that <em>we cannot currently make a valid conclusion</em>. Hence the &quot;theory&quot; part of the conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting it wasn&#39;t a shooting by a single, deranged man. It very well could have been. Regardless of which story is true, that particular version of the story needs facts to back it up just like any other version. I don&#39;t see much of that right now, just a lot of confusion about what&#39;s fact and what&#39;s not. Strangers getting emotional on the internet does not constitute fact, no matter what story you choose to believe.</p>

<p>If I could provide you with legitimate facts to back up <em>any</em> story, assuming it was the true one, I would.

<p>Rationalize this: asserting that one of the currently circulating possible explanations &quot;must&quot; be the right one... well I&#39;m sorry, but your absolutist terms give you away as the one in this thread with the confirmation bias.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice strawman buddy... You&#39;re under the impression that the general public would be keen enough to spot a plan in action. I refuted that point by pointing out the ignorance of the general public. See where I&#39;m going with this? You don&#39;t need to trick people that are too stupid to realize what the &quot;shadowy government&quot; is doing in the first place. The general public has been willingly voting away rights and privileges since the days of Woodrow Wilson...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s neither, my friend.  It&#39;s a principle. Besides, a scientific theory and a scientific law are basically synonyms. For something to be considered a &quot;theory&quot; it is essentially completely true, the difference is that a law is usually a single, simple thing, whereas a theory covers a broad range of science. For example, the theory of heliocentrism contains many scientific laws supporting it.</p>

<p>Also, speaking on the concept of Occam&#39;s Razor, it is a simple logical principle that simply states that any explanation that requires no untestable or unproven assumptions is preferable to one that includes some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge list of questions NOT included in that video that need to be answered. There is also absolutely no real way to go about proving any of the debunking to be correct independently. The government has a history of killing, sponsoring terror, running guns and killing people all over the world. I am no too terribly trusting of anything they do. I certainly want to believe they wouldn&#39;t do this but the truth is we will never know, and I wouldn&#39;t put it past them. Aurora Colorado certainly seems strange. I think that one was probably staged as well as Sikh temple shooting. Saying that this one couldn&#39;t have been is like saying the government blew up building 7 but had nothing to do with the other 2 towers. I remain skeptical of both sides when it comes to Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting it wasn&#39;t a shooting by a single, deranged man. It very well could have been. Regardless of which story is true, that particular version of the story needs facts to back it up just like any other version. I don&#39;t see much of that right now, just a lot of confusion about what&#39;s fact and what&#39;s not.

<p>Isn&#39;t that why the police chief threatened prosecution against anybody talking about alternative theories to what the police said happened?  Either way, that seems like a pretty radical claim  by the police that our free speech/free press rights will no longer be respected.  Pretty unprecedented, for that matter. </p>

<p>Conspiracy Theorist:  We are open to discussion and speculation until <em>indisputable</em> evidence is revealed.</p>

<p>Narrow minded people such as myself are the people considering the facts while people like you waste your time thinking of contrived theories solidified by your own paranoia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Alex Jones? This guy&#39;s listed on the Southern Poverty Law center&#39;s website.. </p>

<p>And I am well aware of what this video contains. You can jazz it up all you want but Its just a hedonistic retreat for the rich and powerful that invokes pseudo-pagan bullshit mysticism to give itself a sense of heritage and self-importance.  </p>

<p>Either that or you&#39;re right, they use &quot;camping&quot; as a cover up to hide the fact that they&#39;re planning a world government to enslave every man woman and child on earth, in between their sadomasochistic rituals and human sacrifice. </p>

<p>But Occam&#39;s razor must not apply to them.. I guess they&#39;re too rich or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you link me to an article that says most times they don&#39;t use lights and sirens to transport, to prove me wrong when I said that most times they don&#39;t use lights and sirens to transport?</p>

<p>This is how far you&#39;ll go to avoid admitting that your preconceived notion of a giant secret conspiracy might possibly be wrong in one tiny aspect.  It&#39;s pathetic, really.</p>
