        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it should be evident to most members of r/conspiracy who are not paid shills that the post regarding Mr. Rosen&#39;s harassment is actually a reaction even a counter attack to the pressure they are under.  For those who are just arriving, off the top of my head here are a coupe of reasons.</p>

<h1>1  They fucked up waaaay too much in Newtown.  Things have not gone as well as they hoped and they are on damage control now.  They must go beyond discrediting people.  &quot;CHANGE TACTICS&quot;</h1>

<h1>2  Regular people who are paying attention outside of reddit and the internet are worried enough about losing an important right &amp; freedom, that they are actively looking to sort out what happened.  I don&#39;t think all these people are &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.  I think some are regular people who just had their alarms rung by a potential tyrannical Gov&#39;t rearing its head.  That woke some people up right there.</h1>

<h1>3  Some of the posts by &quot;people&quot; in the thread regarding Gene are saying its all pretty much r/conspiracy who is to blame.  That kind of a insinuation is telling.  The internet is a powerful thing.  That is why they are here.  They NEED to quash us here and now because our conduit of information is and can be huge.  Lamestream media is going own the shitter and they need control of this bitch sooner rather than later.</h1>

<p>I want to ask everyone to ramp up the effort if possible.  Think about the little things (and big things!) like doing simple searches on google and youtube and where ever else for things like Sandy Hook.  I searched youtube not long ago and the auto suggestion was &quot;sandy Hook conspiracy&quot;.  I was surprised!  The next day it would no longer auto fill like it did but I did all those searches anyway.</p>

<p>Post more comments, talk about it and keep up the pressure.  Talk about the stuff you&#39;ve ALREADY talked about.  Keep mentioning the obvious things, don&#39;t let them be forgotten down that memory hole.</p>

<p>They mean to silence us, obviously.  Our reaction MUST be to push back even harder but making sure to distance ourselves from the &quot;crazies&quot; that post tripe from pedophilia to standard character attacks.  Call them out!  Post that they don&#39;t speak for you on others.  If you&#39;re OK with your current overlords no need to post your opinion here.</p>

<p>One last thing, I did find a video on youtube regarding Sandy Hook that talked about all these satanic symbols being flashed by the victims in pictures (Robbie Parker family) and such, missing fingers and how all the photo&#39;s are shopped to put in devil signs and crap like that.  Please, if you share the opinion as I do that such stuff is intended to paint us as the standard conspiracy theorists, then please post comments there or thumbs down those vids or whatever you feel.  My vote is they are intended to discredit as is their SOP.</p>

<p>Push on fellow human beings.  Once more unto the breach......it will be worth it when you finally see them crash and burn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh fuck you OP.</p>

<p>Tell me. Tell me in PLAIN WORDS. What happened in Newtown? Was it a conspiracy? Why? Who arranged it? I want a list of all names involved. When? Why? When will they act upon their next step? What is their plan?</p>

<p>I expect written documents as proof, no less.</p>

<p>Otherwise, shut the fuck up you miserable narcissistic fuck.</p>

<p>Edit: Right, I&#39;ll expand.</p>

<p>We have a scenario. 23 kids murdered in a school shooting. We have two explanations.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A mentally disturbed man shot all of the children for no discernible reason in a mass shooting. In the frenzy, some early reporting mistakes were made. Some photos of people involved resemble, coincidentally, previous photos. There is footage of a man WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS SLAUGHTERED MERE HOURS BEFORE hyperventilating on camera, before forcing a smile to keep himself from sobbing on national fucking TV.</p></li>
<li><p>A mysterious government whom you cannot name, through methods you cannot name, staged the whole thing for reasons you cannot name. Photos were badly photoshopped and released that prove it to be a conspiracy. The man was an actor prepping for a part.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, employ Occam&#39;s Razor. Which makes the fewest assumptions?</p>

<p>Yeah. It&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>Why not take the kids to the fire station but decide that this guys front lawn is a better place..  How did he get the victims list two days before anyone else?  Was it a Man with a harsh voice or a lady bus driver or now its two people?  where is her bus then we can see the crime scene as they were locking it down?  Did he take the kids to the fire house or did their parents come and pick them up from him?  </p>

<p>Where is the video footage of this kid blowing through the front door all loaded with gear?   No need to show any of the killings but him enterting would be nice..  Why was there a tactical officer from another town caught in the woods with a gun?</p>

<p>Maybe because of the situation they were in the person with the kids panicked. Why don&#39;t you hop in your fucking time machine and tell everyone how they should behave in that incredibly stressful situation.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s because according to the article that mentions the tactical officer <a href="http://newtownbee.com/News/2012-12-27__14-58-27/Police%20Union%20Seeks%20Funding%20For%20Trauma%20Treatment">read it here</a> they only had 45 members on their department and this guy was trying to help out.</p>

<p><del>As for all of your other points why don&#39;t you go track down the information and tell us what happened?</del> Nevermind you don&#39;t want to do that. You are content to take mistakes in reporting from a very confused and stressful situation and extrapolate them into some bullshit that confirms your worldview.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not roflcopter making all the sandyhook conspiracy nuts look like dumbasses. Sorry, but roflcopter is right. It doesn&#39;t make sense. I mean, has the event been twisted and used to push the anti gun agenda? Yup. But was it staged or setup? No, why bother? Why take the risk? With the mental health system what it is in the USA, it was only a matter of time before some whacko had one twinkie too many and went rambo on a school. All they had to do was sit back and wait. No conspiracy. Just... opportunism. If that. I&#39;m not even certain the government really cares about the guns, I think it&#39;s just the media whipping up a frenzy while the legislators run amok trying to slap a band aid onto a dislocated shoulder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing that kills me about all this. We&#39;re now wasting time arguing over guns, both sides are digging in and making great big hay sandwiches out of the issue, which will ultimately end in more or less the same stalemate it&#39;s ended in every other time the subject has come up in recent memory. All of which is an irritatingly convenient way to distract ourselves from the glaringly obvious fact that the state of our nation&#39;s mental health care could most charitably be described as shitful, and that if Adam Lanza had gotten the treatment he needed, none of us would have ever heard of him and 20-some people would still be alive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s frustrating, the lengths to which people will seemingly go to avoid addressing real-world problems.</p>

I&#39;m asking because I was, and I recall well how the neo-conservative movement said the exact same thing that you&#39;re saying now in the early years of that decade when Congress took up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act">Brady Law</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban">Assault Weapons Ban</a> in the aftermath of Ruby Ridge and the Branch Davidian fiasco in Waco.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert—both laws passed, yet 2nd Amendmageddon completely failed to happen. Wasn&#39;t even a near miss. So, in light how completely wrong it&#39;s been in the past, I can&#39;t really give much credence to that argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it is. Or, it might seem so to those who don&#39;t understand it. Occam&#39;s Razor is the scientific method condensed into one idea, that any explanation for a phenomenon that explains all of the known evidence and makes the fewest assumptions is probably right. That&#39;s it. It is powerful, powerful enough to discredit an idea in almost seconds. To those who don&#39;t understand the scientific method it may seem like cheating, but it simply isn&#39;t.</p>

Normally, dead children and in particular denying that something horrible happened causing that child to die when that child has clearly died in a brutal manner is an off limits sort of thing.

<p>Meanwhile the common number for jewish holocaust deaths is ~6 million, which is completely inline with the other casualty numbers. Claiming that they aren&#39;t worth mentioning in comparison to your completely false information is shady at best.
Are you purposely distorting facts? I certainly hope you arent, because if so it appears that you are on a disinformation campaign to discredit anyone that doesn&#39;t agree with your narrative. Exactly what is your motive here, is some one putting you up to this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I am convinced based upon what I have found as fact and observation, that this was staged. My brain immediately assumed then, that there are no dead children, because who would kill 20 innocent children in a plot to further a political and financial agenda in an open manner. If the children ARE deceased, I am ..... I dont even know what to say. I have no doubts that this was orchestrated, so to keep my sanity I need to believe the children were ushered away, unharmed, to live their lives elsewhere. If families sacrified their children- slaughtered them- there is no cause that can justify that obviously, and then this was an act created, literally, but pure evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do i need to link the posts and comments for you? Atom did in a response to my comment, in a very round about and noon sensical way. Inkwellian did also. By staying the lack of &quot;grieving parents&quot; as evidence for a conspiracy he is in effect implying that there are no dead children or that the parents don&#39;t give a fuck. I think it&#39;s really hard to judge anothers grief especially in a situation like this. I have seen plenty of people who i consider to be sufficiently distressed and or medicated in relation to this situation. Detecting &quot;level of grief&quot; is highly subjective, don&#39;t you think? I for one detect a high level of paranoia and lack of critical thinking when i read these sandy hook threads on r/conspiracy, but many disagree. It&#39;s an opinion, not a fact and therefore not something you should use when deciding whether or not 20 children are actually dead or imaginary dead.</p>

All of it could be faked. There, no I&#39;m just as insane as you. Of course they aren&#39;t releasing photos of the dead children or any video to the public. How transposing would that be to that community? You know the media would play that shit over and over and it would be all over the internet, forcing those people to relive this horrid event every single day.

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is REALLY late for his post, but some of the kids has open casket funerals. 
How many family and friends for each separate child? And they ALL lied and kept a secret for this long? How many living children had friends or siblings that were killed? Not one toddler says &quot;that&#39;s not ______&quot; at the funeral. Not one child who is an &quot;actor&quot; ever mentions that their brother/sister/whoever didn&#39;t die? Or weren&#39;t real? I have never met a child or adult who could keep that big of a secret for that long without slipping up. 
Faking one death with anyone knowing is near impossible. The only time it&#39;s remotely successful is if no one has any clue. But to fake 26, with an entire school, 26 separate families, an entire town, all the first responders? To have that many people involved and no one slips a secret, blabs to a friend, sells a tip to the press? These people haven&#39;t disappeared. They haven&#39;t moved or died. How long could you hold up the pretence that your child or sibling or best friend was slaughtered? If you were related to one of the staff whose death was faked, how long could you go along with everyone considering them a hero if you knew they were cowards faking a national tragedy for money so the scumbag government could push a gun ban?
There are too many people involved for it to be faked. And anyone who denies those lives were lost are worse than the government they hate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha! I was down voted 10 times for asking &quot;who are the people down voting you for asking questions?&quot; Shills everywhere, how i know it&#39;s shills, people in this sub don&#39;t get down voted when they have a sincere question. Oh,but when the fact gets pointed out that people are getting down voted for asking questions,they click that little arrow going down as fast as they sold out for a paycheck to spread lies. So I have to say, getting down voted doesn&#39;t bother me. Karma? Like really I&#39;m not shooting for Karma in a conspiracy sub. I&#39;m here to ask questions. What bothers me is the fact that there are people out here trying to keep us quite,keep us from asking questions,or when we do,labeling us as &quot;crazies.&quot; It&#39;s a sham. So to all the shills out there I&#39;ll leave you with these final words. Suck My Left Nut and then go kiss your mom. May you rot in Hades or whatever horrible afterlife scenario you believe in. </p>

<p>Things that make you go &quot;Hmmm&quot;.</p>

<p>I will take all your suggestions with a grain of salt.  Take care out there good Sir.</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> Also, did you guys see that video that was posted about Sandy Hook?  How many views did that have again?  Oh yeah, even if it is stuck......it was at around 7 million hits.  Take a look around and ask yourself if you&#39;re in the majority.  You just awoke a fuck load of people who want to keep their guns, or maybe you didn&#39;t I don&#39;t know I&#39;m just a crazy CONSPIRACY THEORIST.  <em>/EDIT</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the above have a practical, useful, non-destructive purpose. Accidents happen with everything. Even the guns I&#39;ve mentioned (rifles etc.) have peaceful uses, such as hunting and sportshooting.</p>

<p>Assault rifles have one purpose - kill people in quick succesion at range. Why any law-abiding American would need to own one of these is beyond me. This whole conspiracy thing about Sandy Hook is because you are threatened - because the stupidity of the ease at which Americans can get the guns to kill scores of people has been laid bare. Now your only hope is to try to sell the massacre as a deliberate false-flag as a precursor to improved gun control. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the NRA was behind this whole disinformation campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost all of your figures are way off, you need to check your facts. The only one that is close is for the soviets.
Estimated casualty (civilian and military) figures for entirety of WW2 for each of your listed countries:<br/>
Germany - 6.6 -8.6 Million<br/>
Japan - 2.6 - 3.1 Million<br/>
Russian - ~23 million  </p>

<p>Meanwhile the common number for jewish holocaust deaths is ~6 million, which is completely inline with the other casualty numbers. Claiming that they aren&#39;t worth mentioning in comparison to your completely false information is shady at best.
Are you purposely distorting facts? I certainly hope you arent, because if so it appears that you are on a disinformation campaign to discredit anyone that doesn&#39;t agree with your narrative. Exactly what is your motive here, is some one putting you up to this? </p>
