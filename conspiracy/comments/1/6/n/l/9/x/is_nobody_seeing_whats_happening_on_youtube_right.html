    <div class="md"><p>I think the public is just fed the fuck up and tired of all the lies.</p>

<p>The media lies to us daily about everything, politicians lie through their teeth on the campaign trail, the bankers lie cheat and steal while destroying our futures. </p>

<p>And no one is EVER held accountable.</p>

<p>Our society has zero trust left in it. Trust is earned and lost. And the government, the media, the corporations - they have fucked us long and hard enough, that no one trusts any of them anymore. This society - the United States - simply cannot survive as it is.</p>

<p>Theres a storm coming to this country. A reckoning. Its brewing right now. And those who think they can lie, cheat, steal and get away with anything while destroying the public&#39;s freedoms and future - they&#39;re going to find that when this storm gets here, there is going to be hell to pay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy fuck really? Damn this is awesome.  People are waking up this is amazingly awesome. Hopefully the internet is the end of corruption. If this is really working out well then we are making a huge breakthrough. This feels almost fishy though... there are a few holes in this story so why did it pick up so fast? Too many good points? </p>

<p>on guard I say. Look at this though, one day before obama makes his announcement. Maybe he will get the shit boo&#39;d out of him.</p>

<p>Yay!</p>

<p>I find it that the story isn&#39;t as shocking anymore, and that people are noticing is more shocking than the implications.</p>

<p>they are trying to integrate their services in what seems like a reasonable fashion</p>

<p>youtube has long been full of the worst discourse on the internet - much of that is due to the anonymity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I concur.  Not sinister, just weird timing.  The account I can&#39;t comment with is my primary account which has  30+ videos of my own spanning the last eight years.  It&#39;s an old, well-established account.  Plus, the name my g+ account was under was a perfectly reasonable pseudonym.  Just a regular first and last name that happened not to be mine. So, if it&#39;s a merging of accounts, why is youtube telling me there&#39;s something wrong with my name?

    <div class="md"><p>edit: nurse identification addressed below. Great work on the downvotes guys, keep em coming! Get more downvotes and maybe it will all be true. </p>

<p>This video is false. It uses false information which can be debunked with a little google searching. It actually took longer to watch the video than disprove everything. </p>

<p>The first ten minutes of the video are refuted by the simple retraction concerning the Shotgun in the trunk. He argued the gun is an AR-15 and therefore the interview with the medical examiner is grounds to claim something is fishy. The medical examiner said an an assault rifle was used in all the killings.</p>

<p>He- Falsely claims- the rifle is in the car and therefore the shooting is now fair play for a conspiracy. But it is in fact the shotgun in the trunk and the Rifle was with adam and he used it in the murders. </p>

<p>The story checks out. </p>

<p>Facebook pages- The facebook status updates in the video credit the creation of the Emilie parker facebook Page to Alan Pathero and Brian Shultz - Not the Parker family, anyone who can read sees that in the video. Therefore any misinformation presented on the Facebook page is not due to lies or deceit but simple misunderstanding by Alan and Brian when trying to pass along as much info as possible. </p>

<p>The creation date of any website is not grounds for a conspiracy. I took this screenshot yesterday. <a href="http://imgur.com/lfTdi">http://imgur.com/lfTdi</a> using google&#39;s  time restricted search. It shows that the Sandyhookhoax.com website returns a date of December 13th 2012. The day before the shooting</p>

<p>Conspiraception? No, Google index returns the date on pages depending on when it was indexed. You can do this with many, many different websites. This is not undeniable evidence for anything, it&#39;s evidence for nothing sinister at all. </p>

<p>Emilie Park with President Obama. Emilie&#39;s photo in the video is from 2010. Her sister is 2 years younger than her. 2010+ 2 = 2012 making Emilie&#39;s sister the same age as she was in her old photo. </p>

<p>Emilie&#39;s sister happens to be wearing a hand- me-down dress which is also worn by Emilie- in the photo from 2010. Emilie&#39;s recent photos from 2012 and good quality pictures of her sister show undoubtly that Emilie is in fact NOT in the photo with Obama because she was murdered. *<em>Emilie&#39;s sister is in the photo. *</em></p>

<p>The reaction of parents while grieving is very natural and because people have never experience such a loss they don&#39;t know that and assume it&#39;s sinister. </p>

<p>Robbie Parker is not laughing about his daughter&#39;s death. The Mcdonnell family is not laughing about their daughter&#39;s death. All of them are expressing their love for their daughters. </p>

<p>If you watch the interview of the mcdonnell family they speak the whole time about how they loved and cherished their daughter, how much she loved her school and her friends and how they&#39;re all playing together in heaven. </p>

<p>Robbie parker in all his interviews makes similar facial expressions to the slo-mo&#39;d &quot;laugh&quot; which the narrator claims he is mocking us with. In fact he is hyper ventilating and trying not to break down crying. </p>

<p>I could go on but you can check my post history for a minute by minute breakdown of the video in which I refute every single point he has made whether it was malicious, ignorant or just stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See what you did there? Overhelming evidence tearing apart his theories again and again and again. What is your response? You missed this piece so I&#39;&#39;m going to keep believing it&#39;s all true. You are looking for any detail to support your ideas rather than looking at the evidence as a whole and asking what the logical conclusion is. Even if I couldn&#39;t address that fact- WHICH I WILL in a moment- this would be 99/100 pieces of the conspiracy debunked and yet you believed the 1 piece.</p>

<p>You assume &quot;I can&#39;t address the fact that they fucked up the whole adam lanza&#39;s mother being a teacher&quot; - &quot;They&quot; being the government? Instead of asking what happened with Mrs. Lanza. </p>

<p>You realize the media made hundreds of mistakes in collecting information- the whole conspiracy is based on the media&#39;s &quot;story&quot; falling apart under closer examination. Instead of realizing that when reporters are hunting for the story of the year they rush, put out false info and make mistakes, you assume they were all part of a massive conspiracy and then they made mistakes while telling a storytale. </p>

<p>In reality the nurse was mistaken. Adam Lanza&#39;s mother was not involved with the school, she was not a teacher or a substitute. It was a case of mistaken identity. The nurse in other videos claims she never even saw the shooters face, only his boots when he came into her office while she hid. She assumed she remember the kid and was likely begged for an interview.</p>

<p>&quot;Neighbor Gina McDade said Nancy Lanza was a &quot;stay-at-home mom&quot; and not a teacher or part-time employee of Sandy Hook Elementary, as some media reports stated.
Nancy Lanza had earlier worked in finance in Boston and Connecticut, said a friend who knew her well but who didn&#39;t want her name published. Nancy Lanza had retired or was on a break from her career, but she was not a teacher, the friend said.</p>

<p>Here is sally D. Cox on the data base for registered Nurses in CT- the video said she wasn&#39;t on any database. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;second shooter&quot; is either Chris Manfredonia, a father of one of the children (his wife works with the school). He was approaching the school when he heard gun shoots and attempted to enter the school around the back to find his daughter. He was arrested on site and later cleared entirely.</p>

<p>Whether or not this was the man in the woods is not clear. There is highly publicized footage and news about a POSSIBLE (conditional, as in we don&#39;t know) second shooter- why do people think they are trying to cover this up now? It&#39;s plastered all over the place but then they decided to take it back because it&#39;s a government operative? There was a massive man hunt just based on the possibility there was a second shooter. Multiple other people were arrested all over the place. One was a person dressed as a nun in a purple van for ffs. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard a few different things, the guy was taking a piss, walking his dog etc. Honestly. I live in an urban area and I walk around in camo pants- I don&#39;t even hunt, they&#39;re just super comfortable. </p>

<p>Either way the entire area around the school is residential. Houses are right next to where the man was found. It&#39;s perfectly plausible he had nothing to do with the shootings at all- which is why he was cleared after being arrested in front of everyone and we haven&#39;t heard anything more from him.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t found a single source that suggests he was off -duty Swat. The only Swat involvement was that SWAT searched his house. </p>

<p>Adam&#39;s car was listed under Christopher Rodia as operator. He is a criminal, but a small time criminal on trial for theft of- <em>drumroll</em> Leaf blowers. 
If you didn&#39;t know, this is a common crime because landscaping equipment is expensive and not linked by paperwork to any owner. </p>

<p>It&#39;s likely Adam lanza purchased the car illegally (not filing the paperwork) or he might have even stole the car. Either way this is not ground for suspicion, it&#39;s more like an interesting quirk but has many completely plausible and very likely explanations. Unlike a conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>If your next question is about Ryan Lanza&#39;s drivers license- He likely stole it to buy alcohol at some point (he was still only 20). I know a lot of people who use their older siblings drivers licenses to get into bars and such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they waste the effort turning off features on various random accounts instead of just removing the video?</p>

<p>Does that not seem silly to you?  &quot;We at Youtube who are part of a conspiracy at this school(somehow) need to stop the truth from getting out...we could remove the video or we could fuck with commenters by removing random features from their accounts.  The second is thousands of times more resource intensive though and doesn&#39;t actually stop the message...yes that sounds like what we will do&quot;</p>

<p>Do you people even think these things through anymore?</p>
