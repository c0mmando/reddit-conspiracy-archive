<p>No, some videotapes were released to other law enforcement agencies 6 months later and the media got hold of them.

<p>&quot;On Saturday, Carver, the medical examiner, said that all the victims at the school were shot with a rifle, at least some of them up close, and that all were apparently shot more than once. All six adults killed at the school were women. Of the 20 children, eight were boys and 12 were girls.
Asked how many bullets were fired, Carver said, &quot;I&#39;m lucky if I can tell you how many I found.&quot;</p>

<p>Gene Rosen mentions that one of the kids said they saw the shooter, and he had a big gun and a little gun. (two pistols and one action rifle in the school, most killed by the AR) This is in contradiction with the later report that there was four pistols in the building, with no AR. The &quot;big gun and little gun&quot; claim is in acordance with the medical examiners claim, because they were both parts of the original plan, to have Lanza bring the AR into the school. When Lanza entered the school, he did so without the AR, and maybe even without the pistols. They could have been placed by his body, or they may have never existed. There should be proof on the security camera footage, but that&#39;s not being released.</p>

<p>And put that together with the fact that someone who supposedly played video games, had no social record in three years. He could have been under mind control, or already dead. There have been no recent pictures, so why should anyone believe that he existed as mainstream media says he did?</p>

<p>But I guess your just one of those people who doesn&#39;t need photographic evidence, and doesn&#39;t question why that evidence is being detained. </p>

<p>The &quot;proof&quot; that Osama was behind 9/11 has yet to be released, as well as the photos of a dead Osama, proving that we killed a man for crimes he didn&#39;t commit. It&#39;s not hard to lie about media situations, especially when you own the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t see him killing one of his parents, and then driving past multiple schools, to shoot up a first grade class. The media claimed that Nancy Lanza volunteered there, and that Adam was in an altercation with staff members the day before, giving credit to the motive they created for Adam. (fear of being commited to a mental facility) </p>

<p>Then the media claims that the connections between Adam and Nancy and the school, were mere reporting mistakes, and everyone just accepted it as a reporting mistake.</p>

<p>I think Nancy Lanza was killed for another reason, another agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so if you disbelieve the information available then you should have a reason why, is it just a gut feeling? It shouldn&#39;t be based off media reports because they are just spitting out shit as they are told it by whoever.</p>

<p>I mean look at Chris Rodia. This was some guy who was pulled over for speeding around the same time the shooting was initially being investigated. The police were radioing in his plates to do a check and the news reporters heard his name on the scanner, they reported him as a second shooter. Websites sprung up all over detailing his name, address, criminal record, family, girlfriend etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so easy for the news to pick up anything and push it to air because people are going to watch the station that provides the most updates and exclusive &quot;facts&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s perfectly fine, actually it&#39;s wonderful for people to be skeptical. But if you&#39;re only being skeptical so you can heep a hate on for the shady government trying to take your guns, you&#39;re doing it wrong. Not saying you&#39;re doing that but be skeptical to find the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously when governments carry out secret operations there isn&#39;t enough evidence to &quot;see&quot; it for what it really is. You just have to watch all the grieving family interviews, and all of the newscasts reporting conflicting minor and major details, and keep in mind that the US government does have the power to pull this off.</p>

<p>That alone is enough for me to logically think that this is just another planned event, in preparation for the future. The government doesn&#39;t play it by ear. They have agendas and plans that span decades or longer. If you don&#39;t believe in a pending economic collapse, then maybe you should read up on what they do on wall street.</p>

<p>If you think that not asking questions makes you a good citizen, then ask yourself why they don&#39;t want people asking questions. </p>
