       Our society has been been engineered to create people into a paradigm  where we think, act, and behave in a certain manner. From the moment you're born you become indoctrinated by your family, education, mass media, television, advertising, politics, nationalism, and etc. We're constantly being fed these external projections of how we should perceive this reality. Consequently, people accept these views and conform into cookie cutter personas/lives that lead to a great worker society with no critical thinking. To steer the majority of the human population into an accepted belief that they're disempowered, divided, and untrustworthy  of one another. This couldn't be further from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're born into this world you are born as all possibility. Pure consciousness. It's only as you progress through life where we pick up the mental chains that hold us back from becoming our full potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't emphasize this enough, we need to move away from old ways of thinking where we see ourselves separate from one another. If you look at the Earth from space you don't see nations, cultures, languages, politics, or religions. You see one planet with millions of species existing together. Doesn't matter where you're from, what language you speak, or how you look - everyone has hopes, dreams, aspirations, feels love, sadness, joy, and happiness. We're all human beings from the same tribe.

       What I'm trying to figure out is who specifically is in charge? Is it the Rockefellers? Rothchilds? Who the hell is it specifically and do we have any proof? How are they able to bring together so many different groups and get them to play ball? How exactly are they enforcing to comply?

       There are many factions at work here.. and several have begun in-fighting for their 'chosen/preferred' outcome.  Follow the money, as it is the tool that is used to enslave as well as religion.  Research the first gathering at the Council of Nicaea after the extermination and assimilation of the gnostic doctrines (which-ever books suited their new 'myth' and excluded the ones that revealed any real truths).  The Gnostics believed that the Judaic deity was actually the arch-villain (Demiurge) of the universe~ a counterfeit mimic of a more authentic source and that this material world was a matrix-prison... to what end?  Perhaps we are a source of sustenance (fear?) as is portrayed in The Matrix or many other science fiction movies.

       To peer through the looking glass will undoubtedly bring one down a road through insanity and back again.. our story is the greatest never told.

       Conspiracy Theorists would rather believe it was a simple battle of good vs evil. Throw in smug self-satisfaction over 'hidden knowledge' that they are uncovering, and the belief that they are fighting for the common good by spewing this nonsense, and you get the reason people follow conspiracy theories.

       There's too much evidence for it. There's no possible way to get into it in a reddit comment. I highly recommend you look into things on your own. You'll connect dots and see patterns. There's a grand plan in the works. To what end is unclear but the signs are there.

       That's a great question. There's a lot of hypothesis as to who's in charge and one of them is the Rothschild. Personally, I feel it goes much larger than that. The banking cartels, consumerism,  religions, politics, corporate oligopolies and other institutions are mere tools to keep us in debt/slavery, divided, and disempowered. They are the things we can see. The real masters hide in the shadows and are never seen. But the only reason why they exist is because we comply with the system that has been orchestrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose the way to break the bonds of such slavery is to become informed, ask questions, and don't take no for an answer. Speak the truth and don't care what other people think. Remember, "it takes nothing to join the crowd, but everything to stand alone."

       Its designed to brick wall you at that point. Ultimately it doesn't matter who is at the top, though I doubt its anyone we've heard of. Keep the struggle in mind, the puzzle can overwhelm but its meant to make you feel confused and helpless

But a core is the banking elite, namely the Rothschilds in Europe, and the elite 13 families, who collectively own the banks and the banks control the corporations. The wealthy control politics through money, threats, and other methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Goals? My guess is power through wealth, corruption, and ability to control militaries; population reduction, which also assists control; and police states, which make it easy to dominate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key goal is control by the few of the many, maybe a future return to global oligarchy and total destruction of genuine democracy, while maintaining the pretense of democracy.

       On one hand it's been said that, for the most part, the uber rich that live in a different world never really need to meet behind closed doors to achieve their goals.  They know what each other wants, they went to the same schools, same universities, same country clubs and churches.  They work towards each other's mutual interests and that's about as far as most of it goes, but greed/profit are powerful motivators (damn morality and ethics).  Capitalism destroys communities, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, you have things like
       <a href="http://www.alecexposed.org/wiki/ALEC_Exposed">
        ALEC
       </a>
       operating in the world, consolidating the corporatocracy's intentions and will.  You have million dollar think tanks, private meetings such as the Bilderberg group or the Bohemian Grove's annual gatherings and much more.  What's above that, I do not know, but all roads lead to Rome.  The Vatican, for nearly the last 1,500 years, has had it's grasp on everything.  The spread of Christianity, Judiasm and Islam (part of the plan) are the main proponents of evil in the world.  Their salvationist thinking leads way for being able to 'wash away your sins' at the last moment on your death bed, being forgiven and accepted into 'heaven'.  This is not acceptable behavior, socially or even personally (in regards to responsibility for one's actions).  These corporate CEO's and corrupt politicians have a free run at the world's resources while being able to call upon their mighty tabula rasa at the last moment...

       Satan.  These various groups at the focal point of the conspiracy theories aren't in touch with one another, carrying out some mass cooperative plan to enslave the earth with the induction of the new world order. It only appears this way on the outside because these men live lives they believe will bring them personal gain, no matter what it costs their fellow man.  They are slaves themselves, pawns in the hands of a very ancient and evil force.

       I would think it to be a cabal of the worlds most powerful and wealthy. All working together with a common goal of power and domination over the common man. As to who the individuals are? The Rockefellers and Rothchilds certainly among them.
      </p>
      <p>
       My big question is, are all the powerful people working together? Or are there other ultra powerful men unified and vying for power doing battle with each other through their cliques?

These leaders produced The Assisi Declarations, theological statements showing the spiritual relationship between their followers and nature that triggered a growth in the engagement of those religions with conservation around the world.[12]  One Religion.

       This is how I've come to see it as well. Keep the people dumbed down through education and 9-5 jobs. The smart ones have a chance of becoming rich and perhaps joining the elites club. The ones not so easily corrupted will speak out about what really goes on. I really think it just comes down to human nature. We want to dominate the weaker ones, and that is exactly what happens. I'm sure they all subscribe to survival of the fittest and I imagine they think that they're humanity evolved or something of that sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       If humanity could somehow rid itself of its selfishness and aggression, maybe then the psychopaths that bludgeon their way to power wouldn't be allowed to carry on. If everyone became genuinely concerned for their fellow man and did every thing they could to stop war, maybe then could a new society emerge. One that doesn't prey on the weak minded and under privileged.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the elites have a plan under way. Something thats gonna rid the world of their so called "undesirables" and mass resource consumers. If I were to speculate I would think it to be a mass pandemic of some sort, perhaps paired with an societal/economic collapse. One or the other, maybe both. They realize that controlling the mass growing population is no simple task and measures must be taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder however, is there simply one power group? Or multiple, all vying for power and domination. Maybe its like an East vs. West power struggle? I'll have to look into that more. The banks seem to be on top though.

       Oh, the horror of education! Who needs literacy when we can all be illiterare fuckwads who can't even read what you just typed. Oh, the horror of 9 - 5 jobs, the lowest average working hours in history for the average highest wage in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity is kinda brain-hardwired to want shit. That is the motivation for most actions people have ever taken. The best people in the world are those that learn that wanting shit doesn't neccicarily mean taking shit. In case you hadn't realized, the majority of people are busy doing everything they can do to stop wars, the majority do understand that breaking shit solves nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now we go onto a paragraph of 'elite' (whomever that is supposed to be) blaming. Sorry, but these people would have nothing to gain from exterminating their own employees or customers. Seriously, what the fuck makes you think anyone in the world would consider this a good idea?!?! I guess you conspiracy theorists can't whip yourselves into a massive circlejerk over something unless it involves unnamed

       Education and schooling are much different my friend. The US had a higher literacy rate before mass government schooling. And your simply wrong, the majority of people are certainly not "doing everything they can do to stop wars". I have no idea how you came to that conclusion. As for who the elite are, take a look at the members of groups such as Bilderberg, Trilateral commission, Council on foreign relations, etc.. Those people are the ones in power. And your last statement really hits home as to how ignorant you seem to be. It doesn't even make sense.

       Literacy rate in the US is 99%. Loads of countries are in that region between 99% and 100% because, as should be obvious, almost everyone is literate and the few that are not are often mentally disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
       There wasn't higher literacy before mass government schooling. It would be practically impossible to increase literacy rate beyond its current levels.

       And the proof that most people are against warfare? Look at history. When was the last World war. 1945? Have there been only 2 global wars, not really. There have been repeated global scale warfare on a cycle of about every 30 years since the late 1700's, and now, that has ended. As far as peace goes, we are in a golden age.

       I concur. I've tried psychedelics a few times and it brings about an awareness that allows you to disseminate through layers of deception. I'd like to try DMT aka the spirit molecule.

       No. Hallucinogens, and indeed, most drugs, make you temporarily very stupid. Alcohol being the worst, as it quite literally slows and prevents signaling between nerves in your brain.

       I never even get just say no classes or commercials, living in the UK. I am explaining the mechanism through which hallucinogenics and other drugs work, which is by fucking with the brain. Since the brain is, rather obviously, adapted to run optimally, drugs either reduce its function (Weed and alcohol) or increase its function beyond the safe limits set by the body (which also makes you stupid, but in a different way).
      </p>
      <p>
       THC, the active compound in weed, functions by altering and disrupting transmitter release in nerve cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ethanol also disrupts transmission of information in the CNS, specifically by bonding to receptors.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not going to have an amazing logical and philosophical experience by making yourself temporarily stupid. Go ahead and  use them for recreation as freely as you want, but don't pretend it makes you a genius.

       guys life is not a movie. the world isnt divided into good and evil, and no one is actively trying to "control the world"
the elite have one principle in mind. to make profits. to make the best possible environment for buisiness to grow. they believe governments first priority is to make buisiness easier t grow. protecting citizens rights is secondary.

       It does not matter if there is a single organization responsible or many, the fact of the matter is that current leadership is sub par and obviously corrupt.  The agenda isn't for the people and by the people. That much is obvious.

       perhaps you do not understand the question...is currency
      </p>
      <p>
       1, a device that is "there"....implying that it must be created, so beyond the cost of creating it, once created it is there to "use" or go out and get.....or
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Is it a product, one that someone is creating and then charging a profit for the creation process....
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       you see, one is there to use....the other is being sold...

       well, both obviously but youd have to narrow your question down a bit to get a better answer. currency is of course used by people and governments, but it can also be considered a product because it is being "sold" in a way by the us to governments around the world to buy oil.

       at it's point of creation...who makes it, and are "they" making money making money?....or are "they" just charging "you" what it cost to create it....as in everyone pays the same amount to pay for the printing and creating of currency....?
      </p>
      <p>
       is your currency, at its point of creation...meaning one moment there was no money and then the next there was...a product.....or at it's moment of creation is it a device?

       the fuck man ill humor you and answer the parts i can understand but im not gonna play this game anymore just make your point.
the federal reserve makes money. the chairmen of the federal reserve and other central banks "make money"(as in profits), but thats a bit of an understatement. they control the money supply. that type of control gives them a huge amount of power.  the second part of your question would demand i delve into the nature of money, and its relation to debt and fractional reserve and the us mint and all that. i am still not sure how to answer your question.what would differentiate, in your question a product from a device? what is the nature of a device?
      </p>
      <p>
       also make your point.

       I really like your post OP, it doesn't get spoken of very often. I'm going to add my 2 cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       We truly are our own worse enemy. we're an animal that seeks control over our own species using deceptive manipulation. 
I've come to the conclusion that its our primitive side that is having control over us. Our natural feelings of greed, self preservation, survival and the willingness to dominate others is part of our human nature. If you look at our closest relative, the chimp.. they work in similar ways. The chimps are more primitive in their way of defending their territory and ensuring the alpha male in each family keeps it together. They tear each other apart with their bare hands while we do it with guns and our sophisticated technology (ie. nuclear bombs, drones, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I firmly believe that there is a handful of families that happen to figure out how to gain for themselves and make it so everyone else is less fortunate using the economy as its main weapon. To prevent other human beings from living to their full potential. To protect their investments and to protect themselves. We are a highly competitive species. These families have just simply done everything they could to eliminate competition by having control over ones environment.

      <ol>
       <li>
        Lord Edmond Rothschild of London and Jacob H. Schiff of New York City, two of the Elders of Zion, got Theodor Herzl (of Austria) to arrange for the World Zionist Congress at Basel, Switzerland; 197 delegates met there and laid out a plan of World Conquest with plans for a World Government. Herzl, founder of Zionism, in opening the meeting, raised his right hand and repeated an ancient oath of the Talmudists:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its cunning." Herzl also said at this meeting: "We are one nation. We are neither American nor Russian Jews, but only Jews!" He also said: 'With a few exceptions that do not figure at all, the entire press of the world is in our hands."
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dr. Mandelstam said on August 29 at the opening of the Zionist Congress of 1897: "The Jews will use all their influence and power to prevent the rise and prosperity of other nations and are resolved to adhere to their historic hopes; i.e., to the conquest of world power." LE TEMPS, Paris, September 3,1897.

         The Zionist Organization of America was organized in 1897 with Richard Gottheil of Columbia University as its first president, and Rabbi Stephen Wise as the first secretary. Branches for women (Hadassah), and children (Young Judea) were soon organized. ZIONIST NETWORK, p. 32.

       I am speaking of Benjamin Freedman's 1961 Speech at the Willard Hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Freedman, born in 1890, was a successful Jewish businessman of New York City who was at one time the principal owner of the Woodbury Soap Company.
       <strong>
        He broke with organized Jewry after the Judeo-Communist victory of 1945,
       </strong>
       and spent the remainder of his life and the great preponderance of his considerable fortune, at least 2.5 million dollars, exposing the Jewish tyranny which has enveloped the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Freedman knew what he was talking about because he had been an insider at the highest levels of Jewish organizations and Jewish machinations to gain power over our nation. Mr. Freedman was personally acquainted with Bernard Baruch, Samuel Untermyer, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Joseph Kennedy, and John F. Kennedy, and many more movers and shakers of our times.
      </p>
      <p>
       This speech was given before a patriotic audience in 1961 at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Conde McGinley's patriotic newspaper of that time, Common Sense.  Though in some minor ways this wide-ranging and extemporaneous speech has become dated, Mr. Freedman's essential message to us -- his warning to the West -- is more urgent than ever before.

       I've found that anytime you get somebody to whip out the "antisemitism" card things are getting far too close to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Freedman was a great man who was trying to educate the western world about the inherent evils of organized Zionism...at his own (very significant, for the time) expense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, he ultimately failed, though that doesn't make his message any less relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       To those of you who hate on all Jews...please give Mr.  Freedman's speech a listen. There are great numbers of us that know, and condemn, what has been going on in "our" name, trust me.

       First of all, congratulations for connecting the dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, we probably need a cultural revolution to get out of the mindset that keeps us penned into accepting all the lies and distortions we're fed. Once people are elevated, we can move to ejecting the corrupted criminals who dominate Congress, and the definitely corrupt two-headed political party that serves the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing we can do at a personal level is to talk up the issues and create dissatisfaction in minds - but not doing this in a fanatical way, just a common sense way,  Make people aware that the system is rotten and the candidates we are served only succeed if they toady to the power structure.  We need many independent candidates running for office, who can replace the sociopaths the parties have installed.

       I absolutely agree. The only way we'll elevate ourselves is by starting on a grass roots level. Get people thinking by having some serious discussions. The type of questions that get people defensive since they don't want to believe what your saying.

       Yes, I do. Go show me this person who not only believes everything mainstream (an impossibility considering that, with some issues, there is no mainstream view as no view has over 50% popularity) but also truly believes everything they hear on TV (Which would also be impossible because no matter where you look there will always be conflicting evidence).

       People don't move as blind herds following a single leader. They move as water does across the land, falling as raindrops until they find a lake or ocean to settle in, and in doing so, help carve the path for others to follow. Some raindrops are larger than others and carve bigger paths to their lake or ocean, but ultimately, no single raindrop can carve a canyon on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have reasons for following their paths. They do not simply follow a path because they are ordered to by society. In case you were not aware, almost all humans are conscious. Almost all humans can defend their viewpoint under their own arguments. They are not simply blind brainwashed lumps. As soon as you respond to criticism with "Brainwashed" or "Sheeple", you are just pretending your opponents argument doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equating people to sheep is a brutal and ultimately fallacious tactic. You dehumanize them by doing so.

       A sheeple is someone who believes the MSM without going out and finding out the facts for themselves by looking at multiple sources. Yes, there are people like that; the group of individuals who consume conservative media like Fox News and most talk radio and believe it all to be true are sheeple. It is not meant to be dehumanizing, it is simply a descriptor because they act in a way that is typical of sheep: they follow the thought leaders that they identify with; they do not lead themselves. You can deny their existence but it doesn't change the fact that there are millions of people who don't care enough to research their own opinions and instead take the word of others as fact.

       Those in power understand that thoughts create reality. They engineer society into cookie cutter molds, using YOUR OWN MIND POWER to keep you conformed.

       To break this, we need to join our thoughts in positivity, believing, knowing and visualizing the future where our paradigm succeeds and triumphs. We need to constantly visualize all the sheeple waking up, becoming illuminated, and joining us in a renaissance.

       The biggest piece of missinformation you will pickup on r/conspiracy is that Satan is at the heart of all conspiracies. Satan does not exist but evil most certainly does. Misdirecting attention to a mythical entity instead of identifying the real (mostly corporate) sources of evil plagueing our planet only serves the evil.

       Exactly the bullshit I was referring to. Follow the money to find who is manipulating events for profit and you will find the perpetrators. Looking for ancient societies and mystical entities are purposeful distractions for those seeking truth. Profiteers who run the US are the most evil entities on earth at the present time. As long as TV and bullshit distracts Americans from caring enough to even vote or even care that there is no one to vote for, We are all (unless you are well placed in one of the few multinational corporations that have a choke hold on the planet) headed toward fewer civil rights and more tyranny.

       All these eyes everywhere freak me out!  As does nightmarish images in mainstream news stuff.  But I think they are just increasing to acclimatize us to less freakish stuff.  Like minorities etc.     I think then all this eyes and ghoul stuff is evil.  That there is a conspiracy that has nothing to do with heart breaking people with disffigurements.  First of all i think it's an attempt to acclimatize people with blacks and other lunatics like gypos and muslim and jew fundies.  It is evil.  But only in the annoying advertisement jingle sense of evil.  I have never seen satan mentioned in r/conspiracy.  We've got enough problems on our plate without starting to get sectarian.  Any satanist who also has is more than welcome to come and vent with us too as far as I am concerned.  Just no republicrat   christian materialist atheist trolls! That's my preference at least.

       Plus it is you and your 'scientific' breeding fantasies and opposition to segregation who are the heinous criminals not the bankers.

      <p>
       There are lots of things that make a man a wealthy man.  Anyone who would trash them all to grub for worthless debt bankrupt money instead is a sociopath.  It isn't money you are after it's destroying wealth to the level of blacks and their government.

What does matter is 5% of Eurasians brains not being human being but neanderthal.  That a 700,000 years gap separation between Human Beings and Eurasians.

       Because anti-racist scum allow them to become the worlds problems.      As they are designed to.  Might as well ask why women who don't want women to vote have to do with the worlds problems.  Or why the only people anti-racisms violence culture  sets up are scum like blacks and the other poor whites and their corruption and pandemonium as a valid norm.  Only the handlers of scum need anti-racism.  no one else. Everyone ele needs or benefits from the opposite.

       Crap.  The Bible is detail it is the semitic (racist) / anti-semitic (anti-racist) or jewish (racist) / Anti-Jewish (anti-racist, or Zionist (racist) / Anti-zionist (anti-racist) polarization that matters.  I realize that if you are an American  fundamentalist christian materialist atheist even (or especially) if you are one in denial you will just continue  to blather on and on meaninglessly to no purpose about your joy of being whipped but there you are.  Your crap about 'science

       and all that is just the same -  cover for your evil and hate and joy of getting whipped as a good Anti-Racist, penitent Anti-Semite etc etc and on an on. Physically you are just a sickening repulsive excuse of a human being .

       Edit:  I mean by this that only semites should be Anti-Semitic but not so I can brand those who are branded as 'Anti-semitic' though they are not semites as Anti-Semites but just so I can encourage them not to get drawn in and branded as what they really really aren't but to focus on useful polarities like black/anti-black or white/anti-white or American/anti-American etc.  Only a polarity that they themselves really really are and have an authority and heartfelt concern about.  Not allow themselves to get

       You grub for money as all lefties do.  But there are other sources of wealth, other forms of wealth that the money grubbers see as their primary enemy even before corporations etc.  These sources of justice free from the money grubbers and their 'humanity' (they two always go together) are a warning sign to anyone with any sense.

       I think a lot of people want to believe something like this as it's an excuse for why the feel unhappy with their life, or something to blame when they haven't achieved what they believed they would by a certain point in their life.  The belief that there are ruling families/people controlling every aspect of the world is no different than a belief in god and with just as much evidence.  It's just a different god.  Comforting but certainly untrue.

       And that reality is being infringed upon. Would you really say that in face of genocides? In face of natives being overwhelmed, slaughtered, and enslaved throughout the course of history? To say you are dissatisfied with life after being enslaved... is completely reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then finding out there's a very real reason why things are so awful...There's a very real suppression. And if not, then I would have to say globally humans are fucking retarded beyond hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look around, there are humans who exist that will kill you for material desires. To think that none would have ever organized through hundreds and thousands of years is fucking ridiculous.

       Oh, slavery still exists. It has always been a part of human life that has yet to be abolished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the rubber industry, and the aprox. 10 million killed in the congo in less than twenty years. It was found out after the camera was invented. Then it had to be stopped, after the world became aware of what  is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moral of the story is people will commit genocides for money, as long as they can get away with it.

       I don't see what your reply has to do with anything.  Yes of course 'bad' people exist. The believe that they have joined forces to control the world secretly is silly though.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are certainly individuals that lead different aspects of the world but they are usually there due to a desire for power and status.  Something they cannot get by sharing the lead with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book Superclass goes into this a bit.  You should read it.  There was also a fun TV series in the UK a few years ago called something like "The millionaire mind" where they put a group of self made millionaires up against a group of middle class workers in a series of challenges to see what made them different.  When it came to group/team work the millionaires always failed because they were all leaders and had difficulty giving that up.

       Any pragmatic sinister mind will realize this. Which makes me wonder why anyone would ever use a drone strike for assassination.  It causes way too much of a commotion.  Is it a plea for help? Or did they really become fucking stupid? I can't tell this world is so insane.

       To get that control under this plan you would have to give up power and by definition not be able to do whatever you want.  If your desire is absolute power and freedom working within a collective will not give you that which is why it's a joke to believe people looking for those goals would be part of a collective in any way but a destructive one for the collective.

       While I agree to some degree you really don't have full control over your own life. You can influence things as best you can but there will always be something you want to do or have but it won't be your decision no matter how water-tight your plan is.

       Why? Because I started an alt because I knew you guys would try to silence me with downvotes. Quite simple really. Evidently, my prediction was correct. Already on -7. Keep trying to silence me

       Yeah, I can use the same argument as you. Its a stupid argument. As soon as someone makes relevant points, just call them a shill, a sheeple, or brainwashed and you don't have to respond with something logical. Just pretend their opinion doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly anyone who disagrees with you is just being paid to do that right? Nobody could possibly ever have a legitimate reason to disagree with you? Wow, this subreddit is worse than I was led to believe.

       You made no points in your comment to me, you just said nobody's woken up and we're living in a dream. That doesn't seem very valid to me at all. And I'm led to believe that you're a shill because of your lack of account age and comments. Also every single subreddit silences what they don't believe in. It's the nature of reddit. Look at r/politics, you think a conservative or anti Obama post will reach the top? No, because they're not popular opinions within that subreddit.
