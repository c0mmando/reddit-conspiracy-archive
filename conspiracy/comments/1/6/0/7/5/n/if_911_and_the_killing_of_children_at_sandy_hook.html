       I'd like to know what you think the people in the USA would do if there is irrefutable evidence that the government is killing children and innocent people.  Would you riot?  Would you just accept it?  What do you think would happen if there was proof?

       All of that was carefully pre-fabricated emotional therapy for soldiers returning from World War II. Think about that; The American Dream, from before it's inception, is a direct by-product of

       Nah, the American Dream predates WWII.  The American Dream arose from the fact that poor Europeans were able to come here and get rich.  Of course, for the first part of our history, the American Dream was only available if you were white and male.  And, the system was certainly never perfect.  There's always been corrupt assholes try to fuck over the people.  But, there was a grain of truth to it.  For a time, America was one of the few places you could go to escape the tyranny found under most other governments, and experience the prosperity that arises from that relative freedom.

       Such proof already exists for 9/11.  The American people have chosen to ignore it in order to continue with their paradigm.  There will be no riots.  We are a complacent herd for the most part.  Point the way to the slaughterhouse and watch us walk in willingly.

       It's so weird how people refuse to objectively analyze the evidence surrounding 9/11. They just won't. And they get really agitated when others do. I guess I just never loved my government enough to get so caught up in defending its innocence.

       I know people who can't see 3D stereograms either - but they are willing to agree that there is a picture.  I think you'll find those that refuse to think about sept. 11 attacks critically are suffering a sort of stockholm syndrome.   best to have them agree that people in power are capable of great evil.   bring up the manhattan project when they seem incredulous about how many people were in on it.  also bring up the milgram experiment and compartmentalization.  it's not so hard to fathom one bite at a time.  all at once is very daunting to the fragile mind of the official narrative believer.

       I wish this was incorrect - and a portion of me still wants to very much argue this point - but when 3,000

       that the government was anywhere from grossly duplicitous to completely
       <em>

       I cannot say I disagree with this, unfortunately.  It seems that a lot DOES indeed have to come tumbling down before the people wake up.  Problem is that once things get passed a certain point of collapse, it might all be too late to actually do something about it without a LOT of people perishing in the process.

       How so?  I don't understand this at all.  Not saying it's not the case, I just don't see.  Freedom equates to having nothing left to loose?  Again, I don't see that.  Explain if you will, please.

       I feel I understand the sentiment with which you were meaning things now, but to be without material items and little clothing - as the disciples were then and many others today still are - is not necessarily to have "nothing left to lose".

      <p>
       This is very much correct.  I think my confusion arose from the ambiguous interpretation of the words "Nothing left to lose."  It tends to have a generally negative and foreboding connotation.  The fact of the matter is, however, that it can be taken with relative literalness and referred to a circumstance under which you
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       have almost no material possessions - like the wandering Indian sages that walk about with nothing but a loin cloth and a begging bowl.  In this sense, many of these types are truly much more free than those "smothered", as you correctly described, in their material possessions.

       Proof that a proper mental and spiritual outlook can effect and improve the physical?  Our world is rife with such examples is it not?  Evidence of mind over matter?  It's everywhere really.

       We live on a planet that is not conducive to effective mind over matter existence, to be sure.  This doesn't make the two realities any less

       Actually, I'm saying I have my doubts. You are saying I'm wrong. Go to Lymenet (or any other similar site) and tell them they can pray their way back to health.  You will not be taken seriously by anyone. Also, I said nothing about prayers not being a part of getting better. Stop with the dishonesty.

       Why would I ever go there and tell them that when I'm not coming here and telling

       that?  If you think this is the only thing I mean...then, I'm sorry to say, you are wrong.  Praying might help some - and it indeed does help some - but its effectiveness really all depends upon your level of development.  Praying won't help others regardless of how much they pray.  Others, conversely, don't need to pray at all (not in the way you mean it anyway) in order to accomplish certain things.

       No.  Prayer - if you don't know how to pray - isn't all that helpful.  And you're the very one questioning the usefulness of it in the first place w/your own commentary - "Go to Lymenet (or any other similar site) and tell them they can pray their way back to health." - so why would you even make the comment you did here afterward?
      </p>
      <p>
       In one statement you mock prayer, and in the next you defend it...??

      <p>
       So then 1) pass it on.  However, if you supposedly "do" know a way, then why, again, would you make such a statement as you did above regarding Lymenet?

       Perhaps, but I haven't been speaking from any Christian perspective this whole time.

       One, it's the LITTLE things you do that count - not the big things.  The
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       powers that be don't pay attention to what you did when everyone was watching.  They pay attention to what you did when no one was.
      </p>
      <p>
       That in mind (and this is two), your inability to exercise a decent level of communication when you yourself fail to communicate something effectively and, as a result, resort to ridicule in your response speaks VERY badly of your ability to "help humanity".
      </p>
      <p>
       You should work on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       And pray for yourself.  Sounds like you need it more.

       All they care about are "jobs". Working for the empire is how many people put food on the table.

       It will
       <em>
        slowly
       </em>
       change. We will reach a critical point where the public will accept some truth (the media lies). Then more (I know why they lie). I like to reference the
       <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect">
        Hundredth monkey effect
       </a>
       . If the truth gains popularity it will become less taboo and more appealing. Once a person realizes that they are being left behind they will want to catch up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Take into consideration how long YOU have been aware. It takes time to feel somewhat normal again. We should all experience the
       <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model">
        five stages of grief
       </a>
       . With that in mind think about how long it takes for the average person to fully grasp and finally accept
       <strong>
        the truth
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: For the lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial — "I feel fine."; "This can't be happening, not to me."
Denial is usually only a temporary defense for the individual. This feeling is generally replaced with heightened awareness of possessions and individuals that will be left behind after death. Denial can be conscious or unconscious refusal to accept facts, information, or the reality of the situation. Denial is a defense mechanism and some people can become locked in this stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anger — "Why me? It's not fair!"; "How can this happen to me?"; '"Who is to blame?"
Once in the second stage, the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue. Because of anger, the person is very difficult to care for due to misplaced feelings of rage and envy. Anger can manifest itself in different ways. People can be angry with themselves, or with others, and especially those who are close to them. It is important to remain detached and nonjudgmental when dealing with a person experiencing anger from grief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bargaining — "I'll do anything for a few more years."; "I will give my life savings if..."
The third stage involves the hope that the individual can somehow postpone or delay death. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made with a higher power in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. Psychologically, the individual is saying, "I understand I will die, but if I could just do something to buy more time..." People facing less serious trauma can bargain or seek to negotiate a compromise. For example "Can we still be friends?.." when facing a break-up. Bargaining rarely provides a sustainable solution, especially if it's a matter of life or death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depression — "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?"; "I'm going to die soon so what's the point?"; "I miss my loved one, why go on?"
During the fourth stage, the dying person begins to understand the certainty of death. Because of this, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time crying and grieving. This process allows the dying person to disconnect from things of love and affection. It is not recommended to attempt to cheer up an individual who is in this stage. It is an important time for grieving that must be processed. Depression could be referred to as the dress rehearsal for the 'aftermath'. It is a kind of acceptance with emotional attachment. It's natural to feel sadness, regret, fear, and uncertainty when going through this stage. Feeling those emotions shows that the person has begun to accept the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acceptance — "It's going to be okay."; "I can't fight it, I may as well prepare for it."
In this last stage, individuals begin to come to terms with their mortality, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event. This stage varies according to the person's situation. People dying can enter this stage a long time before the people they leave behind, who must pass through their own individual stages of dealing with the grief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kübler-Ross originally applied these stages to people suffering from terminal illness. She later expanded this theoretical model to apply to any form of catastrophic personal loss (job, income, freedom). Such losses may also include significant life events such as the death of a loved one, major rejection, end of a relationship or divorce, drug addiction, incarceration, the onset of a disease or chronic illness, an infertility diagnosis, as well many tragedies and disasters.

       You're asking "what would break the shackles and force them all out of the cave" but it's already happened. There would be scape goats and regime change and a host of other theatrics, but nothing of substance would shift. What would happen if we had proof that America sold weapons to terrorists to help fund other terrorists or if we found the proof that America was involved in the drug trade or if we caught a president cheating at the national election by breaking into the oppositions headquarters. You can break the chains, for the chains are of the mind, but the majority will remain, clinging to walls of the cave that is all they have ever known.

       I think it would be a big wake up call to many people in America. Most people don't want to accept such a reality because of the ugly truth that it would entail. That the government is openly engaging in domestic terrorist operations to steer the American public into a fear based society where the Iron Fist is the law of the land. But you don't need to believe in what you propose to see that Big Brother is coming into fruition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 9/11 you've had the patriot Act, wire tapping and surveillance of american citizens, the killing of said citizens abroad with drone strikes, the militarization of the police force, FEMA as a means to control the population during a "crisis", the evaporation of middle class wealth, and etc. I dont think you need the damning truth that you speak of. If people opened their eyes and weren't so apathetic they would do something about it. However, most people are too comfortable living in their bubbles and would much rather pass the buck down to further generations. Wake up call, ain't going to happen. Shits going to hit the fan and it's going to become everyone's problem.

       This is a big damn if. If you want to believe the government did this, you will find a way. But the fact of the matter is that shit happens that you can't control, and it's best to just accept it than try to blame the government, god, or whoever. Drastic shit can happen without having some master coordinator pulling all the strings.

       Remember in
       <em>
        Animal
       </em>
       <em>
        Farm
       </em>
       when the loyal old horse was going to a "retirement home" courtesy of the pigs? When the truck arrived to pick him up, some of the sheep saw that the vehicle belonged to the knacker (the guy who slaughters horses for glue etc.) They ran to sound the alarm, to tell the other animals of this grave injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the pigs didn't raise an eyebrow. "There is an innocent explanation" they declared: "The horse retirement community's truck broke down, so the borrowed one from the knacker."
      </p>
      <p>
       And that was good enough. Any animal that persisted in such foolish conspiracy theories was labeled antisocial, paranoid, and generally detrimental to the farm.

       I don't know what you mean by "reel you back in." Maybe if you were somebody of any importance, our government may do "something" but I seriously doubt, you, me, or anybody else on this website would qualify.

       As far as 9/11 it has been confirmed. If anything the evidence portrayed should make people extremely skeptical of the official story. But people choose to do nothing because they do not like the idea of their government working against them.

       Especially since there are people who can be given all the facts about 9/11, and still deny that the government that is supposed to protect them, would ever commit such an act.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to come to terms with the truth, so they turn to denial. If our nation was full of intelligent people, who have the mental capacity to accept things as they really are, then we could move forward to perfect equality.

       But the school systems are failing, television numbs instead of provoking thought, and the only truth is on the internet, but people spend their time on

       and

       What can be done?  If r/conspiracy is correct, then sabotage is probably most effective at this point.  I think it would be too late and futile to do much now - e.g. violent resistance/protest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I liken the situation to that of the french resistance under the nazis.  Most french were unwilling to fight the occupation, while those that were did not do so overtly.

       Nothing. Every half way intelligent person knows 9/11 HAD to be an inside job. Doesnt take a genius. Hell, 98% of our population is ok with giving away its guns, rights and sovereignty just as long as they can still watch American Idol. The laws are already written that take away EVERY right a person has. Hell, Look at Vietnam. Sending all those kids to die for no reason. Americans didnt do anything then and they wont do anything now.

       The American dream is dead. I'll never be wealthy. I'll never have the health care that a millionaire has. I'll never be able to stop working and retire. I`ll never recieve the benefits that I pay into every week. I'll work till the day I die then I'll die with NOTHING. America is a big fucking lie.

       Ummm... People wouldn't care.  The only reason people care now is either 1) they're unable to resist the sensationalist media barrage which causes them to go nuts and consume news products 2) they have nothing better to do and are bored with their own lives to the extent that they will actively avoid self analysis.

       Kids die every fucking day, a lot get sold into the sex trade or slave trade.  That can arguably be worse than living a fantastic spoiled american life until one day you're randomly shot.

      <p>
       People unconsciously or consciously know that the government lies/is too powerful, whatever.  False flag is an effective strategy.  People turn a blind eye or just sit and watch, because at the end of the day were all spoiled just enough to not really care.

       IMO there is not enough evidence to conclude that the government did it. But there are so many inconsistencies with it. Government funded Crisis actors, little girl that is supposed to be dead had a pic with Obama after the shooting, coroner had a really odd and unprofessional interview, there were multiple "shooters" or at least people at the scene of the crime but the official story ignores these people completely. There is plenty of evidence to be suspicious or at the very least inquisitive but it's not being talked about and has me worried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: other things I remember. Car that they said belonged to Nancy Lanza did not and actually belonged to a criminal around that area, gun that they pulled from Adam's trunk was not an ar15 but they said it was,

       You really have to ask yourself. Who had something to gain by killing all those kids? There is really only one answer. The Federal Government. Look at the facts and how the story has changed. It changed right in front of us. Went from pistol to assault rifle to a full on assault of one of our most sacred rights. The Federal Government had EVERY THING to gain from this.
