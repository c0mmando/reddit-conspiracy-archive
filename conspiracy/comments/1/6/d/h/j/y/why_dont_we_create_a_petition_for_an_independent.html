       I highly doubt we would get an independent investigation but it shows the government and other people who may have been involved in Sandy hook that we're suspicious. It may even provoke some of the "actors" to get a bit worried.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would really send a message especially if we could get the 30,000 signatures required for a response from the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could post the petition to other websites like 4chan, 9gag, God like productions, the David Icke forums and see what kind of prominence it gets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's popular enough, some smaller news sites may write articles on it and more people might look into it and look at the facts for themselves.

       What does 'independent investigation' even mean? Separate from the government? But you'd petition the government to do it? I'm really confused.

       The government isn't necessary actually.  You just need a team of private investigators - if you prove, for instance, that even one of these people is an actor and the whole thing falls apart.  What this country needs is a independent non-profit media watchdog group that will investigate questionable and significant 'media events.'

       Ok. But then why a petition? That's my point. Why doesn't someone just investigate?

       I attempted to create a petition to investigate the roll SSRI's played in the Sandy Hook Massacre, as well as previous mass shootings.  I attempted to post this originally to politics but was met with very much cynicism.  Perhaps that has to do with the fact that over 1/2 our country is on these medications.  I have prior experience taking these meds, and I have first hand experience with Zoloft causing suicidal thoughts.  Here is the link to my petition if anyone's interested.  If someone wants to create any other relevant petition to Sandy Hook,  I would be more than glad to sign:

       See I have a big problem with the petition site.  It seems to lean towards stating that the white house and the Obama administration have authority over areas that they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        For example:
       </strong>
       Their Statement about deportation of foreign people attacking the constitution (that his first amendment right needs to be protected) is not only wrong (from supreme court ruling), but it isn't the President's place to rule on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we take the ruling of a body that has no jurisdiction on the matter we are basically giving that body jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want civilian representation on the ground floor of this investigation we need to go to the state and demand it, not the Federal Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Write state senators, protest the state house, protest the police department, but going to the White House first before even trying locally seems stupid.  If you do that and they say "No" then there is nothing stopping all other groups from saying the same.

       The problem with how our media works nowadays is that every celebrity is either dumb or considered crazy, and every academic is low profile enough to suppress. Makes any non majority group of people real easy for everyone to dismiss. You get charlie sheen questioning it and people will just assume hes back on the coke. All weve got who thinks and has some celebrity is jesse ventura and he does a show about conspiracies so him looking into it would be accepted as normal.

       Many on this sub don't want an investigation - if they did they would not down vote information that goes against their belief in what actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try posting pictures of the funerals or quotes from the parents as to what their dead kids looked like and see what happens.

       If an investigation resulted in "evidence" that agreed with the official story, then would know the investigation had been compromised. It's called checks and balances. We have all the evidence we need proving this was a false flag, the point now is to raise awareness.

       Even if there was an independent investigation, that wouldn't help, because people would accuse them of being part of the cover-up, just like with the Warren Commission and the 9/11 Commission.

       What would an investigation solve? The problem is that even if it is an "independent investigation" it could still be tainted. Also, any valid information that would come out of an investigation would likely be buried or discredited very quickly. All of the sheep out there that are already buying into the official story would also probably buy whatever excuse they come up with then too. I could be wrong, but I'm not sure how much it would help.

       Well, I suppose it could be a conspiracy without motivation between the local police, the state police, the families, the school administrators who are still alive, the other teachers, the other law enforcement and emergency personnel who showed up, the medical personnel who treated the two wounded and tried to revive two others, the state chief medical examiner and all the personnel from his office, the local funeral directors and the other morticians who came in from out of town to help.

       Since when has ANY ONE of these petitions done anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Never, that's when.

       How about a Kickstarter to fund a private investigation and to pay off people in the state government to leak true information instead?

        do not exist
