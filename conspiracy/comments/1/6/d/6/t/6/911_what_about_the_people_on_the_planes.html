        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Clearly since I am posting in this forum and frequent it often, I have my own thoughts and beliefs about 9/11. I firmly disagree with the official statements that have been put forth from our government regarding this tragedy. </p>

<p>That being said, after much research and many debates with my father, who has a background in journalism (over 10 years with the Associated Press and college degrees to back it), he has only planted one single doubt in my mind. I figured I&#39;d put this out to you all since I cannot figure it out either.</p>

<p><strong>If 3 commercial airliners didn&#39;t actually crash into WTC 1, WTC 2 and the Pentagon as the official story claims, what happened to the people on board those designated flights?</strong></p>

<p>I know there are talks about the planes being switched mid-flight, which is totally credible. But what about the actual Flight 11, Flight 175 and Flight 77 passengers? There have been interviews with people who were scheduled to be on one of those flights, but missed it at the last minute, like Seth McFarlane. </p>

<p>If the planes were switched, where did the passengers go? The only video I saw regarding that was that they were taking to &quot;other&quot; airports and &quot;debriefed&quot;. What has kept them quiet over this world-wide conspiracy? Money? Was there really not one single person among those flight rosters that had a conscience after all these years? Were they all killed in secret after the towers crashing? Or did they go in hiding? Why would the government switch out the planes just to kill the passengers later on anyway?</p>

<p>Look under &quot;Personal Life&quot;. He married a woman named &quot;Lady Booth&quot; and she looks a lot like the wife he &quot;lost&quot; on 9/11. Compare some pics and let me know what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a great question. Why would there be so much conspiracy talk about secondary planes and re-constructions on how the originals went missing?

</blockquote>

<p>Yup great point. I can&#39;t find my source right now, but about ~12 (possibly more or fewer), names appeared on more than one plane&#39;s roster. And it just so happens those were the planes that were &quot;hijacked.&quot; When they were picking names out of the hat, did someone mess up? Every plane in the world has its take off data stored...except on 9/11 those were the only planes that somehow didn&#39;t have take-off data. What. There&#39;s just a point where the sum of these coincidences becomes greater than the parts.</p>

<p>his show had been cancelled prior to that.  now he has 3 prime time shows and hosts award shows.  go figure.  not the only one who got promoted or a medal.</p>

<p>ATC interview tapes were cut up into pieces and deposited in several different garbage cans by a supervisor who later apologized for his &#39;error&#39;.  I suppose he was also promoted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still doesn&#39;t make sense. They could&#39;ve just had the prepped empty planes be the originals that take off - no need to mix up real people here at all. Just have actors load up at the gate, bus transfer to &#39;plane&#39; (just unload the actors at other side of the airport).</p>

<p>Then have the prepped plane take off (which is the empty remote controlled plane), come up with list of fake names + ID numbers and there you go. Much easier than mixing it up with real pilots and people. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this is the way it happened, but the conspiracy story is that they switched planes so they would have the ones under their complete control in order to hit their targets.  The actual passenger planes were flown to somewhere, landed, and the people were &quot;disappeared&quot;.  None of them could be alive.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t believe that.</p>
