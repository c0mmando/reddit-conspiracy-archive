       In 2008 a poster named "Whispers in the dark" posted a message with the message  "Watch Jakarta" at the end. The next day the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta was bombed.

       Many mods &amp; members have the same IP address's   and these different accounts all have different view points on different theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to get banned/have a thread deleted? Just bring up a discussion about how Israel were in someway involved in 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they are doing the same with Sandy Hook. There was a massive thread on there not too long ago which had tons of information about Sandy Hook and weird connections/happenings with that school. A mod posted a message about how they were disgusted with the thread and it was deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Lear was told he had to apologize after another member told a lie about him, they argued and Lear was the only one to get banned. He didn't apologize and as far as I know he is still banned. His moon images were amazing too, some of the things he said seemed a little kooky, but truth is sometimes stranger than fiction right?

       Is ATS cointelpro? Or is it a legit place?

       Signs Under Attack! abovetopsecret.com EXPOSED!!!
1) Mark Allin (Springer) Lives in Comanche Oklahoma... and the P.O. box of the LLC is registered to a post office center in comanche OK... thus, why the whois comes back to there...
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Their Host is located in Plano Texas... They use The Planet for hosting if I remember correctly... that is why you can tracert back to Plano TX... there\'s a huge data center for their hosting provider down there...
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Mark Allin the oil guy is not the same as the guy you\'re looking for... if you want something interesting, look for Valhall, springer\'s wife... She is (or was) a halliburton employee...

       Take a look at subliminal messages. There was different research in use of subliminal messages in 1980 and after that. Before that time that type of research was classified. Charles Manson and hippie movement (LSD).

      <p>
       There was also talk about encoded messages in music.

       In my opinion. Treat EVERYTHING as cointelpro. Remember, disinfo works because its 85-90% truth and 10-15% disinfo.  You learn that the 10-15% is blatantly wrong and you throw out the baby with the bathwater.

       I post on ATS a lot and have seen what the owners think and post on their site.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, most of the time they act like business owners and might "censor" certain things to keep the site from being publicly shamed (if it already hasnt).
      </p>
      <p>
       Never the less, ATS has the most cointel pro ive seen out of the fringe websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still worth visiting if you enjoy topics like, Aliens and UFOs (since thats the largest forum).

       Pretty sure that site is run by retards for retards. Have you read any of the shit that gets plunked down there like it was gold? lol.

       Don't know why you're being downvoted
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems on Reddit as elsewhere, Truth = Downvote
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it's a site for retards.  They're the only members ATS wants.  ATS = DoD = establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       ATS wants people who are highly suggestible followers
      </p>
      <p>
       Empty heads are easy to fill
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, ATS is pushing the UFO/aliens message very hard and has been for many years
      </p>
      <p>
       But, ATS members (being as empty headed and easily-led as they are) believe they're 'intelligensia'
      </p>
      <p>
       and you have to laugh when you see 14 year olds speaking ala Dickensian with their,
       <em>
        Thank you kind sir
       </em>
       pretensions.  Poor little kids
      </p>
      <p>
       Occasionally, and it's like ice-water in a desert, someone with more than a clue strays into ATS and tosses pearls to the swine before realising they're in nutso-land and leave
      </p>
      <p>
       Then of course, there are the missionaries who KNOW they're amongst the clueless, but who nevertheless sacrifice their time and patience in order to hopefully educate one in fifty.  The member Twitchy is one of those.  His avatar may still be John Lennon and his thread about kosher tax is a masterpiece of information and restraint, regardless of the shills desperately trying to provoke in order to have that thread buried/destroyed
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know where Twitchy is today, but wherever he is, people are better off for his presence
      </p>
      <p>
       As to Skeptic Overlord (doesn't that just say it all, lol) --- braggart, bully, loudmouth, narcissistic piece of excreta in my opinion.  And he alone ... just on his own ... has done more to destroy whatever credibility the US administration and its moronic, little-kid, murderous alphabet agencies might have hoped to garner.  I mean, if Skeptic Overlord is an indication of the goons running the US, then God help Americans and the rest of the world
      </p>
      <p>
       ATS, GLP, Icke -- the lot of them -- are brain damage in action.  Keep your kids away from it
      </p>
      <p>
       And GLP (Godlikeproductions for the uninitiated) has something even worse going on.  People who've frequented that dump for even a couple of days report disturbed sleep, disturbing dreams, depression and worse
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for this thread, OP and particular thanks to Goz11 -- between you, you've done a lot for many by exposing this

       Sandy Hook Trutherism
       <em>

       disgusting. I've seen people on this forum say things like "the parents are all actors and should be given prison sentences." Given that there is no evidence of any of the Sandy Hook Truher claims, I can see why this shite would be removed faster than you can say "inside jerb".

       ATS has been around for a long time.

       Even if COINTELPRO was still around, they'd have better things to do than monitor idiots on the internet. Why would they create a conspiracy theory site in the first place if they wanted to stop talk about conspiracy theories? Use your noodle, mate.

       What about the discussions about arabs they have? Just because they suggest Israelis were involved doesn't mean all of Israel is terrible.

       The Sandy Hook stuff like actors, batman maps etc I agree they're fucking insane. But the fact that the shooters car was registered to some other guy who apparently didn't know him is a bit weird. Even on the police scanner they mention this guys name when it's put into the "system"

       They wouldn't need to monitor theorists, just divide their opinions to such an extent they argue. So if any thread brings up valid points they can send in paid people to disrupt the discussion and close the thread.
