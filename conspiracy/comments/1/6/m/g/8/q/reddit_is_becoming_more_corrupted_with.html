       I am noticing a big flow of viral ads and propaganda on Reddit lately.  I notice there are always people to try to discredit certain views including chem trails, aliens, and the Sandy Hook/Aurora shootings.  They often use tactics of questioning the mental health of the truth seeker or discrediting them in other ways.  They seem to log into multiple accounts to reply to your responses (seemingly same conversation with multiple users who stop responding when a new one sends a message.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is becoming the new TV, so be careful.  Seek the truth.  Look up information about aliens.  Watch media subjectively.

       Not trying to be an ass, but what's wrong with trying to "discredit certain views"? If something can be debunked or debated, shouldn't it be allowed without labeling it "misinformation"? Now if they're just trolling or not adding anything to the conversation, then I understand.

       I totally agree with you on what you are saying. But at the same time I do agree with the OP where he expressed concern about how people attempt to discredit views by attacking them personally, instead of debunking the argument itself. Things like that need to be treated more seriously. I am not convinced about chem trails or aliens (to the extent that they have visited earth), but attacking the person on a personal level does not contribute anything to the conversation at hand. What we need to do is focus more on the facts and less about speculation and emotion. I dont think we will ever be able to entirely rid ourselves of this problem, but I think being more aware of it can help us improve it greatly.

       This practice is referred to as sock-puppetry, where each account is a sock puppet being controlled by one person, the sock master. Typically people will take accusations of sock-puppetry as offensive as it suggests various negative characteristics such as dishonesty, and pettiness.

       Basically IMO the "seem" there takes out the accusation and replaces it with a "this is how I feel when two or three guys are finishing each other's thoughts".

       .

      <p>
       Sure you can take a sentence with "seem" in it and make it insulting, "they seem like shill assholes.." but he specifically left out any name calling or labels in his original post.  For that reason I think he is just stating his take on the situation, and ultimately trying to help people keep their cool.

       Chem-Trails are a conspiracy that there are special planes out there that pump toxic chemicals / gases into our atmosphere that affect our thinking patterns and control us as a population.  If you google image for "Chem Trails" you will see some grid formations of what appear to be con-trails, but a con-trail fades into a cloud after about 2 minutes and should be gone after about 5, but in the chem trail photos there are grids of con-trails, which is odd.

       You do understand that the residual effects of a contrail can vary greatly depending on factors that can have high variability, such as but not limited to; atmospheric temperature, atmospheric condensation, altitude, engine/exhaust temperature. Furthermore, the video you posted is comparing a dissipating trail to a freshly forming one at 2 varying and unknown altitudes from at least one unidentified plane, with no record of any of the variables I mentioned above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, do the theorists have any clue what these mystical chemicals are? are they even attempting to find out? Of course not. It’s much easier to point a handycam at the sky and scream chem-trail when they see a white streak in the sky. That’s without even discussing the fact that if chem-trails are as common as the theorist like to believe, it should possible to undertake independent air samples and identify, at least some of the chemical(s?) involved. Approach this air sampling in a scientific method (replicable sampling methods, varying sample locations vs control locations etc.) and the argument may gain some credibility. But doing that may (will) disprove the theory altogether, so I can’t see any ‘concerned theorists’ undertaking that investigation.

       It's also much easier to just sit back and dismiss all of these theories as hearsay and attempt to poke holes into the evidence and argue about it than to research the matter, but it seems like you put a lot of time into your response.  Wouldn't it be better to invest all of that time into looking up more information, than arguing with me?

       Ok, first off, he mentions they took a scientific approach to this. I did a quick search of some scientific databases I have access to and found nothing related to Al, Br and/or Sr being detected in large amounts in the air. He also doesn't mention anything that directly links the increased levels in soil to increased levels in the air from overhead planes. Increased levels of Al, Br and Sr in soil could all be related to other emissions sources i.e. industry. The lady at the end obviously has no understanding of chemistry or toxicology, as she makes blanket statements with no factual basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the chemicals involved are indeed Al, Br and Sr, it should be incredibly easy to either detect them with basic air monitoring techniques, which if it was the case, I'm sure researchers/academics involved in public health or toxicology related fields would be jumping on them. Large amounts of easy to detect chemicals in the air that can negatively impact human health would be a huge discussion point, and huge discussion points = more funding and guaranteed employment. Furthermore, if it is being applied at rates indicated in the video, it would be showing up regularly and in large amounts in blood and urine analysis of the general population from independent and unrelated research projects.

       I’m not debating that geo-engineering doesn’t occur, it does to some extent, but primarily in nations like the UAE to create rain in a dessert environment.

       Please feel free to provide some solid evidence to the contrary, and I’m not talking about youtube videos of handycams pointed at the sky.

       The belief that condensation trails, or contrails, left behind by jets are actually either trails of chemicals or contrails with chemicals mixed in, done in a covert manner to hide a wide array of nefarious activities, from mind control, to weather manipulation, to changing the human genome.

       Almost all aircraft leave contrails in the sky.  A contrail is the formation of a cloud in the sky trailing the jet due to heat created by the engine interacting with the surrounding atmosphere.  Sometimes contrails disappear at a steady, observable rate (mere seconds, prominent effect), but other times they linger for up to several hours long.  Some argue that the contrails that last for hours on end in the sky are not just clouds formed by aircraft, but actually chemicals (or metals) being sprayed by aircraft.  The reasons for these chemicals (note, chemtrail) being sprayed vary from person to person, but common chemtrail conspiracies conclude they are either metals to conduct radar, or poisons to infect the populace.

       Absolutely not nonsense.  They are spraying metals in the air and have been since the 90's.  They need to keep a certain level of conductivity in the air for some undisclosed reason, but these metals are carcinogenic and they may just be poisoning us off.  If someone calls it nonsense they are likely one of the shills, of course this thread would get hijacked.  Look up the info yourself.

       Well, let's consider that as asking, who can fly unmarked jets with opposition by the FAA and US military. Oh, and who can be cleared to fly these from military airbases. Now let's ask again, 'who is "they"'?  Geometric precise logic says, it's gotta be the Girl Scouts.

       Let me break this down to the most simplest way I can:
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       made the claim, therefore
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       provide the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       evidence. Pointing me to Google isn't providing evidence, it's telling me to do your legwork for you. You might as well point out the window and say "it's out there somewhereeeeee". I mean, can you imagine in a courtroom, the Prosecution saying "he's clearly guilty of murder" and then calling the Jury "lazy" for not going out and looking for the evidence themselves? You want to claim something is happening, then you need to provide the actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can back up your claim, then please do so. However I suspect you cannot do any such thing (or else you would have done so already).

       You stated elsewhere you come on Reddit to recreationally troll people. (I paraphrase.)  So as soon as you deflected, it was pretty clear where this was headed.

       I wouldnt say that this problem is as large as you say it is, but I would agree with you to some extent. I have seen people who try and post facts against the majority get shut down pretty quickly. Though I do not disagree with people in anyway for quickly commenting against them I do have a serious problem with downvoting them. This is why I choose not to vote on reddit. I believe everyone should have an equal say, regardles of what it is they have to say. Downvoting, and even upvoting can unintentionally censor people. I think this subreddit of all places should do something about this, at least in the comment section of each thread.

       I wouldn't call them "shills" per say, they may be the same person actually, similar usernames, but a person who doesn't deal with cognitive dissonance very well.  Always needs "more proof".

       These people aren't trying to have a debate, they are bombarding threads with comments mocking those who appose the official view.  They ask for all kinds of impossible proof to find, while providing no actual evidence of their own arguments, usually they just result to calling the person crazy because they are too dumb to think of anything else.

       I said it is likely that most of the people on here arguing against chem trails and calling people paranoid for being concerned are probably shills.  People who don't believe in it no, but people blatantly trying to shut down claims saying there is no evidence in media or news articles.  The evidence is in the sky, the trails are in the sky in grid formation and remain for hours, condensation trails dissipate much sooner despite what some people on here say.

       Ok, sure. Sorry. Of course, you still mentioned shills, which oopididn'tagain said you didn't at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if chemtrails were a danger to us, would there be a measurable amount of whatever they are dropping in the sky in our air? If there isn't, what is your explanation for there not being a measurable amount? And if there isn't, why do you insist such low amounts of whatever the chemicals are would poison us and cause mass cancer? I am definitely willing to believe in chemtrails if given enough unbiased evidence.

       Agent Orange is real and we can all accept this but spraying a different chemical all over people is unbelievable?  I never said the chem trails were meant for mass cancer, maybe, but I think it has more to do with keeping conductivity in the air for some technology we don't know about.

       Think of it this way, the people providing you with all the 'proof' in the media are the same people who staged the thing to begin with.  So to understand what really happened, you must watch subjectively and look for inconsistencies that paint the picture of what is really going on.  For example when an entire plane burns up hot enough to melt steel, yet the hijacker's passport falls to the ground unharmed, that screams out planted evidence and if you do not see that that I can't help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do want to seek the truth, and I welcome friendly debate, but having my character and mental health questioned because I do not agree with the official story is starting to make me feel like I am in North Korea or some shit.  It would be as inappropriate as if I walked up to them and told them to lose weight and get checked for diseases since they look so shitty.

       The problem here is... and this post is a good example is that you are working these things bass akwards, and thats why you lack credibility and it's why people are attacking these views. You have this theory that the government and/or media stages everything then you take "evidence" and whatever random stuff you find as "facts" and then you make them fit that theory that the government/media are out to get you. This is sort of like... suppose you believed in leprecauns. Like really firmly you believe that there are leprcauns and they are in your house.. Now, every little thing becomes evidence that the leprecaun exists and has been there. Keys missing? Leprecaun did it. One sock gone after the wash has been put away? Leprecaun. Rainbow? Leprecaun. For a more real life example look at how creationists take the evidence for evolution and make it fit their theory of evolution and/or intelligent design. They have a conclusion that they want to reach and they bend over backwards to make the facts fit their conclusion, discounting anything along the way that can't be forced to fit their model. That is pretty much what I see a lot of around here (Not trying to put down religious folk, just from my pov can't come up with a better example.)

       I am not saying everything in the news is staged.  I am saying that propaganda is everywhere and that the truth we are told is not the real truth, but the truth deemed 'safe' for us to know about.  I don't blame them, I would spread propaganda to feed my family too unfortunately.

       Like I said, not the royal you, but there are a fair number of folks here on reddit and in general who operate like this. Everything is a conspiracy and everything that happens is evidence for it. If the evidence doesn't support the idea that everything or something is a conspiracy it's a conspiracy to make the greater conspiracy not look like a conspiracy or it's an outlier. You can take that line of thinking in circles for decades.

       People are in denial and it makes no sense.  We know there are top secret government files and we know propaganda exists we are taught about it in school.  We know that there was a 'supposed' alien crash in 1947 and that our technology has boomed ever since.  We know all kinds of other governments have done horrible testing on their own people and we criticize countries like North Korea for using propaganda when the USA uses similar tactics which is why Americans think they live in the best country in the world.

       I've been called a misinformist here.  It's disappointing. So I don't post much. People assume I'm some agent. I'm an engr major with a friend who believes in the reptilian shape shifting theories to what I'm afraid could become unhealthy. So I came here to understand him better, learn how to talk about these theories and what not. It hasn't been very useful.

       Chem trails... I'm still in school, but I'm pretty sure if a jet released mustard gas from 30k feet by the time it reaches us it would be so dillute it would be harmless. Not to mention jet lines can be demonstrated pretty easily. There's a reason crop dusters must fly so low to work properly. Are there any theories about chemicals being tested on people through the water supply? Seems far more cost effective and simpler to hide.

       Poisoning the water supply is one of the least effective methods of harming a population. Because it would become so diluted it would be far most cost effective to try and use a poison some other way.

       How is it "unhealthy" for him to believe in aliens?  I think it makes a lot more sense than god having his own son and sacrificing himself for our mistakes wtf is that shit?  Also, yes our water is poisoned it's called fluoride and Hitler used it on the Jews also. (main ingredient in some anti depressants not 'for our teeth').

       It's not unhealthy now. I'm just afraid it could become unhealthy. He was a major influence on me becoming an athiest. Always questioning everything. I question everything myself.  Like for instance, amongst the ethically questionable nazi medical files there are no experiments involving fluoride. For teeth or breed docility.  Let's assume those have been omitted for some gov't reason. Most ghettos hardly had a water supply, it would be quite the work to treat it with fluoride. I had a project last year of building a theoretical home water treatment device to turn grey water into potable water. We looked into chemical agents such as fluoride and iodine for purification, but decided to go another route because, while they show to clean the water very well, they are still chemicals and long term exposure might do some sort of harm and removing them after treatment is quite expensive. We went with slow sand gravity filter, followed by ozone sterilization, then through uv light tubes, and on through a simple carbon filter. Not a terribly practical device, but fun to design. Another fun fact about fluoride in water, in Africa there is a place that the ground water is rich in fluoride. Too much fluoride makes teeth soft, so they have a history of filling their teeth into sharp points.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, there are better ways to treat water than fluoride so I wish our treatment plants would evolve. But I don't think it likely the Nazis used it on jews in their water. Could have, they did crazy shit, but most of their medical experiments are more than well known.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also jumping back to my friend, I have no problem with him believing theories such that he does. It's how he speaks about them. We're around 20 and use psychoactives. Another friend of mine was recently diagnosed schizophrenic after a number of psychotic episodes after speaking for a while about some new spirit realm that he is the chosen one of. Obviously not a conspiracy theory, but my other friends arguments and convictions remind me of the now recovering schizophrenic. I just don't want another friend to climb naked in trees on campus, refusing to listen to people. At least not sober ha.

       (Not saying you are doing this just a statement that may help everyone here) Attacking a person's character because you feel they are wrong in no way will help them get to your point of view faster.  More so it'll push them to hold their stance harder and firmer.  Allowing them to find the truth on their own is the best way to win them over.  Showing what helps you believe what you do is all that you can do.

       Anyone who questions the veracity of so tragic and easily verifiable event as the Sandy Hook/ Aurora massacres deserves nothing but scorn, derision, and possibly forcible submission into a psych ward, so you should probably count your blessings that all you get is mild antagonism.

       Even if we know the truth, we must still explore the realm of possibility. A lot of the debate around the sandy hook / aurora events stem from the lack of journalistic integrity, overlapping stories of false information in the early hours, and people still latching on to these false claims put forward by the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blame the media for the problem, they created it with the shoddy journalism. Of course if you feed reports that a second shooter was on the scene, or aren't clear about the guns in the back of someones car, of course it will result in some gullible nutjob picking up the story and running with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need better practices for media to cut down on disinformation, to get their damn facts straight, instead of jumping on a story and creating paranoia over it. If a guy reads that a shotgun was used in the massacre, but they find the shotgun in a trunk, of course it is going to result in some questioning how the shooter got it into the trunk, it's faulty journalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why few people understand the link between quality of journalism to the quality of an educated public is beyond me. Bad journalism = stupid public.

       A lot of it is what they don't put on the news at all.  For example both of the shooters fathers and what their real jobs are.  Or why they didn't really report WTC 7.  There is a lot more too it that a couple misunderstandings with the reporters.  Why were some Sandy Hook relief funds set up before the shooting?  How is that a misunderstanding?

       If we were talking about grain prices in Nebraska, and there were conflicting news stories, than your point would very much apply. That is because you can assume that people discussing over correct grain price reporting are, primarily, interested in finding out the correct grain price.

       Sandy Hook is no such case. It was always unfortunately clear that the pro-gun-lobby together with their developmentally retarded cousin, the survivalists, and their closed-psych-ward friend the militias, have a very vested interest in downplaying, doubting, falsifying and belittling ANYTHING that may point to the one truth these people will not face: That easy gun access always has, and always will, facilitate disasters of this category, because there will always be loopy people, and they should not be able to get guns. EVEN if that means that no-one else should get guns.
       <br/>
       THAT is the elephant in the room that underlies all of this "critical", "think-for-yourself" contributions. Police officer first said he heard a shot fired? Later says he heard MULTIPLE shots fired? Oh okay, so it's all just a hoax by the libtards to take away my guns. COLD DEAD HANDS!
       <br/>
       There is no leeway with such people, as there is no leeway and no moral justification for the holocaust denialists (hence I mentioned them in the same breath). Yes, frank discussion is good IF the agendas of those discussing are above board. In this case they are not, hence no discussion with them. End of story.

       Truth is, mental health issues aren't screened against, and until the debate of sandy hook centers around mental health and not gun control, nothing will be accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you just stated was speculation and a fabricated half assed story about the lowest common denominator, the ignorant. You justify your position by the actions of a few. Knee jerk reactions are what got us into this economic mess, do you really think a war on guns will solve anything but crumbling the fabric of society entirely?
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy people will be crazy. You know what happens in other countries when somebody wants to go out and kill a bunch of people? They don't give up due to a lack of guns, thats for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, creating a black market economy is not the answer. Especially at this point into the development of black powder. Taking peoples guns away will just make them more creative. Do you really want more art students roaming your streets?!?

       Bullshit. On so many levels bullshit. Easy gun access doesn't automatically translate to a Sandy Hook  type event. Lack of education on proper storage of guns and the separate storage of bullets and magazines is apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress, It is entirely possible that Sandy Hook was some kind of staged event and I sincerely doubt that the "libtards" would be the ones behind it. As you so elegantly put it with your "frank discussion" and the liberal use of the word retard.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why people may accuse you of being a shill. I however think you are just really f*ing dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI I'm still on the fence about the Sandy Hook incident but the way it is portrayed in the MSM is peculiar to say the least.

       "There is no leeway with such people, as there is no leeway and no moral justification for the holocaust denialists... "
      </p>
      <p>
       Holocaust denialists don't exist. This is just a made up smear word. The correct term is holocaust
       <em>
        revisionists
       </em>
       . The hebrew word holocaust means holy sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was not a name given to the operation by the Nazis. The term that is usually used for what happened is ethnic cleansing and/or genocide but because it happened to some jews it was a "holy sacrifice". 6 million is a myth and number that was used many times by certain Jews long before WW2.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is inarguable. This is frank discussion. Nobody is denying that something tragic happened, people are discussing the fine points points of an official narrative that is used to justify the occupation of a land that was never truly theirs to begin with! End of story...

       I'm not an angry man, I'm a man of peace, few things can upset me, but the notion that millions of jews and other persecuted groups didn't die because of the madness of one sad, pathetic rejected art student and his followers grinds my gears.

       You have never once stated any evidence for your all consuming ignorance, and your disregard for logic makes me question if you're even putting any thought into the strokes your fingers make on the keyboard, perhaps you have only put together this argument through a miracle that arose as you flailed your limbs before your keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Holocaust has been well documented and proven, and you are disrespecting each and every one of those millions who died with your continued willful ignorance, because to completely ignore that kind of evidence requires you to want to stay in the dark.

       The States does not recognize the Armenian Genocide. Obama said he would as a campaign promise, then backed out. Canada did, partly did, finally, in 2004; their official stance stating it was a tragedy but not intentional. Sort of waffley.
      </p>
      <p>
       The photos of emaciated human beings were from the appalling conditions in the prison camps... this was created intentionally by an allied campaign of bombing all railways, supply lines... and a well known typhus outbreak... the pictures were carefully selected (something like 1 in 20 pictures ever made it to public scrutiny)
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not a scrap of documentary evidence for the holocaust, not a single document, this stunning discovery caused David Irving to become a revisionist just through the startling nature of the fact, he had his reputation as a historian tarnished literally overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most distasteful aspect, I think, of it all... is to suggest that the survivors that do describe gas chambers and such are lying. This is where the whole thing really does now seem to be "antisemitism"... but there are still jewish survivors who described having musical intruments, concerts, they put on plays, and enjoyed a number of other things that does not tie in with an exterminationist policy whatsoever... also the eyewitnesses seem to be the same handful of 50 or so people, thats not an exaggeration... although they would postulate themselves that there must be tens and tens of thousands of survivors... simply put... where are they? The whole aspect is somewhat easier to take in if one remembers the geopolitical and sociological effects and just how important it is that this story is told the way it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       you see its really nothing to do with antisemitism for most people, it is simply an exercise in critical thinking, it also requires an understanding of how people are controlled on this planet, and that is a bitter pill to swallow when we're wrapped up in the illusion of free will
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       here's a list of possible issues for you to ponder
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler ordered the extermination of the Jews in writing, orally, or through mental telepathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazis cremated 1,500,000 to 4,000,000 bodies at Auschwitz/Birkenau in less than two years using between 30 and 52 single-body crematory ovens and were able to keep it all a secret until late 1944 despite the fact Auschwitz was a major bombing target photographed by American planes throughout that year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazis were able to destroy all documentation of the extermination program before the total German surrender in mid 1945. This despite the fact all German secret codes had been broken by the British and many SS communications had been intercepted by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazis settled on a plan which called for allocating scarce rail stock to transport hundreds of thousands of people halfway across Europe only to kill them when they could have killed them locally and used the rail cars for the war effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazis used Diesel engines as a source of carbon monoxide for their gas chambers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazis designed Zyklon B gas chambers without ventilation systems or gas delivery equipment for killing people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazis dug deep pits in a marsh and were able to burn bodies in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The victors in a war are qualified to sit in judgment over the vanquished and able to dispense justice thereon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Former political prisoners and common criminals are sources of accurate information regarding their jailers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Victims don't lie and have no interest in vengeance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Holocaust is a uniquely evil event which is unexplainable and can be equated to no other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews should be able to claim special moral authority due to having been the victims of persecution.

       HOLOCAUST
    The destruction of some 6 million Jews by the Nazis and their followers in Europe between the years 1933-1945. Other individuals and groups were persecuted and suffered grievously during this period, but only the Jews were marked for complete and utter annihilation. The term "Holocaust" -* literally meaning "a completely burned sacrifice"* - tends to suggest a sacrificial connotation to what occurred. The word Shoah, originally a Biblical term meaning widespread disaster, is the modern Hebrew equivalent.

       Lol u don't scare me one bit. OOO a survivors family. Was it really hard for them to tell you about it all?  Did you cry? Do you fantasize about killing the big bad nazis? Was it really hard for them in the labor camps?

       Ha! Holohaox revision is illegal in my country too. Because the Zionists control us as much as they control Germany, the USA. You are an unwitting victim in all this. So their you have it folks. Not a shill. Just really f*cking dumb. Got a free trip around the world to see an alleged death camp and you still can't see through the lies. You know who else was Aryan and Jewish? Hitler! White zionist jews are at least half responsible for your holy sacrifice. Fuck you later.

       . He bought his guns in Sweden, and then killed nearly 70 people. So, your argument is a bit weak since the relaxed gun laws allowed a foreign national to obtain weapons and then go on a rampage.

       ...then you should watch what you say, little Nazi. Besides the police, there are several groups in Germany that hunt down little cunts like you, and beat some sense into them. I'm not an "unwitting victim", and I have no reason to doubt my grandparent's testimony. If that still doesn't make it through your tinfoil, you deserve everything that will come to you. Soon, there will be no more place for people like you. They WILL find you... :-)

       I hate that the holohoax is used to justify their own murderous nationalism and extremism. Almost every year a holocaust movie comes out to reaffirm our programming and drill it into our minds. Question the official narrative even a bit and you are a no good anti-semite and a terrorist. It's clearly propaganda that is unquestioningly followed.

       The people using ad hominem attacks (ie tinfoil hat, mom's basement, schizo, nutjob, etc) are just spouting programmed responses that have been given to them via the media and educational indoctrination, those responses are probably involuntary reactions to cognitive dissonance.  Most of those people are probably too deep into the hivemind to be shown the truth, they need to figure it out for themselves in order for it to click in their heads.  Problem is, most of them just delve into mainstream outlets for media and think anything else is "cheap" so they are not exposed to much cognitive dissonance and are perpetually stuck in their own mind-prison.  These people are your average folk, really.  Think of all the sports-idiots and reality show junkies, they are stuck in a media bubble that they cannot let go of or question the intentions of.

       I don't think sports idiots and reality tv junkies are a real thing. I think you  create an idealized version in your head to cope with your lack of understanding of individuals.

       You've never encountered sports idiots?  I am surrounded by them at work, at family gatherings, etc.  It's people who's lives revolve around "the game" and talking sports statistics etc.  Basically meaningless drivel.  Reality show junkies don't leave the house much, but they do exist, I've dated a few.

       The people using ad hominem attacks (ie shill, useful idiot, sockpuppet, sheep, etc) are just spouting programmed responses that have been given to them via the blogs and youtube videos, those responses are probably involuntary reactions to cognitive dissonance.

       Blah, blah blah. Everything you said can be reversed in this situation. Instead of making an us vs them paradigm you should recognize faults in people irrespective of whether or not they agree with you.

       There's a lot more than that, another good book to check out is
       <em>
        Foundations: Their Power and Influence
       </em>
       by Rene Wormser, its about how tax free foundations are funding "social engineering" programs in the universities, schools, and the media to change America from a Democratic Republic into a part of a Socialist World Government run by a technocratic elite.  It relates to the first link there the Dodd Report.

       I'd say for every informed individual on here there are at least a couple paid shills and several easily programmed minds.  Him calling you a paranoid weirdo they are just either paid to lie or they are so scared of reality that they don't want to think about it and want to just stay in denial.

       Did I suggest that? No.  I didn't at all.  I said that there are certain people on here spreading misinformation on purpose and using tactics like twisting around what OP says to make them sound absurd.  No sense in arguing with you though since you are doing just that.  Not saying you are a paid shill, maybe just a mindless drone programmed with mental responses to certain things.

       One possibility is that the "us vs. them" attitude prevalent in online communities such as this one is being deliberately stoked and/or propagated. Elite/slave; legit theorist/shill.

       Funny how "normal" people listen to the Beatles everyday and see John Lennon as a hero but still see us as paranoid idiots. As of tomorrow, America will ban automatic assault rifles and I wonder when shit will go south in the US.

       We'll see about that... As for me taking it easy, I don't care because I'm not American so I will be able to prepare myself much better for shit to come. I merely wanted to point out that shit is GOING to happen, and that afterwards the blame will be put somewhere else than the American government. However, if you know about this beforehand, it is clear evidence that something more is playing a part in this than only Iran, communism or whatnot. And why do you say that things didn't go south during the 1994-2004 lift? I thought Columbine happened in 1999? Seems that gun regulations don't work at all... Unless of course you want to blast hollow point rounds in your fellow Americans.

       I too believe that someday things are going to spiral out of control. I own firearms also. I too believe that we all need to be prepared for whatever comes, and we cannot just accept that "civilized society" will last forever. But the fate of the US is not tied to civilians owning assault rifles. We can buy hunting rifles that do more damage than the junk our regular infantry are issued, so it's not a big deal when assault weapons are banned. If firearms in general are ever banned, then my friend, we can expect things to go south fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your Columbine reference is right on. Gun regulations don't actually work. What I meant by things going south after the assault weapons ban was lifted was in reference to the global economic meltdown that began in 2008. I was trying to be witty and separate the subject of guns and the subject of "shit will go south". I guess I could have done a better job.

       The Beatles have been sugarcoated so much that "normal" people now love them superficially, without going into depth to their revolutionary thinking which is what made them so valid and what has them now as an "eternal" pop band.

       Opposing arguments should always be welcomed, as long as they are not full of logical fallacies. The people being paid to support the status quo love the subject of aerosols being used for solar radiation management as well as the recent Connecticut incident almost as much as they enjoy using logical fallacies in their arguments. However, I would be the first one to argue against the existence of the human-like "grey" aliens.

       The thing about a lot of conspiracy theories is that they're practically unfalsifiable. There isn't any evidence you can present that would change the mind of someone utterly convinced that Sandy Hook was a hoax. Even if they're trying to be perfectly logical they could easily reason that your evidence is only compelling because it was fabricated by the government.

       I've seen it referred to outright as a "hoax", so thank you for clarifying. Is the trend of thinking around here more along the lines of pushing a gun control agenda at a high cost? Or something more like the claims I've heard that Holmes's and Lanza's fathers were to testify in the LIBOR scandal?

       I'm disinclined to trust any report of any single shooter, so most of what I look at is speculation on co-conspirators and additional shooters. With regard to these, I find the conflicting (inaccurate) reporting on weapons, bullets, bullet casings, and especially the stilted testimony of the medical examiner in charge.

       I'm not saying to always attribute it to human error, but too many skeptics hang onto conflicting reports and don't account for that. I guess it's the same logic as witness statements holding up in court, though.

       This corruptive effort would not likely take place unless there was some truth to be fought by them.  When you look at the magnitude of the effort opposing discussion and trying to ridicule it all, you have to wonder why they're so adamant. Why is it so necessary to silence people trying to talk about opposition to gun bans? Who benefits? Why is it necessary for some to crusade against discussion of GMO foods?  Why is it necessary to mock anyone discussing chemical spraying? The common factor seems to be anyone trying to discuss acts by the government or the elites is often attacked by trolls or possible shills.
      </p>

       Some of the debaters clearly make their entire online presence's purpose to mock others. They produce nothing else but this disruption.  Those who only mock others either have a personality problem like a weak ego driving their compulsive attacks on others, or they could be mocking as a tool to wear down anyone questioning official explanations.  In either case, it's not a suitable continual response in debates, and its use shows something is wrong with the attacker.

       It is! It really is.
But when a person cites naturalnews, youtube, and unsourced wordpress blogs as evidence to attack things like the very idea of sustainability as a good pursuit or to prove that homeopathic medicine is great and vaccines cause autism, all I can really do is resort to mockery. They've rejected everything that could change their opinion and it's a dang shame.

       Take note this shill lists his cover ups he is responsible for:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sustainability - The main goal being to sell us our own natural resources like water as they already do in some parts of the world.  Also Carbon tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        Homeopathic medicine - If people can grow their own herbal medicines in their garden it could have a huge impact on the pharmaceutical industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vaccines causing autism - This is one of the biggest propaganda cover ups on reddit right now.  The mercury and whatever else is in that shot is part of an ongoing experiment on the US public.  Some of the shots I suspect contain different compounds which is why only a small percentage get the autism, and within that group there are different types of autism, some autistic people having amazing abilities in certain aspects.

       Sustainability: I spent my summer working on a permaculture farm practicing sustainable agriculture, I like to grow my own food, and I am very fond of not running out of resources. That's sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homeopathy: Herbal medicine is not homeopathy. Homeopathy is the idea that dilution increases potency and it's straight up ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines: Suspect all you want, the peer-reviewed science doesn't agree with you, and I'll believe a well-respected journal of science over people on the internet with no background in science every time.

       What is obvious is how much you want to shut down my argument, why so defensive that there are no shills, when there was recently an article from one of the shills coming forward?  Your job on the line or something?  If you are not a shill then say "chem trails may possibly exist" and I will say "chem trails may not exist" and that is that.  You can't do that though can you?

       Okay, if you want to know, I believe that aliens already have invaded our society, I believe our government does mass testing on us.  I believe all the mass shootings lately are caused by the mind control or are staged and are not really happening.   I believe 9/11 was an inside job.  I believe that in our lifetimes the alien existence will be revealed, and that it is already happening which is why there has been more ufo and alien talk in the news.

       20 countries have banned GMOs but you deny there's ever been evidence. And that's why I'm not going to carry this further with you. And as I noted, you called someone a faggot but try to claim I'm going ad hom on you. Puhlease, clean the shit from your own stable first before getting all whiny that my canary poops.

       New to the conspiracy sub and I have been quite surprised to see how many people focus on being a troll and providing blank skepticism than actually contributing any discussion. Then they turn around calling you the immature one.

       What would you have someone contribute to a discussion with no proof except for skepticism?  Another person joining in saying "Thats amazing", "This is great info", "Everyone needs to read this and wake up" adds nothing at all except back patting.  At least the skeptics are trying to get people to research things.

       I am not talking about skeptics, I am talking about the ones who respond with comments like:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Hey giuse this person points out that i have a mental illness and offers he help OMG LE GOVAMENT SHILL WAKE UP SHEPPLE LOL"

       This person is trying to make me look stupid, and is twisting around what I am saying to do so.  Why is this person so upset?  Why does this person so badly want to throw off the trail that this is going on, just think about it.  Looks like it was written by a 12 year old but it took a certain level of genius to put together such a propagating piss pool of a retarded statement.

       I've noticed this more as of late as well. Instead of stirring a solid argument/conversation the responders simply harass. I find it a little inconceivable that this many non-conspirators would begin coming here for discussion all of a sudden.

       Its not just reddit. All over the TV. News media is trying to discredit the Sandy Hook "conspiracy theories" while at the same time ignoring the death of multiple highly influential 2nd amendement supporters and the death of a man who started the entire movement to set back SOPA and internet censorship. The government is killing those that openly oppose it and gain rational supporters. The NDAA and Patriot Act in full effect. They wrote the laws for a reason and can now legally justify killing Americans.

       Yeah I was wary of bringing that kind of sarcasm into this sub. But I get you man. This is a redundant thing to say but I really wish shit was different in this country. I would love to be gung ho patriotic, and I get jealous of people with their proverbial eyes closed sometimes. The saying "ignorance is bliss" definitely has at least some merit. I feel like in order to think like we do, to allow ourselves to have our eyes open, we have to be inherently cynical. Most people aren't ready to admit to others and to themselves that they don't have nearly as much control over things that they thought they did. Things bigger than them. But in the end, it's the truth. I don't want to say that my opinions on certain things have more value than those of people who have been tricked and fooled, but I feel in many cases, mine do. Ours do. We are relatively few, and the only way anything is going to change is for many more people having their eyes opened. And this, I think, will inevitably lead to a more cynical and pessimistic society. But it's a small price to pay. I apologize for the random rant, but I'm waiting to pick my girlfriend up from work and I've been wanting to get that out. That's another thing, by the way. Especially in the subjects that are discussed in this sub, it's important to have a safe outlet to share your thoughts. Even if no one read them, this kind of thing will pile up and overwhelm you. Good luck to all the truth seekers out there. And remember you aren't crazy, and in a lot of cases you can judge how right you are by how much you are called crazy. Not every time. But most lol

       They are called "Shills", and I have noticed them as well. By definition, a Shill is a person paid to endorse a product favourably, while pretending to be impartial.... Except here it's not a product, but a way of thinking to help discredit conspiracy.

       People are paid to do all sorts of things on the web. Why not this? More and more people are "waking up" each day, or at the very least, not trusting everything they hear from mainstream media. This calls for guerrilla tactics, such as creating fake accounts on reedit/youtube/facebook etc. to help combat how many people can actually view this stuff.

       not anymore, if there is little demand, energy companies cut back accordingly. Same goes for the manufacturing sector which controls production. Only enough is produced to meet demand, as any more would drive the prices down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, it's a controlled supply, and sometimes artificial demand, which jacks up the prices. The resources have already been extracted.

       My argument is that humans can grow what they want and where they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides building the infrastructure, climate control watering, and feeding can be done autonomously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Machines can do the work of thousands of people.  Therefore food should not cost so much. It should hardly 'cost' anything at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to say it is still in a ratio of 1 human produces food for 1 human is wrong. More like 1 human produces food for 10,000.

       The thing is that it's not that simple. It's not just a black and white thing and the choice is easy to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, if such was the case (simply asking why fixes things), I think the problem would be long over. Who didn't ask themselves these questions?

      <p>
       I know the motive behind wars is a very sensitive issue on this subreddit and I honestly think I've had my share of downvotes for voicing my opinion on the subject, so I'll stay quiet on this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of asking yourself "why" all the time, go look for answers for that "why". And not just on conspiracy websites. Make use of the resources that are available to you thanks to internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       When taking a position on a specific subject, you should ALWAYS be aware of what you are dismissing as false or flawed as a result of the position you are taking. In other words, don't believe in the first thing you hear. Investigate. It's also okay to abandon such position once it becomes untenable instead of ignoring contradictory evidence and manifesting confirmation bias.

       I really don't know but keep commenting please because it is nce to hear from sane minded individuals like yourself.  Some people seem like they really want to live in denial and they get upset and scared when they think about the truth because they aren't ready.  I suspect a lot of those we consider shills may be those in denial, but there are certainly people on here purposefully spreading lies.

       Sounds like a trap to me, Chris Hansen is going to tell me to "take a seat over there" and then I go to Guantanamo Bay, no thanks.  I do really agree with you to an extent, but this is spy tool number 1, there is no privacy here and no way for me to trust you or anyone else on here.  We need to be prepared and have guns, it is very important that we have guns.  They are trying to take them away for a reason and that tells me I may have a reason to need one.

       actually in time you will see it's not a trap...i am not a trap...as all it requires is that you believe...in yourself....that's what is great about good plans based on a solid moral foundations, they are virtually incorruptible....you will see, in time, if they allow me to be out of the corral, that what I say will be the key to salvation, our salvation....there is one thing that nwo is really using the net for...they have a prophecy....they know, that the one, the one who will threaten all that they are will come from the web....they have several people that they watch, all with the concern that "they" may be the one....they are scouring the web for the person who has the leadership skills to take them down....I belive I can set you free, I want you to free so I can be free...and yes you should have guns...for you only have so many cheeks you can turn....we all must understand the imporatnce of acting as one, of unification, to do so we must have a plan of action that is executable and one that can not be undermined or co-opted. Above all it must be effective. i have already planted the seed...understand, when you see the number of suscribers jump from 60k to 100k in 2 months....and then in the very short time i have made my presence known, another 3 have joined...understand what you are witnessing...I understand your fear, in time I will turn your fear into victory

       In time you will be either on board or not, it does not matter, you can make any choice you wish to, and you can also change your mind at any time, we are about freedom via debt free currency, if you wish to continue to use central banker paper that has debt attached to it, so be it, the rest of us, shall choose freewill, we shall choose currency that cost only what it cost to make it, we shall not saddle each other with debt, we shall be free, we shall be free to keep what we make, and when we have something such as a service we need/want collectively paid for, we shall do so with equal pay apportioned taxation. The choice is yours, continue to be a debt slave, or just walk away and be free. I can not make the choice for you, all I can do is show you that you have a choice....here again, the beauty of the plan is that I am the leader, you are the leader, I am the follower, you are the follower...The idea is in charge, not the man

       Poisoning the water supply is one of the least effective methods of harming a population. Because it would become so diluted it would be far most cost effective to try and use a poison some other way.

       So now is the time that you stop doing what you're railing against and give me some substance. You're the one who is postulating that anyone who says aliens don't exist is spreading propaganda, so show me.

       We'll see about that... As for me taking it easy, I don't care because I'm not American so I will be able to prepare myself much better for shit to come. I merely wanted to point out that shit is GOING to happen, and that afterwards the blame will be put somewhere else than the American government. However, if you know about this beforehand, it is clear evidence that something more is playing a part in this than only Iran, communism or whatnot. And why do you say that things didn't go south during the 1994-2004 lift? I thought Columbine happened in 1999? Seems that gun regulations don't work at all... Unless of course you want to blast hollow point rounds in your fellow Americans.

       Actually by lapping up the holocaust story as you do, you are disrespecting every person that has died in the middle east due to the very fact that Israel exists.

      <p>
       More importantly, you dishonour humanity's collective intellectual integrity by spouting robotic platitudes all over the place.

       HOLOCAUST
    The destruction of some 6 million Jews by the Nazis and their followers in Europe between the years 1933-1945. Other individuals and groups were persecuted and suffered grievously during this period, but only the Jews were marked for complete and utter annihilation. The term "Holocaust" -* literally meaning "a completely burned sacrifice"* - tends to suggest a sacrificial connotation to what occurred. The word Shoah, originally a Biblical term meaning widespread disaster, is the modern Hebrew equivalent.
