<p>There&#39;s not really much to understand.  If you are outnumbered and have a gun, and there are five other people that you want to take over, but they have guns too, then the easiest way to take them over is to take their guns away.</p>

<p>This is how three dudes can walk into a crowded bank and hold a hundred people up if they have guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why would any soldier ever invade a citizens area?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sad truth about this is that TPTB and the military industrial complex has made and trained soldiers <em>specifically</em> to be brainless, unquestioning, empty-shelled automatons that their superiors can fill with brainwashing propaganda so that the soldier can go fight and kill WHOEVER they say to.</p>

<p>The truth, of course, is that while there are indeed (and unfortunately) many soldiers that ARE basically automatons, many it seems are beginning to wake up.  This is a good thing - a great thing actually - but there are still a lot of soldiers (again, unfortunately) that WILL indeed invade and attack their own citizens if this is what they are told to do by their superiors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most soldiers I know are for gun rights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but TPTB are as intelligent and conniving as they are evil...and they are VEEERY evil...so it is not above them to stage false flag attacks that will make the public look like the enemy so that they can tell the soldiers &quot;See?  Look!  The public is a hazard onto itself and cannot be trusted!  We MUST confiscate all weapons! for the public&#39;s own good!  Go to it, soldier!&quot; and, again, many brainwashed young men and women will indeed go forward.  I would certainly hope I&#39;m very wrong in this, and I hope that if I&#39;m NOT wrong, there are still a lot of other soldiers who ARE on our side and on the side of the 2nd amendment, and WILL protect the citizens...but I am not 100% certain of just which side the men and women of our armed forces will fall at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And how many civilians with semi automatic rifles does it take to stop the marines if they want to get in your house?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not a bad question.  The fact of the matter is that there are indeed more civilians than there are people in the armed forces.  Those in the armed forces, however, ARE trained to fight and kill in a manner that most civilians are most definitely not.  I would imagine that a fight between every person in the armed forces against every civilian would be up in the air in terms of who would possibly win because, although the &quot;civis&quot; vastly outnumber the armed forces, the armed forces are definitely more organized and trained for armed conflict and battle.</p>

<p>That being said, those men and women in armed forces have family members, and I don&#39;t think they would be willing to gun down their own loved ones...so things could ultimately get VERY complicated and sticky.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I would certainly hope that the armed forces are on the side of the civilians.  I would hope that things DON&#39;T get so out of hand that this kind of conflict doesn&#39;t take place, but...who knows...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re correct. I mean, the fundamental concept is that guns = force. And as a force, it changes the dynamic of any confrontation, realistically everything, in any situation/scenario. </p>

<p>Guns are weapons and weapons change the dynamics of how people act. Confiscation eliminates or diminishes the opposition&#39;s ability to do damage or resist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I often ponder the same question.  Only thing I can come up with is that &quot;they&quot; are aware of something we aren&#39;t.  A game changer, if you will.  Something big, like a sudden shift in resource availability.  Something actually <strong>bigger than money</strong>.  What could that be?  No idea.  I&#39;m not even convinced that&#39;s what&#39;s going on.  But the only thing an extreme capitalist puts before profit is their own survival.  </p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fossil Fuels. Research peak oil. We hit it in the 70&#39;s. It&#39;s why America occupies nearly every country on the planet. Most consumer products are packaged in fossil fuels, contain fossil fuels, it&#39;s how we heat our homes, transports goods, transport food. When there is no fuel to sustain the global economy it will be a short matter of time until local (meaning inner continent economies, not in the small sense) collapse. Academically it&#39;s referred to as the Collapse. Derrick Jensen&#39;s books Endgame Volumes 1 &amp; 2 are a great place to start. Resource competition is what drives every species on the planet, we are no different. When we run out of fossil fuels and the vast majority sees how the Elite made no effort to protect us and have turned against us it will be a shit storm. It&#39;s also inevitable considering fossil fuels took billions of years to accumulate and we&#39;ve been using them for less than 200 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What would the government take over though?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, realize that it&#39;s not JUST the government here.  This has to do with a LOT more than just governmental control.  This is a corporatocracy we live in 100% through and through.  There may very well be yet other forces in control of things/the world than just the government and the corporations, but 1) these two entities are definitely big players in the global enslavement scheme and 2) the government alone is definitely not the only entity responsible here nor the most powerful entity by far.  That being said, the little TPTB haven&#39;t already taken over of our lives, our funds, and of the possibility we still (barely) have of resistance to their quest for absolute power is something they want to clamp down upon even more.</p>

<p>Granted they are already very close to controlling us fully.  Monetarily, they absolutely have us under lock and key.  We are wage and tax slaves all the way.  We provide them with trillions of dollars a year in wealth and power.</p>

<p>They just want more of it.  Right now there is still a small chance that the public can fight back.  They want to prevent even that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean isn&#39;t the status quo pretty much desirable to the powers that be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not the one that presently exists.  They have, I would say, about 75-85% control of the population.  That&#39;s a whole heck of a lot, but not only are there various people that DO fight back, but the internet is beginning to open that percentage up even more...and they <em>definitely</em> don&#39;t want this.  The status quo is pretty much already darn close to locked down in &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy">Idiocracy</a>&quot;...but they want as much <em>full</em> lock down control of things as absolutely possible, and they don&#39;t have that as of yet here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rampant consumerism, a pacified, distracted, and (mostly) physically unfit population.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all absolutely true...but, again, TPTB want <em>full</em> control, and they don&#39;t have that yet.  There are still some of us that are actively fighting to wake ourselves up and wake others up.  They don&#39;t want <em>any</em> of that happening, and right now, there is still a possibility of that happening.  They want to lock down on even that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What more could they want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything, my brother.  Everything.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have that <em>yet</em>, and they&#39;re trying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems pretty ideal for the powers that be, especially given income inequality these days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.  You are confused into thinking that the abject consumerism that you rightly point out and the extent of slavery that exists now (consciously and subconsciously) is AS BAD AS IT CAN GET.</p>

<p>It is not, my friend.  Not yet.</p>

<p>They want <em>all</em> of it - <em>ALL</em> the power - and although they most definitely have most of it, it seems they are not interested in stopping until they can exist absolutely uncontested by <em>any</em> possible opposition that could arise against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe its not about taking guns away, but about freaking people out that guns are going to to be stripped so they will settle on something less imposing.  Its like selling a car. I want 3500 for it, but I list 5000. When they bring me down to 4000, I settle and both parties thought they won. </p>

<p>What would they do? I dont know. Maybe Higher security in Schools. Schools become the new airports.  They are talking about demolishing or possibly renovating sandy hook. My guess is, they demolish the school and rebuild it with &quot;New Security Standards&quot;. This will be the normal for ALL new schools and old schools may be required to retrofit in order to receive federal money.  This is my best guess.  Schools are the new airports.  </p>

<p>And lets be real about this, anyone voting on this is probably already out of school and doesnt care, and anyone in school are too young to vote on it. LOL. suckers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve seen it&#39;s all related to the 2nd amendment in the U.S. Constitution. The arguments of pro-gun members revolve around the necessity and right to owning guns in order to prevent a government from going tyrannical, a fear that is very real for some. 
&quot;Who&quot; would benefit? I suppose the generic ruling elites, the upper 1% who profit from all the chaos, as they tend to in most cases. I am not sure about other implications of gun control, nor am I entirely decided on the case, but I am definitely leaning in the favour of pro-gunners at the moment in light of all the very strange mass shootings recently...
EDIT: In short, if the Govt. wants a takeover, this is step one. This is all a summary, by the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the efforts on gun control is representative of an ultimate goal, it will just be another incremental step and a useful wedge issue. A distraction, really. Once the pressure creates some spark of violence against our &quot;benefactors&quot;, that will be proof enough that that we will need the government to to take the appropriate steps.</p>

<p>More to the point will be the morphing of the country into a &quot;needful&quot; compartmentalized, gated community to combat the &quot;dangerous&quot; criminals; such a lock down will become necessary to protect us from increasingly more violent elements. It will all be for our safety and security, of course. What better way to unite people than to protect them from a threat within their own country? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s important to also understand that a lot of people around the globe are looking at the Americans. They have guns and so in theory it should be easier for them to oppose the government should they wake the fuck up and decide human kind had enough of banksters and their friends.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s very important. It only takes one spark to light the flame that will lead to these people getting hanged all over the globe so I guess they are trying to make sure that spark DOES NOT HAPPEN until they have enough drones and autonomous weapons to be able to obliterate everything and anyone in their destructive paths.</p>
