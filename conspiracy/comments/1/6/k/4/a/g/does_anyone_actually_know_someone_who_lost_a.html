    <div class="md"><p>Hooray for circular logic! I&#39;m glad you aren&#39;t a cop, you&#39;d try giving me a speeding ticket while I&#39;m at a red light. Here&#39;s how I imagine that conversation going.</p>

<p>You:I pulled you over for speeding.<br/>
Me: I wasn&#39;t speeding.<br/>
You: Well I checked your driving history and you&#39;ve sped before<br/>
Me: But I wasn&#39;t speeding right now. Do you have any evidence I was speeding<br/>
You:Like I said, you&#39;ve sped before, how am I to know you aren&#39;t speeding now?<br/>
Me:That&#39;s bullshit<br/>
You:I don&#39;t know, I pulled you over for speeding and you&#39;ve admitted to speeding in the past. Seems pretty likely you were speeding.<br/>
Me:<em>has aneurysm</em> </p>

<p>See right there, is why I&#39;m skeptical nearly all conspiracy theorists and their theories. You completely missed the entire point of what I wrote, and then jumped to something you wanted to believe regardless of the facts. The &quot;dialogue&quot; was to illustrate a lack of critical thinking and awareness. Thank you for confirming my point.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you wan&#39;t to insist that something is likely happening, yes I want you to provide evidence. History isn&#39;t proof of something occurring now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to say it doesn&#39;t occur without a doubt in your mind is just stupid  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and presenting it as a likely scenario even though there&#39;s no actual evidence outside of conjecture is even more stupid. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not saying that it does occur</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hate this shit, if you are going to claim something, at least have the balls to stick to your beliefs. The very fact that you claim to to not be promoting an idea while providing arguments in support of it is:1) proof that you know you are on completely unfounded ground and 2) is one of the most intellectually dishonest things I can think of. If you aren&#39;t saying something is happening, then shut your mouth about it. Otherwise, toe the line and accept the criticism that comes your way instead of shirking away once somebody calls you on your shit. Just do what all of the other conspiracy twats do when confronted by someone who&#39;s willing to argue and demands actual proof: call them a government paid shill, and completely ignore the fact that you can&#39;t back up your theories despite all of the &quot;research&quot; you&#39;ve done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point wasn&#39;t proven, your scenario was unrealistic and stupid. Also yes i CAN hold the opinion that it might or might not occur, nowhere did i claim i believed it is happening, I am keeping an open mind and you cant tell me which side of the fence to stand on because of it. I simply pointed out that it has been done in the past, so there can be room for speculation that it occurs today. </p>

<p>Also how can i provide evidence, if the evidence you are looking for is not obtainable? It is out of the public&#39;s reach, therefore it is not something that one can prove or disprove. </p>

<p>Your argument is essentially that your belief that its not happening, is somehow greater than someones else&#39;s belief that it does.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You really are dense arent you? THAT&quot;S THE POINT</p>

<p>the only point I was trying to make was that there is no reason to believe that something is actually happening. Thankfully you&#39;ve been backing up that argument with everyone of your posts. &quot;It is out of the public&#39;s reach, therefore it is not something that one can prove or disprove.&quot;</p>

<p>This conversation started when I asked what would be convincing me to start believing. Since then, the only thing tangible you&#39;ve come up with is something that happened nearly half a century ago and the constant insistence that asking you to actually provide evidence (burden of proof?) is uncalled for because its too difficult for you (or anybody) to get evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your argument is essentially that your belief that its not happening, is somehow greater than someones else&#39;s belief that it does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No my argument is essentially: there is no evidence that chemtrails are a nefarious plot, science provides a plausible explanation of them, and refuting the science and providing no evidence for claims leaves you open to ridicule. If I claimed that a giant, invisible, inter-dimensional TRex was invading our solar system, and provided no evidence (and insisted that evidence was impossible to gather) any true skeptic would be right in ridiculing me.</p>

Because I live in a world where the government would NEVER mess with their own citizens, NEVER try to pass legislation to legalize propaganda, NEVER try to authorize the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens that &quot;they&quot; deem a threat, never spy on it&#39;s own people by reading their emails or listening to their phone calls.

    <div class="md"><p>no my response was to call you paranoid, because you claimed I made a threat when I didn&#39;t. When someone sees threats that aren&#39;t there, its the very definition of paranoia.</p>

<p>paranoia (n): 1) A mental condition characterized by delusions of persecution, unwarranted jealousy, or exaggerated self-importance, typically elaborated into an organized system 2)Suspicion and mistrust of people or their actions without evidence or justification.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This isn&#39;t 2001. It&#39;s 2013. The game is on.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>seems like exagerated self importance</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the threat I expected.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be a delusion of persecution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your conspiracy theories in general </p>
</blockquote>

<p>are the paranoia being elaborated into organized systems</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are not representative of the government than maybe you should ask yourself why you sound like their mouthpiece.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that would be: Suspicion and mistrust of people or their actions without evidence or justification</p>

<p>But of course you are right, YOU HAVE THE ONE AND ONLY TRUTH and any evidence to the contrary is to be overlooked because obviously its THE EVIL POWERS AT WORK. You aren&#39;t delusional at all you are a FREEDOM FIGHTER, meant to save to world from EVIL, you and those like you ARE THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN FREEDOM AND TYRANNY. Right?</p>

<p>For some reason I doubt this, mostly because one of your previous posts was in response to a person that was complaining of depression. Your &quot;expert&quot; information was to tell him that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/127b54/there_is_very_little_good_in_my_life/c6swkxf">we are all living in a computer simulation</a>. Which in itself (as you claim you should already know) is a sign of mental illness. That belief right there is a classic sign of being disassociated with reality. Then again, you could actually have the degree, but that doesn&#39;t mean that you have a good grasp on reality. I certainly hope you aren&#39;t actually in charge of another person&#39;s mental well being. Let&#39;s not ignore the fact that you went to an EXTREMELY small religious orientated college in Missouri, one that does not even get ranked on the national level. I wonder if you going to a religious school could have anything to do with your obsession with propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>legislation was introduced to legalize the government use of propaganda against it&#39;s own citizens, which fortunately didn&#39;t pass</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you admit that the government nefarious plot to legalize propaganda, didn&#39;t actually work.  And if so why are you still using it as evidence? Can you link me to the bill that you are referring to, or is this just something you heard about from somebody else? Also if they are already doing it, why would they need to legalize it? Especially since 99% of your theories involve the government doing illegal activities, why worry about legalizing such a small part of their &quot;nefarious&quot; plan?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>according to you the government would be exempt from doing this. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never made such a claim at all. You are so obsessed with your delusions that you can&#39;t allow any grey area in beliefs can you? In your mind it really is US vs THEM. And anyone who doesn&#39;t adhere to your beliefs absolutely has to be in on the nefarious plot. The fact you have to make up claims for me shows that you have no real interest in intellectual discourse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my preliminary diagnosis would be either: ignorant, naive, or a troll.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So do those show up in the DSM? because I don&#39;t remember ignorance or naivety actually being a sign of mental illness. Then again it seems you&#39;re not really sure what &#39;diagnosis&#39; means.</p>

<p>First off, of course you wouldn&#39;t answer the questions because you would have to show a middle ground that includes skepticism. </p>

<p>Secondly, I&#39;m sure you realize that philosophy is rich with people trying to understand reality and what it is we are doing here. Whether we are living in a computer simulation, I will refer you to the M.I.T. and university of Washington research into these theories, which they are doing. </p>

<p>Sidenotes: lindenwood university was founded as a private religious university but is totally secular now. </p>

<p>Finally, because you are either uninformed or a troll, I refer you to: <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mhastings/congressmen-seek-to-lift-propaganda-ban">www.buzzfeed.com/mhastings/congressmen-seek-to-lift-propaganda-ban</a></p>

<p>Now since it is obvoius that instead of addressing my arguments you would rather follow your own &quot;brilliant&quot; tactical plan of addressing &quot;would-be troll slayers&quot; and suggest to &quot;Distort their words and make unfair analogies&quot;, then it&#39;s obvious that you are not interested in adding to the real discussion people are having about Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>Additionally, you don&#39;t &quot;3) Know your shit&quot; as you recommend, as evidenced by your lack of knowledge about the propaganda proposal, with propaganda being legal in the past in the u.s. </p>

<p>Also, when you &quot;5) Spend time on formatting&quot; it doesn&#39;t make up for your shiity argument skills.  It looks like a lot of wasted time. A turd that is polished is still a turd. </p>

<p>And finally, if I am the troll, what agenda would I be pushing besides skepticism? </p>

<p>Way to yet again misrepresent me as I did answer your questions. Obviously you are on the logical high ground yet again. /s</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually their website says otherwise. It specifically states that they are rooted in Judeo-Christian values. Maybe you should be the one to make sure you know your shit. Especially in regards to an institution you claim as your alma mater. As for the the propaganda bill: we weren&#39;t discussing that until you brought it up as &quot;evidence&quot; of nefarious government plots, and as you&#39;ve previously stated (and now provided evidence for) it never actually happened. But feel free, to insist this is about Sandy Hook even though not a single post of yours has been on that topic but instead filled with ill defined paranoid ramblings about vague government plots. You hold others to the task of answer your questions (then ignore their answers and act like they didnt respond) but never actually hold yourself to that same responsibility.</p>

<p>Which isn&#39;t a threat at all but you interpreted it as such. And to reiterate, seeing threats that aren&#39;t there is a sign of paranoia.  And I am more than willing to put money on the fact  that there is not going to be a significant change in our government in the next year, let alone one brought on by conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>As for you &quot;daring&quot; questions.<br/>
1) yes<br/>
2)no<br/>
3)its not really the primary reason for that amendment but thats a different discussion<br/>
4) no to both. but there are MUCH MORE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS than 99% of conspiracy theories. Focusing on this type of bullshit is without merit and will lead to no changes.</p>

<p>Skepticism is healthy and I subscribe to this subreddit for lots of reasons; though most certainly not for trolling pleasure. It&#39;s one thing to question the official narrative - why it happened, who else was involved, etc. - but these kids are really and truly dead. Just like the people in the WTC buildings. Just like to OK bombing victims.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t really paid the whole thing much mind, and I don&#39;t really care. Kids die in fucked up ways everyday, and just because the MSM is trying to sell some ads doesn&#39;t mean I am going to get worked up over it. </p>

<p>From what I gather yes, people did die in CT, WTC, and OKC. The who, what, when, where, and why is something only a few people in the world know. </p>

<p>Anyway, don&#39;t assume someones POV. Ill give you the BOD and say you didn&#39;t know I was OP. </p>

<p>And just because I believe something to be true, doesn&#39;t mean someone, who has had a whole other perspective on life, is &quot;sick&quot; for questioning anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that is the <strong><em>expected</em></strong> reaction. People often act strangely after a death, or even lesser events such as being betrayed by someone close to you or being left by your long term significant other. Some get angry, some cry, some wallow in depression and/or isolation, and some try to diffuse their own emotions with laughter. It&#39;s common, and you are literally wrong for thinking otherwise. Just because it doesn&#39;t &quot;seem right&quot; or goes against some &quot;gut feeling&quot;, doesn&#39;t make it wrong.

To say I am not a Pearl Jam fan is an understatement. After asserting that I would not be caught dead at a Pearl Jam show, they&#39;d ask why there was a picture of me front and center at a PJ concert in Rolling Stone. I went and looked and sure enough, there I was at a Pearl Jam concert passing Eddy Vedder around like I was loving it. This person looked exactly like me, except the were wearing a bandana which also would never happen. Sometimes people look like other people. I know crisis actors have played a part in other shootings, etc, yet sometimes senseless violence is senseless violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>for the record i completely respect this question. im not one to jump on a conspiracy wagon but i have to say this is all very real and these things that are popping up in the media are very logical and should not be over looked. However, all is rising and the police/government still wont disclose the school video tape of the gunman at least entering the school very odd. if you look at the columbine shooting you can find evidence of the gunman at least inside the school. but for a tragedy that has received so much negative attention by millions of people such as &#39;The Sandy Hook Tragedy&#39; and to not provide one piece of real hard evidence available for the public eye. I find this bewildering and quite honestly disappointing regardless of the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Despite everyone on Reddit&#39;s claims to the contrary, the public at large has almost no truck with Reddit or with conspiracy theories. You have to look for this stuff; it doesn&#39;t show up in the media that most people consume. I have many FOFs that lost kids and knew the teachers, but seriously what do you expect? If I dragged even one of them here for, what, a video confession (NOT going to happen BTW), that would be viewed with as much suspicion as just saying, &quot;I knew someone&quot;. What if you had pictures of the dead? It would just be a place &quot;to start&quot;, right? Then it would break down into wound analysis and on and on and on. This is not my first conspiracy rodeo, I am well-versed in the nasty jazz this country and the elites perpetrate, however I am 100% sure that there are 28 dead people in Newtown. I find it unbelievable that the govt. could penetrate my social network to the depth it did in order to make me get on this page here and attempt to convince you otherwise. </p>
