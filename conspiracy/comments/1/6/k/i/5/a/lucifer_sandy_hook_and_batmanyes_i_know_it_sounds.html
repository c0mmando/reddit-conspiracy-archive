       Let's start with the Bible.  Isaiah 14:12
      </p>
      <p>
       How you have fallen from heaven,
O morning star, son of the dawn!
You have been cast down to the earth,
you who once laid low the nations!
      </p>
      <p>
       So who is this "son of the dawn"?  It is Lucifer.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So what right?  Well for one thing Sandy Hook took place on 12/14/12.  In other words the day it takes place references a Bible verse on Lucifer.  That's pretty thin you are saying at this point right?  Well, what was the name of the Principal at Sandy Hook?  Dawn Hochsprung (Lucifer is literally Bringer of Dawn).  At this point you are thinking that is still pretty thin right? Well first let me remind you that
       <a href="http://www.pakalertpress.com/2012/12/17/sandy-hook-reference-in-batman-dark-knight-rises-movie/">
        Sandy Hook
       </a>
       was literally referenced in the Dark Knight Rises, but in addition to that there was one other massacre related to this movie rememeber?  Aurora Colorado.  What does that have to do with anything?  Aurora literally means "Dawn"! In fact, like Lucifer, Aurora is a deity specifically related to Dawn:
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(mythology)">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(mythology)
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to recount we have two different slayings.  Both have connections to the word Dawn, the Dark Knight Rises, and deities related to Dawn.  Now if that isn't enough the Batman series itself is thematically related to Dawn.  Here, for instance, is  the series posters together.
       <a href="http://imgur.com/DG0k9">
        http://imgur.com/DG0k9
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how they depict dawn?  The first one is dusk, the second one is night, and the last one is Dawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should read the entirety of Isaiah 14 there are not only many Parallels with the Dark Knight Rises but also the establishment of Zion.

       Thanks for sharing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unfortunate that so many redditors discount any reference to "the Bible" so readily.  I personally think that people should listen to what you have to say, even if they have a non-religious worldview.  Particularly when you're not saying, "The Bible is true", but only stating that the date could be an esoteric reference to the verse.  Since there is ample evidence of Biblical references in culture, one would think such a claim would be unoffensive.  Oh well.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, I agree that there's a shared meaning between Dawn/Lucifer/Morning Star, etc..  I am leery of foundations or organizations that name themselves along such themes.  I also believe the occult exists and plans events on certain dates that have esoteric meaning, and they often hide these plans in plain sight.

       Yeah, because it's referencing the dawn remark Harvey Dent made in the previous movie and the "Rising" motif the movie revolves around.

       I didn't know Dent said that in the previous movie.  In doesn't disprove what I am saying.  It actually strengthens my case that there is a dawn motif.  Which makes it all the stranger that there was a dawn motif in Aurora (deity related  to dawn just as Lucifer is) and in Sandy Hook - Dawn Hochsprung.  If I am not mistaken Hochsprung even means something pretty damn close to rising.  And I am also pretty sure that Batman in the series has some other parallels to Satan as well, such as being cast down into a pit.  Not to mention the fact that the word "Sandy Hook" is actually literally printed in the film.

       Not at all.  Although I do think power of any form tends to corrupt.

      <p>
       Edit:  Also I am not completely ignorant of this subject, although I haven't studied it in depth.  It is my understanding that numerology is an occult practice, and it therefore makes sense to me that some cult might find numerological significance to certain dates.  In fact I think it is a non-controversial fact that certain astrological occurrences such as solstices are most definitely associated with occult practices are they not?

      <p>
       The I-ching was about foretelling the future so saying it is a corollary to Western psychology is incorrect.  In yoga one of the things you can develop are the Siddhis which is what in the west would be called psi powers.  I really don't know why you are trying to dress up the occult to make it sound like it doesn't have to do with psi.

       No.  If someone studies the occult they are trying to figure out how to do magick.

       Did you look at that screenshot I gave you of Sandy Hook being in the Dark Knight Rises?  Isn't that a little odd that there is a shooting at the premiere of the Batman movies and in the movie the name of where the next shooting takes place is in the movie?  How is that not like a sigil being used to bring about an event?

       No, again all you are saying is that there can never be a connection between anything since it could always just be someone finding connections between random data.  But not everything is coincidence.  Also, you are just as likely to be guilty of confirmation bias as me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your reasoning is flawed.  Think of it this way:  there are several murders in a town that have certain elements in common - if you were the detective this would go on for years with because in your mind these apparent connections were just coincidence.  The murders would go on for years until a new detective got on the case and said "hey, maybe this isn't just coincidence, maybe its the same guy."  He calls you to get your opinion - "don't be silly, it's just confirmation bias" you say.

       No, it's more like your suspected killer lives on 21 Baker Street, and you figured this out on Dec 21 (and so he
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be the killer!), and noticed that the street name "Baker" relates to the bakery where the bodies were discovered. Case closed!

       Wait a minute...you do admit that there is a dawn theme in the movies correct?  That being the case why are you so quick to dismiss out of hand that the fact that the killings took place in a town named after a deity of the dawn is pure coincidence?  How do you know James Holmes wasn't aware of this connection?

       When did I say "there can never be a connection between anything"? I didn't. I was saying that YOU have confirmation bias. That's like grabbing two boxes of crayons from different companies and saying they MUST be made by the same people because some of the crayons from each box are the same colors.

       The dawn is and always has been a very powerful sign to people, usually standing for rebirth or a new beginning.  Its a common motif throughout literature, movies/TV, and history.

        The plane is path 27 (Peh, Mouth) and is right underneath Tiphareth signifying the sun, therefore (by a stretch) it could also imply dawn.

       Could you tell me more about this.  I am particularly interested in the number 27 (and 72), I could be mistaken but I have repeatedly seen it come up lately - it seems to have some kind of ritual or numerologic significance.  I actually wrote about 27 and 72 in connection with the Dark Knight Rises in another thread so its pretty damn interesting that I see you bring it up.

       I get what you are saying.  The weird thing is that I had developed this idea that Batman was Lucifer so I was doing research starting on the wiki
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">
        page
       </a>
       and the first thing it mentioned was the Isaiah verse, and when I read that I was kind taken aback to see it mentioned "son of dawn" since I was already aware of the dawn theme in the movies.  I also knew that both the word Aurora and Sandy Hook were in the
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p41_5KLhApg">
        DKR
       </a>
       .  I mean, at a bare minimum you got to admit that is a lot of weird connections.
