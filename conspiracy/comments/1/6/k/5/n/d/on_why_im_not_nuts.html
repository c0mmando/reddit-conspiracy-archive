        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">57</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-01-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/sizzletron.html">sizzletron</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s been almost 20 years since this happened to me but I thought I&#39;d get around to writing this down... This actually happened to me. This did not come from the internet.</p>

<p>In Canada, round about 1996-97 the Quebec Separation issue was ubiquitous. Lucien Bouchard was the most hated man in Anglo-Canada and you couldn&#39;t open a newspaper or turn on the news without being driven nuts by it all.</p>

<p>Back then I was very interested in the news. I listened to CKNW whenever possible and read the paper every morning at work. I opened the paint store I was working at every morning at 7am. I would read the paper in the manager&#39;s office, hoping no customers would materialize.</p>

<p>One day whilst perusing the Globe &amp; Mail, for some reason, I was scanning the classified ads. Don&#39;t ask me why, they are as dull as paint drying. But being news centric, I spotted a tiny ad about the referendum. It said something like this:&quot;Are you sick of Quebec Separation? Are you tired of Quebec always wanting their way? Is Separation the end of Canada? Call Helen Burke at: 905-xxx-xxxx&quot; And for some reason I clipped out this tiny, tiny ad, and put it in my wallet. Upon arriving at home after work, I stuck it to the fridge with a magnet and promptly forgot about it.</p>

<p>Six months or so pass and that ad is a distant memory. I wake up one Saturday morning with the long-weekend off and not a dime to my name. Ohh the self-sorrow I feel. I am making coffee and open the fridge to discover there&#39;s no cream. Oh, woe is me. As I close the fridge door, I spot this little ad. I slowly recall what it was, and how I planned to call this number one day. So I decide today is the day; I will distract myself from the ominous penniless long-weekend by calling the lady in this ad.</p>

<p>I truck my scalding hot coffee to the living room, ad in hand. Setting down on the sofa I reacquaint myself with the details. I have to know who to ask for, after all. And I dial....</p>

<p>A few rings later a woman&#39;s voice comes on the line, &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>

<p>My reply is quick if distracted, &quot;Hi, my name is Mike, I&#39;m calling about the classified ad you posted in the Globe &amp; Mail six months ago.&quot;</p>

<p>She replies with a gasp and a labored exhalation. She can&#39;t believe someone has seen it and I concur; the referendum is ubiquitous. It&#39;s at this point where things became strange. She asks me why I&#39;m calling. I tell her it&#39;s about the Quebec Separation ad she posted in the G&amp;M and I read it to her.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s not the ad I posted!&quot; she protests. I ask her what she means. It turns out her name isn&#39;t Helen Burke, it&#39;s Helen Boychuk. And her ad wasn&#39;t about Quebec,-- it was a petition to other victims of Dr Ewen Cameron&#39;s LSD/psycho-torture research on behalf on the CIA in the late 1950s and early 1960s, to come forward and share the details of their encounters. I repeated the ad to her, word for word. And proceeded to talk with her about all of this. She told me of the experiments she was subjected to, the drugs, the films and video she watched, the music in the headphones and of the psychiatrists and psychologists. She was clearly paranoid. I don&#39;t say that to smear her credibility. This woman was terrified for her very life. She was convinced they were poisoning her through the taps in her apartment and they were spying on her, on her phone calls, and following her.</p>

<p>I wrapped up with her after about 90 minutes and hung up. Quite frankly I didn&#39;t know what to think. All I knew at that moment was I had something to distract me for the duration of my poverty long-weekend. More than enough.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, I turned on the TV and there on CBC was a <a href="http://youtu.be/idybBPDIt4g">(Fifth Estate/Passionate Eye, I don&#39;t recall exactly)</a> documentary about how the US Government was FINALLY, after 40 years admitting the CIA had in fact been performing mind-control, brainwashing experiments at McGill University in Montreal and they were (<em>what&#39;s that, I can&#39;t hear you, could you please say that a little louder?</em>) ahem, sorry. The doc&#39;s focus was twofold: 1) Had the American CIA in fact done this? and 2) How did this happen at a Canadian University to Canadian Citizens?</p>

<p>The conclusion was something along the lines of mortal disbelief at the fact that this happened with the blessing of the Canadian Government, that they used persons with mental illnesses and that they had covered it up.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say the MOST notable thing I took from this encounter was this: Some person or persons at the Globe &amp; Mail saw her ad, changed the content of the ad to something so boring and ubiquitous as to never be noticed, much less taken seriously and Ms Boychuk&#39;s name was changed.</p>

<p>You tell me what to think about all of that...</p>

<p>For example the McGill university fails to mention Cameron&#39;s gruesome experiments on its official website.

<p>The former Former Nebraska State Senator, author and attorney, John DeCamp believes that former CIA-director William E. Colby was murdered because he wanted to warn the world of the danger of mind control and help to stop still ongoing projects [podcast about 1 hour long].

    <div class="md"><p>The USA took nazi scientists and doctors after the war into their own.  It&#39;s not surprising that unethical medical experiments such as these continue.  They fit the pattern.  Look at the operation where the CIA got prostitutes to dose johns with LSD and studied them from behind one way glass.   Monstrous.  Probably Owsley, the Merry Pranksters and the Dead were all involved in the scheme.. Where did Ken Kesey get the acid from - sandoz?  And he was an all american football playing boy... just like Jim Morrison.    </p>
