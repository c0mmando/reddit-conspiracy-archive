       Everything I have seen about 911 seems to make the way it happened (as we've been told) about as likely as JFK's magic bullet. Can anyone enlighten me how some guy in a cave arranged the most devastating attack ever on the most heavily guarded technologically sophisticated civilization in the history of the planet? How did building 7 magically fall on its own, etc?

      </p>
      <p>
       This movie presents a mountain of evidence that implicates Israel and many non-Israeli Jews in 9/11 and other false flag operations.  Watching all of it will leave you with no doubt about who was responsible for 9/11.  However, even watching bits and pieces of this film is highly educational and recommended.

       Civil rights movements are the most obvious examples. The Mexican-American War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and our ongoing "conflicts" in the Middle East. Whether you agree or not depends on what rhetoric you subscribe too...

       Yeah... Don't act like you're interested in having a serious conversation when you're not. If you can't understand why the events I mentioned are "relevant," then why are you here? It's going to take at least six months if not longer for a proper investigation to take place. It's too early and sensationalized to just assume either side of the story is reality. The only reality is that the main stream cable news did a good job fucking over their credibility and I'm not surprised people are turning to alternative sources for information.

       Well, if you admit that evidence won't appear for months, why are you making claims? You should default to the only explanation we have that's backed by evidence, which is the official story, when you have no other evidence.

       Point out the racial hatred then. If someone is a Jew and they are suspected of doing something wrong it isn't racial hatred to ask questions about that. What do you want? Do your want Jewish people to be excused from questioning because they are Jewish? Honesty, you're making a fool out of yourself with the anti-Semitic crying shit. It's already really fucking old and overused and you're actually weakening the term anti-semitism by bitching when someone says Jew.

       I posted the link to the hate speech laws.  I'm doing you and the rest of the subreddit a favor.  If you made the same claim about native americans, or even indians I'd be just as vehement.  you don't even understand what it means.  i won't teach you.  go ahead and post your hate speech.  don't say you weren't warned.

       Fuck the laws, they are biased. I'm sorry, Jews in the present day do not get a free pass because of the Holocaust. It makes no sense whatsoever to give a section of religion or society a free pass because of a past incident. Should Ukrainians be exempt from criticism or questions because three million of them were killed by the Nazis? So no, Jews get no free pass at all and no one deserved a free pass from criticism.

       not in Canada, or Germany, or many countries.. maybe it's ok to incite racial hatred in the UK.   go look up the hate speech laws in Canada for example.  it's clear to me that the above poster shows a pattern of inciting racial hatred.   I hope he tries to come to Canada one day.

      <p>
       "German prosecutors charged Zündel on July 19, 2005, with fourteen counts of inciting racial hatred, which is punishable under German criminal law, Section 130, 2.(3) (Agitation (sedition) of the People) with up to 5 years in prison. The indictment says Zündel "denied the fate of destruction for the Jews planned by National Socialist powerholders and justified this by saying that the mass destruction in Auschwitz and Treblinka, among others, were an invention of the Jews and served the repression and extortion of the German people.""

       So if someone does something that makes you hate them you aren't allowed to bring it up for fear of people hating them for it? I don't know what I believe but what you believe is "shut up, move along, nothing to see here, someone might get upset"

       Because they aren't people in caves, you ignorant racist moron.
      </p>
      <p>
       Building 7? Seriously? Building 7 fell because a giant skyscraper fell on it, which set it aflame, and it burned for 8 HOURS. The structural integrity of the building was significantly weakened by the heat, and it caused a collapse in one floor near the middle of the building. This caused a chain reaction of structural failures, and the building internally collapsed. It basically seemed to implode because of this. The walls of the building were left standing, but the floors had already caved in; the walls were an empty shell with nothing inside of them. When they fell, they fell straight down like cardboard because they were light. It made for an effect resembling a demolition, with the important difference being that the blast was not controlled and spread debris everywhere, something demolitions do not, and the fact that the roof can be seen to fall several seconds before the walls do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a dozen buildings around the trade center were damaged to the point of needing to be demolished. They just didn't fall like 7 did, but they might well have fallen.

       Does reading the report mean you have an actual understanding of the physical properties of materials, the changes they make when certain forces are applied, chemical reactions, thermodynamics, statics, and Newtonian laws of energy and matter? Intern meaning you have no real way to gauge for yourself wether the report was written taking into account for all variables and if it correct or not.

       I have a basic understanding of all of these topics that everyone who paid attention in high school can learn. In short, I know enough to spot complete bullshit, and I know enough to understand when something is plausible. I also have enough of an understanding of science to know that a report that is supported by the vast majority consensus of experts is very likely to be accurate.

       You said it yourself... They didn't fall like 7 did because they were eviscerated by debris, no falling took place... Unlike 7 which collapsed into

       It did not collapse into dust. Did you read what I wrote? The outer walls, the thin, light, nothing that they are, appeared to fall into dust because they caved in unsupported.

       I'm sure he did read what you wrote. Why should what you wrote be considered truth? As someone who holds evidence in such high regard, surely you accept multiple witness accounts is of greater empirical value than just yours. In other terms, what you wrote should not be taken as truth or evidence. Research should be conducted if it has not already been, and a decision made at that point, for EITHER position.

       My point is that you're just here to troll and not provide any meaningful discussion.  And I'm willing to bet that you're using a new username to avoid detection as a known troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet has all kinds of wonderful information for anyone willing to search for it.  You're not willing to have an open mind even in the face of known conspiracy facts.  The corporate media has turned the phrase conspiracy theorist into an insult.

       No, it's due to your attitude and the way you say things. It has nothing to do with the points you bring up. I'm positive you are intelligent enough to recognize this.

       I've given enough information for you to start to question what the corporate media is pushing.  The news cycle is agenda driven.  Things don't just happen without an end result in mind.  Any time something happens who benefits?  Not the average citizen.  The powers that be want to control everything and gradually take away our freedom.  All that's required is to have an open mind and to use the internet while it's still available.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again there are no bullshit conspiracy facts that have been proven.  These should show that things are often not what they seem to be and the corporate media won't provide meaningful information about them.

       No. You. Have. Not. You have done nothing. You have not answered a single one of my questions, nor have you explained anything. You just want to ask stupid questions and find "inconsistencies," whatever the fuck that means, in the official story. You are twisting the world to fit your explanations and you won't listen to anything else.

       That wasn't the only question. So why was thermite found there? How is it that heat from jet fuel damaged the iron rods beyond a point which is possible and a couple thousand architects and engineers, many of which are demolition experts, agree its not possible? It is literally impossible from every study I've seen. Most importantly, why the thermite?

       How else could it have happened, if not the generally accepted account?   Yes, the attacks of 9/11 were improbable.  But they happened only once.  Merely because an improbable thing happens once does not mean it can't happen.

       Not to stoke the fire (no pun intended... maybe), but has anyone either verified or debunked the independent analyses that discovered thermite in the WTC ash? Unless there is a chemical reaction that takes place during the course of a building's destruction or a building material that is composed partly of thermite, what's the explanation? Always been a question to me as well, something independent researchers seem to have discovered but never to my recollection made it into MSM reports, even in an effort to debunk it. But then again, the MSM also never brought up the travesty that Bush's inaugural ceremony cost $40 million to put on and the 9/11 Commission, when told to investigate the single worst direct attack on U.S. soil, only received $12 million in funding.

        How is it that heat from jet fuel damaged the iron rods beyond a point which is possible and a couple thousand architects and engineers, many of which are demolition experts, agree its not possible?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Source please. The steel was only heated up a little, not damaged. Steel is notorious for becoming extremely weak when heated up. You don't have to melt it, just get it hot. If you're assuming it was melted, as most of those people are, then it is impossible. But it doesn't need to melt to become weak.

       Source please. I highly doubt this claim, but even if it were true, what would it matter? What are you implying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, use a little critical thinking here. We have two explanations:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Furious, religiously inspired fanatics learned to pilot a large plain, something not difficult to do with a little practice (landing is the hardest bit, which they didn't really plan on doing). They took over 4 unguarded planes and crashed them into two enormous towers and the pentagon. The structural damage caused by the impact and the heat caused by both the burning of a HUGE quantity of jet fuel (enough to cross the ocean, which is a LOT) and of the buildings themselves weakened the integrity of the building over several hours to a breaking point, and they collapsed. Debris from these towers damaged nearby buildings, and set fire to them too. Over 8 hours of burning, one collapsed, several others had to be torn down.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The government, or a secret society, led by people whom you don't name, through methods you can't name, managed to plant explosives in these two icons of America, and for no reason in Tower 7, to demolish them. They hijacked their own planes and flew them into buildings as an excuse. They caused billions of dollars of damage and thousands of American deaths for... no reason at all other than to go to war with Afghanistan, a war which has cost trillions of dollars.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Really, which of these seems more likely? Which better explains the situation? Which has more proof? Which makes fewer assumptions?

       Man I don't even know where to even start with this. I'm about to crash, long day tomorrow. I will pick this back up tomorrow and provide sources. Generally speaking, what you seem to be is stuck in your position without knowing all of the evidence. I, on the other hand, am open minded to both sides- I just want to know the truth, wherever that leads. You seem to be the type of person that wants to believe something, and discounts anything that may lead away from that direction. Moreover what you do is take something that you don't understand, fit it into a box that you do understand, and then defend your narrow version no matter what- in a rude condescending way. Not as an analytical thinker. You invoke emotion into a strictly fact finding, theory testing conversation. Until tomorrow...

       Much the opposite, my friend. I examined both positions thoroughly, and discovered that one was completely lacking in compelling evidence and almost certainly wrong, while the other wasn't. Not all ideas are equal. You're the one holding them up as though they're equal, when one must be right and one wrong, and the evidence suggest that the conspiracy theory is wrong.

       For realz, I asked for you to show me some hard evidence about thermite being found at the crash site and you gave me an interview from a website who's motives are totally biased, from someone who has absolutely no expertise in the field. The question is "what caused the molten steel?", and the answer you have gravitated towards is thermite, simply because it confirms your preconceived notions, despite their being no hard evidence to suggest that more than anything else. Then when I reject the validity of your source (because of the afore mentioned reasons) you totally cop out of the debate. A great attitude for someone who "knows" and wants to spread the "truth". You guys make me chuckle.

       I'm sorry I don't spend my Saturday mornings jerking off in front of reddit. I just got home from coaching a game and have appointments for much of today. I said I would look into it this weekend and yet Saturday morning you're berating me already. I'm going to look into it to see if I can find anything that confirms what I have heard. Not that it's 100% what happened because who knows. I'm sure you're more knowledgeable that those first responders anyway. The fact if the matter is that you make the whole fact finding process miserable. You need to try and one up and make someone feel stupid to make your own shabby, pointless, miserable existence seem worthwhile. Your life must really suck that you actually came back here to try and throw a shot at me on Saturday morning. My guess, you never get laid, you don't make much money, you have very few friends and the ones you have are all like you because that makes you feel normal. You will never achieve anything or enjoy life if you don't get the chip off your shoulder. Deep down inside you know theres something wring when you lay down in bed at night. Let go of all your childlike angst, open your mind and start over. The road you're on leads to a dark place.

       You don't really get into the nitty gritty stuff in a high school education class. Having an understanding of physics and material properties isn't an easy concept to grasp. Metals go through chemical changes when certain amount I heat is applied and there are structural changes on an atomic level. I'm not saying the reports are right are wrong but you yourself are not certified to state with a 100% certainty that the information is correct. Can you yourself be absolutely sure beyond a reason of a doubt?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you say yes then you are a lair cause you can't prove it for yourself or discuss the topic on a level of understanding and knowledge that is required.

       Several members of the 9/11 commission who were assigned to compile the official investigation and evidence said, and i quote "set up to fail" and "were starved of funds to do a proper investigation." How am I supposed to put faith in the official story if these people think its bullshit?

       I don't know what happened, but I'm certain the American government intentionally sabotaged the commission report 
with delays, underfunding and lack of co-operation.

       I'm only posting here because of your attitude - so further generalizing isn't going to make you seem like some sort of intellectual.
