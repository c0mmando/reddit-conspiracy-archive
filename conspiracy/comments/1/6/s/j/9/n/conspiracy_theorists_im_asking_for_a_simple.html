       The operation was probably done by an unnamed agency, or unnamed group of people who have the power to. They know and plan this.

       They planned this operation to remove our rights. As citizens of America, they rip our right away from us, in order to secure their futures. If we have weapons we could protect ourselves from any bad. They also think we are too dumb to hold any sort of dangerous item, and  irresponsible.

       So they have their team go in and kill a class full of kids (or fake it) which most likely happened. Then have Adam Lanza's body, or use him all drugged up as a scape goat. Look up scopolamine. After that they use their control on the scene and only release certain information. Have the actors ready, and boom. Then pay the people like Anderson cooper, to talk about it one way.

       If Buddhaspader has an opinion, he should be able to back it up with some semblance of reason/logic. simple as that. otherwise, he'd just be making wild, unfounded claims to suit his own arbitrary image of the country, it's government, and the world.

       Actually, opinions don't count in your eyes unless he cites links from CNN, BBC, or some other major news outlet.  You accept those media outlets as the basis of fact, and any differing story is some crazy conspiracy.  That is a problem, the fact that people come out so strongly against anyone with a differing version than some paid-for news organization with an agenda.

       Actually, it's the other way round. You're accepting the conspiracy theory as fact, and you're clearly unable to even come up with the most basic evidence to support your claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not afraid of a "differing story" - he is just calmly and honestly asking you to provide evidence to backup the claims you are making.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you are clearly unable to do this speaks volumes about your movement.

       No, it's not the other way around at all.  After researching an d paying attention to the events that transpired, there are clearly many differing accounts as to the facts in the case.  Many of those conflicting reports were reported by your beloved news outlets.  Finally, they decide on an "official" story to pacify people, despite the fact that there are still so many contradictions and unanswered questions.  Any attempt to revisit those inconsistencies and conflicting reports and address them is met with a fury of name-calling and attempts at discrediting....So in reality, unless I accept the media's version as "fact," and base all of my opinions on the assumption that the media is telling the correct story, I am some crazy conspiracy theorist?  It's sad that some people are as naive as you are.  I'm glad I'm not one of them.

       "your beloved news outlets"

       Please don't presume my perspective for me. What the fuck do you know about me?
      </p>
      <p>
       " Finally, they decide on an "official" story to pacify people, despite the fact that there are still so many contradictions and unanswered questions."
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is "they" - were you privy to these conversations? Do you have evidence to back this up? What are the names of the people involved in making this decision?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Any attempt to revisit those inconsistencies and conflicting reports and address them is met with a fury of name-calling and attempts at discrediting."
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking you for evidence is not the same as "name-calling and attempts at discrediting"
      </p>
      <p>
       "So in reality, unless I accept the media's version as "fact," and base all of my opinions on the assumption that the media is telling the correct story, I am some crazy conspiracy theorist? "
      </p>
      <p>
       No - but when you accept the conspiracy theory as fact WITHOUT evidence to support your belief or the original claim - THEN you are a crazy conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       " It's sad that some people are as naive as you are. I'm glad I'm not one of them."
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it's the other way around. Unlike you, my opinion can change - I just need to see the evidence, and simply insisting that anything the "mainstream media" says is automatically part of a conspiracy is not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason we correctly refer to people like you as "crazy conspiracy theorists" (which IS what you are) is because we can easily PREDICT your behaviour beforehand. I know full well before even coming to a place like this the exact kind of things you guys are going to come out with.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bomb goes off in the US tomorrow - I know automatically that you won't believe ANY official "mainstream" report and WILL AUTOMATICALLY start blurting out the OFFICIAL CONSPIRACY theory as made up by Alex Jones and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because nothing says "independent thinker" like the automatic rejection of one story and automatic acceptance of another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you are arguing against having to support evidence to back up your claims proves beyond any doubt that you are not interested in the truth.

       Like everything related to conspiracy theorists like you - the direct opposite of what you said is the correct answer.

       My opinion of you stems solely from the fact that you are arguing against me and others in here simply because we have asked you for some evidence to support your claims.

       "We" are asking me to back up my claims?  It's just you, you tool.  You have no following in here.  Stop trying to make like you have this army of internet losers backing you up, because I'm pretty sure you are in the wrong subreddit if you expect anyone to echo your hollow calls for CNN to be the be-all, end-all fact provider.

       If you have no actual thought processes behind your claims, that's fine. Just say so. But if you used any sort of thought patterns at all to arrive at the original conclusion, then that is what I wanted you to share. If not, you can keep your accusations of everyone but you being tools of the system to yourself, and for future reference, try not being and ass to people for no reason. I think you'll find people more apt to listen to you.

Look up scopolamine. After that they use their control on the scene and only release certain information. Have the actors ready, and boom.

       You're asking for proof which is hard to get. The main cause of speculation is blatant faults in official reports, people telling different stories, and the medical examiners and supposed "parents" laughing (wtf? Your kid just died and you're smiling and laughing?)

       LAUGHING? Is that what you saw? Really? He was hyperventilating. He was taking deep breaths. Seconds before he would go on national TV, he tried to collect his broken wits to keep himself from fucking breaking into tears. Maybe he thought of his daughters smiling face and got a second of relief, had one brief moment where he smiled before snapping back to reality.

       How anyone could conclude he is an actor from that footage is absolutely beyond me.

       Sorry for "pissing in the popcorn", but your "parents laughing" "evidence" is total nonsense. I've seen people laughing at their family members' funerals, they are reminiscing about their loved one, remembering what he/she was like. They are reliving their happy memories with their family member, which causes them to smile. It's not unusual in the least.

       Irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       There absolutely is such a thing as a mostly homogenised modern day conspiracy movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of it stems from the likes of Alex Jones - just spend a bit of time in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and you get it all:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        chemtrails
       </li>
       <li>
        moon landings were faked
       </li>
       <li>
        sept 11th was a government conspiracy
       </li>
       <li>
        fluoride is a mind control agent put into water to control the population
       </li>
       <li>
        the jews are responsible for most things
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These conspiracy theories and many more asides are all related to the modern conspiracy movement. It is very rare to find someone online who believes sept 11th is a conspiracy but there's no truth to the chemtrails stuff, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who fall for this stuff tend to be weak minded and incapable of independent thought - they are especially poor at critical thinking, which is why they fall it all in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's therefore quite ironic that these same people accuse other, more intelligent people who are capable of critical thinking, of being "sheeple".
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at this thread. A guy just asking for evidence, and he gets called a "troll", and told, LITERALLY, that "we don't need evidence".
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, because your cult is religious and faith based, that's why.

       and just what the fuck do you think we are doing discussing this on r/conspiracy.. oh I see what you are saying.  Don't think for yourself.  Believe whatever authorities tell you, and leave it all to them. They only have your best interests at heart.  got it.

       I certainly can make claims without evidence.  My claim is that in my opinion these are actors.   My evidence is that they don't appear to me to emote real grief.  Specifically I refer to the lack of tears, breakdowns or real emotion (this may be subjective)

       What do you want next, evidence of my claim that God exists?  Moron.  Tell it to the Pope.

       You can claim what you want, but if nobody agrees with you, then it's not going to matter much.  In this case millions of us make the same claim.  Do you also want me to prove that money has intrinsic value?

       now you are getting it.   this is what r/conspiracy does.  if you'd been watching instead of trying to derail, the evidence is posted all over the subreddit.

       yes.  he asked for evidence of my opinion.  claim?  I don't know what it means, so how can I claim anything?  I feel that these people do not project real emotion.  and you want evidence that I observe that?

       hardly. but thanks the same.   these are the same types of people that would stop a jury from considering and evaluating evidence.  they would have the jury go and collect it themselves, while the defendants can hide whatever they like.

       I know you're being sarcastic, but not sure why.  Isn't it obviously a bot?  And why a douche?  Your reply feels more like a snap reaction  rather than a cognitive response.

       I asked for logic and reasoning. I didn't say link me to to a story. I didn't say tell me which news org. you watch. I didn't say anything of the sort. I said

       If you have no actual thought processes behind your claims, that's fine. Just say so. But if you used any sort of thought patterns at all to arrive at the original conclusion, then that is what I wanted you to share. If not, you can keep your accusations of everyone but you being tools of the system to yourself, and for future reference, try not being and ass to people for no reason. I think you'll find people more apt to listen to you.
