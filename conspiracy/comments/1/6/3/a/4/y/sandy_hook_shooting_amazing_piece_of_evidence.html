        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, I&#39;m trying to get my head around this to see if there is an explanation because this is really fucked up. </p>

<p><a href="http://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/emilie-parker-lead.jpg?w=600">This</a> girl, Emilie Parker, is supposed to have been killed in the Sandy hook shooting as mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">here</a>.</p>

<p>However when Obama came to visit just a few days later and met Robbie Parker(The girl&#39;s father) and his family, this <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/image/50e598a7eab8ea843100000d/obama.jpeg?maxX=590http://www.businessinsider.com/image/50e598a7eab8ea843100000d/obama.jpeg?maxX=590">girl</a> who looks extremely similar and is wearing the same dress an in the previous photo is there as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://tv.msnbc.com/2012/12/17/president-obama-guns-and-the-newtown-distinction/">This</a> article also says this about the photo: &quot;The president was photographed with several children during his visit to Newtownâ€”in one photo, seen here, he smiles with the surviving family members of victim Emilie Parker, 6.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it just me or is this totally fucked up? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in the original pics she has 2 youger sisters that are close to the smae age... when a kid gets a bit big for clothing (happens fast at this age) the clothing is passed onto the other kids who grow into it.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it much MUCH more likely that this is the same dress on a younger sister then it is that they fucked up so badly that they filmed the girl that was suppose to be dead?</p>

<p>This is about the 15th time I have read such a claim and I think it needs to die... This is a silly premise when given the fact that it has a much MUCH more believable, realistic and likely explanation then the one your claiming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why people are downvoting you. Sure, the Sandy Hook shooting is pretty sketchy all around, but some people need to learn when to stop with the speculation. There is absolutely NO WAY that if this <em>were</em> a coverup that they would let this slip. &quot;Rubbing it in your face&quot; makes no sense either, because if they really wanted to rub it in our face they wouldn&#39;t have tried to cover any of this up knowing full well that no average person could do anything about it.</p>

<p>I almost feel the same way about the speech that Robbie Parker gives. What&#39;s more likely; That this inside job &quot;actor,&quot; when faced with the knowledge that he is going to be broadcasted live across the nation, decides just 10 seconds ahead of time to break character and laugh with the possibility that it could be caught on camera. OR it&#39;s a nervous father who is doing his best to keep himself in check psychologically before giving the most important speech of his life, and feels that laughing (with whomever he was talking to beforehand) will help calm his nerves. Obviously he is not going to smile while talking about his dead daughter, but just because he does seconds before doing so doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he was &quot;getting into character&quot; to lie to millions of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not a father are you? I can tell because a father would spot this bullshit a mile away. No puffy eyes, no red stuffy nose from crying the past 2 days in a row. I tear up sometimes just thinking about my kids for no reason at all. Once you have kids you cannot think of anything else. They are a part of you. The emotional attachment is like nothing you&#39;ll ever experience until you have kids of your own. This my friend is not a father who&#39;s daughter was just murdered by a crazy gun toting killer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The explanation for fathers who murder their kids is that they are crazy. Pretty simple really. As for the rest of us normal parents we tend to react the same way. I&#39;ve never come across anyone yet who didn&#39;t cry when their child was killed. If you look at some of the other parent interviews you&#39;ll see the same thing. It&#39;s not a coincidence. One crazy dad who doesn&#39;t cry yea maybe. But 2-3 sets of parents with no apparent signs of grieving just days after their children were brutally murdered. Hell no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a father, if you found out your child was murdered by some psycho, chances are you&#39;d be so deep in grief that you would do/say/feel things that would surprise you. You can think about how you would feel now, and tear up, but that is not actually how you would feel, because deep down you know it&#39;s not real. When things get intense, the human mind can do strange things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of her sisters looks very similar to Emilie. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s figure out which is more likely...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Parker family has spent their entire lives in middle class obscurity. They went to college, made friends, started careers, paid bills...and all the while they were secretly a part of a plot to enslave mankind, including everyone they have ever met. After years of being sleeper agents, they were finally given their task...pretend that their daughter has been killed. This was the moment that they had spent their lives being prepared for. Then, they botched it by leaving the wrong daughter at home and accidentally bringing the one that is supposed to be dead to a massive media event.</p></li>
<li><p>The Parker daughter who looks very similar to the deceased Emilie wore her bigger sister&#39;s outfit because she looked up to her, wanted to pay tribute to her and had grown enough to wear it. Or, maybe the Parker family had not purchased new dress clothes for the girls since the last family photo, so they put the younger sister in Emilie&#39;s dress rather than go shopping during a difficult time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Whatever makes more sense to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a lawyer for when I need contracts etc worked out, and I am just barely scraping middle class. I find it almost laughable that you and others think that having a lawyer is some sort of evidence of living a charmed life. </p>

<p>When normal things are put under a microscope and obsessed over, they tend to look extraordinary, when really they aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>Some of us need actual evidence to back up extraordinary claims. Since adults do not simply pop into existence, then it should be relatively easy to track the lives of these people...but no one is figuring out their pasts...because it would likely show that these are all just normal, average people and not the Illuminati masterminds that they are painted as. A quick look over the life of Kaitlyn Roig will either show ties to the most powerful people on earth, or just normal middle class teacher stuff...and many conspiracy theorists seem unwilling to find out what that past may be, but will throw out unsupported accusations anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. If there is any particular person that you believe is an actor or some type of government agent, feel free to do some non-stalkerish research on them. People leave trails in 2013...so if you turn up info that someone worked for a defense contractor, then got plastic surgery, changed their name and moved to Sandy Hook in November, then you&#39;d have a REALLY interesting story that we can sink our teeth into. Thus far, I&#39;ve never seen a &quot;they are actors/government agents&quot; thread, article, pic or video that even tried to make any connections with the person&#39;s past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope more and more continue to search for the truth and never stop demanding evidence that confirms the official story.</p>

<p>Something is up and this could be the event that allows for real changes in this country.  And i don&#39;t mean Gun control.  </p>

<p>Information is real freedom and we should all Demand it.  we are not children and we can handle the truth no matter how distasteful. if they could release all the victims names the first day they could release the autopsy photos and or crime scene photos.  If the Government wants to use this event for sweeping changes then present all the facts.  I&#39;m sure if they had real facts they would be shoving them down our throats. </p>
