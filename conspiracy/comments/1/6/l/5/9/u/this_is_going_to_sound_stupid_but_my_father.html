    <div class="md"><p>ok serious answer here. i&#39;m going to kind of rush through this because i&#39;ve had a couple of rye and cokes and i don&#39;t want to ramble on. i have been collecting, for around 24 years, evidence that seems to indicate that there is a certain threshold of difference that is required in a multiverse for alternate Earths to remain separate. I call this the Theory of Conservation of Actuality. I&#39;ve had a couple of experiences that can only be explained by this myself, I&#39;ve spoken to someone who has experienced this, and I&#39;ve seen a massive wave of people who seem to have experienced this. A couple of years ago I saw a flood of people on ATS, IIRC, that all remembered New Zealand as having been on the west side of Australia. I think that reality is not nearly as solid as it appears to be. Convergent timelines. History diverges, but then things possibly happen on the divergent worlds that bring the alts back into harmony, and at a certain point, they are so similar that the multiverse just basically says &quot;ah close enough&quot; and smashes them back together again. Some people seem to appear to each other, some people merge with alternate versions of themselves and their memories average out. Some people remember things that &quot;didn&#39;t happen&quot;. Some people remember both versions of reality. For example, I remember, very clearly, that the space shuttle Columbia did not burn up on re-entry. I also remember it happening. It&#39;s possible, although, I must say, very unlikely, that this is related to your father&#39;s experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know there was an article in r/science like 2 months ago about how scientists discovered based off of evidence at I think a particle accelerator in California that some recorded particle events or states weren&#39;t defined in time as in a particle would be in state A and then go forward in time to state B but based off of evidence it was like the particle was in state B all along. The analogy they gave was: imagine filming someone tipping over a glass of water and then playing the tape in reverse and the glass was tipped over all along.
tl;dr: some recent science may show that it may be possible for multiple realities to exist at once or that events that already happened can kind of unhappen</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Across the Hudson River from New York City, was the scene of a definite flurry of sightings of UFOs, with the heaviest concentration in the Oradell-Hawthorne area. In October (18-29) the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred. It was the closest the world has ever come to a nuclear war. Right in the middle of this crisis an F-106, armed with nuclear-tipped missiles, was scrambled from Palermo AFB to intercept a UFO over New York.</p>
