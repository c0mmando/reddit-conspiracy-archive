One Congressman recently introduced legislation to remove presidential term limits, but who needs congressional legislation when you have constitutional loopholes such as executive orders? The the Western Center for Journalism said he (Obama) is &quot;creating a martial law ‘Disney Land’ of control covering everything imaginable.”  This is all just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Sorry for this intimidating wall of text.)</p>

<p>The NDAA (Obama)</p>

<p>The Patriot Act (Bush)</p>

<p>Rex 84 (Bush senior)</p>

<p>EO&#39;s under Obama:</p>

<p>Executive Order 10990 allows the Government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.</p>

<p>Executive Order 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.</p>

<p>Executive Order 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels, and minerals.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11001 allows the government to take over all health education and welfare functions.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate and establish new locations for populations.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways, and public storage facilities.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issues over a fifteen-year period.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute Industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.</p>

<p>Executive Order 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit, and the flow of money in U.S. financial institutions in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when the president declares a state of emergency, Congress cannot review the action for six months.</p>

<p>A September 24 a Wall Street Journal editorial warned that President Obama is moving to control the Internet by executive order. “Any day now, the White House will issue an executive order on cyber security, according to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano who said last week that the measure ‘is close to completion.’”</p>

<p>It noted that “the White House intends to go ahead with its order in the face of vociferous opposition on Capitol Hill.”</p>

<p>“According to leaked versions of the draft, the executive order would impose security standards for 16 critical industries” and that “private companies have innovated and invested heavily to protect themselves without regulatory prodding. What they need from the government is an information-sharing program and liability protection.”</p>

<p>This is just one more executive order that would, along with others, impose a totalitarian control over every aspect of life in America on the pretext of a national emergency. We had a national emergency on 9/11 and no laws were abrogated, no Constitutional freedoms denied.</p>

<p>A Homeland Security Department study, “Hot Spots of Terrorism and Other Crimes in the United States 1970-2008”, listed Americans who are “fiercely nationalistic”, “suspicious of centralized federal authority” and “reverent of individual liberty” as potential terrorists.</p>

<p>Jeffery T. Kuhmer, writing in The Washington Times in March, noted that “On March 15, the White House released an executive order, ‘National Defense Resources Preparedness.’ The document is stunning in its audacity and a flagrant violation of the Constitution.”</p>

<p>To understand how extensive this is, the Western Center for Journalism published a list of “Obama’s Worst Executive Orders” asserting that some 900 Obama executive orders had been initiated when in fact Obama has signed 139. However, added to active EOs from previous administrations, the Center is correct in its fears that he is &quot;creating a martial law ‘Disney Land’ of control covering everything imaginable.</p>

<p>In a speech in Colorado Springs, Obama said, “We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we set. We’ve got have a civilian national security force that’s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.” </p>

<p>One of the top recommendations in the report from the Rand Corp. was that the capacity and management operations of the U.S. Marshals Service be beefed up and handed the assignment.</p>

<p>The study was released in 2009, only months after Obama made his presidential campaign call for a civilian force as big and as costly as the U.S. military. The opening of the Rand Corp. report was focused on providing “Stability Police Force” services outside of the U.S. borders. A company spokesman said the report focused exclusively on the idea of a structure that could move into war-torn or riot-damaged cities or nations overseas and restore order.</p>

<p>However, a reading of the text of the report makes it clear that similar concerns about the behavior of U.S. residents were being evaluated, too. It noted that the plans for the $1 billion a year effort would have to be structured carefully so as not to infringe on the Posse Comitatus Act ban on U.S. military operations inside the U.S.</p>

<p>Radio talk show Mark Levin discussed it in a broadcast:</p>

<p>He cited Obama’s statement at a dedication ceremony for a facility at the National Defense University.</p>

<p>There, Obama said, “American must also balance and integrate all elements of our national power. We cannot continue to push the burden onto our military alone, nor leave dormant any aspect of the full arsenal of American capability. That’s why my administration is committed to renewing diplomacy as a tool of American power and to developing our civilian national security capabilities.”</p>

<p>What? Levin said.</p>

<p>“What does that mean? … Is he crazy? … He needs a civilian national security force … just as powerful … as our military?”</p>

<p>“The military has tanks, advanced weapons. What does he mean? … I know what his ideology is. That’s why I’m getting nervous…. Will the shirts be brown? Will they be clicking their heels as they walk?”</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be blinded by the many sound ideologies in these programs. They may come off as pro-union, pro-public service, pro-unity, etc. There is a hidden agenda.</p>

<p>Erik Rush, a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare, wrote, &quot;Civil unrest is an Obama administration objective, since it will facilitate crises sufficient for the president to justify suspensions of civil rights. Provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act, Obama’s recent National Defense Resources Preparedness executive order, as well as others, have certainly paved the way for such action.</p>

<p>“The question of a fair election in November is also something that deserves our attention. We can take it as given that voter fraud will abound at the hands of ACORN and other like-minded fringe organizations … All of this illustrates the paramount importance of continuing to beat the drum of Obama’s communism in unequivocal terms, regardless of the mincing ridicule we will draw from liberals…”</p>

<p>Ringer wrote,“I began warning about Barack Obama’s dictatorial ambitions before he even won the 2008 presidential election … Obama’s recent contention that it would be ‘unprecedented’ for the Supreme Court to overrule congressional legislation had dictatorship written all over it.”I will say yet again what I have been saying for more than three years: If polls indicate that Obama is going to win the upcoming election, no problem. He’ll keep flashing that fake Barry Obama grin until Nov. 7, then move swiftly to begin unleashing a dictatorial full monty – consisting of more regulations, higher taxes and less freedom – that will shock all but his staunchest Marxist allies.</p>

<p>“Nothing will be off limits – a national police force, instant citizenship for all Third World people … forced equalization of income (except for Obama’s wealthy supporters), widespread use of tax audits to carry out vendettas against enemies … suspension of habeas corpus … and much, much more.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, two or three months before the election, if the polls clearly show that Obama is going to go down in defeat, I believe there’s better than a 50-50 chance of a major ‘emergency’ coincidentally making its appearance, convincingly manufactured in such a way as to cause the average entitlement junkie to agree that we must rally around the president and ‘postpone’ the November elections.”</p>

<p>Craige McMillan, longtime WND commentary author, said, “Why do you think Big Sis needs 20,000 drones patrolling the skies over America and NSA needs a new listening post to read and listen to every personal communication between every American citizen and archive it forever? … Step out of line and the police don’t even need a warrant to download your location data and buddy lists from your cell phone. Then they can go around and talk to your pals about your terrorist tendencies.”</p>

<p>Nat Henthoff, nationally known authority on the First Amendment,wrote about plans to begin, starting in 2013, for the government to being monitoring and databasing “any form of communication.”He described the new National Security Agency’s new Utah center – “more than five times larger than the U.S. Capitol” where “all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private emails, cellphone calls and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails – parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases…” will be archived.</p>

<p>“We are not yet a police state. The First Amendment is still functioning … But with the NSA burrowing ceaselessly into our once very private lives, where are the reminders of the Declaration of Independence and its indictments of King George III?”</p>

<p>Mychal Massie, the chairman of the National Leadership Network of Black Conservatives, also is on record.”Many say Barack Obama is the most divisive, egocentric megalomaniac ever to hold his office. Others say he is the most ruthless and defiantly determined Marxist-Leninist ever to become president. I say he is, by definition and actions, both.&quot;</p>

<p>Vox Day, WND columnist, wrote, “It is becoming increasingly clear that the federal government is completely and utterly out of control, spewing nonsense, issuing irrational threats and stumbling around the world stage like a belligerent drunk with an empty wallet … Americans no longer enjoy the limited government of their forefathers. They suffer from limitless government. TSA is an apt acronym. But it does not stand for the Transportation Security Administration; it stands for the Totalitarian State of America.</p>

<p>These are not my words. I took several articles and chopped them up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well - maybe if you were illiterate or something</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we&#39;ll so weaken your economy until you fall like overripe fruit into our hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their hands don&#39;t even exist anymore, so I&#39;m not really sure where you get the idea that he was somehow ominous <em>and</em> spot on.</p>

<p>The soviet&#39;s <em>didn&#39;t</em> weaken our economy until we fell into their hands. <strong>The exact opposite happened</strong>. Furthermore - socialism <em>isn&#39;t</em> fascism. Same for communism. <em>Neither</em> of them focus on the corporation. </p>

<p>So really it seems like Nikita was neither ominous <em>nor</em> spot on. Basically every single part of the quote has not come true. Ironically - much of the opposite happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is so bad about that. </p>

<p>In Canada we are just that and live decent existences. Never really understood why the healthcare program was declined with such ferocity in the U.S. too. For a few dollars you&#39;d give access to healthcare to the whole nation, yet for a few dollars that you refuse to pay in taxes. People keep dying of easily treated diseases and others go under with incredible debts.</p>

<p>Socialism; really not as bad you think it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s why we NEED regulation. Look, a perfect system doesn&#39;t exist without some rules. If you allow sectors of society to operate unfettered, then it&#39;s going to get bad. Capitalism has it&#39;s downsides too, as we have been shown. </p>

<p>Blanket statements by some,  like &quot;Socialism is bad&quot; or &quot;Capitalism is good&quot; are just narrow and unproductive. What we need is a system that blends the good of ALL collected experience in terms of governing a prospering society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you clearly understand the healthcare issue and I would be interested in knowing how it was presented to you. It&#39;s not about paying a tax and getting healthcare for free. It&#39;s about being mandated to purchase health insurance. We&#39;re talking premiums, co-pays, and deductibles. Premiums are easily $600 for a family. Then you factor in another easy $30-$60 co-pay for an office visit, some charge up to $300 for an emergency visit. They can&#39;t force you to pay to get care by law, but your insurance company will go after you for it when you are well. Then there is the deductible. That can be anywhere from $2,000-$10,000 a year or more depending on what type of insurance you choose. That means you pay 100% of that out-of-pocket and once it&#39;s met, the average insurance pays 80% and you still pay 20% of the bill. The &quot;relief&quot; of Obamacare makes it so people with pre-existing conditions can get on it, free check-ups, and no life time maximum (the average now is $1,000,000).</p>

<p>The Constitution has been changed 27 times since 1791. The framers even provided instructions for changing it in Article V. It&#39;s not like some freaky new thing.</p>

<p>Seems like a perfectly legitimate question. New Zealand doesn&#39;t have a constitution and they turned out fine. Unless you think the founding fathers were demi-gods or something there&#39;s no reason we should assume they were infallible.</p>

<p>Sure they are. They&#39;re both countries where white Europeans killed off or conquered the natives and set up governments that gave special rights to white people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Constitution contains a lot of dumb things. Like the Senate pre-17th amendment was kinda of useless - just a bunch of unelected old men like the English house of lords - but post 17th amendment bicameralism just makes no sense at all. All it does is ensure that any law that gets passed is rendered into pork-laden trash by the time it passes both houses, plus statewide elections + 6 year terms mean that senate campaigns are massively expensive, creating enormous opportunities for corruption.  </p>

<p>lol, no it wasn&#39;t. The Constitution was ratified YEARS after the U.S. separated from England. In fact there were many Americans who opposed the idea from the start, which should be obvious to anyone who has even glanced at the Federalist Papers. Remember the Articles of Confederation?</p>

<p>Furthermore many of the actual terms of the Constitution were lifted wholesale out of English law. Where do you think habeas corpus comes from? Where do you think search warrants originated?</p>

<p>The Constitution itself is a power grab. The 5th amendment says the government can deprive you of life, liberty and property and the suspension clause says the government can suspend habeas corpus for &quot;public safety.&quot; The 4th amendment says searches and seizures are fine as long as they&#39;re not &quot;unreasonable&quot; and 16th amendment says the feds can tax every penny you earn. </p>

<p>For that matter, many if the authors of the Constitution were also congressmen who vote for the Alien and Sedition Acts. Until 1971 you could be arrested for wearing a jacket that said &quot;fuck the draft.&quot; The real propaganda (which you have apparently swallowed wholesale) is the  notion that the constitution is some great protector of individual liberty, when in fact most of &quot;constitutional rights&quot; people prattle on about today didn&#39;t even exist before the Warren court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the above are rights of the state everywhere else in the world, including much of Europe, and I challenge anyone to show how I&#39;m less &quot;free&quot; in Germany or the UK than in the US. &quot;Oh noes socialism we&#39;ll all be deprived of our precious SUVs and, god forbid, our modest collection of GUNS! How will we live?!?&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s funny how you seem to be the only ones even HAVING this stupid discussion, while the rest of the first world gets on with slightly more important issues such as European integration, Europe&#39;s role in the emerging nations/ Africa, etc.<br/>
You are slipping. What made you a great nation once has deteriorated into empty, angry posturing by radicals, both religious and tin-foil-hat-wearing. Those entrepreneurs you do still have must be silently crying at the low level of public discourse every night.<br/>
All the best from Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you do realize all these executive orders were issued between 1958 and 1976? (<a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/eo/eo-11921.htm">for example.</a>) I guess we&#39;ve been &quot;on the verge&quot; for decades now... hmm, I wonder what the orders actually say? Wait, they&#39;re actually inane legal formalities enacting congressional decrees? </p>

<p>Na, it must be that the websites containing that language are all run by the gov&#39;t. They&#39;re coming for you, go buy guns!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he doesn&#39;t have the power to change anything. If he did, he wouldn&#39;t be the president. Like I said before it&#39;s the global elite that run the world. The bilderburgs, tri-lateral commission, rothschilds, rockefellers,etc.  Those are the ones that call the shots. You don&#39;t think the government has mind control? Whats to stop them from using it on a president to get him to do whatever they want? Look into Mk ultra ,project blue beam, bohemian grove, etc. just the tip of the iceberg...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll use KRS-ONE&#39;s anology: &quot;Barack is like the manager of Burger King. All Presidents are, including Bush. It&#39;s like this: when your fries are cold, your burger&#39;s not done right, you go back to Burger King/&quot;America&quot; or your &quot;Government&quot;, and you say, &quot;My burger&#39;s cold! I want new fries!&quot; First, you go to the cashier. That&#39;s the &quot;courts&quot;. You argue to the courts. The courts if you can&#39;t get justice with the cashier, you say &quot;Let me see the manager! I wanna go to the Supreme Court! I wanna see the President!&quot; The manager comes out. &quot;Hi. What can I do for you?&quot; Now the manager can override the decisions of the cashier, but you never get to see the FRANCHISE OWNER of Burger King. If you really have a problem with your burger, you need to go see the franchise owner! We need to go to the top... or to the bottom. We need to go to where the real architecture of government is, and it&#39;s NOT in a President! It&#39;s in a GLOBAL SCHEME!&quot; Does that make more sense? </p>
