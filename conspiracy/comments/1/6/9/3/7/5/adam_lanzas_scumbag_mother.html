       Completely agree.  What I am saying is that I don't find it believable that Nancy Lanza would simultaneously be considering having her son committed and leaving him with access to guns in the basement.

       We don't even know if she intentionally gave him access or in what manner he gained access to guns in the basement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The assumption and the presumptions people are being allowed to make was that he was a very disturbed young man, but there isn't a huge amount of evidence being presented that supports that claim. And certainly nothing that indicates he was a violent person with a known history.

       Framing Adam's mother in such a way simply fits the official yet entirely unsupported narrative a little too cleanly for my liking.

       Actually, I am just agreeing with you here. They are trying to make her out to be the culprit behind it all. No one wants to count her as a victim. Like you said: Blaming her has been coming on for a while now. And I just don't think that is fair without knowing all the details.

       Dude, what are you talking about?  I agree that there is a paucity of actual evidence.  What I am saying is that this part of the narrative is also  contradictory and therefore not entirely believable - I know if I had a kid in my basement that was so maladjusted that I was considering having him committed the very first thing I would do is put the guns as far away from him as possible.  I wouldn't leave them unlocked in the part of the house where he lived!  Did you even read the articles I posted - apparently Nancy Lanza said to a friend she was concerned because Adam had started self harming (burning himself with a lighter), am I really to believe that this behavior wouldn't be an indicator to her that she keep him away from other things that could hurt him even more...like, say, I don't know...GUNS???

       And everything you stated is based entirely on very questionable information. There is a dearth of information concerning Adam, your links in the OP are full of crap info...information from Adam's baby sitter from fifteen years ago? Come on! Also they are emotionally-centric rubbish using very slim amounts of fact.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The most disturbing questions have to do with the guns—
        <strong>
         perhaps as many as seven of them—stored in the Lanza basement in what has variously been described as a “lockbox” and as a simple “gun cabinet.”
        </strong>
        Why would a mother, an intelligent former stockbroker, bring guns and large-capacity magazines into a home with a clearly disturbed 20-year-old son? Couldn’t she feel the potential danger as she replaced the guns in her basement storage spot after a session at the gun range with Adam? Nancy took Adam to the shooting range, friends have said, to teach him respect for guns. It seems to have been the sole activity where she and her son had a chance to bond—but in retrospect it was the worst decision of Nancy’s life.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's total speculation. Using a little critical thinking when reading those linked articles leaves one with the conclusion that we don't know a whole helluva lot about what really happened. A good place to start is to cross out paragraphs of shit like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <del>
         Nancy Lanza would have loved it. A twilight drive-by of her yellow colonial-style home in Sandy Hook, Conn., shortly after the New Year revealed a brightly lit Christmas garland over the front entrance and second-floor spotlights shining down on a snow-covered front yard. For a woman who adored decorating for the holidays, the sight would surely have made her smile.
        </del>
       </p>
       <p>
        <del>
         But Lanza had been dead for nearly three weeks. The adornments she left behind continue to eerily appear each evening, apparently with the help of a timing device inside the sprawling four-bedroom, four-bath property.
        </del>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then, consider this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nancy Champion Lanza, 52, was victim No. 1 in a murderous rampage carried out by her troubled son, Adam, who
        <strong>
         reportedly suffered from severe behavioral disorders
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There hasn't even been a confirmation as to Adam's "disorders".

       Exactly.  He was so mentally disturbed that she was considering having him committed, but she didn't have the common sense to get the guns away from him?  It strains credulity.  Are you too fucking dumb to grasp this simple point?

       You need to take a step back and recognise that we (the interested public) actually have NO IDEA what parts of the Lanza backstory are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know anything about Adam Lanza's mental health. There is no reliable public information about this, only rumour and disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither do you know anything about Nancy Lanza, how she treated her son, what firearms she actually possessed and how she secured them.

      <p>
       So why you think yourself qualified to make a value judgment on the woman, or her son is a mystery to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we really know is that nothing about Sandy Hook makes any sense.

      <p>
       Save your value judgments for the fuckers who are preventing the truth from being known - the media, the police and those people who actually do know what happened at Sandy Hook.

       She should be blamed if the official story is correct, in which case she allowed through negligence her mentally ill son that she was considering having committed access to firearms.  She should be sued by the victims.

       Look, according to the Official Story Nancy Lanza both considered having her son committed and left her guns in the basement with him where he had access to them.  No sane person anywhere near even average intelligence would do this.  Therefore the Official Story strains credulity on this point.  If you don't get this then you are fucking moron.

       By questioning the media as a reliable source of information you are essentially saying there are no known facts in this case.  I agree with you.    For instance we don't know that it was even Adam Lanza that did this.  What actual evidence has been presented that this is the case?

       I agree. I don't subscribe to the whole theory that it was all made up and actors were used, but I do know there's been very little real information released. The media stuff has been all over the map and now is settling in on a narrative more or less.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Agenda-driven news is the reason that apparent inconsistencies in the Sandy Hook story were not investigated or explained. According to some reports, the medical examiner said the children were shot with a rifle, but other reports say the accused was found dead inside the school with two pistols and that a rifle was found outside in the car. The police capture a man in the woods who says “I didn’t do it.” How would a person in the woods know what has just happened? Who was the man? Was he investigated and released? Will we ever know?

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Some reports say the school was locked and admission is via security camera and being buzzed in. Why would a heavily armed person be buzzed in? Other reports say he shot his way in. Why wouldn’t such a commotion have alerted the school?
       </p>
       <p>
        Another puzzle is the video of a father whose child has supposedly been shot to pieces. Prior to the interview he is caught on camera laughing and joking, and then, like an actor, he pulls his face and voice into a presentation of grief for the interview.

        The spokesman for the Connecticut State Police is anxious to control the story, warns social media against posting information contrary to official information, but provides little information, refusing to answer most questions. The usual “ongoing investigation” is invoked, but Lanza has already been declared to be the killer and the number of dead reported. About the only hard information that emerges is that the police are investigating where every component of the weapons was manufactured. The relevance to the shooting of where the components of the weapons were manufactured is not explained.

       <p>
        The medical examiner’s press conference is weird. He is incoherent, unsure of what he is supposed to say, hasn’t answers to questions he should have, and defers to police.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the best way to avoid fueling suspicion is for public officials not to hold press conferences until they are prepared to answer the relevant questions.
       </p>
       <p>
        And where are the bodies? Like the alleged murder of Osama bin Laden by a SEAL, the crucial evidence is not provided. Paul Vance, the Connecticut State Police spokesman, said that the “victims’ bodies were removed from the school overnight” and that detectives “were able to positively identify all of the victims and make some formal notification to all of the families of the victims.”

        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        Allegedly, no parent wanted to see the body of their dead child, but how do you know it is your child if you do not see the body? It is a strange kind of closure when it is provided to parents by impersonal detectives. Has anyone seen a body other than a state medical examiner and a few detectives? Where are the media’s films of body bags being carried out of the school? Why would Obama’s gun control agenda forego the propaganda of a procession of body bags being carried out of a school?
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the sensitivity issue prevailed, but with all the suspicion that already exists about the government and its claims, why fuel the suspicion by withholding visual evidence of the tragedy?
       </p>
       <p>
        There are reports that when emergency medical help arrived at the school, the medical personnel were denied access to the children on the grounds that there were no survivors and the scene was too gruesome. Yet, there is a conflicting story that one six-year old girl had the presence of mind to play dead and walked out of her classroom unscathed. If the story is true, how do we know that other survivors did not bleed to death from wounds because the emergency medical personnel were denied access? Did police exercise more control over the scene than was warranted?

       There you go! It isn't too far fetched to hear it, especially with a special needs child IMO. Everything I heard about Adam was that he was special needs. My friend has a ten year old child with special needs that you cannot turn your back on because he will put the cat in the dryer and try to "dry" it off. Cats and dryers do NOT make a good pair. It's messy. I learned that the hard way because I helped that friend clean out the dryer after he did it. Sorry if this grosses anyone out, of course. It's just my experience.

       <em>

       turn their back on him, but turn their back on him and leave him with access to firearms.  Meanwhile she is so worried about his mental health she is considering having him committed!  Just admit that this either doesn't make sense or the woman would have to be mentally challenged herself.

       I think she truly cared about him, she just lost touch with how to take care of him, especially with him being an adult. It was always just her and him, his older brother and father weren't around. I think the whole thing about her trying to send him away to college and places was to try and push him into society to help him, more than to just get rid of him. That's just my feeling about it though.

       If this woman would've acted with a modicum of common sense and kept the guns away from her child that she was considered having committed then 20 children wouldn't have died.  I find you being offended by this post a little misplaced.  Questionable really.

       Look, according to the Official Story Nancy Lanza both considered having her son committed and left her guns in the basement with him where he had access to them.  No sane person anywhere near even average intelligence would do this.  Therefore the Official Story strains credulity on this point.  If you don't get this then you are fucking moron.
