       4??
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the hearing today, police recovered 4 gas masks from the Aurora Theater crime scene. 2 of which were supposedly Holmes'. The other 2....still unanswered. Also reported that a police officer removed the gas mask worn by Holmes from the crime scene by mistake. WHAT!?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is were the evidence lies for more possible shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Holmes did not do the actual shooting, but I truly believe there were more involved. I really hope someone can bring this to light.

       The four gas masks are troubling, maybe the other 3 were worn by police and discarded once the tear gas had run out (I know nothing about tear gas but I assume at some point it will dissipate). Perhaps it was too difficult to see and work with masks on when they were rescuing people from the theater and they were tossed haphazardly to get them out of the way(?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't buy a lot of the conspiracy theories however after reading the proceedings in the pretrial hearing, I have a question because something doesn't seem quite right.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this article:
      </p>
      <pre><code>          CENTENNIAL, Colorado -- James Holmes sat in the interrogation room in his T-shirt, white socks and boxers. 
          Gone was the body armor that police found him wearing when they encountered him outside a movie theater where
          scores of people had been shot. Police had cut it off.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/national/james-holmes-aurora-theater-shooting-case-update-detective-describes-holmes-odd-behavior#ixzz2HVWsXgEn">
        http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/national/james-holmes-aurora-theater-shooting-case-update-detective-describes-holmes-odd-behavior#ixzz2HVWsXgEn
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is his gear so far from the car that he was commanded to remove his armor near-- or if the police cut it off of him as this article states, did the police run around tossing his gear in random locations? It just doesn't make sense to me! Like I said, I'm not a believer of all things conspiracy-related, However, but this seems to be a major contradiction between the evidence we can see in photos from the scene and what has been reported by cops via their testimony at this hearing. Why is the evidence not matching the offical dialogue regarding the apprehension of Holmes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I find it troubling to read that Holmes was not tested for drugs when he was reputed to be behaving oddly. The police said they didn't do any tox screen on him because they didn't think he was on anything because he was not behaving like an intoxicated person. These two points of interest do not mesh well together. He either was acting strangely or not acting as if he were on something. Even if it was a case of "he just looks crazy," why wouldn't they test him for psychiatric medication to ensure he hadn't overdosed on anything? Most psychiatrists wiill do a tox screen on regular patients at some point, let alone on someone who has just blasted away people in a movie theater. It is also commonplace for drug testing to be done when admitted to an ER, etc, just to make sure they're not missing anything. I've been tested for drugs when I was pregnant at my OB appointments and have also noticed drug testing on my discharge forms from ER visits. I am not on drugs so I didn't care although I was suprised to see it in my paperwork.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last point on this-- didn't the police originally think he was on Vicodin?  If he was, wouldn't they want to ensure that this was true or false and ensure he was drug-tested? Especially when they made note of him being sweaty  and his pupils being very dilated??

       I don't believe the other 3 gas masks would belong to the police.
I mean, first of all in an investigation that has already been controversial and supposedly has been set up, so to speak. Why would the police leave those behind and then also admit them into evidence to exacerbate the already inflamed accusations that a conspiracy is taking place. Not to mention, a myriad of gas masks exist in this world, with different manufacturers. What are the odds that they were all the same make and model and also admitted into evidence? No, sorry this is a valid point being made and needs to be addressed. Frankly, I'm surprised that such evidence made it into court. It's very incriminating to the powers that are investigating this tragedy.

       I have to say, the three extra gas masks is very odd. I just offered the "police dropped them" theory as a potential explanation. In retrospect, I think you have a legitimate point. If they were the gear of law enforcement officers, I am pretty sure they would have realized at some point during the ongoing investigation that they were missing their gas masks. I didn't know much about the gas masks so I didn't know if they were all the same model or whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm not entirely certain I believe every conspiracy theory that is floating around online, it is becoming exceedingly clear to anyone giving even a cursory glance at the evidence that something is not right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think, most likely, he had an accomplice. There is just too much coincidence with regard to cold, hard facts that point to something different than the story we're being fed by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either he seemed "sober" or he was acting strangely upon his arrest.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        What about the supposed Vicodin? What was in the other prescription bottles?
         - Why were his pupils so dilated? Was it just the black contacts or was he 
           either drugged or willingly taking some psychoactive med? 
         - Regardless of whether someone appears sober, it seems like sloppy 
           police work to not draw blood as evidence-- particularly when such a 
           massive crime has just occurred?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Either the police cut off his body armor near the vehicle and stripped him to his boxers and stuck him in a squad car--or someone else removed most of their gear and tactical equipment near the exit of the theater.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Why do the police state that they cut JH's body armor from his body when 
 photographs from the crime scene clearly show body armor at the exit of the
        <br/>
        theater? Why four gas masks? Why do witnesses report a second shooter?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'll say this, I was 100% skeptical when I first read of a conspiracy but when I started researching I realized something was wrong. Evidence that does not match the testimony-- how are these things being overlooked? And of course the biggest question of all.... WHY?
      </p>
      <p>
       I expected to find out a little more about the shooting when I began following it and researching here and there. I never, in my wildest dreams, believed there was a conspiracy of any sort. When I read about the investigation, some of it gave me pause, but for the most part I could explain it away. It was this week, when the testimony started to come out that I realized the only explanation is that we're not getting the full story.

       I forgot to add something else that just doesn't sit right with me. He was described as very relaxed and compliant when he was arrested. If he had been planning this out over the last few months and he finally accomplished his sick act, I don't believe he would be relaxed. This is something he'd been obsessively planning for an extended period of time. I'd think he'd be almost giddy or manic or in some way excited at accomplishing his plan. Instead we hear he appeared dazed, relaxed, etc. I know whenI do something I've been planning for some time, I am excited about it. Why would he suddenly become a little doormouse after his plan "worked"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, just one more thing that didn't make sense to me. When I told my husband about what I've read and seen online and explained all the details, he also was convinced that something is not right with this story. I told him JH appeared "relaxed", had massively blown out pupils and was totally complacent when they detained him. Without skipping a beat, the first thing out of his mouth was "he was drugged and framed". If you knew my husband, you'd know that this isn't his usual response. I was expecting him to laugh his head off at my "crazy stories". He is a very calm, accepting, relaxed person. The last one to agree to something "out of the box". His summation in response to my presentation made me even more convinced there is a conspiracy of some sort in these cases.

       I said this in the other thread also. I used to work as an EMT and stuff gets left behind all the time at even minor stuff. Especially if it's gear that you don't use on a daily bases. Combine this with the fact the cops tend to be very out of their depth when it comes to medical emergencies, it's not hard to think they would be under a lot of added stress. Also with the amount of people (cops) moving around the area it would be easy for someone to pick up a couple of gas masks that seemed to be dropped in a hurry.

       Like I said, there are a myriad of different gas mask makes and models.
If they were the police gas masks they should be obviously discernible between what Holmes was supposedly using and those of the precinct that responded. So, why enter them into evidence if they were police gas masks?

       How do we know they didn't look very much the same? Also the normal police and Swat teams usually operate independently from each other so not everyone knows what each others gear is. Holmes has been said to have been carrying some rather Swat style gear, so if a cop found 4 gas masks they may not be able to tell what belonged with whom because of the rest of the gear that Holmes had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you said yourself that there is a myriad of different gas mask makes and models. The team that went in may not have all been matching, some may have had newer gear than others and that sort of thing.

       Simply because they look similar does not advocate that they are the same. SWAT and Police gear is locked up in an inventory with specific serial numbers. Surely, the police went to the trouble to identify these masks before actually entering them into evidence. The police who used these masks would have been asked which one's they wore and which one's they didn't. Entering something into evidence is a big deal, something the police and DA do. They wouldn't bother if they hadn't already examined every other possibility, otherwise it wouldn't be admissible in court and we wouldn't be hearing about it.

       A false flag is an attack carried out by the government but blamed on an opposing group or person. This doesn't quite fit that.
