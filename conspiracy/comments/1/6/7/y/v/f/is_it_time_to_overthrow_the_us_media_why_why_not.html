    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they don&#39;t really cover relevant shit, and they&#39;re mostly owned by the few might be a better segway since these are things that are pretty well accepted as fact. </p>

<p>&quot;The media is all propaganda. Nothing but lies&quot; is a pretty absolute black and white statement that will discourage an open discussion imo. There is a lot that the media likely reports accurately. I wouldn&#39;t know about the patriot act, or NDAA if the media hadn&#39;t told me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s beyond lies, lies would imply some motive to deceive, based on the fact that its is &quot;supposed&quot; to be a group of &quot;independent&quot; journalist out there to scour the earth for &quot;facts&quot; about &quot;events&quot; as they happen. By this premis, as an entity that could make money by telling you either the truth or lies there is no motive for either way in a business model that just disseminates information. So therefore by default what we have is something much more insidious and much more crafted than most could imagine, after all they still dictate your election, and all are accepting the choices and decisions, so they are winning,... No what you are seeing is the end result of millions of man hours in advanced training where individuals are molded to manipulate the entire population by creating what they perceive as reality. It is by far the longest running military operation in existence, set in motion against the american people starting operationally in 1913, and conceived well before that. When you watch tv, from the &quot;good shows about animals&quot; to the news, what you are seeing is a clever and effective form of hypnosis whereas cult victims are brainwashed via group think embarrassment psychology. It is a military operation. First with Ink, then with Radio wave, then the tv,all of it there to manipulate reality...I mean, you don&#39;t want to be the only one who doesn&#39;t know?...do you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does one make an offensive on the entirety of media? Are we talking about some form of Anon-esque type public shaming as in a graffiti hack? </p>

<p>I think another aspect of this is the continuation of support for alternative media. I really like the Tragedy and Hope network, for example. There have been so many new broadcasters over just the past couple of years, that I can&#39;t help but think that we&#39;re on the cusp of something big with regards to media consumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alternative media is GREAT, and I hope it only flourishes, but the problem with it is that it still does not get anything to a national stage. I&#39;ve thought before that if there was a way to circumvent the MSM, but still get something to a national stage, then that&#39;s what we need. But that&#39;s simply not happening.</p>

<p>What we need is a massive effort with letters written, emails sent, comments bombarded on articles, and people getting out there to explain exactly how and why the media is completely controlled and wrong. The people are waking up at an alarming rate, we know that - but it&#39;s time we do something about it. It&#39;s time we take our media back.  Think about it - if every major news show and news network had proverbial and maybe even real angry crowds banging on their door, they couldn&#39;t help but to acknowledge it.</p>

<p>You know what we need? We need an Occupy Wall Street, but on all forms of corporate media in this country. People literally camping out or whatever, generally causing a nuisance at news stations. <strong>REGARDLESS</strong> of people&#39;s post opinions of OWS, it got national attention - and THAT&#39;S what we need.</p>

<p>P.S. In the end, secretly I know this still won&#39;t, in itself, fix much, but it will definitely be a catalyst to something. Good or bad, I don&#39;t know, but anything that&#39;s not the status quo is good to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem with your suggestion is this (and I&#39;m looking at YOU Comcast)--if you cancel cable you also cancel your internet connection (unless, of course, you are handy and simply remove the in-line bandpass filters--result is cable internet with free basic cable TV).</p>

<p>In time, wireless connections will offer nearly the same advantages as RG-59 does today...but I cannot get a consistent 60MBps with Clear or sat...not even close.</p>

<p>Still, upvote for the comment--sucks to admit it but we most assuredly ARE paying to be lied to, especially with the &quot;new and improved&quot; NDAA &#39;13. What a joke. </p>

<p>It is connoted that one overthrows tyrants, but no one is forced insofar as I know to consume American media; this would be like &quot;overthrowing the candy store&quot;... and just as absurd.  Shutting down the candy store doesn&#39;t magically put people on a diet, and shutting down certain media outlets won&#39;t put an end to confirmation bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point: people that get their information from one source <em>CHOOSE</em> to do that.  There are plenty of options, no one makes you watch Fox News and only Fox News.</p>

<p>Taking away that choice doesn&#39;t take away Fox News viewers, they&#39;ll find someone else to tell them what they want to hear, all the while blaming you (somewhat justifiably) for your intolerance.</p>

<p>Having correctly identified the problem, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If every person except yourself gets their info from one source</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... you&#39;re trying to solve the wrong one.  You&#39;re focusing on &quot;one source&quot; when you should paying attention to the verb &quot;to get&quot;.  Why do people choose to get their news only from one source?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ill give you a hypothetical example. </p>

<p>typical 9-5 guy finishes 8 hour shift and leaves to go home. 40 minute commute with a pit stop at starbucks. hes home by 615. has dinner by 7 and by 8 is on the couch watching tv. he wants to watch the news. he has a few options but SHIT BRO IM REPUBLICAN. i turn on fox news and say fuck the liberal biased media! theyre out to get me! needless to say he watches cbs sometimes and other cable network televison shows but only goes to fox for news! hes done this as long as he can remember. </p>

<p>tell me, after this person has watched fox news for years and has become indoctrinated to the point of a self serving bias, does this person <em>really</em> make a choice? or could they simply place too high a value on the time they have already invested in watching fox? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find presenting functional and preferable options the best tactic in the struggle between awareness and ignorance. Whenever someone says &quot;I saw on the news X&quot;. I look at them mostly blank with a hint of concern and say non judgmentally &quot;you watch tv news?&quot;. They then begin questioning me and I quickly explain in a non &quot;crazy conspiracy&quot; way that I don&#39;t trust the mainstream media due to conflicts of interest with their parent corporations and the necessity for the news to make advertising revenue over factual reporting. Naturally at this point, I have done this many times, they ask &quot;well where do you go for your information&quot; to which I promptly respond with several websites I find highly enlightening. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t attack them for being ignorant and brainwashed, help them find truth compassionately.</p>

Even if you don&#39;t try to watch that crap, you still see it, in the promos for the local news, while you&#39;re changing channels, when you&#39;re bored and think &quot;I wonder what&#39;s going on in the world&quot; ....

So, when one proposes to inflict some type of reprecussions to these buisness&#39;s that on the suraface act as merely buisness, buisnesses that do not have treason, sedition and alike to protect themselves from you, one must be aware that the underlying unseen hand that guides it does have those &quot;protections&quot; in place.

    <div class="md"><p>its not necessarily the <em>content</em> we disagree with, its the sourse of the content. a big media company will look to other (non-media) companies to partner with for advertising revenue. if those other companies get involved in some shady activity that should become publicly scrutinized but DOESNT because of that partnership, then i think its time for a new source of content! </p>

<p>as we know, nothing exists in a vacuum, and that includes big media companies. there are so few of them that it has become a pseudo prisoners dilemma where none will rat on each other or their revenue streams. </p>

<p>Please we shouldn&#39;t be fighting, ford2city was expressing his opinions besides its a little absurd to try to overthrow the media.

<p>Actually if one applies the scientific method, one can =O. If someone tests the blood of a person from Russia that claims Judaism, and compares it to a person from Yemen that claims Judiasm and sees that they are similar, more similar in-fact than to a non-Jewish Russian person, this would imply some sort of genetic link between the Jews of Europe and other Jews around the world. And so the idea of Jewish blood is very credible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is indeed the difference between Satanism and Luciferianism. But Satanism&#39;s the &quot;humanism with a goat mask&quot;, and Luciferianism is the religious philosophy based more on opposition of Christianity and utilization of &quot;magic&quot; than any over-arching philosophy. 
The only reason Luciferians employ any nihilism generally has to do with it being counter to typical Christian beliefs rather than being a central religious tenet to them. Lucifer they hold to be a deposed god, Yahweh being the usurper and the true evil entity. All this has been folded into hermetic and ceremonial magic systems and concepts, and borrows heavily from the occult movements of the Victorian era, but &quot;punched up&quot; a bit with music and imagery.</p>

<p>For Satanists, however, the &quot;magic&quot; aspect is purely pageantry, and they don&#39;t literally worship an external being, believing that one&#39;s self is the center of its respective universe. They don&#39;t believe in a literal Satan, using the name in an &quot;adversary&quot; sense rather than as the name of a deity, the adversary of ignorance rather than an evil entity.</p>

<p>Because christians are just as fucked up and arrogant as jews.</p>

<p>Christians believe, that they need to kiss jew ass because thats what god wants them to do. In the belief that by doing this, the jews will completely take over Palestine - thus fulfilling the prophecy of the second coming - when jesus returns - so he can murder all the jews (and all the other non-christians) himself. They&#39;re basically just fucked up slaves to a sociopathic fairy-tale dogma.</p>

<p>P.S.</p>

<p>Oh, and your affirmative action analogy doesnt work - because jews arent a race. They&#39;re a religion, and there is a clear seperation of church and state in our constitution. And even if there werent, the last thing in the world you would want is scientologists, catholics, mormons and all the other bullshit religions demanding guaranteed representation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they don&#39;t really cover relevant shit, and they&#39;re mostly owned by the few might be a better segway since these are things that are pretty well accepted as fact. </p>

<p>&quot;The media is all propaganda. Nothing but lies&quot; is a pretty absolute black and white statement that will discourage an open discussion imo. There is a lot that the media likely reports accurately. I wouldn&#39;t know about the patriot act, or NDAA if the media hadn&#39;t told me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does one make an offensive on the entirety of media? Are we talking about some form of Anon-esque type public shaming as in a graffiti hack? </p>

<p>I think another aspect of this is the continuation of support for alternative media. I really like the Tragedy and Hope network, for example. There have been so many new broadcasters over just the past couple of years, that I can&#39;t help but think that we&#39;re on the cusp of something big with regards to media consumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK then overthrow the U.S media. What does that mean? I&#39;m guessing it means that we destroy all media created in the U.S. But that&#39;s just stupid isn&#39;t it? I personally like having media, I enjoy books, movies, television, radio, music, etc. </p>

<p>So if it doesn&#39;t mean that then what does it mean? Don&#39;t consume corporate media that you don&#39;t agree with? Ok, but that&#39;s not exactly overthrowing anything. As a consumer you can choose what you purchase and what you don&#39;t, there&#39;s no overthrow involved. </p>

<p>The OP&#39;s post is asinine. He&#39;s talking about unachievable and unnecessary goals using unrealistic language. The post might as well have asked &quot;Is it time we overthrow The Corporations and fought The Man?&quot; </p>
