        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>About a month ago I saw this cool video on YouTube that was featured on Reddit (r/conspiracy and others) titled <em>Stone Builders, Mound Builders and the Giants of Ancient America</em>.  It was very interesting and made me want to learn more about the topic just as a TED talk should.  I was interested in going back to watch it again today but I discovered that it had been removed (marked private actually, but same difference.) </p>

<p>Here is the original YouTube link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELu9ARLo0jc">Stone Builders, Mound Builders and the Giants of Ancient America</a></p>

<p>I did a quick Google search and found a blog post dated December 14, 2012 on the TEDx Shelburne Falls site that explains why it was removed.  Here is the link: <a href="http://tedxshelburnefalls.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/jim-vieiras-talk-removed-from-internet/">Jim Vieira’s talk removed from Internet</a></p>

<p>The post includes a detailed point by point response from the real TED organization that challenges many of claims and details that Jim Vieira makes in his talk.  I watch TED talks from time to time but this is the first time I have heard of a talk that was was aggressively refuted after the fact.  Maybe there are more cases like this but this whole thing is striking me as very odd.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>from the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>to the author: As to your below comment that ted and tedx only deal with ‘proven facts’ – this is utter nonsense. Jill Bolte Taylor, probably the most famous of all the ted lectures was a scientist who had a stroke, a neurologist at that and she described her experience as a rational person realizing that parts of her brain were shutting down and her rational acts to contact someone to help her while this was happening. She knew her memory was going so she kept her finger on that last digit of the number she was dialing so that she could complete the call for help, this took she thinks 45 mins just to dial out an entire number. However she also described a feeling of expanding into the universe, an all-ness and a certainty that she would be OK. She described in the most compelling way (one of the reasons millions of people have viewed her lecture) the utter metaphysical experience that she had. A thing that no one can prove or disprove for that matter. I picked this lecture because its the most famous but I could call on Aubrey de Greys talk on physical immortality, or Jane Goodall”s lecture on the superhumanity of primates, or Keith Barry’s magic, or for that matter Al Gore’s nonsense ‘truth’, or Brian Greene, on string THEORY. But what I would like to leave you with miss is Alain de Bottom’s description of success and happiness. You should soul search my dear and then come back and tell the truth. It doesnt matter if Mr. Vieira is telling the truth or not, it is utterly dishonourable to silence him thus. Shame on you all</p></li>
<li><p>The examples you use in your letter to justify removing the video are non-issues, irrelevant asides, and taking a figure of speech as something else. And you choose to give credence to experts on the opposing side, while giving none to Mr. Vieira. There will always be two sides to an argument. And who are you to say they’re right and Mr. Vieira is wrong? Really, all you’re doing is making the video much more famous and in demand. While impugning your own credibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Vieira refers to more than a thousand historical published documents, spanning several decades, many attributed to various authorities. This quantity is difficult to fathom in the context of Stacy’s rebuttal claim 5. This claim would have us believe that just about everybody excavating burial mounds for several decades between the 19th and 20th centuries opted to perpetrate a hoax. This is as incredible as the apparent information it seeks to debunk!</p></li>
<li><p>It seems to me that it would be more intellectually honest to invite speakers with opposing viewpoints to present the arguments against Mr. Vieira’s contentions. Simple removal of the material is more an approach of censorship than of scientific debate. Given this approach, I would expect that TED would act to deny almost any idea access to its venue unless it was “proven,” also known as accepted by the orthodox scientific community. History shows us time and time again that what is correct today may well be proven incorrect tomorrow. A balanced forum is far better than censorship. Is Mr. Vieria incorrect in his assertions? Quite probably. So what? Bring on the debate, not the censors.</p></li>
<li><p>But TED does not “only present proven facts in the field of science”, they present all sorts of interesting ideas as per their namesake mandate, and Jim’s presentation was not intended to be a scientific presentation but rather obviously a historical observation based on the, um, concrete field evidence and historical record. Moreover, Jim presentation could fall under the “Entertainment” mandate of TED, as clearly many folks are interested in the ideas presented, but should fall under the “Discovery” aspect of the TED mandate as the “Technological” attributes are as yet unverified precisely because of the ignorance of the academic community and failure to properly study the evidence presented by Jim. As a graduate history major and anthropology minor I can attest to the fact that neither discipline is a “science” but rather a consensus that fluctuates depending on funding.</p></li>

<p>there&#39;s just nothing better i can say. these five sum it up rather nicely, imo.</p>

<p>Go read up on the difference between TED and TEDx.  It&#39;s a common misconception that they are the same thing or have the same weight/quality.  Lots of pseudo scientists have begun in recent years getting sessions at TEDx events then proclaiming that they have spoken at TED.  It&#39;s a big issue for the people behind TED.</p>

<p>That I&#39;ve noticed at least.</p>

<p>Yet both times you fail to make any point in the end. Then when questioned you simply don&#39;t answer... and poof into the abyss. Not even to mention that it is almost 100% guaranteed that even you don&#39;t know honestly what happened on that day either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said I believe the official narrative.</p>

<p>See, you are what is wrong with people who want the truth. You are belligerant, namecalling, believe you are certain when you have no way of being certain, you are practically fanatical about what you believe. You use fallacy, ad hominem, and strawman in this case (a fair accomplishment to use 2 fallacies within 2 sentences).</p>

<p>So good job, although logic and critical thinking have left you long ago it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have some serious problems Sir. Go check all those quotes, without error, I&#39;m speaking to people who offer zero evidence for anything. My labeling of nutbags is done after they&#39;ve proven they have no evidence, cause if you have no evidence you have nothing worth even discussing. I gladly admit I use belittlement against those who fail to understand a silly theory means absolutely nothing without evidence.</p>

<p>But feel free to twist that how you like. I at least admit I belittle the ignorant, you however, again have proven you will use fallacy as if it stands alone as an argument.</p>

<p>For the record, I do not care where or what a source is, if it has reproducable, and verifiable data. Keyword: Verifiable.</p>

<p>You post some links to movies, that I agree pose good questions, but they provide no fact, they expose lies, they ask very good questions, they posit interesting theories. I find them to be good learning tools, but then you come in and claim you know &#39;exactly what happened on that day&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>Although you have done exactly as I said you would do, simply moving the goalpost, once again. And after I answer this question, you will move the goalpost again.</p>

<p>I will however answer your question, because it seems you honestly have no idea what verifiability even means.</p>

<p>Take for example, the engineers and scientists who have found and documented nanothermite within the dust collected at ground zero from the twin towers and building 7. That is verifiable information.</p>

<p>Now take for example the main point of this entire post, the guy has zero pictures of these so called giant skeletons, his information comes second hand and third hand, and he himself has never actually seen what he is talking about. This is an example of nonverifiable data.</p>

<p>Was that so hard to understand? Now please move the goalposts so that I can once again answer your silly questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was right about you the entire time, you literally make things up dude...</p>

<p>You just made up a ton of shit about me, utterly nonsense... I have absolutely never said that I disbelieve 9/11 as a false flag. You completely and utterly made that up. </p>

<p>How does it feel to be completely dishonest even with yourself?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t even comprehend that I would admit that I don&#39;t know for sure what happened can you? I have stated time and time again I do not know what exactly happened, and time and time again you claim you do know exactly what happened. You are juvenile and simply repeating the same exact thing over and over even when something is clearly laid out for you.</p>

<p>I also never used thousands of other historical events people and places, so your last paragraph is just you vomiting words to make yourself feel like you have a point.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t have to provide evidence for my claims here because I wasn&#39;t making those claims, though I do believe them, I was showing a silly boy the difference between verifiable and nonverifiable data. I&#39;m sorry that you seem to not have the ability to understand these things.</p>

<p>So why don&#39;t you refute literally anything I&#39;ve said this entire time? The nearing dozens of fallacies that you have used, the clear repitition of the same exact point even after refutation, and the utter lack of any point literally at all?</p>

<p>Or you can claim the microscopes not on you, or you can blah blah blah... I&#39;m tired of your nonsense once again, you bring absolutely nothing to the table except vapid and nonsensical arguments that I find it rather difficult to believe that any self respecting logical thinker would ever find themselves uttering without hating themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ideological context.</p>

<p>during the decades when a majority of these finds were claimed the Smithsonian was the center for the movement of Darwinian elitists, whom were yet still cementing their prominence. finds of giants would have undermined their theory with unnecessary but unavoidable biblical association from their ideological opponents at a critical period. this was charles fort&#39;s own opinion of the matter as well. researchers back then speculated as much, and today, that research lives on and can be found cited in the work of Joseph P Farrell and others. Farrell goes on to suggest there may be other reasons why the elite would try to control this curious aspect of human origin story. it&#39;s fascinating. </p>

<p>It should be possible, imo, to be able at some point to dredge up some proof that something in this context found, described and shipped to the Smithsonian had subsequently disappeared. </p>

Other than the secret caverns under the Smithsonian where the Koch brothers have allegedly kept these giants under wraps,  where can I go and see one of these giant skeletons? Where is the evidence?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve taken a lot of courses dealing with Native American prehistory and what Mr. Vieira says in the beginning is true. There has always been a concentrated effort to disenfranchise early Native American mound builders. Early European researchers went as far as to say Europeans came over, built the mounds, then left, the great mounds were built by Atlanteans, they were built by another race of beings, etc. </p>

<p>The reason for this unwillingness to attribute the mounds and geographic calenders was, as Vieira says, to dehumanize them so Europeans could justify their actions when it came to Native encroachment. I think it is really appalling that this is still going on, especially in the examples from New England that Vieira gives. Intensely complex architecture, aligned to solar and lunar cycles, is reduced to &#39;root cellars&#39; when comparable architecture from early societies in Europe are deemed the wonders of their age. </p>

<p>Everything he says up to this point is absolutely true and it does seem like there has been/is a concerted effort in academia to discredit the sophistication of these earth/stone works. </p>

<p>He lost me with the giants. I&#39;ve never heard about anything like that before, so I did find it really interesting, but not all that credible. True, he does give a large amount of contextual and secondary evidence,  but nothing that is really concrete. I find it really hard to believe that discoveries like this would be completely ignored by evolutionary biologists, historians, and archaeologists just because they didn&#39;t fit into the picture. This would be the find of the century and if any scientist had primary evidence for it he/she would not risk going out on a limb to publish their findings. If they were peer reviewed and proven true he/she would be the envy of all academia. </p>

<p>Also, while there are a lot of alternative theories on the peopleing of the Americas, if you follow the conventional explanation that humans crossed from Siberia to Alaska through Beringia, the evolutionary narrative doesn&#39;t add up at all. Unless this is the most pronounced genetic mutation that has every occurred, there simply isn&#39;t enough time for morphology to change that much in the human species.</p>

<p>So, there is a lot of evidence that Native Americans had far more complex societies than we&#39;ve been told. Cahokia was on it&#39;s way to becoming one of the grandest city-states in the history of the world before Europeans showed up and the intricacy of Native architecture is very under appreciated. But, as for the race of giants, while it is a really fascinating pool of second-hand evidence and definitely makes you raise an eyebrow, is really improbable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m almost positive every giant skeleton found has been a hoax, most of them not even a real life hoax, just photoshop. The reports of them being dug up from the early 20th and late 19th century aren&#39;t convincing to me, as they haven&#39;t survived to the present <em>and</em> that time period was a high water mark for archaeological hoaxes.</p>

<p>Further, unconnected sources saying the exact same thing isn&#39;t as impressive when that thing is &quot;Giants.&quot; which are really just applying the adjective &quot;large&quot; to humans. That is, it&#39;s a combination of an adjective and a noun that any mediocre storyteller might come up with, which would explain why most cultures on the planet have stories about giants (often describing gods, not people on the Earth). It&#39;s a fairly obvious psychologically-impactful flourish. Want to make something scarier in your story? Make it bigger.</p>

<p>Very true. The mound-builders deserve investigation. And the Native American party line that &quot;we were here since the beginning of time&quot; is unscientific bullshit that should not be appeased.</p>

<p>Giants with two rows of teeth are not the answer, though.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure of this. If the passage through Beringia was harrowing enough, a pretty severe population bottleneck could occur and a handful of surviving traits in the remainder would end up expressed in the entire population that follows. I think this is called a &quot;Founder Effect&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an evolutionary biologist or anything though, this just seems a bit more plausible than you&#39;re giving it credit; but to be fair I&#39;ve also read some convincing cases made for them being descendant from earlier sea-fairers. </p>

<p>Still, with you 100% on the giants stuff. All the evidence is there for them being a tall tale, but not much more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll concede that if it were possible, it would probably come from a genetic bottleneck. But still, to diverge that much from the normal human framework (double rows of teeth, even if being 9ft tall could be accounted for through a founder effect) would have to be the work of some crazy eugenics experiment in my opinion. Forming a separate species entirely would be really hard given a shallow gene pool and pressures to intermarry with &quot;non-giants&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no evolutionary biologist either, so I&#39;m going off limited knowledge. I do know a bit about human evolution though, and the history of hominid anatomy has been gradual change without major deviation from the original framework. To go from human to giant due to a migration would be a staggering change. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been interested in different theories on the populating on the New World. There&#39;s one (can&#39;t find it) that has evidence supporting an Australia to Tierra Del Fuego migration. There are two places in the world where these specific negative hand-print paintings show up; Australia and the southern tip of South America. It&#39;s pretty interesting. More info on some others: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_contact_hypotheses">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_contact_hypotheses</a></p>

<p>A lot of archaeologists and anthropologists agree now that it could have been a result of multiple migrations from multiple places via multiple methods.</p>

<p>imo, you&#39;re just overreacting and making sweeping statements, which are pretty rarely justified in general.</p>

<p>and while i agree that empirical evidence is necessary to objectively verify claims scientifically, i don&#39;t think vieira was under any delusions about the nature of the scant data he had. he admitted having little to go off of, and what was there was a tantalizing series of newspaper and digest articles, and claims of a possible intentional epistemological chasm maintained by an entrenched scientific elite, which is not a claim unique to vieira.</p>

<p>the next logical step i can hope for is that some new eyes will be inspired to try and ferret out more data, and see where it leads, rather than play &quot;nuh uh / yes huh.&quot;</p>

<p>Admitting he had little to go off is essentially calling the quantity of available evidence rather weak.

    <div class="md"><p><strong>it is simply the most infantile notion to believe that science is impervious to elitism.</strong> even its own history is literally riddled with cases of individuals or small groups going up against a massive, well financed, and entrenched elite, often with grave effort. this has as well been argued as being a good thing, the so-called &quot;weight of previous evidence&quot;. that may be true but it still euphemistically covers up the reality of entrenched elite human motivation.</p>

<p>you can make an argument about the scientific method, and that is fine. but you must also be able to observe the corruptibility, intentional or un, of people. </p>

<p>additionally, the more i look into the giants thing, which has been a fascination of mine, and not in the biblical way, for some time. i find the opposite is true. the manipulation of hoaxers and storytellers still does not outweigh the circumstantial evidence for a phenomenon of a much more serious nature. i am curious if it is possible to use academic access for proper literature research to try to compile primary sources currently only paraphrased on crude sites on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Berkeley has some of the skeletal fragments from the Humboldt museum claimed to be from giants in lovelock, Nevada and you can request info on them. They say there is nothing out of the ordinary about them. I am inclined to agree with them based on the fact the original news papers that printed the stories stated that John T. Reid(The man that found them) gave the measurement of  16.5 inches for a femur found and said it would have to have belonged to a person that was 7 feet tall. Blatantly false. I don&#39;t know how tall you are but I suggest you measure yours and make a comparison. the Museum of the American Indian also sent out expeditions a few years after and found nothing but artifacts, no skeletons. However, the site is considered one of the most important native american archaeological sites because of the amazing pieces being pulled out of the ground there, including bones and even muscle tissue dating back to 1450 bce. </p>

<p>John T. Reid probably heard tales from the natives he was mining with about a fearsome tribe of giants that fought like demons and was convinced it was a real tale. Think how the Romans first described the goths and Germans they encounter and how they wrote about them being monsters that found like devils.</p>

<p>As for academic access to proper literature. All universities I have wrote or gone to have provided me with more then what I asked for. If you find a professor that or Teachers assistant that really loves their work they are willing to talk your ear off about it as well as share everything they have. Contact Berkeley I&#39;m sure some one in the department would love to talk about it, they are nerds just like us and love to talk and speculate about all this stuff just as much as we do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s all good and well, but out of many possible examples to research, even a few cases certainly cannot be statistically relevant. i&#39;m more interested in going personally through archives for news clippings and primary material like field notes and journals than i am seeking expert academic opinion on the matter. </p>

<p>worth considering is the concept of knowledge filtration, whereby data that falls outside of the current mainstream consensus is not printed or well kept in academic sources, and as a consequence becomes filtered out of the record studied by academics. this is a less malevolent manner in which the epistemological chasm i refer to could be maintained than outright intentional conspiracy. however, i am inclined to entertain theories, as i said. </p>

<p>in determining the value of academic professional opinion, it is important to understand the other aspects of institutionalized academia and its relationship with financiers, &#39;cultural patriarchs&#39;, and global steering group policy. we of our age tend to view scientific culture with a softened lens, smoothing out the shadowy parts that are a lingering consequence of human nature, despite the otherwise excellent methods of discipline. conspiracy is as close to human social behavior as handshaking. it is a fallacy to relegate it to only certain theaters or parties.</p>

<p>*now, i&#39;m not accusing berkeley specifically of conspiracy. it was intended to be more a statement about a human condition in general. my current anthro prof is the anthro chair at the school, did both undergrad and post at berkeley, and is an amazingly brilliant individual and a really cool guy i would not accuse of being steered by power brokers. but, i would like to ask him about such matters around the school if i get a chance at some point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not just one case, That is THEE case. Proven wrong. These are late Victorian/early Edwardian era hoaxes and cons that range from psychic mediums to lost cities and on to magical drinks that can cure all. It was the wild west of scientific and archaeological advancement and you could get away with anything. Hoaxes rarely last days now.</p>

<p>You may want to make it seem like It was as if an occult hand had swooped in and plucked out all this ancient lost knowledge or block it from being seen but the fact remains if it is worth pursing, the scientific community that it pertains to will pursue it. It&#39;s the reason we have a Large Hadron Collider and not a Large shaking device to make homeopathy dilutions. Its the reason Atomic theory is taught in stead of phlogiston theory. Homeopathy and phlogiston share a similar story, they were proposed and pursued but in the end they were found wanting and therefor dismissed by the scientific communities.</p>

<p>I ask you this: What purpose does covering up a new discovery serve in the scientific community? If it is earth shattering and new, everyone wants to be in the forefront of that field so it serves no purpose for academics to cover up work that might lead to that kind of advancement. Everyone wants to be the next Higgs or Eisenstein and i think that bit of human nature out weights the conspiratorial one. </p>

<p>as defensible as this position is, i cannot prove it in light of absolutely statistically relevant anomalous data, which though is at best contextual, alludes to the possibility of lost, suppressed or filtered out data.</p>

<p>you can tell all the usual popular science narratives of the achievements of science over pseudo science and superstition, but it doesn&#39;t address any of the oblique elitism the modern academic culture of the western world exhibited in the early 20th century, and continues to exhibit today.</p>

<p>these idealistic narratives about what scientists want, do, how they behave are sweeping generalizations that conveniently omit such concerns as i have raised. </p>

<p>basically, without access to the physical evidence that was claimed recovered, it is the weight of the existing record that makes any dismissing of these anomalies defensible on evidential grounds. however, for me, at this point, that is just not good enough. </p>

<p>i have read of hoaxes, and how specialists of the day often called them out, to no detriment to their circus popularity - the obvious reference here could be the Cardiff Giant. i have also read accounts of anomalous prehistorical archeological findings of mummified red haired beings of abnormal height and unknown cultural affiliation in the associated material remains, that no one can find a shred about today in the public domain. it is possible such information exists in private collections.</p>

<p>i am aware of some of the hierarchical nature of the american academic elite, and i will certainly entertain theories that include either intentional information suppression, or unintentional knowledge filtration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is not the only occasion in which red haired giants have been claimed to have been found. it does not take much looking to observe this. and at that, it was only mentioned as an example among a set of anomalous data distinctly different from the Cardiff Giant, which experts of the day readily refuted, despite your claim otherwise. </p>

<p>&quot;this scientific elite&quot; has examples all throughout history. out of a hat, examine the relationship between the young Faraday and his mentor Davy and his elite academic circle that attempted to have Faraday censored for being right too quickly for them. another example would be how the funding of tesla was cut when his projects were considered to run afoul of the financier&#39;s political agenda. also, whose foundations have built many of our illustrious institutions but rockefeller&#39;s? whose money saw to it that certain research and certain personalities would find major purchase over others? today we find examples of industries manipulating scientists and their studies in support of questionable products, and getting caught doing it. evidence also exists of revolving door policies that allow industry advocates in positions of regulation and approval process, such as the FDA. it is not difficult to find evidence of less than scientific behavior motivating the development and uses of scientific data and authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact it is the only instance I can find of red haired giants. A dubious and I would even say false claim. You keep bringing up the Cardiff giant for some reason, why is that? I don&#39;t recall saying anything about it.</p>

<p>As for Faraday, He didn&#39;t credit Davy or Wollaston for the work he did with them when he published his findings. That&#39;s why he was given so much shit in the royal society, You credit those who help you. He wasn&#39;t censored because he was right, they took him to task because he was a dick. He even went on to work for the royal society so that example doesn&#39;t work either. </p>

<p>Tesla didn&#39;t lose funding, he blew through his money on his work and when he asked for more, JP Morgan refused. He realized Tesla had royally screwed up and because of all his delays in production Marconi also had a patent on radio tech. He bet on Tesla and Tesla lost.</p>

<p>And yes you do see corporations buying scientists. You also see the rest of the scientific community calling them out all the time for it. Look at the GMO debate. Whenever a study gets done the first thing that is looked at is who paid for it. The next is whether or not the science is good. If Monsanto paid for it? its rejected. If non Monsanto guys do the study its put under the same microscope that everything else is, and the last few big studies have been terrible and called out for it. The system works.</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Morgan had already orchestrated circumstances in Tesla’s life in order to force Tesla to be dependent on him for financial backing. During an earlier period, when Tesla himself had millions from his Polyphase AC generator royalty payments and other earnings, Morgan wanted to woo Tesla with a deal that effectively gave Morgan majority control over his patent rights and projects, but Tesla turned him down, telling Morgan that he had enough money of his own to fund his projects.  While returning to his hotel from that very meeting with Morgan, however, Tesla was told that his laboratory had been burned to the ground. It represented a tremendous loss to Tesla and it shook him deeply. Everyone, of course, felt convinced that Morgan was behind the arson. In order to save face, Morgan was embarrassed by Tesla into putting up the money to pay for the rebuilding of a new lab as an act of “philanthropy”. From that time forward, however, other financial backers were not to be found. Morgan was powerful enough to black list Tesla among the Eastern Establishment elites that previously had hobnobbed and feted with Tesla as if he was one of their own. Black listing and ostracization by officialdom and financiers lifted somewhat after Morgan’s death, but generally continued to haunt Tesla for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Before the turn of the century, Tesla also willingly gave up millions, perhaps billions, in royalty earnings to George Westinghouse in an unprecedented act of friendship. Westinghouse had believed in the superiority of Tesla’s AC system and provided the money to build Tesla’s big AC  generators at Niagra Falls, NY. Tesla was paid millions up front for his patents, but was also due to receive royalty earnings for every kilowatt of power produced. When Westinghouse ran into financial difficulties at a later date, Tesla tore up his royalty contract in order to save Westinghouse from financial ruin. Had he not done that, Tesla would have had enough money from royalties to keep him ensconced in great wealth for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>The story is frequently told that when Morgan found out from Tesla that the true purpose of the Wardenclyffe transmitter was to provide free electricity to the world, he abruptly pulled the funding. That’s not completely accurate. The economic conditions were recessionary at the time and the stock market had taken a considerable dip that year. Morgan wasn’t interested in risking any more capital in perilous times on a project he couldn’t fully fathom and wasn’t completely convinced of. Tesla held land ownership of the Wardenclyffe site and tower, but no further work was done after 1910. In 1914, Tesla was deeply in debt and signed over the deed of Wardenclyffe Station to pay off years of back rent due to the owners of the New Yorker Hotel where he was living (he occupied two penthouse suites in the hotel). In 1917, the hotel owners had the tower demolished and its parts sold for salvage. Despite the loss of Wardenclyffe, Tesla continued to refine his understanding of Radiant Energy and miniaturize the equipment needed to produce it. He eventually was able to reduce the equipment down to the size of a suit case. </p>

<p>i&#39;m going to kindly end this thread now with you. i am going to continue to search for appreciable data on this topic, despite your great effort to demonstrate how you are certain of it to be bunk. i think contextually there is a <em>strong enough</em> case to suggest the possibility of occluded data, and it will not injure me gravely to spend some time to research. i see no reason to disincentivize the endeavor, but that is my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sorry but your 3 cases for giants are outstanding examples of why you shouldn&#39;t believe what you read on the internet. The first one even says at the top of the page evidence points to this being falsified. The second is not even a case for them, its simply red headed people. It then goes on about aliens for no reason at all. The 3rd is a news paper article that says some hunters got attacked by giant people with red hair and then nothing. The page also goes on to say that &quot;We know 3 things&quot; and includes that goliath showed up with the philistines in 10th century bce?

A version of history, mind you, that attracts about $11B worth of tourism to Egypt, each year.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Don&#39;t count out &quot;crackpot&quot; ideas, because science may end up proving them right at some point.</p>

<p>Correct.</p>

<p>&quot;2000 years ago 40 foot tall men lived with 12 rows of teeth and ate the native population until they rose up and killed them with the power of prayer&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, baby steps. he&#39;s a mason, he should do the talk on masonry. once we all agree on the validity of that, we can build on our understanding. </p>

<p>the only real evidence i saw regarding giant skeletons was the picture of two guys standing on either side of a big weird dead body.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cultofweird.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/giant-mound-builder.jpg">http://www.cultofweird.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/giant-mound-builder.jpg</a></p>

<p>from the apparent age of the photo it would seem hard to fake a body that well. but the bottom line is, either these skeletons exist or they don&#39;t. if someone at one of these roadside museums has a giant skull or something, let&#39;s see a pic.</p>

<p>and really, giants just capture the imagination. if they were big, that&#39;s cool but i assume they were still meso-american indians culturally.</p>

<p>&quot;this scientific elite&quot; has examples all throughout history. out of a hat, examine the relationship between the young Faraday and his mentor Davy and his elite academic circle that attempted to have Faraday censored for being right too quickly for them. another example would be how the funding of tesla was cut when his projects were considered to run afoul of the financier&#39;s political agenda. also, whose foundations have built many of our illustrious institutions but rockefeller&#39;s? whose money saw to it that certain research and certain personalities would find major purchase over others? today we find examples of industries manipulating scientists and their studies in support of questionable products, and getting caught doing it. evidence also exists of revolving door policies that allow industry advocates in positions of regulation and approval process, such as the FDA. it is not difficult to find evidence of less than scientific behavior motivating the development and uses of scientific data and authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crackpot ideas, yes. The guy was saying there were giants living all across America but he had no evidence because all the skeletons were hidden by the Smithsonian and the Koch brothers!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see what 9/11 has to with this, but my views on this are not secret. There is <em>extensive</em> evidence that there was a conspiracy behind the 9/11 attacks, led by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and financed and encouraged by Osama bin Laden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, EXCELLENT book!  I&#39;m almost done with it, but I love the way that it is referenced.  Even getting it through Google Play, in eBook format.. EVERYTHING is referenced, and linked to the references in the back.  So, if you want to follow some of the tangents, further, you <em>can</em>!  =)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>funny this is the second time you&#39;ve simply come out with &quot;Lets test this guy! What&#39;s your opinion on 9/11?!&#39; </p>

<p>That I&#39;ve noticed at least.</p>

<p>Yet both times you fail to make any point in the end. Then when questioned you simply don&#39;t answer... and poof into the abyss. Not even to mention that it is almost 100% guaranteed that even you don&#39;t know honestly what happened on that day either.</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Morgan had already orchestrated circumstances in Tesla’s life in order to force Tesla to be dependent on him for financial backing. During an earlier period, when Tesla himself had millions from his Polyphase AC generator royalty payments and other earnings, Morgan wanted to woo Tesla with a deal that effectively gave Morgan majority control over his patent rights and projects, but Tesla turned him down, telling Morgan that he had enough money of his own to fund his projects.  While returning to his hotel from that very meeting with Morgan, however, Tesla was told that his laboratory had been burned to the ground. It represented a tremendous loss to Tesla and it shook him deeply. Everyone, of course, felt convinced that Morgan was behind the arson. In order to save face, Morgan was embarrassed by Tesla into putting up the money to pay for the rebuilding of a new lab as an act of “philanthropy”. From that time forward, however, other financial backers were not to be found. Morgan was powerful enough to black list Tesla among the Eastern Establishment elites that previously had hobnobbed and feted with Tesla as if he was one of their own. Black listing and ostracization by officialdom and financiers lifted somewhat after Morgan’s death, but generally continued to haunt Tesla for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Before the turn of the century, Tesla also willingly gave up millions, perhaps billions, in royalty earnings to George Westinghouse in an unprecedented act of friendship. Westinghouse had believed in the superiority of Tesla’s AC system and provided the money to build Tesla’s big AC  generators at Niagra Falls, NY. Tesla was paid millions up front for his patents, but was also due to receive royalty earnings for every kilowatt of power produced. When Westinghouse ran into financial difficulties at a later date, Tesla tore up his royalty contract in order to save Westinghouse from financial ruin. Had he not done that, Tesla would have had enough money from royalties to keep him ensconced in great wealth for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>The story is frequently told that when Morgan found out from Tesla that the true purpose of the Wardenclyffe transmitter was to provide free electricity to the world, he abruptly pulled the funding. That’s not completely accurate. The economic conditions were recessionary at the time and the stock market had taken a considerable dip that year. Morgan wasn’t interested in risking any more capital in perilous times on a project he couldn’t fully fathom and wasn’t completely convinced of. Tesla held land ownership of the Wardenclyffe site and tower, but no further work was done after 1910. In 1914, Tesla was deeply in debt and signed over the deed of Wardenclyffe Station to pay off years of back rent due to the owners of the New Yorker Hotel where he was living (he occupied two penthouse suites in the hotel). In 1917, the hotel owners had the tower demolished and its parts sold for salvage. Despite the loss of Wardenclyffe, Tesla continued to refine his understanding of Radiant Energy and miniaturize the equipment needed to produce it. He eventually was able to reduce the equipment down to the size of a suit case. </p>

<p>i&#39;m going to kindly end this thread now with you. i am going to continue to search for appreciable data on this topic, despite your great effort to demonstrate how you are certain of it to be bunk. i think contextually there is a <em>strong enough</em> case to suggest the possibility of occluded data, and it will not injure me gravely to spend some time to research. i see no reason to disincentivize the endeavor, but that is my opinion.</p>
