Also taking into account the current international surveillance on the masses to stop terrorist action - Does anyone actually feel safer today?  Also, was it maybe intentional to increase the numbers of terrorists thereby continuing the cash-flow into the military industrial complex and also increasingly erode the rights of our own people in the process?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>use of drone strikes was in March 2011 when 40 people were killed, many of whom were civilians at a local tribal meeting</p></li>
<li><p>The use of drone strikes also allows the Taliban to win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; game and as a result it has been successful at recruiting disaffected Pakistanis from within the villages and streets using emotive and effective propaganda tools such as CDs and DVDs,</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Because social media and the internet have exposed western abuses to a wide audience, such as the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/06/04/obama_again_bombs_mourners/">drone strikes on funerals</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan">&#39;double-tapping&#39; rescuers of previous attacks</a>, renditions, sexual abuse at guantanamo, indefinite detention at guantanamo, forcefeeding at guantanamo, the illegitimacy of the Iraq invasion, the list can go on for quite a while.</p>

<p>Without western hegemony in the Islamic world, there would be no Islamic terrorists. Or do you believe they hate us for our &#39;freedom&#39;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess my comment is in the minority here. My view is that the war on terrorism was a good plan, but should have been executed differently. There are ways to wage war that don&#39;t include bombs and guns. I do, however, think that media has made it easier for them to band together, just as it has ignited many of the uprisings in the middle east. </p>

<p>It has to do mostly with the problems brought along by lingering imperialism and a whole bunch of religious unrest. It&#39;s not a  &#39;hate for freedom&#39; but (in my eyes) a scapegoat to band the peoples together. Sure the US has done some sick things. The real question is, does the good we do outweigh the bad? The United States is not the only country that has done wrong before. </p>

<p>On a related off shoot from my comment, Yes, I do know that knowledge of terrible things like the war crimes we have done makes people upset.</p>
