       I've been thinking this for awhile now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sidney Leathers? just shows up once Weiner's ahead in the NYC Mayor race?  Now this whore is making $100,000 from Inside Edition for an interview that is essentially an orchestrated political hit?  Former tanning salon worker and political blogger?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the guy isn't freaky.  But he had phone sex?  Big fucking deal.  His wife obviously knows about this shit.  And he's not actually meeting them, he's basically just getting free cam sex from slutty young girls.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's wrong with that?  The girl rubbed her pussy on a live feed for this hairy New Yorker - she can hardly complain about being misused.  And she wouldn't be a whore if she wasn't whoring it up on tv and ruining this guy's mayoral race.  Why doesn't he put the pics of HER on the internet like SHE did to him.  Then everyone can judge her for doing the exact same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only problem I see is that the guy should have known some political operative was gonna throw a honey-pot at him, just in case he decided to try and get back into public office.  Seems to be working, as all the hypocrites can't get enough coverage of themselves denouncing his dirty deeds done dirt cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sigh.  In the end, Weiner shouldn't be Mayor.  Not because he shot his load on Sidney Leathers's iPad, but because he's too dumb to chill out his freakydeakyness before he's gainfully employed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kennedy fucked Marilyn Monroe and a nation of secret boners waved in throbbing envy and respect.  These days a dude just looking for a selfie to jerk off to is a monster of moral turpitude.

       Times have changed.

       Everyone has done something wrong in their lives. All the keyholders have to do is make a call. A scandal to cover up their scandal.

       if we look real close we might find that he's even died or acted for one of the many other false flags we've been drenched in while they dispose of manning and install rothschild banks in syria.  Then its off to n korea and iran to spread banking, i mean democracy.
