    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking this for awhile now.</p>

<p>Sidney Leathers? just shows up once Weiner&#39;s ahead in the NYC Mayor race?  Now this whore is making $100,000 from Inside Edition for an interview that is essentially an orchestrated political hit?  Former tanning salon worker and political blogger?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the guy isn&#39;t freaky.  But he had phone sex?  Big fucking deal.  His wife obviously knows about this shit.  And he&#39;s not actually meeting them, he&#39;s basically just getting free cam sex from slutty young girls.</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with that?  The girl rubbed her pussy on a live feed for this hairy New Yorker - she can hardly complain about being misused.  And she wouldn&#39;t be a whore if she wasn&#39;t whoring it up on tv and ruining this guy&#39;s mayoral race.  Why doesn&#39;t he put the pics of HER on the internet like SHE did to him.  Then everyone can judge her for doing the exact same thing.</p>

<p>The only problem I see is that the guy should have known some political operative was gonna throw a honey-pot at him, just in case he decided to try and get back into public office.  Seems to be working, as all the hypocrites can&#39;t get enough coverage of themselves denouncing his dirty deeds done dirt cheap.</p>

<p>Sigh.  In the end, Weiner shouldn&#39;t be Mayor.  Not because he shot his load on Sidney Leathers&#39;s iPad, but because he&#39;s too dumb to chill out his freakydeakyness before he&#39;s gainfully employed.</p>

<p>Kennedy fucked Marilyn Monroe and a nation of secret boners waved in throbbing envy and respect.  These days a dude just looking for a selfie to jerk off to is a monster of moral turpitude.</p>

<p>Times have changed.</p>
