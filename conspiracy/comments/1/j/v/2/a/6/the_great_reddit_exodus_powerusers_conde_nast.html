       Here's how we are different:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) There is no common feed. Your feed is based on following any combination of users, tags, or domains. When you follow a user, you see what they post, and what they share. You can ignore any user, tag, or domain, and posts with them won't appear in your feed.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Users are their own moderators. You can ignore users and tags, and you can mute users, which means they can't comment on your posts. You can't moderate on another user's post.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Posts can have up to two tags from the author, and the community can add a third tag. (Newbies can't participate in community tagging)
      </p>
      <p>
       4) When you've used Hubski for a bit, you can start badging content. Badges highlight comments and posts for the rest of the community to see. Here is the
       <a href="http://hubski.com/badgesubs">
        badged feed
       </a>
       . As you use Hubski, you earn badges that you can give away.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) PMs can include any number of users.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) There's a bunch of other things, from active magnet links to a chatter page, that shows you what people around your feed are talking about. But 1-5 is the most important stuff. We are working on some other things at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been around for a while, and we aren't going anywhere. We have our own goals, and they aren't always the same as Reddit's. People often think we won't survive the eternal September, but that misunderstands the nature of the site. Hubski is more like Twitter when it comes to what you see. There's a ton of crap on Twitter, but it's easy for me to avoid it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be happy to answer any questions.

        piece on us

       in the very beginning. We've had almost no press. The short version is that I wanted to build a site that provided what I was looking for. I have goals for the site, and that's what guides us. We aren't flailing about trying to get popular.

       "independent" much like 'objective' or'free', is largely a conceptual fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to far round the bend of independent you come out on the side of 'authorized/verified' independent - but who would verify its independence. at Least on reddit there are more verifiers or authorizers. Its kinda dualistic, and I think Reddit in its current form is invaluable in providing a diversified and adaptive platform. What more could we expect? At least here we can game back...
      </p>
      <p>
       In my pragmatic opinion, reddit is adaptive and resilient to being destroyed by being gamed but not protected from it entirely. Its a fair balance and its power is in the myriad of users' awareness-es

       At least by staying here we can keep an eye on them and learn from their shenanigans.    I think it's interesting to watch them try to manipulate as if everyone wasn't aware what they are doing.

       The sockpuppet/AI angle is really good to watch for too.  Why employ hundreds of dumb american and chinese kids to correct opinions, when a machine can do it.

       Good post dos. I just found out about
       <a href="http://digg.com/">
        digg

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit doesn't get it's shit together; it will fail. And failing can mean; lose it's intellectual community. How many of you still pay for television? Case in point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Innovation will eradicate this fuck of a site before too long; if they don't start doing things right. In the meantime... an exodus is a great idea. Although I'll admit... sticking around and educating the retarded has it's merits.

       Many Digg users came to Reddit after Digg changed it's method of posting and voting on stories.  They even called it an exodus.

       Digg used to be decent until they changed.

       Great links/comment, thanks. Digg looks like it used to be pretty great. If you haven't checked out
       <a href="http://hubski.com/">
        hubski
       </a>
       , I'd recommend that as a similar site to what digg looks like it used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ya. So far I'm most impressed with hubski; as far as format goes. It could likely use more of a user base and probably has some lack where reddit doesn't... but seriously; reddit's fucked anyway. Only reason I stick around is for the meaningful posts/conversations/education I can provide and engage in here. When something better comes along; I won't hesitate to abandon this site forever.

       Which is probably worse, because such empires with collections of owned media usually serve agendas for someone high up.  Look at Rupert Murdoch's pyramid of political-influence media, with Fox News and newspapers and tapping phones. Rotten from the top down.
