    <div class="md"><p>Pitch for A above middle C has been as high as 466 Hz at points in history.  Likely even higher...  Higher pitches have greater amplitude to allow for more prominent, richer overtones.  This makes for brighter more in depth sound, and a more fulfilling musical experience.</p>

<p>Although A at 440 Hz is an acknowledged standard, it is not the rule.  Boston Symphony Orchestra uses A=442 Hz.  And many European orchestras use A=443 Hz.</p>

<p>Instrument makers wanting their instruments to sound brighter, more vibrant, and express more life musically than their competition would inflate the tuning frequency for this purpose.</p>

<p>Orchestras wishing to express the same qualities also inflated their pitch.  Orchestras seeking a deeper, darker sound did the exact opposite.</p>

<p>MANY bands tune down a half-step for their lead singer, to reduce strain and increase the vocal range in their music.  Still, MANY bands use what I call sloppy tuning.  A lot of AC/DC is not tuned to any specific pitch.  They just tuned up, relative to each other, and went for it.</p>

<p>Still... Many bands tune very finely to A=440 Hz.  But in the mixing/mastering process, the pitch is tweaked to offer just the right amount of fullness for the presentation of the song&#39;s mood.  (Check the tuning of Bon Jovi&#39;s &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;.)</p>

<p>My band used to tune down a half-step just to make the sound fatter, darker, and heavier.</p>

<p>A=440 Hz was decided upon as a midway point between the lowest and highest of historical A&#39;s.  This would provide amplitude for richness of overtones, while sparing the accompanying vocalist&#39;s voice.</p>

<p>There was never a standard of A=432 Hz.  Before A=440 Hz became the standard, pitch was all over the place.  The closest thing to a previous standard was the Austrian government&#39;s 1885 recommendation of 435 Hz.</p>

<p>Although A=440 Hz is standard, it is not the rule of law.  Many European countries still use 442 and 443.</p>

<p>To think that this is conspiratorial is just plain asinine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>different types of wood resonate better with different frequencies.  I disagree on a universal frequency, rather it is relative frequencies that produce effects.</p>

<p>by slowing down the Adele song, you change absolute, but not relative frequencies.  the chords are still chords.   besides, human hearing is logarithmic.   Since the notes we use in the western scale are related by natural logarithms, playing in different keys does indeed affect some relative frequencies and harmonics.   Here I think you&#39;re just slowing down the tape, so the effect isn&#39;t really as noticeable as if everyone played in a lower key.   </p>

<p>Jimi Hendrix and Tony Iommi are known for playing in lower tunings.  The effects on tone and feedback are noticeable, but the psychological effect of their music comes more from the relative frequencies involved, and very much the rhythms and tone sequences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most music worldwide has been tuned to 440 hertz since the International Standards Organization (ISO) endorsed it in 1953. The recent rediscoveries of the vibratory / oscillatory nature of the universe indicate that this contemporary international concert pitch standard may generate an unhealthy effect or anti-social behaviour in the consciousness of human beings.</p>

<p>A=432 Hz, known as Verdi’s ‘A’ is an alternative tuning that is mathematically consistent with the universe. Music based on 432 Hz transmits beneficial healing energy, because it is a pure tone of math fundamental to nature.</p>

<p>There is a theory that the change from 432 Hz to 440 Hz was dictated by Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. He used it to make people think and feel a certain manner, and to make them a prisoner of a certain consciousness. Then around 1940 the United States introduced 440 Hz worldwide, and finally in 1953 it became the Worldwide ISO 16-standard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a jazz musician who has taken 6 years worth of ear training and I honestly can&#39;t hear the difference between the two when played separately and side by side.  That&#39;s not to say this is all BS, but that&#39;s my two cents.  On a slightly unrelated note, when I meditate to 432Hz tones, I tend to leave my session feeling peaceful, uplifted, and my body feels tingly.  I usually get this with frequency meditations, but it&#39;s more pronounced when I use the 432Hz tones.  I don&#39;t know if that will add to anything, but I thought I would share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t see how it is different except that the key seems to change slightly.  I understand the frequency stuff as well and I suppose it make sense to resonate with nature instead of being pushed up a little.  I would have to assume the change was to hit a nice even number with little notice of the pitch change.</p>

<p>The best thing I got out of the 2 minutes of research I did on it may have been the best thing I found all year and explains even further where we are today in the US:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” -Nikola Tesla

<p>If I can dwell upon this, when you listen to the 432 version, the music is being played into your brain. When you listen to the 440 version the music feels like it&#39;s being played at you in an aggressive tone.</p>

<p>So, on a playful juggle of teslas words, you are thinking <em>in</em> the 432 frequency when you listen to the music.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God damn!  You STILL don&#39;t get it!</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about voice frequency!  It is about the WHOLE song being based off of A=440 Hz.  Even if the song is in Bb Minor and A and 440 Hz are never even present in the song, all of the notes and harmonics are mathematically relative to 440.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about ONE note!  It&#39;s about ALL the relative tones and overtones being either harmonious or dissonant with human physiology.</p>

<p>This is my last post in response to you.  You are hopelessly ignorant of this entire discussion.  You&#39;re argument goes so far off in the wrong direction it&#39;s disgusting... It is readily apparent that you don&#39;t even understand the basis of the conspiracy claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I agree that it isn&#39;t a conspiracy. However, I think that people respond to certain frequencies in certain ways. The way that music makes you feel emotion is kind of the way that I believe these frequencies affect us. It definitely is a science, and can be used for positive or negative ends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t.  You are obviously completely ignorant of the the discussion at hand.</p>

<p>If you pick a frequency to which you are going to tune, there are harmonics present in every note that are relative to that frequency.  Although I play A at 440 Hz, 440 Hz is only the base, most prominent frequency.  There are endless other frequencies present in that note, known as harmonics.  Akin to overtones.</p>

<p>OP is saying that by tuning to 440 Hz, the other relative notes (frequencies) in the scale, and their overtones (other frequencies), are not relative to the frequencies of the human brain.</p>

<p>And OP suggests that with tuning to 432 Hz, the relative frequencies of the rest of the notes and harmonics are more in tune with frequencies of our brains.</p>

<p>When frequencies are out of tune, they are dissonant.  Out of tune, meaning that their tones and overtones are not mathematically related to each other.   Dissonance is not pleasant, whether obvious and up front, or buried and only perceived.  This dissonance between music and the brain is where OP&#39;s suggestion that music is engineered to conflict with our subconscious comes from.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with you, 60 Hz, and your subwoofers.</p>

<p>Let him listen to his 60 &quot;hurtz&quot; sine waves and be happy. There are some people that, no matter how much knowledge you try to share, just will NOT pick up on it.</p>

<p>This guy has obviously never heard of frequency entrainment, or even understands the basics of how overtones and harmonics &quot;work.&quot;</p>

<p>And you fail to observe just how frequencies affect physiology.</p>

<p>Just about everything you have posted has NO bearing on the discussion at hand.</p>

<p>OP&#39;s claim is:
Tones and harmonics based on A=432 Hz are harmonious with human physiology.
Tones and harmonics based on A=440 Hz are not harmonious with human physiology.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about the tone and harmonics in relation to your body.</p>

<p>This discussion has nothing to do with the frequency range and subwoofers.</p>
