        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People have actually convinced themselves that dealing with chronic aches and pains, illnesses, lack of energy, and declining health are to be expected. It&#39;s become so prevalent that its accepted as normal. </p>

<p>In fact, most assume that their head and body aches, poor circulation, painful joints, decreased hearing and vision, loss of motor-skills, decreasing ability and capacity to perform regular exercise, breathing difficulties, restless sleep, and generally poor health is just how it is for everyone because their friends and family have the same ailments.</p>

<p>The bar has been lowered so dramatically that if you don&#39;t have these symptoms, ailments, issues; you are now the minority. Most are on multiple medications and prescriptions or they use OTC meds daily. The average and typical diet and lifestyle have become dangerously out of proportion. </p>

<p>Know that you don&#39;t have to live with aches, pains, and discomfort. Know that you don&#39;t need to rely on meds, scripts, and OTCs. This doesn&#39;t have to be your life. You can live independently, freely, capably, and comfortably. You can be happy, healthy, confident, and strong. You can be more than you are allowing yourself to be.</p>
