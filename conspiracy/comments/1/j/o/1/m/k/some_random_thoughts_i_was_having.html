       Those in power have basically created this extremely large outer ring of bureaucratic protection, while consolidating their wealth and power. A completely secret court with secret laws, that allow them to not only do as they please, it seems they can almost anytime get their way with the laws in congress too.

       They've perfectly engineered our emotions against us. We hate those of us who aren't all gung-ho to go to war or feel that it's not necessary to have the absolutely most absurd military budget possible, or some other way of alienating people who are against their plans. We've actually become complacent while we're absolutely screwed over royally,

       I was thinking about the recent information about the NSA projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember hearing about the Nazis having their mind control experiments, I've heard about the CIA mind control experiments as well. What if the NSA's newest experiment is part of a larger mind control experiment? One involving trying different things: controlled/planted terrorism, country wide alerts (Terrorism levels), controlled leaks, controlled politicians, you name it. From this they then use their systems to try and determine the general moods and/or psychology of the populace? With this kind of data and system, they could in essence control the world. They would have a formula of what to do to control the population. Would something like this make sense for a government to have? I guess it does if you want to try and forever maintain control.

       The scary part to me is that I've spent the past 15 years of my life reading and studying and reading some more about various subjects.  I feel like it is all at a crescendo now and I am putting things together.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I am as spooked as everybody else about hastings and all of the other suspicious deaths.  I started thinking back over time about it since this basically is easy confirmation that our government is killing citizens who will reveal corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I got to JFK and couldn't get the idea of Curtis Lemay's cold hatred for the Kennedys and his lust for death and war and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lemay and the joint chiefs killed the Kennedys.  We've had a subversive military state since then run by puppets at the highest levels.  I was born in the 70s and haven't been free a day in my life.

       perhaps they just don't care? They're perfectly happy living their lives, which are made safe by today's society. Why would they give a crap about those in power, people they will in all likelihood never met and who will never have an impact on their lives?

       Ok sure, they do have an impact on our lives, I will admit my mistake. However I cant help but feel you are exaggerating the extent of which they affect us! A lot of people could live their entire lives happily without really noticing the government's impact. To say we will be "backed into a corner and realizing all our freedoms and rights are gone" is a ridiculous overstatement, you have to admit!

       It's not an overstatement in the least - many of our rights have already been taken. If you don't think it's already affecting you, hate to say it, but you must be blind or ignorant.  Everything you do and say is recorded and put into a databank.  19% of your income tax is going to fund defense (aka offense).  That money, from your salary, is going to killing innocents abroad as well as irradiating the land/water/air with nano-particulate (from depleted uranium munitions).  The establishment of (mis)education builds a false reality where people believe certain deceptions (like 'medicine' saving lives, when in reality, it's the greatest purveyor of deaths-per-year).  ER situations are fine (broken bones, car accidents, ruptured organs etc), but like everything in our corrupted-capitalist society, it's built on profit and bottom-dollars.  I just had a beautiful baby girl at home, with zero intervention ~ she's completely healthy and fine. You are a commodity to be sold.  Justice now serves to stockpile humans into for-profit prisons.  The prison-system is a new form of control in which; you lose your right to vote, makes it near-impossible to find a job/housing etc etc.  You become an outcast.  All the while, big corporations are destroying our Earth (several front page posts today attest to this gross misconduct) and being fined meaningless punishments that they can accrue back in a week (or hours.. or even minutes).  You may think it's not affecting you, but only because of it's slow growth and your background have you neglected to see it's power.

       Its hard to say. I haven't looked at this planet the same for years now. Soon you will realize how domesticated we are, how everything we do/think/love/hate has been manufactured. When you notice that your favorite things aren't real - its very depressing. A human born today has no chance, no option to be real.  When I get away - and get back to nature for a day or so, it's the most depressing feeling in the world to know we're never getting it back.

       But then again think of what the technology of this day and age has brought us! None of which would have been achievable without some kind of social order. Sure, we sacrifice some freedom, and the environment suffers a bit, but its a compromise I think is entirely worth it! 
I guess it really depends on your perspective, and optimism/pessimism.

       I like to think that image is true but the problem is there is so many levels of awakened understanding, there is getting it ('aah shits bad, things need to change, lets do something') and then there is getting it! ('Yeah we're most likely run by some form a Illuminati power structure, just about every aspect of life has been planned out and we're in a lot of trouble')

       Definitely. The same way that a twitter hashtag picks up topics that are trending, there are software which determine mood and sentiment.  Any psychological operation is going to have a DARPA program following it to gauge public opinion.  My assumption is that there are simulations being run to determine at what point this public sentiment reaches critical stages as could boil over into something more pronounced.  If you know WHEN you are bound to see significant protest- it is easier to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The academic consensus right now is that the first world is due to see some sort of large protest movement against the current system (as it is progressing) by the year 2030.  Clearly this is a huge threat to security- Not just for the status quo, but for the west as it stands as a world power. It would be easy for Russia or China to aid a protest movement in an attempt to destabilize.  This is one of the reasons I find Snowden going to Russia and China suspicious.  They aren't like Switzerland- some neutral with non extradition privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Data collection from:  Video games, Internet usage, Email and Phone content and metadata, shopping/credit card purchases/banking records, Music choice, television records, Social Media and perhaps even facial recognition in public forums is able to provide data on trends and sentiment.  The data profiles we are building are becoming more an more detailed and the technocrats who have access to the data are being given better and better prophetic powers with the simulations they are able to run being more and more defined.

       I appreciate your thoughts. I do think that we need to maintain a level of suspicion regarding the leaks/scandals. You can analyse starting from various assumptions but one surely has to be that the government are interested in testing the public's sensitivity to these scandalous news events which will surely tempt the anarchist.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this kind of assumption the military searches after the boston bombs, the weird national emergency texts, terror alarms etc take a new perspective.

       It does seem like the media are generally trying to paint a picture of the world falling apart though. I'm in Britain and although the MSM/general political situation doesn't seem as explicitly corrupted, I still notice that the BBC is on a mission to create an atmosphere of crisis/scandal/revolution, which makes me wonder how much of this stuff is actually an experiment. The TV always tries to convince us the the MP's and the government are incompetent, that murder/child abduction/road accidents are everywhere, that the middle east is in turmoil. Is it experimental or is it straight up propaganda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe these are just the 'elites' attempts to disseminate fear into the population, or even eventually spark revolution against the 'state', in the hope that the people won't realize the state aren't in control?

       This is the type of post that completely turns people off and says this place is crazy. Fine, you believe in the Annunaki, C'Thulu, and ultraterrestrials, but the average person doesn't. Don't you think it's better to get the masses listening before you turn them away?
