        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Julia Davis, a national security whistleblower  discovered and reported a breach of national security at the largest and busiest land border crossing in the U.S. on 4th of July, 2004. </p>

<p>The DHS failed to act on her reports but instead of correcting the shortcomings exposed by Julia’s report, they opened investigations against her. </p>

<p>Her husband BJ, a film producer who documented these events , never reported on by mainstream media, although Julia took her case to court and won.</p>

<p>They detail unprecedented retaliation and abuses of the Patriot Act in Julia’s case and talk about how the DHS spent American taxpayer’s money on warrantless surveillance, including aerial surveillance with a Blackhawk helicopter and a fixed-wing airplane, wiretaps, sneak and peek burglaries, Internet monitoring and On-Star tracking of the Davis family. </p>

<p>They explain why this story was never reported on by mainstream media and who was involved. </p>

<p>several deaths connected to this story including Julia’s father, her neighbor who filmed the footage of the Blackhawk and the actress Brittany Murphy as well as her husband. </p>

<p>Julia and BJ talk about the diminishing of our American rights amongst &quot;terror theatre 101.&quot; Don’t miss this astonishing story of the real terror, within the US government. Nd she now beleives the security breath on 4th of July, 2004 was  by design for a proposed FALSE FLAG TERROR EVENT run by the NSA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good question, RME, but not one without plausible explanations.  </p>

<p>I can only speculate how I would react in a similar situation but, assuming they need to keep me alive for whatever reason, I can imagine that threats and violence against my family would give &quot;them&quot; much leverage against me - more than if &quot;they&quot; simply threaten me...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling a border patrol officer a &quot;National Security Expert&quot; is a bit of a stretch isn&#39;t it? So is calling her a whistle-blower to be honest.</p>

<p>She reported an unusual amount of &quot;people of interest&quot; crossing her border point, but since it was July 4th the actual &quot;National Security Experts&quot; were on leave she followed protocol and reported it to the FBI anti-terror unit.</p>

<p>Later she was harassed by &#39;Murica, but won a lawsuit against them.</p>

<p>I fail to see how anything of it is related to the deaths, other than people trying to make an interesting story out of something novel. But I guess it pays to have an interesting back story when you&#39;re an aspiring Hollywood actress. :p</p>
