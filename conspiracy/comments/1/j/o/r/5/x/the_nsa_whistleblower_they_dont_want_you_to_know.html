       Julia Davis, a national security whistleblower  discovered and reported a breach of national security at the largest and busiest land border crossing in the U.S. on 4th of July, 2004.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DHS failed to act on her reports but instead of correcting the shortcomings exposed by Julia’s report, they opened investigations against her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her husband BJ, a film producer who documented these events , never reported on by mainstream media, although Julia took her case to court and won.
      </p>
      <p>
       They detail unprecedented retaliation and abuses of the Patriot Act in Julia’s case and talk about how the DHS spent American taxpayer’s money on warrantless surveillance, including aerial surveillance with a Blackhawk helicopter and a fixed-wing airplane, wiretaps, sneak and peek burglaries, Internet monitoring and On-Star tracking of the Davis family.
      </p>
      <p>
       They explain why this story was never reported on by mainstream media and who was involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       several deaths connected to this story including Julia’s father, her neighbor who filmed the footage of the Blackhawk and the actress Brittany Murphy as well as her husband.
      </p>
      <p>
       Julia and BJ talk about the diminishing of our American rights amongst "terror theatre 101." Don’t miss this astonishing story of the real terror, within the US government. Nd she now beleives the security breath on 4th of July, 2004 was  by design for a proposed FALSE FLAG TERROR EVENT run by the NSA

       Ok. In all seriousness, why would someone go to all the trouble of disposing of so may people around this Julia person, including a global superstar, and not simply take out the root cause of their trouble? This is absurd logic.

       They only make martyrs out of people as a last resort. Killing people that are only tangentially related allows them to utilize the power of doubt and conspiracy.

       Perhaps as a warning, just to scare everyone else in those circles to not make the choice she did. They could tear her down, or atleast try to, just to make sure fewer people act out.

       It's a good question, RME, but not one without plausible explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only speculate how I would react in a similar situation but, assuming they need to keep me alive for whatever reason, I can imagine that threats and violence against my family would give "them" much leverage against me - more than if "they" simply threaten me...

       Calling a border patrol officer a "National Security Expert" is a bit of a stretch isn't it? So is calling her a whistle-blower to be honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       She reported an unusual amount of "people of interest" crossing her border point, but since it was July 4th the actual "National Security Experts" were on leave she followed protocol and reported it to the FBI anti-terror unit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later she was harassed by 'Murica, but won a lawsuit against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fail to see how anything of it is related to the deaths, other than people trying to make an interesting story out of something novel. But I guess it pays to have an interesting back story when you're an aspiring Hollywood actress. :p
