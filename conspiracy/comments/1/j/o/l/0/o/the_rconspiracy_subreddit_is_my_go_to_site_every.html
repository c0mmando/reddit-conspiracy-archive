There&#39;s lots of excellent discussion here, lots of good links with great follow up.  I appreciate the efforts a few of the members go to produce accurate resources and quality references.</p>

<p>And I post every day here.  It&#39;s my #1 place on the internet for sharing news items that people are not willing to discuss publicly.</p>

<p>But something seems to be off here.  I&#39;ve posted several articles that have disappeared within seconds of my posting them.  I&#39;ve made comments that I can no longer find.</p>

<p>Is anybody else having these issues with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p>Something big &amp; ugly made an massive explosion and it came from outside of Syria and these innocent people deserve an explanation but you go right ahead and get loaded some more!</p>

<p>At the very least, three young men died in Benghazzi defending a man and an administration that were covertly (cough, cough) running drugs and guns...</p>

<p>When Oliver North testified he declared he performed all duties &quot;under orders&quot; or some such verbal-garbage.</p>

<p>Manning &amp; Snowden are still alive and fighting. Hastings got dead fast as did some Blackhat Hacker with tricks up... and then this General is allowed to lie straight up, with one little &#39;poof&#39; of protest and here it was &#39;hailed&#39; on reddit as an TKO!

    <div class="md"><p>I like reddit because for the most part people here are rational.  There are a lot of conspiracy websites, but I&#39;ve found they are peppered with irrational people - a lot of christians and people who believe in the rapture, for example - see religious signs and prophesies everywhere.</p>

<p>/pol/ on 4chan has some interesting discussions, but there&#39;s a huge amount of racism, bigotry, misogyny and antisemitism there.  Of course you have to be thick skinned and skilled at reading between the lines, but there&#39;s none of that nonsense here on reddit.</p>

<p><a href="http://godlikeproductions.org">http://godlikeproductions.org</a> has a lot of interesting conspiracy discussions, but also a lot of nonsense and they will ban your IP if they don&#39;t like you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most religion is not based on anything that can be proven, yet people believe it even in the presence of information that directly proves it wrong.  Religion has people brainwashed so badly, that they <em>believe</em> things that can instantly and easily be proven to be completely and totally wrong.  People actually <em>believe</em> the bullshit they are told as children, and <em>believe</em> that they are right just because that has been the norm for them all their lives.  To me, that is a big fucking joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you only harp on religion of man made confines then none will ever see the beauty of simple spirit.</p>

<p>Let go of the circle-jerk you self proclaimed. It ends with you.</p>

<p>Life is spirit, energy, survival, pro-creation, death and none of us will escape it unscathed. </p>

<p>Children soldiers in the streets of Syria chopping off the heads of Christians; child sex slaves sold to the highest bidders of the elite Politicians &amp; Globalists of all faiths; young boys raped simply due to a wrinkle in some obscure text that preserves females for child bearing. Abject poverty when the ground is fertile. Trillions of dollars to fund war through drug &amp; gun smuggling!!!! </p>

<p>It&#39;s never ending, the lengths depraved people are willing to kill spirit and energy! Never ending!  </p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of an young child that was hailed in the papers for surviving an harrowing ordeal of near death because she would be educated; her spirit and millions of spirits, male &amp; female thrive not from religion of man but by energy of spiritual determination. </p>

<p>If the boot is on your throat and the spear has pierced your chest then I&#39;ll give you farewell. If you have just a voice left then use it, by any means possible. If you have feet and hands, get busy!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t allow your spirit or energy to be sucked dry! </p>

<p>Sleep well!</p>

<p>Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Not to get involved or take sides, just because he said bullshit doesn&#39;t mean anything.</p>

<p>It is given the context and manner that he delivered it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if some says bullshit referring to a pile of actual bull shit, or call a female dog a bitch, that&#39;s <strong>not</strong> in way near as bad as calling a person stupid or ugly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you mean to have the word &quot;not&quot; in there but didn&#39;t put it in?  If you did, then firstly, I&#39;d say that he didn&#39;t in any way mean bullshit in the literal sense (i.e. referring to bovine excrement).  He meant it in the derogatory cursing sense.  That carries much more negative energy and the issue I took with it as such very much still stands as a result.  Again, it&#39;s about the meaning applied to the word, and that word carries a enough negative meaning for what I said to be valid.</p>

<p>If you DIDN&#39;T mean to put the word &quot;no&quot; in, and you&#39;re saying that using the word bitch is just as bad as calling someone stupid or ugly, then I wouldn&#39;t necessarily disagree with that.  Calling someone stupid or ugly is pretty bad too, of course.  This doesn&#39;t contradict the fact that using the word bullshit still goes against what he&#39;s supposed to represent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet, because someone said a naughty word you question his faith or piety or whatever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  I did so because their very first reaction was one of immediate and unsolicited vehemence and negativity.  That&#39;s a very different thing altogether than the manner in which you&#39;re describing it here.  To begin from such a negative stance when you&#39;re supposed to be a representative of someone who&#39;s supposed to advocate peace and the OPPOSITE of what you came in with shows that you are a pretty bad representative of that group.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure that the MPAA or FCC or whoever determines what words are bad, has alternate goals than his religion (whether it&#39;s real or made up).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, but we&#39;re not going by the MPAA or FCC.  We&#39;re going by the tenets of his religion, and regardless of what any other group says, I&#39;m sure his religion DOESN&#39;T advocate one comporting themselves in the immediately negative manner that he did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think we&#39;ve been in a slump lately but not because of evil mods.  I think its two things:</p>

<p>1) Fatigue?  Overload?  The last few months have been crazy, a lot that we&#39;ve known has become validated and therefore banal. It&#39;s all mainstream now, so we don&#39;t care.  It&#39;s either repeating the same facts now or putting up quotes that tangentially sort of rally the troops.  The only radical thing left to say is about what we should do about it, because whether or not there is a problem isn&#39;t up for debate anymore.   </p>

<p>2) Self censorship.  I can&#39;t say much more about this because they&#39;re watching me.</p>

<p>Since you are in the business of changing the way people think (as shown by your desire to &quot;break&quot; my &quot;chains&quot;), I&#39;ll just give you this advice:  A person can only change themselves.  You can not do a fucking thing about what someone else chooses for themselves.  You can plant the seeds, but you can&#39;t make them grow.  Plant healthy seeds if you want healthy results.</p>

0001- Online Persona Management Service. 50 User Licenses, 10 Personas
per user.
Software will allow 10 personas per user, replete with background , history,
supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and
geographacilly consistent. Individual applications will enable an operator to
exercise a number of different online persons from the same workstation and
without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries. Personas must
be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world and can interact
through conventional online services and social media platforms. The service
includes a user friendly application environment to maximize the user&#39;s
situational awareness by displaying real-time local information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...Riiight. But when the topic he posts gets posted multiple times in this subreddit and his is the one that gets caught in the filter? It&#39;s not a conspiracy or intentional.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you see in most subreddits about messaging the mods if your post doesn&#39;t show because it most likely ended up in the spam filter.</p>
