       If you're starting to think deep and question exsistance, never start with 'Has anyone considered...' Because, odds are, many have. For example, you quoted a song by The Beatles...they probably had a similar epiphany. If you're interested in the relation between an infinate, cyclic universe and evolution of human and animal biology, you should read The Endless Universe. It's a beautiful book. Also, The Doors of Perception is amazing and a quick read.

       Until you think of something like cancer.  I mentioned this in a different comment, but if you came down with something like brain cancer, because you cannot avoid that reality, it would be impossible for you to make a different reality.

       It's an interesting idea. Maybe you need to elaborate more but as far as I know I cannot make my own reality. I can't just say I'm king of the world and become king of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can work hard to try to be successful, but there is no guarantee that that will work. No matter how hard I try I may encounter obstacles that just don't allow me to be as successful as someone else.  Take cancer as an example. You could be super successful and then come down with brain cancer and die or have all of your wealth taken away to pay for your treatment.  You can't avoid that reality and therefore cannot make a different one.

       Imagine my scenario from a person who believes they create their own reality...  They 100% they believe they create their own reality and yet they still get cancer and die.  If that happens just once, the whole "you create your own reality" theory gets blown out of the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe they get hit by a bus.  Who knows?  But looking at how popular that belief is, I would say something like this has already happened several if not thousands or millions of times...

       I'll start by saying 1. you pose very valid points, given our current theories and understanding of how existence works, and 2. I'm more of a very intrigued, cautiously skeptic observer of this theory than a die-hard proponent of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm fascinated by the ideas brought forth by the double-slit experiment, that indicate that the "observer" can somehow influence the outcome, which has brought forth the theory that the mere act of observation can change the pattern of particles. Taking that out of the quantum world and into the tactile, physical experience, the experiments done by Masaru Emoto and others regarding consciousness' effects on water crystals are fascinating (though, to be fair, at the moment this is still considered to be "pseudo-science"). What it all seems to be suggesting is that our consciousness, intention, and observation of the world around us may, to some degree, have an impact on our physical "reality". Also, when you understand the qualia phenomenon (our inability to fully explain our subjective reality to others), it's apparent that my subjective reality may be completely different from yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       To discuss your point a bit further, if someone has a 100% belief in this concept and their intention is to not die of cancer, they will most likely take every precaution (diet, exercise, healthy habits) in order to avoid it. They will create their reality by doing all they can to avoid cancer. But what about genetics? Aren't some people born with a genetic predisposition to cancer? I'd encourage you to look into Dr. Bruce Lipton's research into epigenetics. In short, he's a stem cell biologist who has posed that it is actually our environment that controls our genes and not the other way around, like we have believed. So though our initial genetic makeup could be more susceptible to cancers, we can actually control our genes, thus we can control that reality. Sure, this theory is a new look at genetics, and needs to undergo much more testing, but it wasn't so long ago that we believed the earth travelled around the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the random bus accident scenario brings up the dark-side of this belief. In essence, the popular belief amongst those who study this is that this accident was still created by you. Subconsciously. Maybe you had a fear of getting hit by a bus and it came to light. Perhaps a carnival fortune-teller told you that you'd die in a car accident and that stuck with you (this actually happened to me. I've placed it in the "time will tell" category, for now. If it happens, I'll see if I can get someone to let you know). Maybe you saw a horrific bus accident when you were a child and carried the "that could happen to me" in your subconscious all these years, etc., etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gigantic problem with the "create your own reality theory vs. death" argument is that in order to test it, we would need to have a group of children placed in individual, controlled environments (think The Truman Show) for their entire lives, let them fully believe that they are immortal, but introduce risk factors for death, and study them forever. If they ever die, well... theory debunked, obviously. I think we'd agree that this proposed, theoretical experiment is a bit on the unrealistic side.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr there is no concrete, scientific proof that we actually create our own reality, but there are some experiments and new views of science that could lead us to the discovery that this might actually be true. I'll continue watching... but by observing, am I creating the outcome?

       But once you going to the subconscious creation of that scenario it's basically the same argument used to support prayer...
      </p>
      <p>
       If your prayer comes true, then you assume you're correct. If your prayer doesn't come true then you don't have enough faith but you're still correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's essentially the same idea, and it isn't testable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The double slit experiment doesn't show that the observer changes the outcome, It shows that the act of observation changes the outcome itself.  The observer doesn't have a role in what happens just because they are observing.

       Except that we do know the subconscious affects our actions, much like our intentions do, and our subconscious intentions have been proven to be just as strong (if not sometimes more so) as our conscious intentions. And, if you really boil it down to nuts and bolts, isn't "prayer" just focused intention with the extra step of a deity added into the thought process? The difference lies in the acceptance of the outcome. In prayer, not getting the desired outcome indicates your "faith wasn't strong enough" or "it wasn't god's plan". With intention, it flat out means it didn't work. There are plenty of scientific studies being conducted regarding the effectiveness of focused intention, using control groups, blind/unbiased result gathering, and otherwise falling completely in line with legitimate scientific standards. The one I can remember off the top of my head involved a group of people focusing their intention on a body of water several miles away with the intention of raising the pH level of the water, and the results showed that it did have a recordable effect. Yes, the subject of intention has been a scientific taboo, but it doesn't mean we can't legitimately test it, or that we shouldn't be open and unbiased to the idea. As with all new scientific studies, a healthy skepticism needs to be present, but every universally accepted scientific theory we hold true today faced skepticism at it's inception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your correction about the double slit experiment is 100% correct. I'll reiterate that I am not an expert on all of this, but I should've caught the error myself. My bad. Yes, it is the observation that changes the result, but the observer in that experiment does not actually predict the result. I'm curious as to what might happen if we mixed the double slit with a focused intention experiment. I'm not sure if that has ever happened?

       I'm not really anticipating any proof that we can think real hard about a monkey in our room and POOF there's a monkey, but more so that our subconscious intentions may have some form of 'butterfly-effect' within physical reality. On a low-level, cause and effect scale we already know this to be true. Our subconscious thinking affects our every action, and our every action creates a chain of events that would not have happened otherwise, thus changing the universe and creating reality. This chain of events can sometimes circle back to us, causing us to face the repercussions of our initial subconscious thoughts. Often, we're not even aware of the cause and effect. In that light, it's not such a far-fetched idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all a fascinating subject and I hope that it can see the light of much more scrutinizing, scientific study. Thanks for the discussion!

       But once you going to the subconscious creation of that scenario it's basically the same argument used to support prayer...
      </p>
      <p>
       If your prayer comes true, then you assume you're correct. If your prayer doesn't come true then you don't have enough faith but you're still correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's essentially the same idea, and it isn't testable.

       The double slit experiment doesn't show that the observer changes the outcome, It shows that the act of observation changes the outcome itself.  The observer doesn't have a role in what happens just because they are observing.
