       Just a question my co-worker brought up and seemed pretty interesting. I was curious on everyone's thoughts.  Does this generation of youth, with access to such realistic video games on killing, going to play a part in the future of these children's way of thinking on killing another human?  Will they just view war, as a soldier, as just another video game to cope with their reality?

       I see my little brothers playing some COD or Battlefield and it's just so real now (at least some parts are, it's still very much a video game).  The games I played as a child (I'm currently 24) may have been violent, but it was blocky, laggy, violence. It's going to become so insanely realistic, that soon enough there's going to be a small difference between reality and virtual reality.

       Alternative Perspective:
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always thought video games, horror/revolution movies, etc. are a way for humans to vent certain thoughts and feelings in a safe environment.  It's about releasing certain feelings and having a sense of satisfaction after the hero wins which nullifies those aggressive feelings.  Then, the person doesn't feel compelled to do those things in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the "fake" Korean "propaganda" movie called it, a revolution anywhere but on the streets.

       I do agree with this and it's one of the points I brought up as well when discussing it with my co-worker.  I do hope that this will be the true reality but as the world has simply taught me:  Hope for the best, Expect the worst.

       To me yes and no, mankind as a whole was already well versed in killing each other long before video games. But does video games help I wouldn't see why not. But at the same time man may be "civilized" but at the end of the day we are still animals with those basic instincts of fight or flight. Just my opinion. My grandpa used to say mankind has a penchant for killing and war, its something we are very good at is killing each other.

       Well said, and very true. I do think we have progressed as a society with the introduction of mass use of technology to the public, but with that progression, I feel like society has kind of reversed in a way. People are less reliant on their brains and more reliant on their gadgets to think for them and with the youth, it's just so much worse.

       There's definitely a big indoctrination element ("Call Of Duty" ). I spent an obscene amount of time playing Modern Warfare 2 (~13 days total playtime over about a year) - it was fun and I played it competitively with co-workers to unwind.
      </p>
      <p>
       It started to bother me how the Western spec ops team and "OpFor" were always perfectly even in terms of weaponry, including UAVs and other air support. This is done for competitive balance, of course, but the way these weapons are
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       deployed makes "war" a one-sided shooting gallery. Death from above.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people generally join the military in part for honorable reasons... However, the reality is indiscriminate slaughter, creating a vicious cycle where more take up arms against 'Murica. I think this generation will be somewhat amenable to a draft, if/when it's put in place.

       Not long ago whole families and communities would join in their best clothes in central squares to watch prisoners would being slowly and paifully killed to the roars and cheers of the crowds. Violence and sudden death were commonplace, so was disregard to public safety and human rights. Read
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature">
        The Better Angels of Our Nature
       </a>
      </p>

       So while the entertainment indutry (movies, television and video games) introduces violence to many who, luckily, will never encounter. Most important in warfare and public opinion is de-humanization of your enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately a more humble and peaceful population is much easier manipulated, specially since the masses today are overwhelmed with free-time, and as such more prone to revolutions, unless manipulated otherwise (propaganda, enemy threat, pleasure, drugs).

       No. I think they are training us to be robotic soldiers. Much more plausible. Why spend money to make these people sit around all day and play video games and not always have it on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drone pilots all use screens thousands of miles a way. Why can't we control drone humans? This is really fucked up to think about this. The word drone conjures up nothing but being killed in a video game.

       That is a good point, but I'm more focused on the younger generation currently growing up, not the one in active duty.  It's more of a question of what's to come rather than what is happening now.

       Yes, but video games then were merely blocks and cheap sound bits, and I understand that then it was realistic to them. But You can't deny that games now and in the future feel very real. I mean, isn't that kind of one of the points of video games? I believe It just may mold a bit of the youth's perspective on killing another human being.

       Indeed it does, and that article is great and all but it only reflects of what's happening today.  I'm speaking in a future tense.  I believe there has been a tipping point in how realistic graphics are now.  With the ushering of the next generation of gaming consoles it's only becoming more and more real. Only the future's data can put this theory to rest, otherwise the possibility and probability of less remorseful generation is, in my view, very high.  I do believe that we will be able to keep crime to a minimum and I'm not saying that there WILL be a violent generation, but to completely dismiss that this won't be a problem is just naivety.

       YES.  That is a very valid point which emphasizes the small barrier of reality from game in that setting.  I'm sure there are plenty of exceptions everywhere but if it took that pilot that many kills in order to feel bad, I can imagine how a desensitized future soldier fighting with his joystick would take much more.

       Oh that's a simple one.  You see, the video game craze indoctrinates human beings into becoming completely desensitized to war and violence.  Matter of fact, they glamorize it, so it becomes pretty easy to recruit a lot of young, indoctrinated kids to do the evil bidding of TPTB.  They go to war, kill, and perpetuate all kinds of horrible crimes.  They go into war ready and willing because, again, they were entirely desensitized to it by the many years and years of video games they were brainwashed with growing up.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, once they're actually IN the actual real life war situation and having to kill and rape and behead men, women, and children, then they realize that things are a LOT different in real life than in the many video games they played.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point, however, it's really too late.  They've already done it.  They've already perpetuated the crimes - done the acts.  They went into war ready to maim and kill because they did it so many hundreds of thousands of times for so many years in all the many violent video games they played, but when they actually got into the reality of the actual situation and really started murdering many people, they realize that the shit is a LOT more real and a LOT more terrible and scary than any video game they could have EVER imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, again, it's really too late by then.  By then, they've already done and gone through with all the killing and maiming and torturing.  At this point, they've finally realize how different real life is than the video game, and they absolutely freak out and have an absolute break down because after having gone through with the ACTUAL
       <em>
        ACTS
       </em>
       of murder, etc, they realize it's so, so different and the reality of that huge difference and what they have now become (a murdering, raping demon) really comes bowling them over in the most traumatic, horrific way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, as a result of their coming face to face with this horrible reality, a lot of these kids end up killing themselves.  They would have never done any of these acts had they not initially been so desensitized and indoctrinated by all the horrible video games they played growing up.  They didn't realize how much of a monster the video games turned them into until only AFTER they were done with the actual killing of the many people in the real scenarios the shitty military put them in.  They would have never otherwise done those things, and many come to realize what they ended up being turned into...and it simply (and understandably) freaks them the fuck out to no end.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they kill themselves because it's simply too much to handle and bear.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah.  There you go.  I just explained to you why it is that suicides are at an all time high not in spite, but BECAUSE of the war video games that are also at an all time high:  It's, again, because the video games desensitize you into THINKING that the actual act of war and killing is okay/will be okay (because, after all, it's okay in all the video games you played where you can kill entire armies and then just hit "restart" when things don't go the way you like), so they jump into the actual REAL thing in the military thinking that it will be similar...that they can hit "restart" whenever they want, when things don't go their way...but they can't.  Things
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       turn out okay or like that.  Not by a LONG shot.  But by the time they come face to face with this, it's already too late and they've already
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       killed whole villages of women and children and soldiers, etc...and they realize (too late) just how real the actual act is, and just how different it is from the video games that indoctrinated them into thinking it
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be okay and they
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be heroes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they come home and not only are they traumatized and an absolute, irredeemable wreck, but their own country and their own people - the people that they were told they were fighting for and going to war to protect - now hate them and abandon them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah...I can't say with 100% certainty that I wouldn't kill myself either under these circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucked up, shitty life/planet/world we live in.  Too many of us falling victim to the evil brain washing we're constantly bombarded with...

       I do not feel humanity would be able to survive as a species if remorse were somehow bred out out of it.  Remorse is nothing but another aspect related to empathy and kindness.  Take that away from a species and it would simply kill itself off entirely and not survive long enough to even develop much into a society.

       Not at all.  I'm speaking solely in an objective point of view.  I have loads of fun playing video games, particularly violent ones!  I just feel that on a subconscious level, this new generation growing up might have slightly less resistance to killing another human being than the older generation.
