<p>Nice try. legally speaking manning and snowden are whistleblowers. The only law they broke was releasing data; however the data they released was to show the government was breaking not only domestic laws but international laws. They were well within their oaths to uphold the Constitution.</p>

<p>That remains for the courts to decide, doesn&#39;t it? I mean, I <em>personally</em> agree that they are merely whistle blowers and should be protected, not convicted, but that&#39;s beside the point. If &quot;a trial by a jury of their peers&quot; judge them to be traitors, either you have to stand by your comment and agree that they should be &quot;drug outside and shot&quot;, or you admit it&#39;s all hypocrisy, and in fact you just want to kill whomever you don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really not. You said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rather than coddling their treason, as soon as the verdict is passed, theyre drug outside and shot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If &quot;a trial by a jury of their peers&quot; judge them to be traitors, either you have to stand by your comment and agree that they should be &quot;drug outside and shot&quot; [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are all straight quotes. You&#39;re saying that <strong>if</strong> someone is convicted by a jury of their peers to be a traitor, you would rather shoot them than &quot;coddle their treason&quot;. Thus, if Manning and Snowden <em>are</em>, in fact, convicted for treason by a jury of their peers, you would have them &quot;drug outside and shot&quot;. That is what you&#39;re saying, black on white.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How you came to the conclusion that i think we should just round people up and start pulling triggers is beyond me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I come to this conclusions because you seem very eager to shoot anyone convicted of treason that you also don&#39;t happen to like or support, but when it&#39;s someone you <em>do</em> like or support, you&#39;re squirming and weaseling out of your own call to shoot them as soon as they&#39;re sentenced.</p>

<p>You <em>have</em>, effectively, stated that you support shooting Snowden and Manning instead of &quot;coddling&quot; them, as soon as they have been tried and convicted for treason by a jury of their peers. There&#39;s no disputing that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>the sentence for treason, throughout history is either:<br/>
 A) exile<br/>
 B) life in prison<br/>
 C) death   </p>

<p>Exile isnt in play very often these days, which leaves life in prison (receiving 3 square meals a day, entertainment in their cells etc) and death. After a revolution &quot;life in prison&quot; is hardly ever an option, historically speaking. This leaves us with death; rather than &quot;coddeling&quot; them by keeping them detained for several months or years as they &quot;wait&quot; for the execution (as per our current system is) thy are given their sentence right then and there.</p>

<p>AHAHAHAA. Theres plenty of disputing. Manning turned down a jury trial and Snowden is in Russia and hasnt been tried.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t. You did not understand the argument. Read what I said again, slowly.</p>

<p>Just in case, here it is again:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You say about traitors: &quot;Rather than coddling their treason, as soon as the verdict is passed, theyre drug outside and shot.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>You base their status as traitors on whether or not they&#39;ve been convicted as such by a jury of their peers.</p></li>
<li><p>Both Snowden and Manning could, potentially, be convicted as traitors by a jury of their peers.</p></li>
<li><p>If that happens, your own words as quoted in #1 would apply to Snowden and Manning as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, if Snowden and Manning <em>are</em> convicted as traitors by a jury of their peers, you then argue that they should not be &quot;coddled&quot; and you advocate that they be &quot;drug outside and shot&quot;.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have not put a single word in your mouth. I have, instead, quoted you word for word, and applied <em>your own logic</em> to a different set of people than the ones you were originally referring to. You now either accept that your words apply to these other people as well, or keep pretending that you&#39;re too stupid to understand what you yourself said and expose yourself as a hypocrite.</p>

<p>Your choice.</p>

<p>You seem to be forgetting the basis of this is under the premise of there already being a revolution that succeeded. Youre the one who doesnt seem to understand what youe saying. </p>

<ol>
<li>yes.</li>
<li>in this hypothetical situation, the &quot;corrupt&quot; politicians have already been rounded up and are being tried. Senator John Doe who accepted X million dollars to write and vote for legislation in favor of a particular group at the expense of liberties of the people. is an example of this hypothetical scenario outlined by the OP.</li>
</ol>

<p>YES. everyone knows Senator Doe is guilty, we fought a war against him and his ilk. The sides have already been drawn in the sand. there is no confusion or uncertainty </p>

<ol>
<li>They COULD but thats not what you said, you insinuated they would. Were talking about a scenario of a post-revolution America, <em>not</em> present day. This is a strawman you can seem to let go of.<br/></li>
<li>as i said in 3, no it wouldnt apply.<br/></li>

<p>Hating Jews for their actions is not antisemitism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Antisemitism (also spelled anti-semitism or anti-Semitism) is prejudice, hatred of, or discrimination against Jews for reasons connected to their Jewish heritage. A person who holds such positions is called an &quot;antisemite&quot;. It is considered by most scientists to be a form of racism.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus, hating Jews for &quot;their actions&quot; is blatantly racist, and thus anti-semitic.</p>

<p>Do you hate white people for &quot;their actions&quot; as well?</p>

<p>If I had a dollar for every time someone claimed I got paid, I <em>would</em> be getting paid. As it stands, all I have is my dayjob, and all you have are pisspoor excuses because your arguments don&#39;t hold up. Instead you pretend you&#39;ve &quot;outed&quot; me as the paid shill you apparently think I am.</p>

<p>Your evidence? That I disagree with you. Fantastic stuff.</p>

<p>Do you know where I could get paid? Because I&#39;ve been asking around, and as much as you people seem to know about shills and shilling practices, no one has been able to point me anywhere I need to go to actually sign up. It&#39;s almost...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>95% of the violent crime can be attributed to environmental circumstances.  If you change the environmental conditions, you change behavior, but what about the few individuals that are suffering from severe mental issues, aided by a genetic predisposition?  Look at them from a case study viewpoint, a sick patient.  Identifying the root cause of the issue is the first step, whether it be environmental influence or a genetic predisposition, for example: being genetically predisposed to be non-empathetic.  We better make sure any one diagnosed with such a genetic flaw, be analyzed, treated and cared for scientifically, minimizing the chances of such brain activity to flourish.  Killing abhorrent individuals is an unprogressive and inefficient way to deal with the situation, for killing or jailing people doesn&#39;t change the actual cause of the problem.  </p>

<p>Help people become aware of the world around them at a fundamental level, strengthening the emergent symbiotic relationship between humans, nature and the universe. So decisions pertaining to society can be arrived at objectively with the best scientific information to date and with the priority of human well-being at the forefront; and if the best scientific decision isn&#39;t good enough, then we better get in the lab.</p>

<p>But I guess jail will have to do for the next decade or so.</p>
