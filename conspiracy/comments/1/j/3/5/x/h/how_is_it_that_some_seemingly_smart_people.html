<p>People can be smart as hell, but believe whatever they&#39;re told because they don&#39;t have the intelligence to think for themselves. One can be highly educated, but if they don&#39;t know how to put that education to good use then its pretty useless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paradoxically, though, I&#39;ve found that the people who think they&#39;re the smartest, most fantastical rockstar critical thinkers tend to be the ones who don&#39;t think critically at all, but repeat what they&#39;re told and call it &quot;logic,&quot; because they&#39;re told it is logic.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest stumbling block for those with open minds is to get caught up with one of these people and begin to doubt your own competency (one of the pitfalls of having an open mind).</p>

<p>Critical thinking also means being able to work with the subtlety that is pervasive through life. The current definition of &quot;critical thinking,&quot; however, seems to be &quot;take what&#39;s obvious and state it as loudly as possible and as the only truth there is.&quot; By nature, if you discount the subtle, you&#39;ll never see the whole picture.</p>

<p>The majority of Reddit is a terrible place for critical thinking and open mindedness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The panic in the eyes of someone questioning a &quot;fringe theory&quot;, after it&#39;s initial thesis has been presented, is one of the most telling human reactions.  It&#39;s fear, at its core.  Fear of the possibility that the foundation they&#39;ve built their comfortable lives upon is not nearly as stable as once thought.  Fear of more work.  Fear of deviation from the well-established neural pathways for habitual thought.  Fear of looking like a fool.</p>

<p>Culturally, we&#39;ve replaced spiritual and mental growth with a complete reliance on external factors.  We live in a time where everyone is <em>conditionally</em> well-balanced.  Remove the underlying, optimal conditions and you&#39;ve got some very frightened and defensive apes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;mainstream media&quot; is a useful first-pass filter for bullshit.  They have educated people, on location, who actually talk to officials and scientists and victims and others who have first-hand knowledge.  They have a reputation to preserve, which gives them an incentive to be accurate.  Some random blogger or small site can make some wild claim and not suffer much if it turns out to be false; a big outfit has more to lose (reputation, audience, advertisers, money in a lawsuit, etc).</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean the MM is infallible, or the only source to read, or that &quot;big&quot; means &quot;good&quot;, or that they should control your &quot;beliefs&quot;.  Some of them (such as Fox) have a clear agenda, some (CNN) have a poor record recently.  But as a first pass at the truth, they&#39;re useful.  They have a FAR better record of being accurate than many other venues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it that some seemingly smart people believe almost anything that&#39;s &quot;validated&quot; by blogs, forums, etc?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t particularly care who I hear something from, or where. I care if it makes sense. Conspiracies rarely do, in my opinion. They depend on tiny strings of barely-connected threads of evidence through a chasm of ignorance and confusion, with a single far-fetched explanation somehow being much more likely than a dozen common ones.</p>

<p>Besides, what&#39;s with this circlejerk topic? &quot;We&#39;re so much smarter because we don&#39;t believe the MSM lies&quot;? Is that really constructive? Does that really make more people believe what <em>you</em> say? Does it even make anyone want to listen to you?</p>

<p>If you were to present professional, coherent theories backed up by solid facts and clear evidence, people would have no problem trusting you over the media, but you don&#39;t. You have blogs with neon-green text on starry backgrounds, you have videos that are hours and hours long, without ever getting to the point, and you accuse everything of being &quot;false-flag&quot;, and anyone of questioning you of being &quot;shills&quot;.</p>

<p>I like to think of myself as at least a &quot;seemingly&quot; smart person, yet whenever I point out obvious inconsistencies or failures in a line of reasoning, I get attacked and lambasted, as if what I was questioning can&#39;t stand up to scrutiny, and I must be driven away by force to protect that belief. Why is that? Why is it that seemingly smart people can&#39;t handle questioning and disbelief without getting confrontational and aggressive?</p>

<p>Stop worrying about those who don&#39;t believe you, and start looking at those who do. They&#39;re a much bigger problem, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Apparently not, since we believe <em>any</em> new information as long as it comes over the TV. That was the point of this submission, wasn&#39;t it? And what TV does so well is presenting professional, coherent messages (although I agree they are not always backed up by facts and evidence), which is <em>why</em> people listen.</p>

<p>If you were to present professional, coherent theories backed up by solid facts and clear evidence, people would have no problem trusting you over the media, but you don&#39;t. You have blogs with neon-green text on starry backgrounds, you have videos that are hours and hours long, without ever getting to the point, and you accuse everything of being &quot;false-flag&quot;, and anyone of questioning you of being &quot;shills&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I agree with the over-the-top accusations, how would one ever be able to present clear facts when clear facts would be hidden from plain sight on purpose? Isn&#39;t that the point of theory? To take what you see and evolve a series of events on it?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Defensive much? It was a rather basic question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a very <em>loaded</em> question, and my reply reflected that, I think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how would one ever be able to present clear facts when clear facts would be hidden from plain sight on purpose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is it that an <em>absence</em> of clear facts still so often lead to &quot;<em>clear</em>&quot; conclusions on what happened, then? I can&#39;t think of many people here who show any signs of being in any way <em>unsure</em> about what&#39;s happening, rather the opposite. The less actual evidence exists, the more evidence <em>that</em> is that&#39;s it&#39;s a conspiracy, and it&#39;s being covered up. The main line of reasoning around here is way too often &quot;absence of evidence is evidence of conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Isn&#39;t that the point of theory? To take what you see and evolve a series of events on it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s a hypothesis. Generally, a theory is something built on top of <em>solid</em> evidence, and something you attempt to <em>disprove</em>. How many people here ever attempt to <em>disprove</em> their own theories?</p>

<p>Conspiracy &quot;theory&quot; has always meant &quot;theory&quot; in the colloquial sense, but for some reason very few people know that. Scientifically speaking, there&#39;s absolutely nothing scientific about the method by which people &quot;prove&quot; their &quot;theories&quot; here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might want to take a look in a mirror sometime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likewise. Which was basically my point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God forbid anyone think outside what&#39;s considered rational by the masses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above. Things are considered &quot;rational&quot; for good reason, and <em>looking</em> for evidence of conspiracies everywhere while disregarding evidence that disputes it is <em>not</em> being open-minded or &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;. In fact, it&#39;s the opposite. People here often <em>only</em> accept opinions that are clearly <em>inside</em> the box, in that if you criticize or question any conspiracy, prepare to be accused of bad things and downvoted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know that false-flags have happened, we know that the US gov has shady dealings and financial ties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And why do we know that? Because when it actually happens, there is evidence to prove it, evidence that stands the test of time and public scrutiny. Claiming Sandy Hook was a &quot;false flag&quot; operation and that everyone at the Boston Marathon were &quot;crisis actors&quot; does not stand even the test of reason, nor does it hold up to any kind of scrutiny whatsoever.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t dispute that <em>conspiracies</em> exist, neither in the dictionary-sense of the word of the more sinister, practical use. But there&#39;s a difference between real, provable conspiracies, and &quot;theories&quot; that are, in actual fact, nothing but ramblings based on numerology or overzealous analysis of compressed JPEGs.</p>

<p>For example, I have little doubt that there was some kind of <em>conspiracy</em> (in the dictionary sense of the word) to misrepresent evidence and reports in order to have an excuse to invade Iraq. But I sincerely doubt there was any conspiracy (in the sinister sense) to create an impossibly elaborate catastrophe in NYC in 2001 that brought down the entire World Trade Center district. One is based on reason and evidence that holds up to public scrutiny, one is based on magic, paranoia and mad ramblings.</p>

<p>Absolutely not. That&#39;s not what I said in the slightest. However, people who <em>want</em> to believe their government lies to them, who <em>refuse</em> to think outside the box of conspiracy theories, and who <em>reject</em> any questioning of any theory they&#39;ve decided is true, no matter what, they are clearly not out for any kind of honest search for truth.</p>

<p>I think the NSA spying is unequivocally wrong, and is <em>clearly</em> a conspiracy to skirt the rights and freedoms of people as much as possible. Does that mean I think I&#39;m a wacko?</p>

<p>Those who don&#39;t think Illuminati controls the world. Or FEMA controls the USA. Or Freemasons and Skull &amp; Bones control every world leader. Or Monsanto is allowed to poison everyone. Or we&#39;re all under CIA mind control.</p>

<p>Look, there&#39;s no shortage of out-there conspiracy theories with little-to-no factual basis, or even internal consistency. I know you all believe in different things, but the common denominator is that you <em>all</em> believe in something with very little evidence for it, go to great lengths to reject or deny any evidence against those theories, and become <em>incredibly</em> defensive, to the point of being hostile, whenever anyone shows overall skepticism towards what you believe.</p>

<p>I was <em>just a few hours ago</em> downvoted for <em>asking someone to clarify</em> what kind of conspiracy their submission implied. I didn&#39;t not even question whether there <em>was</em> a conspiracy or not, I was simply trying to understand the submission itself.</p>

<p>If I can&#39;t even question <em>that</em>... well, how are you going to convince me that this place is honestly after truth and fact, and not just blind acceptance of anything &quot;alternative&quot; or just plain opposite popular consensus?</p>

<p>The problem is, you&#39;ll believe almost anything that&#39;s on <em>You</em>tube instead. How is that any better?</p>

<p>You treat TV and media as if everything they write are calculated lies and deliberate deception meant explicitly to control you, yet you think <em>everything</em> posted in this subreddit is absolutely beyond criticism, and anyone who questions it <em>must</em> have ulterior motives?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I or anyone else is better than you. I&#39;m saying <em>you</em> are not any better than <em>anyone else</em>. And the belief that you are is the entire point of OP&#39;s submission, isn&#39;t it? Along with all the &quot;sheeple&quot; and &quot;wake up&quot; and &quot;shill&quot; and &quot;disinfo agent&quot; bullshit, practically everything in here is to confirm how much smarter you are for &quot;seeing the truth&quot; in all those conspiracy theories, and how stupid everyone else is for being dopey, drugged-up, mind-controlled idiots.</p>

<p>The submission is <em>dripping</em> with self-importance and inflated ego.</p>

<p><em>Exactly</em>! So how is it that so many are <em>so convinced</em> that&#39;s what it was? If the kinds of facts and evidence that would be required to make it into a truthful theory don&#39;t yet exist, what are people basing their beliefs on? How is it that <em>so many</em> can decide that Sandy Hook or the Boston Marathon bombing were &quot;false flag&quot; attacks <em>before they were even over</em>? Not even <em>hours</em> went by before people started making those accusation.

<p>This is the big one.  All the most dangerous men, in the eyes of the government, have wielded love of their fellow man as their weapon.  Most of them seem to end up dead.</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned seeing people like Alex Jones seeming almost giddy about the idea of some sort of violent outcome to this apparent increase in pressure... What the hell do you think happens after the mob goal has been reached?  Everyone puts their weapons down and cooperates?</p>

<p>The real threat is the peaceful man who has awoken to the degree that he realizes he <em>does not need</em> a government, and lives without letting a concept rule his actions.  Cooperation, absent the potential for exploitation, equates to a guaranteed loss of the sort of power which our supposed leaders would sacrifice just about anything for in order to maintain.  They thrive on hate, violence, and conflict.  Remove these, and they have no game pieces.  Nothing.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re dead on with the emotional aspect.  100%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a good point, people are willing to trust large-scale organizations over the incoherent ramblings of a blogger.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s also dangerous and prime for abuse, to only believe those who put on a good show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just got into a heated argument last night about transgenderism and how it has been made &quot;acceptable&quot; by the use of a well orchestrated propaganda machine and I got called a nut and banned from <a href="/r/sex">/r/sex</a>.  I tried to break it down for people that objective reality would describe someone like that as delusional, but they all worry about &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;special rights&quot; for people, and I was just pulling my hair out like what the fuck?  Has everyone taken some kind of &quot;class&quot; that informs them all about people who THINK they&#39;re the opposite sex?  Is giving into delusion the best choice for these people?  No, it just degrades society further into a fucked up dystopia where universal androgyny will be the norm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is because we grew up believing that what was reported on TV was real and the truth. And too a large extent, it is. There is a fire, and they report that there was a fire. There is a riot and they report it. The temperature and the weather, the stock prices, almost anything you can check for yourself, they report the truth. It is only things in far-away places, or things like medicine or law that require special knowledge/training to understand where they lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between wanting things to be validated by the mainstream media or whatever and not believing crack pots who tell you the world will end tomorrow every day.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really kind of sad though, because I bet a lot of conspiracy theories are right, shit the recent NSA scandal shows you that at least some it is true. But when these theories are presented by people who&#39;re obviously crazy you&#39;re just not going to believe any of it.</p>

<p>Maybe you get a guy telling you 9/11 was a false flag operation, maybe he even has some compelling evidence. But then, right when you&#39;re beginning to question shit he&#39;s suddenly telling you the country is run by a shadow government of Lizzardmen.</p>

<p>Post the Lizzardmen it&#39;s hard to believe any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you have to understand is that TV is a mind program devise. That is why they are called TV programs, they are programing the viewer, not the show. </p>

<p>The TV is the perfect brain washing device, something that has your undivided attention and puts you in a trance. Add to that the illusion that lies cannot be told and you have an entire population that believes everything they see on the TV. They are told that the news is trustworthy because it is protected by the first amendment just like religion. </p>

<p>TV is worshiped in the US today, and intelligent people are no different. They can be brainwashed if they are not taught to question everything at a young age. This I think is the key, children are taught in school not to question authority. Some are lucky to be taught to question everything, sadly most are not. </p>

<p>Try this, walk into a bar or even a home with several people watching TV. Use as many subjects as you can so bars are best. Go and watch the people watching the TV, they look like they are being programed. They react when the TV tells them to, their emotions are tied to the show. They are completely controlled by the TV for the entire time they are watching. It is fascinating and sad at the same time, but it is also the reality of the USA these days. </p>

<p>That my friend is why seemingly smart people are so gullible. TV programs them to think a certain way. Free thinkers usually don&#39;t watch, some don&#39;t even own a TV. </p>
