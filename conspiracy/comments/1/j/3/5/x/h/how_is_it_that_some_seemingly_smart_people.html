       There's also a difference between being smart and being intelligent. Just like there is a difference between having knowledge and knowing how to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can be smart as hell, but believe whatever they're told because they don't have the intelligence to think for themselves. One can be highly educated, but if they don't know how to put that education to good use then its pretty useless.

       Paradoxically, though, I've found that the people who think they're the smartest, most fantastical rockstar critical thinkers tend to be the ones who don't think critically at all, but repeat what they're told and call it "logic," because they're told it is logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably the biggest stumbling block for those with open minds is to get caught up with one of these people and begin to doubt your own competency (one of the pitfalls of having an open mind).
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical thinking also means being able to work with the subtlety that is pervasive through life. The current definition of "critical thinking," however, seems to be "take what's obvious and state it as loudly as possible and as the only truth there is." By nature, if you discount the subtle, you'll never see the whole picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of Reddit is a terrible place for critical thinking and open mindedness.

       I think it's great. The children are the ones who need to be taught this kind of thing because its more likely to stick because they are impressionable and such. Up vote for you.

       We come from an education system where critical thought is abysmally discouraged. Rote memorization and compliance are praised and lauded. We are taught from childhood to absorb and regurgitate, absorb and regurgitate...

       The Information Age is still in it's infancy. Until recently, mass media was the only way to keep up with current events. So a majority of americans still plop themselves down in front of the nightly news and absorb the info that is spoon-fed to the public ad nauseum, then regurgitate that info within their social circles until we've effectively brainwashed ourselves.

       That's the absolute truth. When it's going well, they believe the system is working stellar because it recognized their success. When life goes sideways on them, they begin to seek answers to questions 'mainstream' society doesn't want to discuss.

       The panic in the eyes of someone questioning a "fringe theory", after it's initial thesis has been presented, is one of the most telling human reactions.  It's fear, at its core.  Fear of the possibility that the foundation they've built their comfortable lives upon is not nearly as stable as once thought.  Fear of more work.  Fear of deviation from the well-established neural pathways for habitual thought.  Fear of looking like a fool.

       Culturally, we've replaced spiritual and mental growth with a complete reliance on external factors.  We live in a time where everyone is
       <em>
        conditionally
       </em>
       well-balanced.  Remove the underlying, optimal conditions and you've got some very frightened and defensive apes.

       I have fun with it, watching him go through the 5 stages of grief in a about a minute is entertaining at times. its mostly (i think) because he spent several tens of thousands for a political science and history degree, while as i quit college halfway through and am still able to meet him mentally, and at times, stomp him into the ground.

       The "mainstream media" is a useful first-pass filter for bullshit.  They have educated people, on location, who actually talk to officials and scientists and victims and others who have first-hand knowledge.  They have a reputation to preserve, which gives them an incentive to be accurate.  Some random blogger or small site can make some wild claim and not suffer much if it turns out to be false; a big outfit has more to lose (reputation, audience, advertisers, money in a lawsuit, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean the MM is infallible, or the only source to read, or that "big" means "good", or that they should control your "beliefs".  Some of them (such as Fox) have a clear agenda, some (CNN) have a poor record recently.  But as a first pass at the truth, they're useful.  They have a FAR better record of being accurate than many other venues.

       I think one huge aspect of them is they don't want to be wrong and seem like an outsider by believing in these theories. They also lump them in with things like "alternative medicine" and try to psychoanalyze them from a distance without actually looking into them, because from their perspective it's a colossal waste of time.

       How is it that some seemingly smart people believe almost anything that's "validated" by blogs, forums, etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't particularly care who I hear something from, or where. I care if it makes sense. Conspiracies rarely do, in my opinion. They depend on tiny strings of barely-connected threads of evidence through a chasm of ignorance and confusion, with a single far-fetched explanation somehow being much more likely than a dozen common ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, what's with this circlejerk topic? "We're so much smarter because we don't believe the MSM lies"? Is that really constructive? Does that really make more people believe what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       say? Does it even make anyone want to listen to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were to present professional, coherent theories backed up by solid facts and clear evidence, people would have no problem trusting you over the media, but you don't. You have blogs with neon-green text on starry backgrounds, you have videos that are hours and hours long, without ever getting to the point, and you accuse everything of being "false-flag", and anyone of questioning you of being "shills".
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think of myself as at least a "seemingly" smart person, yet whenever I point out obvious inconsistencies or failures in a line of reasoning, I get attacked and lambasted, as if what I was questioning can't stand up to scrutiny, and I must be driven away by force to protect that belief. Why is that? Why is it that seemingly smart people can't handle questioning and disbelief without getting confrontational and aggressive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop worrying about those who don't believe you, and start looking at those who do. They're a much bigger problem, in my opinion.

       No, that's a hypothesis. Generally, a theory is something built on top of
       <em>
        solid
       </em>
       evidence, and something you attempt to
       <em>
        disprove
       </em>
       . How many people here ever attempt to
       <em>
        disprove
       </em>
       their own theories?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy "theory" has always meant "theory" in the colloquial sense, but for some reason very few people know that. Scientifically speaking, there's absolutely nothing scientific about the method by which people "prove" their "theories" here.

       Likewise. Which was basically my point.

       See above. Things are considered "rational" for good reason, and
       <em>
        looking
       </em>
       for evidence of conspiracies everywhere while disregarding evidence that disputes it is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being open-minded or "thinking outside the box". In fact, it's the opposite. People here often
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       accept opinions that are clearly
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       the box, in that if you criticize or question any conspiracy, prepare to be accused of bad things and downvoted.

      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And why do we know that? Because when it actually happens, there is evidence to prove it, evidence that stands the test of time and public scrutiny. Claiming Sandy Hook was a "false flag" operation and that everyone at the Boston Marathon were "crisis actors" does not stand even the test of reason, nor does it hold up to any kind of scrutiny whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't dispute that
       <em>
        conspiracies
       </em>
       exist, neither in the dictionary-sense of the word of the more sinister, practical use. But there's a difference between real, provable conspiracies, and "theories" that are, in actual fact, nothing but ramblings based on numerology or overzealous analysis of compressed JPEGs.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I have little doubt that there was some kind of
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       (in the dictionary sense of the word) to misrepresent evidence and reports in order to have an excuse to invade Iraq. But I sincerely doubt there was any conspiracy (in the sinister sense) to create an impossibly elaborate catastrophe in NYC in 2001 that brought down the entire World Trade Center district. One is based on reason and evidence that holds up to public scrutiny, one is based on magic, paranoia and mad ramblings.

       Because people who DARE to think the government lies to us, who DARE to think outside of the box, who DARE to question what we are told are are wackos right? We are all just quacks that belong in a mental institution? That's why the government needs to spy on every american! They need to catch us terrorists, you know, the ones that believe in privacy, sound money, and the Constitution/Bill of Rights! But, none of us have any evidence of anything we talk about, we create conspiracies out of thin air, and ALL of us believe in a secret race of reptile aliens that secretly control the world, right?
...Right?
Ben Swann is an investigative journalist who could be considered a conspiracy theorist. He used to be with FOX news, but left to become independent. He must be a whacko too... Now that I think about it, you must be the only sane person in the world, right?
...Right?
Shame on everybody for daring to think for yourself, and not believing everything that comes out of the tube.

       Look, there's no shortage of out-there conspiracy theories with little-to-no factual basis, or even internal consistency. I know you all believe in different things, but the common denominator is that you
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       believe in something with very little evidence for it, go to great lengths to reject or deny any evidence against those theories, and become

       Fluoride is basically a medication that is given to Americans by force (up to 1.2ppm in municipal water sources, plus huge amounts end up in our food) . It's a neurotoxin, shown to reduce IQs in many studies. Its also known to calcify the pineal gland in the brain. It was used in Nazi concentration camps. Do you really think it's all about saving our teeth? I doubt it. If you have a enough willpower to stay away from sugar, your teeth will never decay in the first place.

       Emotional involvement seems to take precedence over reason when it comes to shifting paradigms. Being completely detached emotionally from a situation is what seems to permit the exploration of different interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that good memory and processing speed have far less importance than emotional intelligence in the common hypnotic state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think about things like "cremation of care" or "abuse rituals" in this light.
      </p>

       Beware of conspiracy boards for that matter. Recurring themes like hate, powerlessness, convenient paradigms to dismiss our own shortcomings defend the status-quo.

       This is the big one.  All the most dangerous men, in the eyes of the government, have wielded love of their fellow man as their weapon.  Most of them seem to end up dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm concerned seeing people like Alex Jones seeming almost giddy about the idea of some sort of violent outcome to this apparent increase in pressure... What the hell do you think happens after the mob goal has been reached?  Everyone puts their weapons down and cooperates?
      </p>
      <p>
       The real threat is the peaceful man who has awoken to the degree that he realizes he
       <em>
        does not need
       </em>
       a government, and lives without letting a concept rule his actions.  Cooperation, absent the potential for exploitation, equates to a guaranteed loss of the sort of power which our supposed leaders would sacrifice just about anything for in order to maintain.  They thrive on hate, violence, and conflict.  Remove these, and they have no game pieces.  Nothing.

       A few things:
1) Lets face it, mainstream media has tremendously better production value.  A lot of the "conspiracy" websites look like they were made in 1997 by an  8 year old.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There is no filter whatsoever for alternative media sites.  It takes a while to find reliable sources and figure out how to cut through the BS.  MSM provides a more accurate lies vs truth filter, but of course, there are still plenty of lies.

       I just got into a heated argument last night about transgenderism and how it has been made "acceptable" by the use of a well orchestrated propaganda machine and I got called a nut and banned from
       <a href="/r/sex">
        /r/sex
       </a>
       .  I tried to break it down for people that objective reality would describe someone like that as delusional, but they all worry about "feelings" and "special rights" for people, and I was just pulling my hair out like what the fuck?  Has everyone taken some kind of "class" that informs them all about people who THINK they're the opposite sex?  Is giving into delusion the best choice for these people?  No, it just degrades society further into a fucked up dystopia where universal androgyny will be the norm.

       It is because we grew up believing that what was reported on TV was real and the truth. And too a large extent, it is. There is a fire, and they report that there was a fire. There is a riot and they report it. The temperature and the weather, the stock prices, almost anything you can check for yourself, they report the truth. It is only things in far-away places, or things like medicine or law that require special knowledge/training to understand where they lie.

       There is a difference between wanting things to be validated by the mainstream media or whatever and not believing crack pots who tell you the world will end tomorrow every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really kind of sad though, because I bet a lot of conspiracy theories are right, shit the recent NSA scandal shows you that at least some it is true. But when these theories are presented by people who're obviously crazy you're just not going to believe any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you get a guy telling you 9/11 was a false flag operation, maybe he even has some compelling evidence. But then, right when you're beginning to question shit he's suddenly telling you the country is run by a shadow government of Lizzardmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post the Lizzardmen it's hard to believe any of it.

       Some people can't let their world view be shifted that much. Some people have only had that one source of information, and not much critical thinking or skepticism of what is being force fed into their brains. To challenge that source that has been there is to effectively cause a paradigm shift which would cause them to question their entire lives.

       Stockholm syndrome also comes into effect. Look at the Jew's 60 years ago they where pretty darn smart and most of them where the upper class in society aswell. Look how the country betrayed them, they never expected that nor did they think it would be possible. This does't mean obama will do the same to us he is a good president.

       What you have to understand is that TV is a mind program devise. That is why they are called TV programs, they are programing the viewer, not the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TV is the perfect brain washing device, something that has your undivided attention and puts you in a trance. Add to that the illusion that lies cannot be told and you have an entire population that believes everything they see on the TV. They are told that the news is trustworthy because it is protected by the first amendment just like religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       TV is worshiped in the US today, and intelligent people are no different. They can be brainwashed if they are not taught to question everything at a young age. This I think is the key, children are taught in school not to question authority. Some are lucky to be taught to question everything, sadly most are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try this, walk into a bar or even a home with several people watching TV. Use as many subjects as you can so bars are best. Go and watch the people watching the TV, they look like they are being programed. They react when the TV tells them to, their emotions are tied to the show. They are completely controlled by the TV for the entire time they are watching. It is fascinating and sad at the same time, but it is also the reality of the USA these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       That my friend is why seemingly smart people are so gullible. TV programs them to think a certain way. Free thinkers usually don't watch, some don't even own a TV.
