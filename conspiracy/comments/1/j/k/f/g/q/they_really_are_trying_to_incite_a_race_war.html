    <div class="md"><p>Nope, race is their cover story. The &#39;elites&#39; are desperate to find an excuse to disarm the law abiding citizenry. Their color matters not. In order for marxist revolutions to succeed the average citizen must be forced to live in fear without the means to defend themselves.</p>

<p>For any of you that still labor under the delusion that this &#39;Show Trial&#39; was about race, consider the huge Latino race hustling industry represented by La Raza that immediately abandoned their Latino crime victim George Zimmerman and subordinated his civil rights for the greater progressive good of total civilian disarmament.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but you think they&#39;ll need a reason to take the guns away without pissing off the public. They could use a race/civil war as an indirect way of taking our guns away. Cause not everyone will participate in a civil/race war. And in order to &quot;protect&quot; the people take away the guns.
I&#39;m not saying they really are. I&#39;m saying I think they might be doing something as a cover for their real agenda.</p>

<p>The fasci are a bundle of nationalist sticks when tied together make a weapon that make the nation-state supreme. Don&#39;t get me wrong, both are statist and absolutely evil. </p>

<p>The state reigns supreme over all in both systems. That&#39;s why there&#39;s not much difference between marxist&#39;s like Obama and national socialists like Adolph Hitler. </p>

<p>please, educate me. maybe i&#39;m just ignorant when it comes to &quot;fabian&quot; socialism, but if &quot;fabian&quot; socialism is responsible for the evils of giant corporations, anti-communist covert organizations, and late capitalism, then it really doesn&#39;t seem like socialism to me.</p>

<p>(i kind of want to apologize for the rant, but honestly at this point i&#39;m so tired of people crying &quot;socialist&quot; when conspiracies come up that i really just want to end this nonsense here and now.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you arguing the system we have in westernized countries is free market capitalism? Let&#39;s have look at the socialist platform as of 1928 and how it has fared, shall we?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>“Nationalization of our natural resources, beginning with the coal mines and water sites, particularly at Boulder Dam and Muscle Shoals.” (Boulder Dam, renamed Hoover Dam, and Muscle Shoals are now both federal government projects.)</p></li>
<li><p>“A publicly owned giant power system under which the federal government shall cooperate with the states and municipalities in the distribution of electrical energy to the people at cost.” (Tennessee Valley Authority.)</p></li>
<li><p>“National ownership and democratic management of railroads and other means of transportation and communication.” (Railroad passenger service is completely nationalized through Amtrak. Some freight service is nationalized through Conrail. The FCC controls communications by telephone, telegraph, radio, and television.)</p></li>
<li><p>“An adequate national program for flood control, flood relief, reforestation, irrigation, and reclamation.” (Government expenditures for these purposes are currently in the many [non-adjusted] billions of dollars.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Immediate government relief of the unemployed by the extension of all public works and a program of long range planning of public works …” (In the 1930s, WPA and PWA were a direct counterpart; now, a wide variety of other programs are.) “All persons thus employed to be engaged at hours and wages fixed by bona-fide labor unions.” (The Davis-Bacon and Walsh-Healey Acts required contractors with government contracts to pay “prevailing wages,” generally interpreted as highest union wages.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Loans to states and municipalities without interest for the purpose of carrying on public works and the taking of such other measures as will lessen widespread misery.” (Federal grants in aid to states and local municipalities currently total [non-adjusted] tens of billions of dollars a year.)</p></li>
<li><p>“A system of unemployment insurance.” (Part of Social Security system)</p></li>
<li><p>“The nation-wide extension of public employment agencies in cooperation with city federations of labor.” (U.S. Employment Service and affiliated state employment services administer a network of about 2,500 [in 1980] local employment offices.)</p></li>
<li><p>“A system of health and accident insurance and of old age pensions as well as unemployment insurance.” (Part of Social Security system.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Shortening the workday” and “Securing to every worker a rest period of no less than two days in each week.” (Legislated by wages and hours laws that require overtime for more than forty hours of work per week.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Enacting of an adequate federal anti-child labor amendment.” (Not achieved as amendment, but essence incorporated in various legislative acts.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Abolition of the brutal exploitation of convicts under the contract system and substitution of a cooperative organization of industries in penitentiaries and workshops for the benefit of convicts and their dependents.” (Party achieved, partly not.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Increase of taxation on high income levels, of corporation taxes and inheritance taxes, the proceeds to be used for old age pensions and other forms of social insurance.” (In 1928, highest personal income tax rate, 25 percent; in 1978, 70 percent; in 1928, corporate tax rate, 12 percent; in 1978, 48 percent; in 1928, top federal estate tax rate, 20 percent; in 1978, 70 percent.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Appropriation by taxation of the annual rental value of all land held for speculation.” (Not achieved in this form, but property taxes have risen drastically.)</p></li>

<p>You can&#39;t control the world if the world is filled with free markets and free people you have to control every aspect of lives schooling, health (obamacare), education (compulsory public schooling), food (subsidies/regulations/FDA), energy, money (The Fed), etc...</p>

<p>We are UNQUESTIONABLY moving in a socialist direction whether or not it&#39;s what you want to call &quot;Pure Socialism&quot; is up for debate, but socialism is NOT the nice thing you seem to wish it would be, and as of right now I would say we are almost there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, these programs also coexist with the massive and disastrous deregulation thats taken place under every administration since reagan...
In particular taxes are way lower now, and income inequality has soared</p>

<p>Are you really arguing that we should abolish child labor laws? Return to exploiting convicts even more? Abolish unemployment insurance? Eliminate all public sector jobs? Lengthen the work week?</p>

<p>In a &quot;pure&quot; free market system THE RICH control things. And you cant have this kind of free market without a state to enforce property law. &quot;Free markets&quot; have required violent imposition in: the US, chile, south africa, iraq, etc.</p>

<p>A market where the people who have the most money, or wealth (the accumulation of which was largely made possible by exploitation, and in the u.s. slavery and land theft) is NOT free. Unless free means &quot;free for rich people to do whatever the fuck they want.&quot;</p>

<p>Im against the first thing you mentioned because the vast majority of those resources were stolen from native americans. If you look at what things were like in the united states before taxation, nationalization, bureaucracy, etc you dont find a system based on private property, you find a system based on collective ownership, personal property, and free trade.</p>

<p>Hitler and mussolini werent socialist. &quot;Obamacare&quot; isnt socialist. The public mandate requires people to buy private insurance, which is an excellent example of what happens when the state exists to service the &quot;free market.&quot; It didnt come about because socialist obama is having his way with us, we have obamacare because the right (and the nominal left) rejected single payer, which was his initial proposal. If obama is a socialist it sure seems like hes powerless to actualize it in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Finally you are right that there are elements of socialism around today. Virtually all the ones you mentioned are things we are better off for them having happened. But the claim I initially made is that the american governmental, business, and covert elite have consistently aimed to destroy any communist resistance to the status quo, even (more like especially) when it has also been anti-racist, anti-imperialist, and democratic. You dont have to be a communist to recognize that theres a pervasive anti-communist conspiracy. But this is a tough pill for a lot of r/conspiracy to swallow, because it means that conspiracy theorists like glenn beck may actually be part of a larger conspiracy, that some conspiracy theories actually serve the interests of the powerful...</p>

<p>But I dont want to hate on libertarians too much. There are some places I agree with ron paul: like the surveillance state, the war on drugs, and war in general. But im terrified of what would happen if someone like him got their way with the economy and more or less eliminated the last semblance of a social safety net that exists in the US. Im troubled by paul supporters because they tend to either ignore that there are people like nader and kucinich (hell, he claims to have seen a ufo!) who share all these positions with paul but also support policies which dont open the floodgates to even more corporate power and economic inequality, or are explixitly against them for those very reasons.</p>

<p>If such a thing is possible, im a libertarian communist. But like ive said elsewhere, im a democrat first. Its just pretty shocking to me that people here have gone as far as to argue that democracy = fascism in order to oppose socialism. In my mind, thats pretty scary, and brings to mind the numerous cia coups against democratically elected socialists and COINTELPRO&#39;s targeting of leftist dissidents, which is pretty troubling to encounter in r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a bit of a no true scotsman fallacy going on. </p>

<p>What is a socialist then?</p>

<p>Hitler was a &quot;National Socialist&quot; for heavens sakes. </p>

<p>What you are having trouble understanding is that when the state runs the economy as in socialism, it gets abused. Concentrating so much power in one place will lead to corruption it&#39;s human nature.</p>

<p>Another place where you are confused is the difference between truly free markets, and crony capitalism. </p>

<p>Without a state to grant license, bail out, and create monopolies competition flourishes and we all get richer. </p>

<p>I mean half of the problems you are describing are caused by the fed which has a monopoly on making money. If they couldn&#39;t print and bailout banks/etc... we wouldn&#39;t have the terrifying concentration of power that we have.</p>

<p>Just make society voluntary, don&#39;t steal from me, I won&#39;t steal from you. </p>

<p>If you want to make a communist collective GO FOR IT! Just don&#39;t steal (Tax) from me in order to pay for your commune.</p>

<p>Just let everyone have their life, liberty, and property. How could you oppose that? </p>

<p>I think the answer is to get rid of the &quot;State&quot; which is the most violent actor in human history and let us live voluntarily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How? How do big monopolies get broken up with no state, regulation, or taxes?</p>

<p>How do you have a free market that is not based on fraud in a country founded on slavery and land theft? The whole &quot;voluntary interaction&quot; thing was kinda fucked up about 500 years ago or so... and saying &quot;OKAY FREEZE, VOLUNTARY INTERACTION TIME!&quot; when a tiny elite have the vast majority of resources is free in only the most frighteningly orwellian sense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I should get to choose who to &quot;steal&quot; from. This is the system that I advocate: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1jfhcd/national_impeach_obama_day_set_for_august_6th/cbebxsx">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1jfhcd/national_impeach_obama_day_set_for_august_6th/cbebxsx</a></p>

<p>The idea that &quot;live and let live&quot; will solve all our problems via eliminating the state is a fairy tale. (Rich) people are perfectly content to &quot;live and let die,&quot; and I have no idea how what you&#39;re proposing will do anything to change that. Having a small group of people with a shit ton of wealth and the ability to hire private security forces (whoa! non-state force and coercion!) isn&#39;t exactly going to solve any of our problems.</p>

<p>Also, if there&#39;s any &quot;no true scotsman&quot; going on here, i don&#39;t think I&#39;m responsible for it. I claimed &quot;there aren&#39;t marxists in power.&quot; You replied with &quot;but fabian socialists!&quot; I replied &quot;but there&#39;s an extensive history of anti-communism among the u.s. business, covert, and governmental elite&quot; and then you say &quot;but national socialism has the word &#39;socialism&#39; in it!&quot; Yeah... and? The black panthers, AIM, weather underground, communist party USA, and occupy movement aren&#39;t nazis... Nor is immortal technique, dead prez, salvador allende, or the sandinistas...</p>

<p>Regardless, do you really think we shouldn&#39;t pay attention to and criticize doublespeak with respect to political labeling? The U.S. calls itself a representative democracy; that doesn&#39;t mean the government is representative or democratic. The USSR called itself communist; that doesn&#39;t mean it was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think the historical argument is going to get us anywhere. Hitler took control of the economy, schooling, etc... That is by definition socialism, but whatever it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>What does matter is that you understand that in a free society money is EARNED not distributed as you are asserting.</p>

<p>You get money by giving value not just by being evil. Evil companies die out, because they are evil and people stop doing business with them. </p>

<p>Whereas in a statist society you have a big gang that can just grant them a monopoly.</p>

<p>Wait so monopolies are bad, so we should give the state a monopoly on healthcare, education, money, policing, regulation?</p>

<p>Wait so, the State in its current form = Evil so we should have more state control?</p>

<p>States grant monopolies through preferential legislation, so the only way to break them up is to have more state?</p>

<p>Politicians are evil and cruel so let&#39;s give them more power?</p>

<p>Violence is bad, let&#39;s give the state a monopoly on violence?</p>

<p>States are corrupt and inefficient, let&#39;s give them control of healthcare? </p>

<p>Force, fraud, and coercion against free men and women who have done nothing wrong is evil. </p>

<p>You cannot steal from me because you have a white building that you call a government I have a right to life, liberty, and property. </p>

<p>Free markets create value unlike the state which can ONLY destroy value. It has nothing it didn&#39;t steal first. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying free societies are utopia, but they are the best and most just way. </p>

<p>Dude, you are saying the worst thing that could happen if we got rid of the state is another state...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes it is bad, it&#39;s not like we got it for free, they stole money to pay for it, private roads have existed in current, modern, and ancient times. Private roads, private courts, and private security ALL EXIST NOW. We can&#39;t even imagine how much better they would be in a free society. </p>

<p>You are providing zero evidence of this. Secondly, you are again saying the worst case scenario is that we end up back at the status quo.</p>

<p>Sweatshops exist, because of government intervention on the part of china in the form of union regulations and currency manipulation. Do your research before you throw around claims. </p>

<p>What? Isn&#39;t that contradicting your point, the free market allows you to make a choice, the state doesn&#39;t. So why are you recommending the state again?</p>

<p>Socialism requires a HUGE state, more socialism, more state to administer, how do you not get this as a socialist.</p>

<p>No it&#39;s neither you only aggress against someone who has aggressed against you or your property. </p>

<p>Do you believe you own your body? If so why then don&#39;t you believe that you own the results of the actions of you body? If you think so then we have natural property rights and from there all you have to do is agree we have a natural right of self-defense of ourselves and property.</p>

<p>Also polycentric law already exists, it&#39;s called binding arbitration. Options would be greater in a free society. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t become billionaires by fucking people over. If they didn&#39;t make their billions of the state then they did so by making peoples lives better. What raises people out of poverty is entrepeneurship, private property, and actual economic growth. you can&#39;t just produce an edict that says no one will ever be poor. People need free markets to grow. Kiva.org is a great example. </p>

<p>By the way I&#39;m sure you will hate this, but minimum wage laws hurt the poor. People who keep their jobs are very visible, but the ones who don&#39;t get hired because of added costs are hidden. It&#39;s a short-sighted, idiotic policy, and you seem to have very little understanding of BASIC economics. </p>

<p>Zimmerman is a perfect example of how this was happening. There was no amount of evidence (from the beginning) that he could be convicted of murder. But most of the media intentionally created their own narrative where this black kid was shot for no reason, not telling facts at all. And the outrage forced them to try him, and of course he couldn&#39;t be convicted of anything.

If you see pass the story, to me atleast, it seems like a reminder of how White America treated Black America. 
I&#39;m on my phone no internet until tomorrow.  Can you link me some of those articles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you for years I was basically raised by T.V. cause my mom had to work 24/7 to support us. I didn&#39;t like reading books because I either get yelled at or made fun of. Used to have a lisp. Didn&#39;t follow the news cause it was boring, didn&#39;t try and learn cause I was already a loser constantly made fun of for being an outcast, and saw on TV what other kids did to nerds. I was brainwashed by the media.
I recently woke up and started realizing I was slowly killing myself. Trying to educate myself and actually think on my own. And the way things are going I&#39;m starting to see how the elite might enact they&#39;re plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, the timeline doesn&#39;t make sense for there to be any connection to the Zimmerman case.</p>

<p>For starters, the movie doesn&#39;t come out until another couple of weeks. If there&#39;s a conspiracy to piggyback the so-called racial tensions from the Zimmerman case then why not release the movie now? Last week? During the trial?</p>

<p>The movie is a bio-pic about a black man who worked in the White House for nearly 40 years, IIRC. He started as a dishwasher and worked his way up to whatever the fancy title is for being in charge of the kitchen staff, butlers, maids and serving staff. He had access to the private lives of the Presidents. He was in the WH from the 40s-80s so there&#39;s no way in hell that race issues would be left out.</p>

<p>He was paid for the rights to his story by a movie house in 2008. They tabled it, I don&#39;t think they ever did a rough script. They sold the rights to another movie house in early 2012. Filming started in Spring 2012 and wrapped up late Summer/Autumn. Then came post production editing, promoting, etc. Pretty much the same timeframe of any non-CGI movie that&#39;s not being released on a gimmick date.</p>

<p>No conspiracy, maybe mildly interesting at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think the historical argument is going to get us anywhere. Hitler took control of the economy, schooling, etc... That is by definition socialism, but whatever it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>What does matter is that you understand that in a free society money is EARNED not distributed as you are asserting.</p>

<p>You get money by giving value not just by being evil. Evil companies die out, because they are evil and people stop doing business with them. </p>

<p>Whereas in a statist society you have a big gang that can just grant them a monopoly.</p>

<p>Wait so monopolies are bad, so we should give the state a monopoly on healthcare, education, money, policing, regulation?</p>

<p>Wait so, the State in its current form = Evil so we should have more state control?</p>

<p>States grant monopolies through preferential legislation, so the only way to break them up is to have more state?</p>

<p>Politicians are evil and cruel so let&#39;s give them more power?</p>

<p>Violence is bad, let&#39;s give the state a monopoly on violence?</p>

<p>States are corrupt and inefficient, let&#39;s give them control of healthcare? </p>

<p>Force, fraud, and coercion against free men and women who have done nothing wrong is evil. </p>

<p>You cannot steal from me because you have a white building that you call a government I have a right to life, liberty, and property. </p>

<p>Free markets create value unlike the state which can ONLY destroy value. It has nothing it didn&#39;t steal first. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying free societies are utopia, but they are the best and most just way. </p>
