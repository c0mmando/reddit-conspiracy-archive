        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First let me say thank you for at least clicking (if only to downvote). But take a moment before or after you do, just to think. </p>

<p>First things first: the issue of common ground on which to base any discussion. </p>

<p>Im going to assume that most of us on both sides of this debate are not too different, I mean taking the lowest common denominator, we are all at least in human form and all have the same basic needs. In that I salute all of us, the human condition bonds us regardless of if you feel it. Another common fact is that we are all on reddit and here, virtual location is a bond as well, and in that I say hello, lets not waste this moment and hear what everyone wants to say. The third common fact, is that we are probably all younger, and im no age-ist but this world belongs to the youth, just look at the numbers. And in that I say to both sides, lets figure this shit out together, because a lot of us have a long way to go.</p>

<p>Secondly: Why it is in the best interest of ALL OF US to save this sub.
I know a lot of us are American and that we don’t usually act in our collective best interest, but rather on ideological lines, but hear out these reasons and let’s debate them until we all know better where we stand. Below are reasons why saving this subs integrity is pertinent to each group self interest: </p>

<p>Reasons for the shills: (paid shills, and agenda motivated parties)
If you&#39;re being paid, do what you have to do.  But know this, the longer fact based conspiracies stay hidden the longer the corrupt system which has put you in the place of needing that paycheck will also stay. Do you think your employers carry even the slightest loyalty, they may, but mostly Im thinking because it is in their corrupt self-interest to do so. If you actually care about anything bigger than yourself ease off the shilling when facts are present, have a go at the wild theories, but the important ones of which there is logic behind. Ease up my friends. If you destroy this sub-reddit the sooner your employer will have no need for you. It’s not in your interest to win by defeating us. Do your job of course, but let the important truths flow. And if you’re ready come over to the light side, were having a party all the time. </p>

<p>Reasons for the trolls: (b/tards) (pseudo-intellectuals acting from egoist superiority) 
You guys are funny, no really thanks for the entertainment, and I don’t think you’re the problem, your ego is controllable and Ive had great fun troll-trolling because you are predictable. Don’t let your ego tell you that your undefeatable, and again if you&#39;re so fucking smart, act in your and the collectives best interest (which in this case are one and the same), if you don’t you have to admit you’re not as smart as you claim, for any acceptable definition of intelligence must surely denote truthful self-perpetuation. If you disagree PM me and ill rhetorically defeat that super brain of yours. If you win keep trolling if not Ill try again. Either way, let’s be friends. </p>

<p>Reasons for the common redditor: 
Whats up guys/gals. Thanks for the past discussions and I look forward to the future ones also. It’s a fucked up world isn’t it, but you have to admit it’s all kinda fun. And most importantly we have already won, if only through trends and time. The best conspiracy in my opinion is the shift that’s happening regardless right now,  it cant really be denied, and even if you do, I’m sure you will be happily be proven wrong. Its kinda all win-win isn’t it? Lets keep up the quality posts, or just move over to r/politics which is becoming more like r/conspiracy anyway (take that as a sign that were already in the lead). Good luck guys I truly love that your all still here trying. </p>

<p>Conclusion:
Soon enough we wont even need to separate conspiracy from mainstream news, and so maybe this post is redundant, but I wanted to reach out to everyone here just a little. Thanks for taking the time. </p>

<p>Or don&#39;t! Instead ask yourself some questions. </p>

<p>Do you know who is actually giving the orders and providing the money for the person/agency who gives you your paycheck? </p>

<p>Do you know what your employer&#39;s ultimate agenda is?</p>

<p>Could it be that they are the bad guys? And if so, what would that make you...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figured if theyre shilling its cuz they need the money. I wouldnt suppose to take someones livelihood away. I mean its not like they can actually destroy the truth, just annoy those who already know it. most people I know hate their jobs. I do kinda feel for em. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we gotta change the game were all playing thats whats really important. If we cant convince the shills and the ignorant that our ways are better, what is to be expected? to enforce the self defined righteous will on others? If you want to talk like your on the high road and they are not, you actually have to take the high road. We gotta treat the shills like theyre one of us, and actually believe it. otherwise its just another us versus them game, and thats what got us into this mess in the first place. were on the losing side of it. if you want to play again thats fine. i dont. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order for discussion to take place both parties must know the subject to approx the same depth, this is the biggest problem shills have. Secondly why bother discussing anything with a shill when you know they WILL NOT change their mind no matter how convincing you are or how many sources you provide? Providing sources to a shill is doing thier job for them, as they can go away and have &#39;the team&#39; shutdown or hack that website or just have it not appear on the usual search engines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if both parties already know the subject to the same depth, we probably wouldnt have to say anything. the truth would then be apparent. and whatever choice people wanted to make based on that info would be their choice to make. sadly as a conspiracy theorist the worst thing is having the truth explicitely stated and people not really caring ie:nsa. so deal with it. this is our world, not everyone has to passionately understand the implications of reality. but they also shouldnt stop others who do. </p>

<p>regarding your fears of what shills and hackers may do... you can literally feed that fear fire all day all night. its a sign of a healthy creative imagination. and some of it might be correct, but were not saving the world by informing people, it might contribute, but we save the world by living how were supposed to live. Fuck the shills, the agendas, the elite. life is short make it count with passion and offer more than just pointing out how fucked it is. there are so many people waking up that they cant shut down every leaky faucet, so enjoy a bit, dont worry so much. </p>

<p>We win by making them want to live like us. lets show em what happiness is, a lot of the foot soldiers will convert. And the elite will be their own demise because they cant change.</p>
