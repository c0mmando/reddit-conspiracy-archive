        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everyone keeps asking &quot;what can we do to stop the corporate takeover, the tyrannical government that&#39;s forming in America&quot;. The answer is <em>you</em>, the same thing that made this country great: The consumer! </p>

<p>Stop consuming the product of American society. That&#39;s what they bank on: the fact that the masses will continue to blindly consume based on the television and news media&#39;s definition of what&#39;s truly important. They spend millions on social engineering through &quot;popular&quot; music and celebrities whose fame has been misconstrued and giving you these gadgets to distract you and disconnect you from the actual WORLD.... So far from the potential of the human race.</p>

<p>These corporations, this government, these representatives, these <em>people</em> are misleading us for the profit of a select few, who are steering our society in a way that benefits only them. There&#39;s nothing we can do because they are better than us and their money is more powerful.</p>

<p>But our money funds these people. If it didn&#39;t they wouldn&#39;t be rich. If we as a whole, or majority, dissent to these evil entities through monetary means it will be exponentially more effective than this circle jerk we have going on in America. Money is what&#39;s most important to our country anyway, not human life (or life in general, to be quite honest).</p>

<p>This kind of protest coupled with conscious noncompliance and refusal to conform to the privatization of human rights and taking to the streets could make a real difference. Stop feeding in to the corporatocracy and live by the ways you believe, not what&#39;s easy. Download the buycott app, don&#39;t buy from corporate industries. Fuck your phone that you pay $100+ hard earned dollars for, there are phones that you can pay way less than $50 a month for with no contract! Turn off your cable, I can honestly say I haven&#39;t turned on my television in three months yet still pay the cable bill ($160/month). Cut yourself off from the things that the societal engineers want you to see and focus on what makes you happy, and feel fulfilled, feel empowered and important. Stop being spoiled and yet complaining about the way the companies you support are taking your rights away. Hit &#39;em where it hurts!! In your mind and in their bank account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting.  There are lots of us who have been doing this for many years, we are waiting for you on the other side!  </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually pretty nice to have no TV, download what you want to watch without ad&#39;s. Pay as you go phones are great. </p>

<p>Data on wireless works more than enough, that way you have dedicated times to check email rather than on all the time.</p>

<p>Buying organic and growing your own veg, plus not buying any corporate junk is a great way to meet local&#39;s in your area with the same interestes, AND support them. Win win - this is called stacking functions in permaculture.</p>

<p>I own an old truck that runs on propane gas (it&#39;s clean, a byproduct of oil and you can cook on it), and I ride my bike / transit mostly.  No harm done, plus in great fighting shape from the exercise.</p>

<p>Where you focus your attention is where you will see the fruits of your labour - that is what magic really is.  Good luck fellow earthlings - I love you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an ex-Mormon.  Coming out of the LDS faith really opened up my eyes to the simple fact that organized religions are just another way for TPTB/The Man/People Who Want To Rule Over You to siphon your money and control your mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t wanna insult anyone&#39;s religious beliefs -- if you&#39;re happy with what you have and it works, more power to you.  I just personally don&#39;t see the necessity of going to an organized religion and giving them your time and money to connect with the higher power you believe in.  That&#39;s generally done much more deeply and effectively on one&#39;s own, if that&#39;s your thing.  I get the social network that church provides, and some people need that connection as well, but I personally don&#39;t feel that going to church is necessarily gonna be the thing that connects you to whatever higher power you decide you wanna believe in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s impractical. People are lazy and love/are addicted to the convenience and pleasure provided by corporations.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one thing you can do: support direct democracy politicians. Like it or not, we currently live in a republic. The powers that be can only twist election results a medium amount without getting caught. Use mere upvotes and shares to get a snowball effect going behind some aspiring direct democracy politician with a viral video. Put someone into office who believes in democracy 2.0. Don&#39;t forget, this is a country where horses have and Hunter S Thompson have almost been elected mayor.</p>

<p>&quot;TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY&quot; some of you might be screaming. It&#39;s true, the catch with direct democracy is, you&#39;re gonna have to trust your fellow citizens to make decisions that dictate your life. Maybe it will help you to remember that our politicians are in no way better, smarter, or more moral than the rest of us. They are good at schmoozing and power hungry. I hope this is clear to you by now. Your neighbors are citizens. They live here too. They should have a say. They might be dumb. It might not be exactly what you want, but the majority having power is in no way worse than individuals having power.</p>
