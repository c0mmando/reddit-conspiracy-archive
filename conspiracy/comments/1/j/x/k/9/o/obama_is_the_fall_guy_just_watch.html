       They're going to try and get away with as much they can, until the American public can't take it anymore. He'll either be impeached or will be scrutinized after he leaves office. Either way, Obama is a tool for those actually in power.

       All of the presidents are 'cat's paws.'
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the nice thing about them. They rotate in and out and everyone claps for the new guy who will be better than the last. There's no need for a dictatorship. This system allows for the guise of newness while still keeping corporate interests in the back - and most important - seat.

       Whilst I agree with virtually all of what you say, I do think that Obama is a different puppet from previous White House incumbents. The amount of unconstitutionality that is being forced through on his watch is completely unprecedented, and it really does seem to me that the puppetmasters regard him as expendable, a scapegoat.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will engineer his impeachment when the time is right, and make sure he gets the blame. They will also ensure that the worst of Obama's executive orders remain in place for "the next guy" to take maximum advantage of.

       Maybe you don't understand the structure of our government. The President isn't a King responsible for all decisions. He doesn't create the laws and he doesn't judge the constitutionality of laws, but he gets blamed for everything. Our country is ruled by groups, not one guy.

       Because of his executive powers he is able to ram through unconstitutional executive orders in order to kick start certain policy changes the groups want enacted.
      </p>
      <p>
       He acts as a shroud for the actions of the house and senate so that it can yet again be two teams pitted against each other once more in the competitive team based democratic system, as he holds the power of veto over congress.

       The people who control what happens are the global elitists who own all the banks, control wall street through their dominance of the stock market ( and not just the common mans market like actual owners shares so that they can be on the board of directors for the companies they invest in so they can essentially own them ), and all the fucking land and resources they control.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty much a handful of insidious people who then pass down their agenda through the ranks until it becomes fully implemented within the ranks of the common folk.

       This is how they got us to start drinking fluoride in our water. "Hey, what the fuck should we do with all this fluoride waste from making this bomb?" "Fuck, let's run a PR campaign along with the dental association alleging it's good for your tooth health even though it's the wrong type of fluoride for that and it shouldn't be ingested so the delivery system is completely fucked but that's the point cause now those fucks will be less healthy AND we can make a butt load off this manufacturing waste."

       TL;DR - The system is so completely gamed it's hard to tell exactly who pulls what strings but you can start to put together pieces of the puzzle when you start to scrutinize the right individuals such as the Rothschilds or the Bush family.

       You'll have to excuse me for being difficult, but do you have any hard evidence to support any of this? I have learned the long and hard way to not believe everything you hear, and I think it's important to apply that at all times, even when the subject in question is something I generally support.

       Also do a search on the origins of fluoride introduction to our water supply and view the different types of fluoride, the natural form being calcium fluoride and the one in our water supply being hydrofluoric acid.

       There are mountains of evidence to link all of these people to the global shadow elite that control the worlds finances and politics.

       That is by design. It's just easier when you can blame one person for everything and then replace them with another scapegoat after 4-8 years. It's the people who we don't elect, that have all the money and power, who control things. They get to blame the revolving door of politicians for their evils and the politicians will happily take the blame for a price. It shouldn't be this way, but it is.

       They selected Obama because they knew about his past (we don't) and control him like they control many elected politicians, judges and others in positions of power - through blackmail and threats. The puppets gladly make a Faustian trade-off for wealth and the trappings of power, but know that they have sold their souls to some very dark forces.

       Very much worth noting.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things have become so standard for me that I rarely get upset by them any longer. In some ways I've become more accepting to the abuses than the average person if only because I expect them as where the average person find these things to be incredible and upsetting. They're confounded when they're lied to as where I say, "Yeah, and?"

       yup. spot on. our election cycles are too short to accomplish any long term good for society, but just long enough for people to think that the president is the one personally responsible for the current direction of the country. it's literally the perfect scapegoat.

       I remember George W. Bush saying, "History will look favorably towards me.", or some variation of that phrase. With an MSM like we have, how right he was. Obama will leave the oval office in the same way. That is the way our society works. We are impulsive. We hate things immediately and upon hours/days/months/years of reflection i.e. indoctrination, we come to love those same things. It is Stockholm Syndrome without so much the physical abuse as the mental manipulation/masturbation.

       But he's

       a good salesman. Practically no one, even his former followers or at least a very substantial chunk of them, don't believe a fucking word he says. He is saying the things that he is being told he should say, wagging his thumb with that librarian-type scholarly authority, but that doesn't mean shit when people know for a damn fact that that which you profess to be true is a complete lie.

       I have to say this is not only an American domestic problem. This is something that every citizen of the world should be engaged in before it is too late (maybe it already is).
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans have rights that 'foreigners' don't and NSA is working on a global scale. This means that while you might be able to protect some basic rights for Americans the rest of the world does not have such luck. The rest of the world is subjected to surveillance program of a scale that even stasi and kgb couldn't have imagined. And this information will be used by the US in diplomatic trades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, in any conflict in the world, the one party that can please the US (maybe access to oil fields, defence contracts etc) might gain access to data from NSA spying on their citizens. This is threatening the integrity of all citizens in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The  main problem is that the leaders of the world might be very happy with this situation. The leaders in my country are not allowed to do what the NSA is doing - buying the information from the US might be a solution around that problem.
