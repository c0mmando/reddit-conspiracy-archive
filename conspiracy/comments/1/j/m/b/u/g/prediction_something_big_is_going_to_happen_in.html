        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The US is closing embassies left and right and I am reading that the UK is closing it&#39;s embassy in Yemen and other places in fear of &quot;Al Qaida&quot; attacks.</p>

<p>I think they are planning something big, and unfortunately for me, I would wager that with a green light from the USA they are planning to remove the pro Morsy supporters from the streets here in Cairo; and I think they are planning to move them in bags. Which, is why the US And UK are clearing out their embassies in fear of retaliatory attacks on it&#39;s embassies.</p>

<p>Prediction: The internet, television and telephones will go out across the Middle East, then the US backed coup leaders of the Egyptian army will open fire on the pro-Morsy protesters citing some false-flag attack or something on the police or army to give them presidence to clear out the protesters using deadly force and make a big statement that the new dictator Sisi is here to stay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The largest reason why this should be concern is if they decide to allow nuclear attacks under the guise of rouge suitcase nukes and other &quot;soviet&quot; cold-war bullshit they purposely planted back during that time and then propagandized our minds with into oblivion.</p>

<p>Read the nuclear bible, like it&#39;s so blatant ( the nuclear terrorism theme ) it&#39;s the central theme of the largest game series out there ie Metal Gear and book series Tom Clancy and many movies like Tom Clancy&#39;s The Sum of All Fears.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been propagating the idea of terrorists using these devices ever since 9/11 as well, and have even been on record before that day on multiple occasions making remarks towards global nuclear proliferation and the potential for terrorists to use them as weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>They have been plotting these things for years, and they are up to a most insidious evil. And it&#39;s not like people haven&#39;t been warned because they&#39;ve been being warned for years upon years now.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that television is pure propaganda, mindless entertainment meant to reshape your views on humanity and how you behave in social situations. This is why the jersey shore is a show and honey boo boo and all that other garbage that it hurts to even talk about exists. It numbs the mind and turns you into a passive zombie that just believes whatever garbage is fed to it, gobbling it up like a fat hog that just loves raking his muck in the trough.</p>

<p>The only way that things like this can be prevented is if we share this information NOW with as many people as we can, so that we can convince them that this manufacture &quot;coming apocalypse&quot; doesn&#39;t have to happen if we don&#39;t allow it to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you heard about all the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50151706n">middle eastern prison breaks</a> <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/30/19760372-taliban-prison-break-militants-among-250-freed-by-pakistan-jail-attack?lite">here&#39;s another</a>.</p>

<p>If what we think is true then these prison breaks could very well be the reason for any sorts of attacks that could occur in these regions around the areas where these facilities are all located.</p>

<p>See how well scripted it all is? As if somebody has written it and it&#39;s being orchestrated onto those who are living in the world that has been pulled over their eyes to blind them from the truth?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to see through their contrived diatribe and their evil money schemes and all the other horrors they enact upon the world in collusion with each other.</p>

<p>But it can&#39;t be seen by the tv watchers, the grazers that are okay with a broken two party system, who are okay with electing one douche bag business man and banker after another, never realizing how that always leads to corruption even though it does almost every time, especially at the top where it happens just about every time.</p>

<p>Well I know this has been a &quot;long read&quot; ( yeah right ) but if you&#39;ve stuck with it then thank you for reading and good luck in your fight for the truth, share it with the world and make it know to them so that they can wake up and start living in the light rather than the darkness.</p>

<p>Hang on, isn&#39;t Morsy the US&#39;s boy? They were sure pissed when he was removed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean they &quot;acted&quot; pissed. Realize that they still refuse to admit that it was a coup. Now you got Kerry&#39;s lanky ass saying &quot;The Egyptian people wanted it the Army to overthrow it&#39;s fist ( And only ) democratically elected president after a SINGLE YEAR and we support that.&quot; How the fuck is that democracy? If the man (Morsy LITERALLY shat golden bricks for the entire time he was in office he couldn&#39;t have fixed 30 years of Mubarak&#39;s fuckups.</p>

<p>75% of Americans hate Obama does that mean if we take to the streets and ask the army nicely they will go in and </p>

<p>You see, this is what I thought was so confusing. Then I remembered that the US only keeps it&#39;s &quot;friends&quot; as long as it suits them then they casually throw them under the first bus they can find. </p>

<p>Remember, Saddam Hussain was a Personal friend of Donald Rumsfield and he invaded their country and had him hanged. </p>

<p>Morsy., I think he was the real deal. HE thought he could actually change things and get away with thumbing his nose at the US and her minions and they shut his ass down. I like the man, but he didn&#39;t do much to make it difficult for them to shut him down. His first actions in Egypt were to open the borders to Palestine and he was devising a new plan for the Suez canal. He also stopped shipping gas to Israel and went and spoke with the Iranians. It was clear he needed to go. I personally thought he would be killed. </p>

<p>What is scary is that the Egyptian people, while inbred and not very smart, have gotten a wiff of freedom and they realized with the overthrow of Mubarak that they actually have a lot more power than they thought so they will not give up easily. I know many, many people who are part of the Salafi party or Ikwan Muslameen who have said that they would die before giving up power to Americas new pet Sisi. So, unfortunately, the only way I see this turning out for Egypt is another Syria. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems pretty clear to me that Israel will have &quot;their war&quot; very soon.</p>

<p>I have a friend who works for a news agency who has been holed up in a hotel in Tel Aviv for nearly two years now. His company has a block of floors rented and access to the roof...in fact, they have a camera on the roof that&#39;s always on and transmitting to a web feed. Needless to say his agency (along with EVERY other major one) is preparing for incoming rockets--REAL rockets--not the (pretty much) bottle rockets that the IDF uses as an excuse to kill many, many Palestinians nearly every week or so.</p>

<p>And, of course, when our &quot;closest ally&quot; (who needs enemies with allies like Israel?) decides to shatter the delicate peace with the Iranians (who have shown <em>incredible</em> restraint in not preemptively taking Israel out) Israel could utterly care less...considering that US soldiers are going to be killed/injured at a rate of about 1000 to 1.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no wonder that America is the laughingstock of the entire modern world for her unwavering support of a terrorist apartheid state that learned their tactics from &quot;the best&quot;--the CIA and the Nazis.</p>

<p>Never have the words &quot;never again!&quot; rung so hollow.</p>
