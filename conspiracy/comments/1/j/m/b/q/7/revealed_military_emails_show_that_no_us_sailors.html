<p>Internal emails among U.S. military officers indicate that no American sailors watched Osama bin Laden&#39;s burial at sea from the USS Carl Vinson, and traditional Islamic procedures were followed during the secret ceremony.</p>

<p>The emails, obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act, are heavily blacked out, but are the first public disclosure of government information about the al-Qaida leader&#39;s death. The emails were released Wednesday by the Defense Department.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends. If indeed he had bad kidneys it should not have been hard to find someone who needed constant dialysis. That&#39;s hardly someone that would be able to evade a world wide man hunt. Many speculated that we knew exactly where he was the whole time and just didn&#39;t do anything. W in fact said that he &quot;Didn&#39;t really care about Bin Laden&quot; and implied it on many occasions. It was of course all about Saddam for a while.... until it wasn&#39;t. It&#39;s possible they just needed a boogie man. It&#39;s also possible he got kidney transplants but again it seems implausible for us to not have known about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It is true. Likely because the Bush Administration viewed an &quot;alive&quot; Osama Bin Laden as politically useful in propaganda terms. Also, because after Bush&#39;s first term was over he didn&#39;t need to whore for popularity. Obama was in the tail end of his first term and needed some way to get him into his second term ahead of Romney. Also, in May of 2011, the public was getting tired of all the obviously fake pictures and tapes. So, something &quot;new&quot; was needed in propaganda terms and so it was time for OBL to &quot;die&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First, Bush wasn&#39;t in need of popularity. The election was rigged in his favour. So, he was, in effect, &quot;chosen&quot; for the job as President. Second, that was only 7 or so years after the real OBL died, which meant the US Government could still get away with using his being&quot;alive&quot; as propaganda. But in 2011, the real OBL had been dead for almost 10 years and Obama was indeed needing popularity...any way he could get it. The public (with plenty of help from the Internet) finally got tired of all the clumsy and obvious fakes. So OBL was officially &quot;Killed&quot;.</p>

<p>Besides, Dick Cheney actually ran the White house. Bush wasn&#39;t smart enough to blow his own nose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still don&#39;t buy what ? That OBL died in 2001 ? Or that Bush wouldn&#39;t have &quot;captured&quot; OBL ? You seem to forget that OBL was &quot;political currency&quot;. As long as he was &quot;alive&quot; he could be used to justify the MIC (Military Industrial Complex) raping the economy. But that started to get stale. the timing was more of a coincidence from the Presidents (Bush and/or Obama) view point. Also, notice that after May 2, 2011, that is after OBL &quot;died&quot;, &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; suddenly became much more noticed by the corporate news, since they replaced OBL as the new &quot;bogey man&quot; that the MIC uses to rape the economy. This does all fit together. You just need to put the pieces in the right place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, thanks for the link. On the other hand, the SEAL team must be pised that they had to lug the corpse on the chopper, drop it in the hall, try to find its brains, and shoot them, then lug the rotting scattered remains to the ship, slide the festering putrid body parts to the railign, and heave them overboard while observing Muslim ritual.  They don&#39;t pay SEAL team members nearly enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UBL was a CIA asset. Nothing more. A stooge. Just think about all the &#39;videos&#39; that were leaked by al jazeera of him walking about in the mountains of afghanistan. That was all staged. Stock footage. Old footage. </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, the UBL raid never happened. Just like 9/11 was a sham, so too was the &#39;conclusion&#39; of finding UBL. It&#39;s one reason why you didn&#39;t hear much from Benazir Bhutto who was killed some days/weeks after an interview when she stated that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euK87Vr5B4U">UBL was killed by Omar Shekh</a> </p>

<p>The truth is that the people in power of this planet are not who you think they are. They are deeply religious in their Luciferian beliefs, and will do anything they can to promote their NWO. Their vision of their New World Order is in their movies (Hunger Games, Elysium). </p>
