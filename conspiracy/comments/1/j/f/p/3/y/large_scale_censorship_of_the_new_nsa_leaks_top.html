       Top post gets momentum in r/all. Is removed because the title did not come directly from the article. The mods keep some of the lesser momentum posts that

        <em>
         DO NOT
        </em>
       </strong>
       directly quote the article. Later a submission uses the Guardian title and gets twice the upvotes in half the time of the other guardian post on the page. It is removed for being a repost.

       The reason given in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is that the posts have editorialized titles. To be fair, it does look like a couple of the submissions are somewhat objectively in violation of the rule, as they contain commentary and other opinions not actually stated in the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       This story absolutely needs to be on the front page, so whoever wants to post it again needs to follow
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the rules of the subreddit when they do. It would be a tragedy for this to miss out on a great deal of exposure due to silly rule violations.

       There is a link there now that doesn't violate any rules so lets see how it does.

       I am frustrated first off that they define 'editorializing' as any text that isn't a direct quote from the article, and second how obvious it is that they are selectively enforcing it, as evidence by the front page of the subreddit.

       They really are complete morons on r/politics and I've told them there are many people who believe they moderate with a bias to their own political views and selectively enforce rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently I had this thread removed:
       <br/>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1j3axr/after_being_jailed_in_yemen_for_three_years_at/">
        After being jailed in Yemen for three years at the personal request of Obama, journalist Abdulelah Haider Shaye who helped expose a U.S. cruise missile attack on the Yemeni village of al-Majalah which killed 41 people, including 14 women and 21 children in December 2009, has been released.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I wrote to them and once again explained what an editorialized title means. It means inserting your opinion into a title. My title didn't do that. I changed the title because the original gave the impression that Obama called for his release, not his imprisonment. I summarised the report which is what a title is supposed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOPE, they weren't having it. They took issue with the word 'personally' even though Obama did personally telephone the Yemini president and ask him to keep the journalist in jail. Nope, 'personally' isn't mentioned in the article so they wouldn't approve it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I then asked if I could use the first sentence from the report:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prominent Yemeni journalist Abdulelah Haider Shaye has been released from prison after being held for three years on terrorism-related charges at the request of President Obama. Shaye helped expose the U.S. cruise missile attack on the Yemeni village of al-Majalah that killed 41 people, including 14 women and 21 children in December 2009. Then-Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh announced his intention to pardon Shaye in 2011, but apparently changed his mind after a phone call from Obama.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes that would be fine they said.
       <br/>
       Now what is the difference between by title and the first sentence? There isn't any. Only I summarised it.

       This would not be the first time r/politics mods deleted a post that was gaining momentum.  In fact, it's been their stock in trade....hence their removal from the default list of subreddits.  That said, the other subs following suit is somewhat troubling.  It does not bode well for the future of this site.

       if anyone for a second believes that the MSM has no control over those "news" subreddits are myopic.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~6% American adults use reddit. that's 6% revenue for any of those MSM conglomerates. of course they're going to do their best to manipulate the subreddits. what we need is this subreddit to be more popular but with the title /conspiracy as it is, it all gives us a negative image due to the connotation of the word "conspiracy."

         Splintering (Multiple posts on

          Xkeyscore
         </a>
         )  This has the effect of slowing down momentum of a story. I thought if you tried to post a link that had already been posted, you couldn't do it.  I see 15 posts of the guardian site.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

         Ghosting/shadowbanning- I made a political post the other day in

         and the post is only available if you click on it and not if you search.  Of course, nobody can click on it because they can't see it.

         Removal of politics from defaults.  This has the effect of containing outrage to those already exposed to it.
        </p>
       </li>

      <p>
       These 3 methods alone are effective at quelling debate.  Does reddit have a responsibility to provide a platform for debate?

       I seem to remember a post here about how the mods remove the Guardian articles and favour the Washington Post ones. I think I remember if being the mods of
       <a href="/r/restorethefourth">

       and one of the news subs being the same people.

       is not for news with a particular relevance to the United States. It may not be what you wish to see, and you may find it to be relevant to the entire world (I can certainly see that argument), but that's probably why that happened.

       <a href="/r/news">

       threads were simply removed for having a shitty source; the Guardian source was left untouched.

      <p>
       In addition, not all of the posts listed here as censored are censored for me. Meaning I can't only access them, but they show up on the front page as well.

       Whereas on politics they kept the business insider version and torched the Guardian one.

       Naturally the Guardian version is what people need to see.

       Yes, I noticed there was one such subreddit. Shit decision. BI is nothing but a reblogging bunch of cunts.

       Actually, checking just now, I'm seeing the Guardian all over
       <a href="/r/politics">

       , and

       BI NSA story right now. Don't know if it changed, or if I'm talking about another subreddit. Still, I fully agree with you.

       Reblogging is harmful and needs to be stopped. It dilutes the facts and restricts access to others.

       Then the moderation isn't perfect. The custom CSS even warns against US news at the top of the page.

      <ul>
       <li>

         Marked as having an editorialized title

       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="/r/technology">
          /r/technology
         </a>
         submission had an editorialized title, and may not be on-topic for the sub (though that's debatable)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Not censored

       If censorship is going to be claimed, at least try to follow the rules.

      <p>
       Mind you, I'm not saying moderation isn't suspicious sometimes, but if you don't follow the rules it's as though you're trying to make things seem more suspicious than they are.

       The politics and tech threads that were removed because of 'editorialized titles' had the title '"NSA using top-secret program to mine online data of millions of Americans". How is that editorialized in any way? It is an accurate representation of XKeyscore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Editorialized title is the reason they removed it but it doesnt mean its legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which one was not actually censored? I posted 4 from
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       which has a bot record deleted threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as r/worldnews, use the search function for PRISM or Snowden and find dozens and dozens of threads with thousands of upvotes. It is a clear case of selective enforcement, as is the issue with r/politics. r/worldnews prohibits us-internal news but stories like this and prism are clear us-external news

       The meaning that 'editorialized title' has on Reddit for many subreddits means 'anything but the original title'. It's a restrictive interpretation, sure, and some subreddits at least allow one to use quotes from the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't personally agree with it, but those are the rules in those subs. If you don't play by them, you don't get to cry 'censorship'. If you have a problem with the rules,
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       what you should be fighting instead.

      <p>
       And that, I'm not denying. Most subreddits seem to have shitty moderation, even unsubscribing from all the defaults doesn't really fix that.

       That's alright, it may just have been one downvote. I don't really post here, these may be my first comments here, so I'm sure Reddit's algo's are extra skeptical regarding me. I recently found that I could still comment in subs other than one I happened to be downvoted in.

       Un-deletion indeed is something I can't rule out. Not sure whyit would have been: even a moderator entered that thread to give his kudos to the OP for submitting the original. Confusing, no?
