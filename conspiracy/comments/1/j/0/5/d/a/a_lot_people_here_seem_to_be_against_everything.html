Almost all of these current problems can be traced back to our fake representatives declaring themselves above the constitution... All economic problems and most of the military industrial complex can be blamed on the unconstitutional counterfeiting of currency done by the private Federal Reserve. Spying, TSA are violations of the 4th amendment. ......and so on...Tyrant=an absolute ruler unrestrained by law or constitution</p>

<p>If you remove the aspects of work, money, and labor, I think, daily, increasing amounts of people would volunteer their time and brains to help a project they have expertise in. There is little left of an average &quot;first world&quot; person&#39;s day, once you remove the money/work/slave part of life. The technology exists to remove these hardships from everyone on earth, while still being able to provide essentially any goods to them at the same time. </p>

Removing that influence might take more pain than people are willing to take upon themselves without being forced into it. Until more people see it and vote against it en mass with clear directives for the new representatives then it will simply get to the point where either they have no power against that which stands against them, other than death itself, or they will have been placated and distracted into apathy and compliance. So in short... more people need to become aware. Until they are willing to look into the uncomfortable mirror there is little help. </p>

<p>Right now the whole desire to defund the NSA go me thinking: why should people have to wait and lobby representatives to defund something (or fund something for that matter).

<p>Why not have the same for taxation? So that people can say at the time of paying taxes what they want to fund (NASA and schools) vs (drones and NSA). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just looking through some of the previous comments I see some people talking about rule of law, the constitution, and even types of anarchy. </p>

<p>Personally I&#39;d like people to think a little more outside the box.  As much as some may say that the constitution limits government, it also gives it it&#39;s authority. The rule of law has very little to do with freedom, but more for laws to be enforced equally. But do laws really make people free? </p>

<p>I&#39;m here to tell people that they are free. Even those that choose to love their masters are free to do so.   Because freedom is a natural right.   It can&#39;t be given to you by a constitution or a government. The very fact that you can think for yourself gives you freedom. </p>

<p>It&#39;s true that corporations, cartels, governments, secret ops, and distractions have shackled many people. Even a slave can be free, as long as he chooses to rebel, to strive for something different. </p>

<p>Debt, laws, and violence are tools used to suppress people. If people were not naturally free, why they need to actively work to keep people suppressed. </p>

<p>My vision for a great future doesn&#39;t require you to want the same things I want.  I want every man woman and child to understand that they are free. Being free, they can choose to resist the system that leads us to hate each other. </p>

<p>Edit: some formatting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all starts with money and banking. If you free the market from the forces of bankers who are looking to basically extort your money, you will have a more free and just society. From there, there won&#39;t need to be as much legislation, because most crime comes out of poverty. </p>

<p>People, and I mean all of you r/conspiracy as well, need to go read books about economics. That was what broke the camel&#39;s back in the Revolutionary times, because the leaders knew how they were being fucked economically. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading Ezra Pound&#39;s economic writings, some of which are available as downloadable pdf&#39;s on <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/10/ezra-pounds-writings-on-economics/">this</a> website. They&#39;re somewhat confusing, but he gets down to the root of why usury is a cancer to the world and how the USA was highjacked from the very beginning by the merchant class. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an anarcho capitalist, personally, and while I understand the problems with that system, I think it&#39;s better than anything else out there. I&#39;ve been leaning towards a sort of local socialism too, because I think it works on small levels, but I think anarcho capitalism works towards that end when you have a just government that breaks up monopolies, balances its budget, and generally punishes collusion. </p>

We&#39;re <strong>not</strong> for being held back.

The federal reserve is destroying our economy due to massive amounts of corruption, which <strong>is bad</strong>. GMOs have not been fully tested in order to look out for the consumer&#39;s safety which <strong>is dangerous</strong>. Not to mention, it has been found that these GMOs <strong>cause tumors</strong> in lab rat studies. Facebook has become a government agency by collecting large amounts of citizen data that <em>can</em> ultimately be used against you. It is obviously up to the user, as to what is shared, but the service has <strong>malicious potential</strong> so we <strong>warn</strong> people. RFID technology has many practical uses, but is often implemented in poor environments such as credit cards and passports which <strong>lack proper privacy concerns.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i was actually thinking a bit differently:</p>

<p>Right now the whole desire to defund the NSA go me thinking: why should people have to wait and lobby representatives to defund something (or fund something for that matter). When you donate to a university you can designate money to &quot;financial aid&quot; or &quot;baseball fields&quot;. Universities tend to follow those guidelines.</p>

<p>Why not have the same for taxation? So that people can say at the time of paying taxes what they want to fund (NASA and schools) vs (drones and NSA). </p>
