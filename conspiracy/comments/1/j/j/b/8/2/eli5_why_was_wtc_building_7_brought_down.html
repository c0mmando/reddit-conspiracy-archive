That having been said, a drive in me was realized recently, to look behind the curtain, at this country&#39;s real history, ruling powers, motives, and end goals, and this subreddit has been instrumental in helping me in this mission. You all turned me on to the fact that 9/11 involved a controlled demolition of three buildings in NYC, that media outlets (BBC, and God knows who else) apparently had prior knowledge of. But what I cannot grasp is WHY that last building, WTC7, was brought down. My only theory is a half-baked one at that: The twin towers were distractions from the main objective, in the eyes of those responsible, and that WTC 7 housed something that these people must really have wanted destroyed, like financial documents or something, but what would have made them want to go to all of that trouble?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes a lot of sense, too. Wow. So many good ideas, could it possibly be all of them? Seriously, they all have logic behind &#39;em, but a common theme I am seeing is that it was rigged to fall because it was supposed to be hit by 93, but, like I said, I thought I had been told that 93&#39;s intended target was the WH. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The three buildings that went down on 9/11 had all been pre-wired for demolition. Flight 93 went off script and they pulled WTC 7 later in the day, betting on Mencken&#39;s rule that no one ever lost anything underestimating the intelligence of the American public.</p>

<p>BTW, good on you for looking at this now while you&#39;re still young enough to have the time and inclination to do so. What matters most to me isn&#39;t that people believe me or disbelieve the &quot;official&quot; story but that people look at the best evidence of 9/11/2001 for themselves and form their own opinions on the matter. </p>

<p>That&#39;s largely why I made sure to mention that I&#39;m not saying that it was intentionally brought down. It&#39;s quite likely that it was not. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Could you point to any of these buildings that escaped unscathed? Building 3 (hotel which sat between the twin towers) was completely destroyed, building 5 (8-story building between the towers and building 7) was very badly damaged... Heck there was even a building across the street from building 7, which is not part of the WTC complex, which was damaged by building 7&#39;s fall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha, thanks. And fair enough, on all of those buildings, I just googled to see if all of those really did sustain that type of damage, and they did, I just had read before that closer buildings were not destroyed, and took the writer&#39;s word for it; my bad. Only question, i guess, that remains, is that of the free fall of the building. What do you think explains that (again, maybe, I&#39;m misinformed on this too, as I&#39;m not an architect, and couldn&#39;t visually tell a free fall from anything else, but a lot of more informed people have called it a free-fall, consistent with controlled demolition.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610">final NIST report</a>(PDF, 5mb) admitted that Building 7 fell at freefall acceleration for 2.25 seconds. This was after their earlier drafts claimed that it did not. They had to finally change it due to the 9/11 truth movement&#39;s complaints to NIST which proved mathematically that it did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for letting me know about him. I appreciate the warning. Also, thanks for linking to the report, and wow, freefall acceleration for 2.25 seconds. And even after admitting that, the NIST still claims it was a fire? Again,I&#39;m only 16 and barely passed chem, but doesn&#39;t steel have a WAY higher melting point than any normal building could produce, PLUS the stuff they use to make buildings is heat treated on top of that, right? I&#39;m just saying that the NIST is hiding behind quite the thin cover story if a 16 year old knows its not a plausible explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to find the pictures for you later, but basically it only looked like a freefall from one camera angle and that&#39;s the one everyone posts.

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, that&#39;s what I&#39;d heard, and thought, and all, so I think we can establish controlled demolition as a fact of the matter, especially given that the NIST revised its report to concede that there was indeed that freefall, but then that leads to the question; who rigged it for controlled demolition? Obviously not Al-Quaeda, I&#39;m smart enough to knw they don&#39;t have the assets to do that, plus, if they had, they wouldn&#39;t have waited 8 hours to blow it. I think that wait time is more consistent with conspirators scrambling around wondering what to do now that 93 crashed in PA, and they had no scapegoat for their demo job on the building, and so waited around until some higher-up gave the go ahead to blow it anyways, thinking no one would notice because no one died. But as with everything I assert, I am fully aware that that could be a a stupid notion, its just what i&#39;ve come up with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who rigged it? To answer that question, you need to look at who benefits.</p>

<p>The PNAC document gives a good indication, as does the fact that COG emergency shadow government with it&#39;s patriot act and homeland security was forced on the country - with some help from another attack - Anthrax.  Then afghanistan and iraq, and libya, now syria, also egypt and probably iran eventually.</p>

<p>Whoever it is are behaving like psychopathic criminals, and won&#39;t stop.   I look to connections going back to pre WWII, the business plot, nazi support, operation paperclip etc..  maybe they think what they are doing is noble and good, but I don&#39;t ascribe to the ends justifying the means.</p>

<p>The only way to know for sure is appoint a special prosecutor, and lean on the lower downs until they give up the higher ups.  The gov&#39;t has all kinds of torture and rendition procedures that might help in that effect.</p>

<p>Bush and Cheney testifying together not under oath?  Not on my watch.  I&#39;d have start with demolition companies and go from there.</p>

<p>But honestly I don&#39;t expect a criminal organization to investigate and prosecute themselves..  I just hope they finish whatever they think are doing as quickly and as painlessly as possible.</p>

<p>They should know that every action has a reaction, and that the observer also becomes part of the experiment.   This is concerning.  Evolution-wise, it&#39;s suicide.</p>

So ok, the shadow govt. benefited from this, in that their FEMA-run martial law doppleganger to our current system was made a plausible reality because of it, defense contractors, like ENRON, as someone mentioned above, also won because this started a seemingly irreversible precedent of loosely justified military interventions in the Middle East, so they could both have orchestrated it, that makes a lot of sense to me. And you are right that we brought over some , messed up Nazi war crimin..err.. I mean uh &#39;scientists&#39;, through Operation Paperclip, and while I had never put two and two together, and thought that those same characters could have been what set in motion the whole Psy Ops deal, false flag attacks and all, which, of course, would tie them right in to 9/11.

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t, though. parts of it may have, but not the whole thing. In any case, the explosives used in controlled demolitions are loud and numerous. I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t recall hearing loud numerous bangs in any video footage from the area at any point immediately before the collapse. I&#39;ve heard people claim they heard one or two bangs, but that&#39;s still a far cry from what you hear in controlled demolitions...</p>

<p>The measurement of freefall acceleration follows the roofline down.   Don&#39;t tell me that the building underneath fell away, and then the entire facade fell at free fall acceleration.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the same mistake the NIST model tries to pass off as science.   The internal structure falls away, and the rest of the building is not attached?   The model does not come close to what we see from ALL available video angles.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.   why didn&#39;t anyone even test for explosives?   besides the entire area was evacuated by then, and who was around to hear the explosions?</p>

<p>the case is clear, scientifically, global straight down free fall acceleration - as was observed - can not occur due to fire damage.</p>

<p>This type of collapse has never and never will happen to a steel frame skyscraper.   The dust clouds should also concern you.  Look how much energy went into pulverizing the building.   I&#39;d like to see an energy balance equation showing where this enormous energy came from.. gravity?  LMAO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are various schools of thought on this but it&#39;s unlikely we&#39;ll ever know for sure.</p>

<p>Some say it&#39;s because WTC7 was the control center for the op. Some say Flight 93 was intended to hit 7 after 1 &amp; 2 came down. Some say it&#39;s because of the ENRON investigation which was housed in 7. It actually could be all three of those reasons. And more.</p>

<p>Just keep doing your own research and question everything. Also watch very carefully for any of these:<a href="http://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">The Gentleperson&#39;s Guide To Forum Spies</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? The ENRON thing is PARTICULARLY interesting, I had never heard of that, do you have a link so I can read more on that? And about 93, I thought that plane was intended to hit the White House. And center for the op? Pardon the Naive reference, but taking it out for that reason reminds me of the opening scenes of Dark Knight, where the henchmen all systematically shoot each other to tie up loose ends.</p>

<p>Of course nobody knows for sure. But that&#39;s what the supporters of the official conspiracy theory claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And center for the op?</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/project.jsp?project=911_project">timelines</a> for the 4 flights that morning and you&#39;ll see how Flight 93 could well have been intended to hit Building 7 after the towers had been demolished and after it had been evacuated.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, yeah, it does look like 93 was aimed at building 7, not the WH, I know I heard one plane was intended to hit it, and I just assumed that, because the WH didn&#39;t get hit, it was flight 93, but that&#39;s my mistake in that assumption; thank you for the correction. Wow, tie up loose ends, that is scary, and as much as i don&#39;t want to believe you because of the implications of that answer, its the most plausible I&#39;ve read so far. Again, thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha, thanks. And fair enough, on all of those buildings, I just googled to see if all of those really did sustain that type of damage, and they did, I just had read before that closer buildings were not destroyed, and took the writer&#39;s word for it; my bad. Only question, i guess, that remains, is that of the free fall of the building. What do you think explains that (again, maybe, I&#39;m misinformed on this too, as I&#39;m not an architect, and couldn&#39;t visually tell a free fall from anything else, but a lot of more informed people have called it a free-fall, consistent with controlled demolition.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for letting me know about him. I appreciate the warning. Also, thanks for linking to the report, and wow, freefall acceleration for 2.25 seconds. And even after admitting that, the NIST still claims it was a fire? Again,I&#39;m only 16 and barely passed chem, but doesn&#39;t steel have a WAY higher melting point than any normal building could produce, PLUS the stuff they use to make buildings is heat treated on top of that, right? I&#39;m just saying that the NIST is hiding behind quite the thin cover story if a 16 year old knows its not a plausible explanation.</p>
