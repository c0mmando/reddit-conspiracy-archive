    <div class="md"><p>Man, I mean, you&#39;re speculation is very good actually.  Most people don&#39;t even know there is such a thing as Night of Power.   Also the Muslim calendar is very confusing, especially since it is lunar, so there&#39;s always some speculation.</p>

<p>You know when they know it is Eid because some scholars in Saudi have to wait and see the moon first, and see if the month is truly over.  So people make travel plans and so on but sometimes the day is delayed because the moon isn&#39;t yet finished.  Of course they can do this now with predictions and stuff, but they still arrange it in the old-school way where the ones in Mecca (I think) tell the rest of the Muslims that it is time to eat and be merry.  </p>

<p>Also to demystify Ramadan a bit, the key thing about Ramadan is 1) everyone is lazy because they are fasting and 2) there are always big time shows that come out during Ramadan.</p>

<p>It would be like if there was one month during which game of thrones, the wire, and (insert cool show here) all came out and played every day.  So everyone is watching their TVs with the family and chilling and eating with friends all month.  And no one really works or expects anything, because when youre fasting you can only work from 9 am to about 2 pm.  So all works clsoe early and people just sleep or watch or chat in the afternoon waiting for the breakfast. It&#39;s actually cool.</p>

<p>But if you put yourself in their shoes, it doesn&#39;t make sense that they&#39;d be all &quot;ooh I&#39;m gonna do something horrible right now&quot; mood.  It&#39;s like Christmas but for a whole month.  It&#39;s meant to be a peaceful time.  But of course all the symbols get turned upside down and used against people, so now Ramadan and Eid, which are celebrations of inner strength and deference and patience ( or at least of family and being together), turn into orgies of violence in the minds of people.   And then everyone believes that Muslims have these evil violent holidays, when actually they are just chilling and watching TV with the family.</p>

Looks like &quot;an expert&quot; mistook a video i submitted of an arms depot exploding, as a nuke. They quickly removed the article.</p>

<p>From the testimony I&#39;ve seen out of Syria over the past few days, what we really need to be worrying about are the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epKxWN5q-18">vacuum bombs</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou1pb-ZcmDU">barrel bombs</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, but what i get is that the night of power/destiny is supposed to be big, and that it falls on an odd number, so the 7th is more likely than the 8th. Abreu reported that the attack was likely on the 5th or the 7th, when everyone was saying that it was going to be the 4th, so I&#39;m inclined to go with the 7th.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude are they saying in the us that Lailat al Qadr (night of power) is tonight?</p>

<p>That&#39;s strange man.  Most people already celebrated it on Sunday.  Lailat al Qadr is the night that the Quran came down to prophet and he rode to heaven to visit all the other prophets.  This is the story of how the Quran happened.</p>

<p>Anyway no one knows the exact date but usually it is the night of 27 Ramadan.  Different people do it different.  By now Ramadan is ending, and were going into eid, which is the feast at end of Ramadan.  So usually people wouldn&#39;t say that Lailat al Qadr is happening now.</p>

<p>Anyway I said this in another thread, but I don&#39;t know why people think Muslims are going to be violent during eid.  Eid is a time to watch tv, eat a shit ton of food and pass out form food coma.</p>

So all works clsoe early and people just sleep or watch or chat in the afternoon waiting for the breakfast. It&#39;s actually cool.</p>

<p>But if you put yourself in their shoes, it doesn&#39;t make sense that they&#39;d be all &quot;ooh I&#39;m gonna do something horrible right now&quot; mood.  It&#39;s like Christmas but for a whole month.  It&#39;s meant to be a peaceful time.  But of course all the symbols get turned upside down and used against people, so now Ramadan and Eid, which are celebrations of inner strength and deference and patience ( or at least of family and being together), turn into orgies of violence in the minds of people.   And then everyone believes that Muslims have these evil violent holidays, when actually they are just chilling and watching TV with the family.</p>
