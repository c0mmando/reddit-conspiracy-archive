       Almost everyone can do a passable job of quoting their favorite amendment but I rarely hear anyone quote what for me is the most important paragraph. The context and reason all the amendments were written.
      </p>
      <p>
       "THE Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution."
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Bill of Rights contains the terms and conditions upon which States will trust and be loyal to the Government defined in our Constitution. In its absence, or when these terms and conditions are violated, there is no obligation of trust or loyalty to the Government. The Bill of Rights is a list of deal breakers.

       I still think the Bill of Rights was a mistake. For the sake of this argument I will accept the premise that rights exist and are "naturally endowed."
      </p>
      <p>
       James Madison:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "It has been objected also against a Bill of Rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Everything you need to know about what you can do is already described in the preamble to the Constitution that defines the Constitution's purpose: to secure "the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity." What is liberty? The ability to control one's own actions. Any action against someone that infringes his ability to control his actions or his person creates a victim and is an injustice. This means attacking someone, killing someone, stealing someone's private property are infringements of liberty and are true injustices.
       <em>
        To that end, anything that avoids those harmful actions, is within your rights to do to/for yourself.
       </em>
       The definition of liberty is that you essentially have rights approaching infinity, as long as they don't limit the ability of someone else to control himself in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mistake of the Bill of Rights is that it begins to enumerate rights. Alexander Hamilton:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "[B]ills of rights . . . are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous. For why declare that things shall not be done [by Congress] which there is no power to do? Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given [to Congress] by which restrictions may be imposed?" Hamilton's argument was that Congress can only do what the Constitution specifically gives it authority to do. Powers not granted belong to the people and the states. Another way of putting Hamilton's concern: why have an amendment prohibiting Congress from infringing on our right to play hopscotch when the Constitution gives Congress no authority to infringe upon our hopscotch rights in the first place. - Walter E. Williams
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This makes the Ninth Amendment IMO the most powerful part of the Bill of Rights. We can see how scared the writers were by enumeration that they felt the need to reiterate this.
       <strong>
        "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
       </strong>
       Unfortunately it always is, by minds that don't understand the definition of liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       An expectation of privacy is a personal right that infringes no one's liberty, but how many times do we hear the argument "Privacy isn't listed in the Constitution./ Privacy isn't a right." All of Hamilton's fears are coming to fruition in the current Zeitgeist of covert and lawless government that grants itself powers for security that are never listed in, or dubiously construed from, the Constitution (Example for my point, the DHS's justifications for everything they do are redacted and not describable to the public. It's because they're illegitimate.) If people understood liberty and gave up their fear-driven need to control the behaviors of others and penchant for slippery slope fallacies we would have a fraction of the problems we are having.

       Wasn't Hamilton in favor of a central bank? Isn't debt-laden currency one of the things that lead to corpraticricy? Maybe I'm wrong.

       It is the job of each State to protect its citizens. Many state constitutions have an article detailing the "right to rebel" against a tyrannical government. When that fails, we have to rely on that "well regulated militia" thing we are entitled to.

       Great question. Your question comes down to the legitimacy of the "Social Contract." In some people's opinions, it's no different than the monarchs who used to say "My rule is granted by God!" The Constitution was set up by the upper class (lawyers, businessmen, doctors) to be ruled in perpetuity by the upper class (half Congress is millionaires - the starting pay is $174k.) Some argue the claim that set up the Constitution, the belief in a social contract, is no more legitimate than the divine rights of kings. How is anyone else more fit to represent the actions of an individual than that individual himself? Does the Constitution betray its goal?

       Yes. The Federal government however, appears to have taken up the challenge of making sure that the Bill of Rights is an exhausted list of irrelevant and antiquated ideas with regards to national security.

       Furthermore, they have planted the seeds within the political world that moving against those that pay you is a career ending move. Not many representatives are willing to make that sacrifice and instead, choose to perpetuate the corruption.

       The Constitution itself was written to give taxing power to the central government, a power that was lacking in the Articles of Confederation. As Americans, we need to get away from the fetish for a "contract" between dead men that lived 10 generations ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the conditions of today, the Constitution either helped facilitate the current Police State or it has no power to do anything about it. Why do we keep backing up an old model that obviously doesn't work?

        "The defects of the Confederation were many; but they may all be summed up in one phrase: The real power was vested in the several states, and Congress had no power to enforce its laws. Congress could resolve, but it could not execute; it could ask the states to pay taxes, to furnish troops, to conform to treaties, to do justice to each other's citizens, but it could not command them."
