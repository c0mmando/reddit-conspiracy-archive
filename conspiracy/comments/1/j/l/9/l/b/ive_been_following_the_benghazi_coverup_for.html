       In the wake of the

      </p>
      <p>
       The thorn in their side was

        It Gets Ugly
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       In the summer of 2012, a
       <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syria-says-it-will-observe-un-cease-fire-on-thursday/2012/04/11/gIQAx9AGBT_story.html">
        series of ceasefires failed in Syria
       </a>
       . People went into the streets, they were beaten back by the regime. Occasional bombings and assassinations mixed it up. Up until this point, the Syrian crisis was a problem of a brutal government cracking down on generally peaceful (at first) protesters. Very Arab Spring-y, maybe even pluralist and liberal. But, the people hadn't begun to fight back
       <em>
        en masse
       </em>
       against their government yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Syria, long a thorn in the side of the US, NATO, the Gulf and Israel, the only steadfast ally of Iran was ready to fall, if only someone could be found to do the dirty work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in Libya in summer 2012, the
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/06/world/africa/libya-violence">
        violence was getting worse
       </a>
       and it began to look like stopping
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/al-qaeda-flags-parade-gadhafi-hometown/story?id=16004407">
        AQIM from flying al Qaeda flags in Benghazi

        Muslim Brotherhood from gaining political power
       </a>
       might not be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, the story gets hazy. This is my theory and some evidence:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Americans came up with a plan to transfer their problem in Libya to Syria, where it would be Assad's problem.

       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          The Annex in Benghazi served as a launching point for buying back the weapons they had 'donated' to topple Qaddafi, and maybe even facilitating the movement of fighters from Libya, through Turkey to Syria.

Be it the transfer of weapons from militants in Libya to Syria, the support of militants who would volunteer to go to Syria, or the purchase of weapons from militants in Libya. They are reportedly threatening peoples' families and giving monthly polygraph exams to ensure no one talks (this is toward the bottom of the CNN article linked in link 1).

       is crazy talk, but this is now the only place on reddit where people seem to actually want to try to put the pieces together and figure things out.

       I appreciate what you have done here, but I must apologize as I take issue with Gaddafi being called a dictator. Gaddafi had not held the position of prime minister since shortly after the peaceful coup in '69. Additionally the cult of personality around Gaddafi was because he was idolized among many Libyans due to the prosperity and progress he helped facilitate.
      </p>
      <p>
       His contribution so important and impactful that he helped Libya emerge in just four decades from being the poorest nation in the world ruled under monarchy, to being the most prosperous and progressive nation in Africa and the Middle East. He was doomed by the love of many Libyans to live out his life in the spotlight. Gaddafi was merely a statesman and adviser to the system of direct democracy known as 'Jamahiriya' that he helped create. He was so loved for what he had done that they honored his contribution by calling him the 'brother leader'.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for any supposed atrocities committed by the Libyan government one must consider a couple important facts. First, the Libyan government was highly decentralized. This was done by design as everything in Libya was decided upon through a system of citizens councils implementing direct democracy. Two, unfortunately this also meant that radical elements in Libya were able to have their own sick backwards Sharia governments. But the system worked, because the majority of Libya lived in a very progressive society that valued civil liberties for women, high literacy rates, and high standards of living thanks to Socialism. Gaddafi worked his whole life trying to integrate the ungrateful backwards radical Islamists into the twenty-first century and with the rest of Libya.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, we must realize that some period of readjustment was required after the bloodless coup of '69. Such readjustment is never peaceful, unfortunately. You can't take what was the poorest nation in Africa at the time (which was also ruled by a monarchy) and expect a perfect thriving economic powerhouse and democracy to emerge instantaneously. It's not going to happen, some eggs are going to be broken. Old habits die hard as they say. I doubt anyone (or any government in this case) has done everything perfect in their first attempt. Keep in mind that Libya did go on to be the most prosperous and progressive nation in Africa, (at least the parts not controlled by violent radical Islamists).
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering that! The rate of advancement, and limited number of human rights violations that did occur is a commendable and an astonishing feat when one sees the end product of their pursuit of democracy (pre 2011 revolution that is).
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted this many months ago right after Hillary resigned (because she was so sick, give me a break) to avoid having to testify on Benghazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       "During the Libyan intervention, the US and NATO backed Islamic Jihadi radicals to topple the people's Jamahiriya government of Libya. The radical rebels were largely based in Benghazi, it is/was essentially a stronghold of radical Islamist sentiment in Libya.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately for the Jihadists the uprising didn't quite work out in their favor as the majority of Libya has for four decades enjoyed a decentralized system of socialist direct democracy, therefore making it difficult for the radicals to establish a strong central authoritarian government based on strict Sharia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US and NATO had been funding, giving intelligence, weapons, logistical and tactical support to the rebels. Their contact was Ambassador Stevens, a CIA asset. The motive for attacking the consulate and killing of Stevens is open to speculation. Unfortunately, we may not find out the truth for some time because at the moment the issue is incredibly divisive and polarizing, as it is seen as a senseless conservative/republican attack on the Obama admin to question what happened. (Given the ties of republicans/neo-conservatives to the CIA I doubt they are interested in exposing the truth behind the event and are only using it as an excuse to bash Obama, even though there is some legitimate blame to be placed on the admin for backing Islamic terrorists in the Libyan conflict.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My best guess is that the attacks were revenge for failing to offer further support in helping the rebels establish an Islamic dictatorship in Libya."
      </p>
      <p>
       Some additional sources of interest implicating a connection of Washington to Libyan jihadis.

       I'm however still not entirely convinced about the Benghazi-Syria connection. Much of it is based on conjecture (as you claimed), but if it is true, then it would show a much more centralised "Al-Qaeda", as opposed to randomly dispersed fundamentalist Muslim groups.
