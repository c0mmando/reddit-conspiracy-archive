       Seriously, a full blown revolution. WITHOUT the fighting, and other horrible atrocities like we're seeing in the middle east. In the US, EU, EVERYWHERE, we need a total turnover. Society needs a fresh start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the state of the government in the US. Corporations, lobbyists, senators, all in a big buddy group of rich people who screw over the general populations. Every aspect of our society is corrupt. And everyone knows this! Why don't we do anything?! It's just become general knowledge. Like:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hey, the government can see everything you do!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Isn't that illegal?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Try telling that to them."
      </p>
      <p>
       "oh well, whatever. Hey check out these sweet pics of my new grow op!"
      </p>
      <p>
       No one cares. I know you care. Everyone really cares, but because you've got everything you need to live comfortably why should you do anything? People have been saying this for YEARS! George Carlin. Out of all his famous rants, the millions of views, and not a single thing has been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       idk reddit.. Maybe I'm just getting angsty, but this severely bothers me. Why should we live in a world so short sighted and power/money hungry?
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to change the world. I know you all want to too. How can we do this? Just ordinary people.
      </p>
      <p>

       The rev is happening right now.  Its been happening for months now.  Its moving very, very slowly...and thats a good thing because there needs to be a consensus of what will be kept and what will be replaced once the exsisting structure crumbles.  It makes no sense to replace leadership of a fucked up system, because it still wont run right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The angst you feel is because its not happening fast enough for you.  You want it to happen and be over tomorrow.  Get that out of your head.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have explained it before as having to move a mountain...and as you can imagine, a mountain doesnt get moved overnight.  Each of us has to do our part.  That may seem daunting but its not.  Its as simple as picking up a handful of pebbles and moving it out of the way.  Day by day take your pebble.  Stop supporting megacorp.  Drop your cable, move your money to a credit union and away from a bank.  Pay up front for any purchase you make.  Any way you can think to keep your money away from megacorp...do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plant some seeds in candidates you want to help in the quest.  No arm twisting, no hammering, just simple suggestions.  People who are capable will awaken themselves with the right suggestions eventually.  10-15% of Americans is all it will take.  Probably less.  Recognize not all people will come to terms with what needs to happen until its almost completely finished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every day take some time to research the problem(s) at hand. The more understanding you or any of us have of the problem, the better solutions we can come to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take time to imagine every day.  Imagine what it takes for you to take that next pebble.  Take your best idea(s) and put them into motion...and repeat them in as many people as you can and as many times as you can yourself.  When you are bored of moving pebbles start imagining what to do to start taking rocks.  Take those ideas and put them in motion, share them with your like minded friends.  You will naturally attract people who can see the benefits of your idea once you begin.  Repeat and share the success.  Once you get the hang of it new ideas will spawn on their own.  Think big, work small.  Problems are rarely solved without imagination. And no solutions are going to be perfect, but with care and diligence, they will be better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably the most important thing is this:  A successful revolution is a side effect not the goal.  The goal is a better society, a more equitable society.  My personal goal would be a society striving to be efficient and effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emulate the champions of change.  Einstein: "No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Gandhi: "Be the change you want to see in the world"
      </p>
      <p>
       King: "The hope of a secure and livable world lies with disciplined nonconformists who are dedicated to justice, peace and brotherhood."
      </p>
      <p>
       Lennon: "When it gets down to having to use violence, then you are playing the system’s game. The establishment will irritate you – pull your beard, flick your face – to make you fight. Because once they’ve got you violent, then they know how to handle you. The only thing they don’t know how to handle is non-violence and humor."
      </p>
      <p>
       Get picking, the mountain is calling.

       Until We, the People realize the cia/military whacked JFK, MLK &amp; RFK--the cia/military will keep running the world until they are exposed (or it is no longer profitable)...but after killing leaders around the world for 66 years--and subverting every law written--the agency (and it's public and private affiliates) will keep regurgitating bald-faced LIES...
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1989, JOHN STOCKWELL estimated that the cia was responsible (via covert action, funding/training militias) for the deaths of 6 MILLION people in it's first 42 years--think LYING about data collection is any big deal?

       There's a new show coming out called "almost human" , it is about humanoid robots being a part of the police force. Really got me thinking about the future and how the government is building humanoid robots, robotic flys, drones... In 15-25 years they will have that tech in mass numbers (I pulled that number out of my ass, but it seems do-able considering the speed at which technology is growing). You might ask yourself why that's such a bad thing, well robots don't judge situations on a moral level, so if the instructions are to kill, that's what they will do. So whoever sits behind the controls, could essentially control an army or lethal weapons. If that point is reached with the same people in power as we have now, there won't be a chance for revolution of any kind anymore. Humans will be slaves, no doubt in my mind. We are at a pinnacle, and what we choose to do or not do now will dictate our future.

       I think robots and drones could be what gets people really upset. It's bad enough so many people are unemployed, so even further jobs losses might get the unions organized.

       The government is just a reflection of a LARGE section of the population which is QUITE happy with their property and lifestyle.  If there is a serious attack on their stuff, they and the govt together will take up arms to resist the revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       See for example Syria.  Many, many Syrians support the "evil dictator" because they were doing okay in the old Syria, and they greatly fear what might come after a successful revolution.  So they back Assad, with weapons and bodies.

       First step is for the public to form a common law court and convict the puppets and controllers of the military industrial complex with crimes against humanity and treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unreasonable to expect anything to be done within the current system. All aspects of this corporate system (all judicial bodies) have been corrupted. The people need to form their own tribunal under common law and take the power into their own hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the corporation known as the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA has been dissolved within a common law tribunal the public must then begin to function under common law.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really see no other way at this point.

       Edit: I also think all police stations need to be disbanned as they are part of the corrupt corpoate system. We can look to countries like Mexico who started citizen patrol groups to keep things safe. Crime and murder rates have dropped. Strong communities can withstand revolution. Weak communites will only follow and do what they are told.

       Yes, and because these entitys have so much power and influence we cannot try them in their own judicial system. The system is rigged. Lets all ignore "them" and begin to Live; civilly, under common law.

       Revolution, yes that does seem necessary. Then what kind of a revolution do you want? Obviously you want a peaceful one. So without physically forcing the change we need to change the minds of all the people in America. A change of consciousness. What is something our society and systems of control are lacking? I would say lack of spiritual values and sense of a global family. Lack of forethought about everything except profit. What can we introduce into the culture to shift us from this cold, selfish, calculating and material consciousness. I can only suggest psilocybin or ayahuasca like this ted talk says.

       A revamp of society would create a period of chaos, and what if the new society doesn't work out? Now, if by revamp you mean a steady progressive change much like the American progressive era, that is more applicable and plausible.

       There will be no revolution, these are the times, you have to go as far away as possible from this toxic society and live until the end comes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Way too many people are indoctrinated, and even if a revolution succeeds what comes after that? Man will still be materialistic, he will still be isolated from his fellow man, he will still be divided and seek power. Even if a revolution happens nothing will change.
      </p>
      <p>
       What humanity needs is something a lot bigger and scarier, something that will kill and destroy, until the superficial materialist human finally bends his knees in humility. This will never come about by mere revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a political crisis, it is not an economical crisis, this is a crisis in consciousness, and if you don't realize this then you will look the wrong way for change. I hear people talk about new economic and political systems for the future, its because they still think in the same terms they were taught when they grew up.

       Oh believe me buddy, I dedicated my life to finding root problems within myself and society as a whole. Its hard enough to flesh out what drives your own psyche never mind healing trauma's and getting rid of fears. But I am confronted by the stupidity of our society every day, the shortsightedness of people, the lack of understanding (of which I do not exclude myself).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the root problem as I stated is nothing material, nothing systemic, it is the consciousness which has produces both nuclear energy and the atom bomb. It is the consciousness that puts kids away 8 hours a day from their parents only to later complain about how fucked up the younger generation is. The consciousness that treats disease with toxins, builds institutions of justice only for them to be corrupted by the very people who are supposed to guard its sanctity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe you me, Iv been as deep as you can go. And the problem cannot be fixed in the same way as we have been "fixing" our problems in the past. In fact you could say that we rarely fix problems, it seems that we just delay the negative consequences by coming up with pseudo solutions, you can see this politically, socially and economically. Constantly pushing away the ugly truth that stares us in the face. That what we are doing, how we are living and thinking is completely wrong. But people are too dependent on the system they have inherited, they are too fearful of change and even if they do feel a change is needed they wouldn't know what to change into.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a negative perspective that I hold, in fact I would say its very positive. The destruction that will come is completely natural, it would not exist were it not to be necessary. You are averse to the idea of destruction I put forth, but it is only because your view on the world isn't broad enough. You think from the perspective of your life and so every death is a tragedy, I put forth the idea that death is not a tragedy. It is a necessity, only after death can there be a rebirth, and if this rebirth were to happen it would profoundly impact each and every person still alive to witness it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, the materialist suit that walks wall-street with stock picks running through his mind cannot be changed easily, he is so engrossed in the material world that he has forgotten all that is spiritual. He even laughs at spirituality and carries an impenetrable arrogance where ever he goes having made himself the master of the physical world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a christian but the bible says that you better not be tempted by worldly things, but that you seek to be eternalized through attaining atonement with god, enlightenment. Anybody who stands with even one foot firmly established in the material world is not saved, never mind someone who is firmly rooted in it with both.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care for the deaths of people who are blind to the beauty of this world. I don't care for the deaths of people who seek to only gain physical pleasures. I don't care for them who scarcely have the time to sit in silence and observer the miracle that is this life. People nowadays are too fast, they run from one thing to the other, they don't have time for anything. The reality is some people are not worth saving, and I do not make that decision of who is and who isn't. I live my life as purely as I can, and I leave the judging to something bigger than me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As is now, the world does not look like it will avert its tragedy. Heck the large majority of Americans are anti war and yet that doesn't stop America from participating in them does it, so where would this mysterious revolutionary power come from do you think? People are too afraid of revolutions, and the only reason they will stand up is if their own front doors are stained with the blood of their fellow man. But at that point I wouldn't call it a revolution anymore, but simply a fight to keep on living, nothing noble and idealistic, just the brutal animal trying to survive at all costs.
      </p>

       In the end only time will tell.

       I agree with most everything you've said except I disagree with how much of the spiritual you ascribe to the common person. There is a very small crust of materialistic humanity that has been served by the control systems present today, they have their feet firmly in the material. There are billions of humans who have only ever known the spiritual dimensions of life, some of them are in ghettos and slums, some in rural areas, some in undeveloped nations, some in palatial mansions, and some in suburbs. Thats quite the sleeping giant there, and it slumbers fitfully.

       Ask yourself "What the CIA would do?"  Pay attention to what has happened in Egypt.  Pay attention to what is happening in Syria (The rebels are being infiltrated by Al Qaeda.).  If people are not savvy with regards to tricks, the result will be another dictatorship.  Overt violence/revolution is NOT the answer because mass movements are much to easy to manipulate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real revolution is happening in people's minds.  The real revolution is happening right now.  When everyone has a full understanding about how these world manipulators work, the revolution will be over.  When everyone has full knowledge, we will have won, no violence will be needed unless they insist we prove it.

       Yes there is a full blown revolution. However it's not going our way. I also used to think we could do it peacefully when I came on here over a year ago. However all the shit I see. Like DHS citing the Founding fathers as terrorists, or Obama providing arms to the enemy that we are at war with. The efforts to curtail our bill of rights. I don't think doing it through the ballot box is not going to happen. It's the corporate elite state of fascist America ny the corrupt ancient Roman Senate and it's wanna be little Caesars.

       I'm not sure it's quite
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       simple.  The money comes from paying taxes.  Saying "stop giving these people money" is essentially saying "stop paying your taxes".  This, of course, is something that I am 100% in total agreement with, but how many of us are really and truly doing that?  We need to all do it together.  Right now, we're still all paying our taxes - paying for these criminals to keep being criminals.  We keep saying "Hey, let's all stop paying our taxes in total!....Okay.  You go first." and none of us do it.  We all keep paying in to their corruption and our own destruction.

       No, not taxes, the corporate sponsors. Buy local, buy independent! Buycott is an app that traces corporate trees, so you can boycott all Monsanto, etc. Most can't eliminate feeding into the system, but if mass boycotts start getting media attention, we might have a chance.

       I agree w/what you said regarding buying local and independent, etc.  I don't have much faith in the political system, however, so I personally wouldn't be calling any reps or writing any letters to them, etc.  The gov as it stands is almost entirely corrupt and necrotic.  Writing and talking I don't think will do much of anything at this point.  More - much more - is needed.

       I haven't had enough IRL conversations, but if I were assassinated by the gov for my views, I imagine it would be because my views/interests got popular enough on the interwebs at least - and this alone is not a bad thing even if I personally didn't get enough done IRL.

       We still have the power of petition. Voting is vitally important. You have to USE THE SYSTEM to overthrow it. Don't just assume it's broken and therefore useless to address.

       Petitions are a joke and so is voting.  This is the case 100%.  They're both completely controlled by TPTB.  There's never been a president in power, for example, that they didn't allow in.  Voting and petitions are both a joke.  We need more than that.

       I don't assume it's useless to address.  I assume it should be addressed by being IGNORED by a people that should stand up on their own and demonstrate en mass.  If the people cannot get together and do that TOGETHER, then they will definitely not have enough ability to change the consummately corrupt government that currently exists.  If the people CAN come together and unite, then they/we won't need the government because we are making the changes ON OUR OWN without it.

       No worries. At the end of the day, we can disagree and still be on the same side.  You make as much of a difference toward the good on your end, and I'll make as much of a difference toward the good on mine, and at the end of the day, I think we'll still meet at the same place.

       taxes don't elect politicians, corporations with lobbyists do. There are better/free alternatives for almost everything online. Tax rate is way too high, like you said. Once in office, they misuse our tax revenue.

       Even more than this, however,
       <em>

       That will save me about $150/month. I can still watch baseball and football online for a mere 1 month worth of cable. I would take public transit if I could, but its not good here. I work from home, we grow our own vegetables.

       I'm an elected town meeting member, meaning 56 of my neighbors thought I was positively engaged in the community.  My opinions on articles are of public record. I have no power or interest, besides improving my neighborhood and the protection of my rights. But more than anything, I've used their paper trail to voice my concerns. What's childish about that?

       , better known as direct democracy. You want to give the power to the people right? Well be prepared to deal with the consequences. Revolution is a romantic idea and all, but what happens after we take power back from the powers that be? What happens when we're actually in control? We're still gonna fuck up. We are all human. The only difference is that we will (as a society) at least be able to control our fate, be it good or bad.

       No. It's a good idea if you want the people to have power instead of some un-elected elite.

       Don't believe the lies taught to you via corporate propaganda. Decentralized systems are not only better ethically, they are more practical than other kinds of systems. Direct democracy (and "flat systems" in general for that matter) work. You know the game company Valve? They work via a system like this. You know Switzerland? They practice direct democracy. You know wikipedia, bitcoin, and the human brain? Those decentralized organizations/systems are doing pretty well if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Direct democracy is not two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner. It's all the sheep and all the wolves reaching a compromise without the use of violence.

       If there's a will theres a way, nothing made or taken will be perfect from the start, anything is possible when groups of people come together and correspond with each other, there is nothing more powerful then minds coming together accomplishing what can't be done in the senate.

       Revolution without violence is an oxymoron.  Can't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the possible results of revolution WITH violence, see Libya, Egypt, Syria, etc.  Lots of things can go wrong in a revolution.

       I'm not sure it's quite
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       simple.  The money comes from paying taxes.  Saying "stop giving these people money" is essentially saying "stop paying your taxes".  This, of course, is something that I am 100% in total agreement with, but how many of us are really and truly doing that?  We need to all do it together.  Right now, we're still all paying our taxes - paying for these criminals to keep being criminals.  We keep saying "Hey, let's all stop paying our taxes in total!....Okay.  You go first." and none of us do it.  We all keep paying in to their corruption and our own destruction.

       I'm an elected town meeting member, meaning 56 of my neighbors thought I was positively engaged in the community.  My opinions on articles are of public record. I have no power or interest, besides improving my neighborhood and the protection of my rights. But more than anything, I've used their paper trail to voice my concerns. What's childish about that?
