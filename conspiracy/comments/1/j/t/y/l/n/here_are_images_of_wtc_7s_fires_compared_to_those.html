       I don't think the issue any longer is evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the real issue is state of mind. You could have George Bush admitting that his administration was personally responsible, but people with the shells around their minds would refuse to believe it still! That's how good the propaganda Machine is.

       Nice! I think too many of us look at the holocaust as a tragedy that's over and done with. Hitler was bad, the end. Most of the problems we face today the government has taken a page out of that time.

       You didn't read the page I linked, did you?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Pure liquid aluminum would be expected to appear silvery. However, the molten metal was very likely mixed with large amounts of hot, partially burned, solid organic materials (e.g., furniture, carpets, partitions and computers) which can display an orange glow, much like logs burning in a fireplace. The apparent color also would have been affected by slag formation on the surface."
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming that the flow would be molten aluminum from the airliner and the color of molten aluminum is silver then why is the flow orange?
       </p>
       <p>
        The color of pure molten aluminum is silver, It has an emissivity of .12. Steel has an emissivity of .4 and appears orange in the temperature range of molten aluminum.
       </p>
       <p>
        The emissivity of aluminum oxide is .44 and also appears orange in the melting temperature range of molten aluminum.
       </p>
       <p>
        The emissivity of plate glass is .937 It begins to soften at 1000 F and flows around 1350 F. Silica has an emissivity of .8
       </p>
       <p>
        Copper oxide also has an emissivity of .8. however I will assume that their effect is negligible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aluminum oxidizes readily in the foundry under ideal melting conditions. Large surface area relative to thickness, turbulence, the presence of water or oil greatly increases the oxidation of aluminum. A jet airliner is made of thin aluminum sheet and most probably suffered considerable oxidation especially in contact with an open flame and being in contact with jet fuel. If you don't believe this, try melting a few soda cans over coals or open flame. If you are lucky you will end up with only 50% aluminum oxide. However, the cans may completely burn up.
       </p>
       <p>
        The specific gravity of aluminum is 2.7. The specific gravity of aluminum oxide (Al2O3-3H2O) is 2.42 the specific gravity of Si = 2.40 and Glass is 2.65 these are all very similar and likely to be entrained in a molten aluminum flow. Don't believe it? lightly stir the dross into molten aluminum. The surface tension is so high is is almost impossible to separate them.
       </p>
       <p>
        THEREFORE assuming that the flow consist of molten aluminum and considerable oxides, and assuming that the windows in the trade center were plate glass and also in a plastic state and that they were also likely entrained in the molten aluminum. I would expect the flow to appear to be orange in color. Especially since both the entrained materials have emissivities equal to or more than twice that of iron.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        The color means nothing. The color can be misleading, and because it can be misleading, it means nothing as evidence. This is not aluminum in a foundry which hasn't mixed with anything. This is a cocktail of whatever was on the plane and in the towers which happens to come together. It wouldn't be unreasonable to suspect Aluminum and some other properties has changed its color.

       Suppose that's true. And suppose that that
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       thing we saw coming out the side was from thermite. Then why did the tower fall? Because that's not going to be enough. There must have been something else, right? Maybe something more like the "official story" perhaps? Or maybe there
       <em>
        was

       Awesome change of subject dude. We were talking about steel, aluminum, and thermite and you suddenly bring up building 7. Classic "I can't respond to these arguments in a reasonable way (and am obviously not going to admit I may be wrong), so lets randomly start attacking on another front" maneuver. Brilliantly executed.

       Who's "they"? It was certainly on fire for a long time, longer than it was designed to withstand, but I don't think I've ever heard anyone on either side claim that it was "engulfed in flames from top to bottom".

       What is this all about? I'm perfectly willing to learn, but you must understand that, as with many other learners in many other subjects, I am going to have questions that need to be resolved in order for my learning to advance. Questions such as those I have asked above, not a single one of which you have answered.

       I have pictures of WTC7 and it was not engulfed in flames prior to collapse and here's the crux with you people. The firemen said they heard explosions going off in the buildings. And you people deny them what they said. You cannot have it both ways. What you gonna tell me the fireman didn't see molten steel pouring out of a building now? What a shitty argument. I'm not caught up in these details, that shit was dropped because of the petro dollar.   Lemme make this point to you since you are not a fireman obviously. NON COMBUSTIBLE MEANS THAT......NON COMBUSTIBLE.   Sky scrapers have long since been engineered to be on fire indefinately that is the way things work. We cannot have buildings that collapse just because they have been on fire  for 24-48 72 hours. Buildings around the world have used these techniques and steel doesn't melt with a room and contents fire. NO MATTER WHAT YOU PUT IN A BUILDING.  And for the matter of it collapsing you you don't get everything to fall simultaneously without it being planned. It would have been a lot more plausible if it was a partial collapse and you people would have had a leg to stand on if it was more like the Delft University building. But no , you had to be greedy because that building was holding records of a SEC fraud that was a multi billion if not trillion in evidence. So here's the deal. You have a history here rife with conspiracies in America and shitty money system that the greatest wars in the world have been fought over. It is what it is, if you wanna learn about this stuff you have a long journey of understanding and picking up all the inside stories about who , how and why then it will become clear to you. Take time instead of arguing with us about and go learn and listen. I suggest

       Nobody is saying that any steel melted. At least I'm not. Steel (as well as many other materials. Butter for example) does significantly weaken though at higher temperatures even before it reaches it's melting point.

        And for the matter of it collapsing you you don't get everything to fall simultaneously without it being planned. It would have been a lot more plausible if it was a partial collapse and you people would have had a leg to stand on if it was more like the Delft University building.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The mechanics of the collapse of building 7 are actually fairly more complicated than that, and the specific design of the support structure is extremely important to consider when talking about how it happened. After being weakened for several hours by fire, a single structural failure started a chain reaction that progressed upwards until the penthouse fell in the top, and eventually the whole core of the building was destroyed. The outside shell (the part that you see) collapsed relatively separately from the core.

       Here's my problem with this particular conspiracy theory: If they were really trying to cover it up, why couldn't they have just silently shredded all the evidence or something? Maybe lie and say that they lost it. Why did they have to make a huge spectacle of it?

       I believe that I have sufficiently demonstrated that the building 7 collapse was not the result of demolition and that the material seen pouring out of the tower was not steel and was likely aluminum. You have not even made any attempt to dispute those points, giving me no reason to belive that I am wrong. Further, your continued attempts at changing the subject give the impression that your side of the argument is completely indefensible, shifting credibility away from it and towards mine.

       well I am not a scientist but this will put it in laymans terms for you the temperature of the metal that is pouring out of the building, scroll down and you will see the temperature that is associated with that color, its light physics and seeing that aluminum melts at around 600C , you are pretty far off the mark in your claim that it is aluminum.

       Twice now I have pointed out that that's wrong.
       <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/moltensteel.htm">
        Seriously, read this article, since you obviously haven't yet.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Pure liquid aluminum would be expected to appear silvery. However, the molten metal was very likely mixed with large amounts of hot, partially burned, solid organic materials (e.g., furniture, carpets, partitions and computers) which can display an orange glow, much like logs burning in a fireplace. The apparent color also would have been affected by slag formation on the surface."
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming that the flow would be molten aluminum from the airliner and the color of molten aluminum is silver then why is the flow orange?
       </p>
       <p>
        The color of pure molten aluminum is silver, It has an emissivity of .12. Steel has an emissivity of .4 and appears orange in the temperature range of molten aluminum.
       </p>
       <p>
        The emissivity of aluminum oxide is .44 and also appears orange in the melting temperature range of molten aluminum.
       </p>
       <p>
        The emissivity of plate glass is .937 It begins to soften at 1000 F and flows around 1350 F. Silica has an emissivity of .8
       </p>
       <p>
        Copper oxide also has an emissivity of .8. however I will assume that their effect is negligible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aluminum oxidizes readily in the foundry under ideal melting conditions. Large surface area relative to thickness, turbulence, the presence of water or oil greatly increases the oxidation of aluminum. A jet airliner is made of thin aluminum sheet and most probably suffered considerable oxidation especially in contact with an open flame and being in contact with jet fuel. If you don't believe this, try melting a few soda cans over coals or open flame. If you are lucky you will end up with only 50% aluminum oxide. However, the cans may completely burn up.
       </p>
       <p>
        The specific gravity of aluminum is 2.7. The specific gravity of aluminum oxide (Al2O3-3H2O) is 2.42 the specific gravity of Si = 2.40 and Glass is 2.65 these are all very similar and likely to be entrained in a molten aluminum flow. Don't believe it? lightly stir the dross into molten aluminum. The surface tension is so high is is almost impossible to separate them.
       </p>
       <p>
        THEREFORE assuming that the flow consist of molten aluminum and considerable oxides, and assuming that the windows in the trade center were plate glass and also in a plastic state and that they were also likely entrained in the molten aluminum. I would expect the flow to appear to be orange in color. Especially since both the entrained materials have emissivities equal to or more than twice that of iron.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        The color means nothing. The color can be misleading, and because it can be misleading, it means nothing as evidence. This is not aluminum in a foundry which hasn't mixed with anything. This is a cocktail of whatever was on the plane and in the towers which happens to come together. It wouldn't be unreasonable to suspect Aluminum and some other properties has changed its color.

       the color means nothing it could have mixed with wood, ha fucking ha, what retard would latch onto that statement as being scientific? Have you ever in your life seen molten aluminum mix with wood. Of course you have not because the wood remains solid until it combusts at which point the gas is what is on fire.. go the fuck away, you are waste  of time if you believe this source as credible.

       </p>
       <p>
        The color of
        <strong>
         <em>
          pure
         </em>
        </strong>
        molten aluminum is silver...
       </p>
       <p>
        The emissivity of
        <strong>
         aluminum oxide
        </strong>
        is .44 and also
        <strong>
         appears orange in the melting temperature range of molten aluminum
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Aluminum oxidizes readily
        </strong>
        in the foundry under ideal melting conditions.
        <strong>
         Large surface area relative to thickness, turbulence, the presence of water or oil greatly increases the oxidation of aluminum
        </strong>
        . A jet airliner is made of
        <strong>
         thin aluminum sheet
        </strong>
        and most
        <strong>
         probably suffered considerable oxidation especially in contact with an open flame and being in contact with jet fuel
        </strong>
        ....
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
       </p>
       <p>
        ...
        <strong>
         <em>
          This is not aluminum in a foundry which hasn't mixed with anything. This is a cocktail of whatever was on the plane and in the towers which happens to come together.
         </em>
        </strong>
        <strong>
         It wouldn't be unreasonable to suspect Aluminum and some other properties has changed its color.
        </strong>

       Actually, WTC7 was different.  All of the other fires were actively fought from the moment they caught fire.  Building 7 burned uncontrolled for more than 6 consecutive hours.  All the firefighters were redirected to the Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC7 is the only building in history to burn that long with no attempts being made to extinguish it.

       Exactly.  Theres nothing any fireman can do to fight the fires in those other buildings.  You have skyscrapers entirely engulfed from fires from top to bottom, and they act like throwing a bucket of water on that made all the difference from a total collapse and a still standing steel frame.

       When you have the entire building from top to bottom engulfed in flames, does it really matter anymore if there are a few fire man dousing it with water at the bottom.  Those fires in those other skyscrapers are way out of control.  You act like shooting water at one small fraction of the entire skyscraper that is entirely engulfed in fire made all the difference.  Please.

      </p>
      <p>
       NIST writes on pages 330-333 of the final report on WTC 7 that the maximum temperature reached was 450 degrees, and that no area of the building held that temperature for "any longer than 20-30 minutes". The buildings I featured burned up to 2-2.5x hotter, up to 7x longer, and yet WTC 7 is the only one to even
       <em>
        partially
       </em>
       collapse, let alone telescope into its footprint with a portion of the fall at freefall acceleration

       So, if you read the NIST report, then you know about the design defects that led to the collapse because of thermal expansion. Do you have questions about it?

       The first question I'd ask is why NIST won't make the data they used for their WTC7 collapse model public.   Oh right, they said it was for reasons of National Security.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you really have to just take NIST's word for it that what they claim with regards to 'thermal expansion' is even possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, their own
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNEKtvB80us">
        computer model
       </a>
       shows that they can't even demonstrate that their claims of thermal expansion could lead to total collapse of the whole steel frame of the building, let along could they demonstrate it collapsing at free fall speeds.

       Yes I've read many parts of the final report. Nothing they say matters after they admit freefall acceleration for 2.25 seconds. Freefall acceleration requires a moment where every single support (not some of them, not half of them, not most of them...
       <em>
        all of them
       </em>
       ) give way at exactly the same time. No resistance whatsoever. That cannot arise from asymmetrical office fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking a step backward, NIST writes the hottest temperature reached was 450F, and that no area of WTC 7 held that temperature "any longer than 20-30 minutes". You're telling me buildings burned at 2-2.5x that temperature for 29 hours to be structurally sound, but 450F in different spots for 20 minutes brings down WTC 7
       <em>

       At any rate it doesn't matter, there's no argument against freefall acceleration.

       Edit: You'll see in your FAQ they spend one sentence describing "stage 2; freefall", and then spend no further words on how freefall fits any part of the report, because of what it entails

       His point was the fire was uncontrolled, and that every other skyscraper fire pictured was also controlled. They all had fire fighters attacking the fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't address that in your response to him. I provided evidence to back up his assertion. You didn't respond to that either. His assertion stands: all the other buildings had fires that were fought and not abandoned.

       I'm the FAQ you linked, NIST writes "Whether the fire fighters fought the WTC 7 fires or not is not a meaningful point of dissimilarity from the other cited fires." They're saying the fact the fire was controlled or uncontrolled had no bearing on the collapse. They say this after they cite 38 Meridian Plaza (which I almost included in my pictures) as a steel skyscraper with similar fires that had no intervention, yet didn't collapse. So NIST itself says firefighters are irrelevant to WTC 7's damage. Thanks, I should have mentioned it earlier!

       No, I said what I just said because it leaves you with only two logical options now. You can: (A) agree with them that firefighting is irrelevant, in which case the weakness of WTC 7's fires relative to its outcome becomes magnified and extremely anomalous (the point of my topic), having a very doubtful route to each other (remember, you tried to argue the physical reason WTC 7 collapsed was because the fires were uncontrolled. Choosing option A uproots and defeats your argument); or (B) agree NIST is wrong here, in which case, as it's the only source, the only source now has holes in it, and we have grounds to continue questioning the veracity of the rest of their claims. If that route leads to you only dismissing the point you forfeited and nothing else, then perhaps you're suffering from confirmation bias towards the official storyline?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have two biases: the laws of physics in freefall acceleration, and what I can see with my eyes. I don't believe NIST's conclusion. You introduced one source, a trusted source, that bolstered the opposition's position on the specific topic, if you actually trust the source as reputable. That's sort of a problematic thing to do, and leads to the two endpoints I described.

       "Sounds like"? Maybe you should sit down and think through the way those the only two scenarios of logic play out, so you know what they actually are. My topic is about WTC 7 and its evidence. I'm not interested in unprovable conjecture about who set it up or why they set it up. I'm pointing out, and interested in limiting the discussion to, the observable physical anomalies of WTC 7. You are frequently exiting the discussion to grasp for the straws of "gotcha" fallacies and youtube satires on things I've never put forward instead of rebutting with an argument.

       Why do you think it suffered a "symmetric" collapse? (as it was not demolished).

       So to be clear you are leaving the point on firefighting technique to discuss symmetry. A symmetrical collapse is when the building collapses into its own footprint, like a telescope folding up. Asymmetrical is when the building favors any side in any manner that is even slightly unequal. WTC 7 telescoped

       It was symmetric BECAUSE IT WAS DEMOLISHED.

       Asymmetric would mean that the building MIGHT have only collapsed onto its structurally weakened areas where the fires were burning..

       even if there was a collapse at a certain part of the building it still does not explain free fall speed of the building. For that to happen all supports have to give away simultaneously! I wonder what the odds of that happening are? Especially when its class one construction?

       Lol well first i would say no one is stupid enough to say 9/11 was an inside job based on some pictures. Likely anyone who up voted this is already at least fairly convinced the official story is untrue based on their own research. In regards to discussing this topic in depth and I'm sure no one here feels any inclination to waste their time trying to argue with some one so condescending, rude, and seemingly vehemently opposed to even the possibility that the official story is false—granted as someone who has spent dozens of hours reading up on 9/11, It would take me 20,000 characters to even write a poor essay on the matter and it would hardly be 100% convincing or a efficient use of my time— However there is easily a few hundred hours of reading that can be done on the matter. 
On the off chance that, despite the tone of your comment, you are actually interested in reviewing the evidence for the  'conspiracy theory', I would recommend the following.

       Oh my, these same tired links that have been debunked numerous times?  Wikispooks?  Seriously?  It's no wonder the truth movement isn't gaining any real traction.  People keep repeating the same tired "evidence" over an over again which eventually appeals to a small minority of the population that can't be bothered to do follow-up research.  Congratulations, you've managed to to take one step towards being a critical thinker, now try taking a few more and realize that blindly accepting what these truther sites publish should require just as much rigorous investigation as what the other side says.

       How would I know?  I'm not a physicist, a structural engineer, a civil engineer, a demolitions expert or really have anything to do with how buildings are constructed or brought down.  I'm also not a fireman or have any personal experience with burning buildings.  Not sure why you would even pose such a complicated question to a stranger on the internet for any kind of insight.  Go to a local university's engineering department with the evidence, formulae, materials and videos you have collected for your conclusion and speak with an expert.  Seems like it would yield more promising results than surveying absolute strangers at random on the internet.

       Thats like asking me to prove that the theory of evolution is the most supported theory for how life formed on this planet by listing one species, or one piece of evidence for the theory, at a time. I think we both know that, with any scientific theory, it is not that each individual claim/piece of evidence is evidence enough to draw the conclusion; it is all of them combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many substantial individualpieces of evidence regarding 9/11 which are pretty hard to just brush away as if they hold no significance, and hundreds of small pieces of evidence that when considered support one wholistic picture, but it seems you havent even read up on the official explanation of 9/11, yet are vehemently assured that there is no way the official story is untrue, in which case i dont foresee the time i would spend laying it out for you would be very useful to either of us.

       All of your other examples come from fires that were internally instigated, rather than the fairly unique incident of the WTC. In a building filled with paper material, and other flammable objects such as furnishings, it's hardly surprising that fire spread rapidly throughout the building. Jet fuel is proven to burn hot enough to warp/melt steel. You only need one side of a building to have massive rapid structural weakening for the whole thing to fall down.

       This is WTC 7... not the two towers.. there is no jetfuel present here, and all the flammable material in WTC 7 is the same as all these other buildings that withheld their integrity..

       The really funny part is that steel actually
       <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html">
        gets stronger
       </a>
       when you heat up to about 450F before it begins to weaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       The buildings were designed to withstand the impact of a similar sized plane and part of that was structural mechanisms to prevent oxygen flow from feeding a fire, thereby limiting maximum burn temperatures of not just jet fuel but also things you would normally find in a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the excellent thermal conductivity of steel, it is hard to imagine how temperatures much in excess of 450F were reached anywhere.  Normally you see window blowouts in the 550-600F range from fires, which don't appear to happen until the collapse is initiated and are more likely indicators of explosions (as everyone reported hearing) than hot fires.

       Yeah. They should add something about it in the NIST report. The fires got really hot and then used the elevator to burn up each of the floors, that's why it took so long for the building to collapse.

       Nope.  The elevator shafts were designed to stop the flow of oxygen.  We had already learned prior to the construction of WTC that elevator shafts served as vents to funnel oxygen into high rise fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC elevators were designed to shut off oxygen flow through elevator shafts.  Just one of many reasons the physics of the official story are impossible.

       Very good point. Tangent to that, the NIST final report on WTC 7 around page 330 says the flames reached 450F maximum and that no spot held that temperature for longer than 20-30 minutes.

       NIST never implicates jet fuel for WTC 7; it was not hit by a plane. Furthermore, NIST writes in the final report on WTC 7 that no area in the building held a temperature hotter than 450F for longer than 20-30 minutes. And all of this is subservient to the fact you mention "one side of a steel structure." The building is seen to fall symmetrically in 7 seconds, in a complete destruction. Asymmetrical damage leads to an asymmetrical collapse (toppling), which never happens. Paper material and office furnishings as the combustibles make WTC 7 the one and only steel skyscraper ever to collapse, let alone collapse at freefall speed, in that manner. Steel buildings burned bigger and for up to 7x as long and stood structurally sound, as shown in the pictures

       Your thoughts do not explain the whole building falling at free fall speed. That defies the laws of physics. What universe do you live in?

       Your video of the corner is cute, but here's one of the real fires, from the 5th tower I featured:

       NIST writes on pages 330-333 of the final report on WTC 7 that the maximum temperature reached was 450 degrees, and that no area of the building held that temperature for "any longer than 20-30 minutes". The buildings I featured burned up to 2-2.5x hotter, up to 7x longer, and yet WTC 7 is the only one to even

       collapse, let alone telescope into its footprint with a portion of the fall at freefall acceleration

       I have pictures of WTC7 and it was not engulfed in flames prior to collapse and here's the crux with you people. The firemen said they heard explosions going off in the buildings. And you people deny them what they said. You cannot have it both ways. What you gonna tell me the fireman didn't see molten steel pouring out of a building now? What a shitty argument. I'm not caught up in these details, that shit was dropped because of the petro dollar.   Lemme make this point to you since you are not a fireman obviously. NON COMBUSTIBLE MEANS THAT......NON COMBUSTIBLE.   Sky scrapers have long since been engineered to be on fire indefinately that is the way things work. We cannot have buildings that collapse just because they have been on fire  for 24-48 72 hours. Buildings around the world have used these techniques and steel doesn't melt with a room and contents fire. NO MATTER WHAT YOU PUT IN A BUILDING.  And for the matter of it collapsing you you don't get everything to fall simultaneously without it being planned. It would have been a lot more plausible if it was a partial collapse and you people would have had a leg to stand on if it was more like the Delft University building. But no , you had to be greedy because that building was holding records of a SEC fraud that was a multi billion if not trillion in evidence. So here's the deal. You have a history here rife with conspiracies in America and shitty money system that the greatest wars in the world have been fought over. It is what it is, if you wanna learn about this stuff you have a long journey of understanding and picking up all the inside stories about who , how and why then it will become clear to you. Take time instead of arguing with us about and go learn and listen. I suggest

       and if you need more evidence the gov't is trying to use false flag events to go to war learn about Operation Northwoods and see how Israel attacked us in 1967

       That's enough to keep you busy for awhile.  If you need more than this I have more but please don't bother me with denial about all of it because you can't deny any of it. The evidence is too insurmountable. I have a lot left so lemme know, am glad to help but you have to understand all of this before you can understand the rest of it.
