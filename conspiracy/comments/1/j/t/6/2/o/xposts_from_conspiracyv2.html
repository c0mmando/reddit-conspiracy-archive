    <div class="md"><p>Posts get removed all of the time, many of yours do get flagged but i&#39;m trying to discuss this with you amicably. </p>

<p>Look at it from our point of view. All of your posts try to promote a separate but related subreddit. Imaging if i was to creat worldnews2 or similar and then proceed to post with [crosspost from worldnews2] after every submission, wouldn&#39;t last long would it?</p>

<p>Besides, if your sub wasn&#39;t private it wouldn&#39;t be so bad, however the fact that it is invite only(and i was invited months ago) makes things more difficult. What are new users supposed to think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and the fact that they were removed is sometimes extremely suspect on your part like this one for example.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1i7mvx/report_israel_behind_recent_strike_on_syria/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1i7mvx/report_israel_behind_recent_strike_on_syria/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to as well PM Flytape and have him forward our discussion.</p>

<p>The sub didn&#39;t start as private but was forced to do so after the Conspiratards attacked it with downvoting and reporting everything as spam.  You know, the same way they downvote me here and report posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s besides the point. Private or not you are actively promoting your subreddit on r/conspiracy. We have no idea what goes on inside your sub, there is no transparency. The moderators here remove posts, if they are flagged or caught in the spam filter it happens. Users message us all of the time asking about posts that have been removed or caught in the filter, many are then approved. If i remove a post and you disagree you can message me. </p>

<p>The point in question is why conspiracy2 should be allowed to self promote to the levels it is now on r/conspiracy. The sub is private, other private subs don&#39;t do this here, so why should you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, no, these aren&#39;t posts caught in the spam filter, because you remove them sometimes days later after they are posted and are receiving votes and/or comments in the sub, so that excuse isn&#39;t going to work.</p>

<p>If you say I can&#39;t post X-Posts unless they are self posts from v2 then I&#39;ll stop, it&#39;s pretty simple.  This is your sub and you can run it however you see fit.</p>

<p>I used to have a lot of respect for you, until I saw your removal history on <a href="/r/Uncensorship">/r/Uncensorship</a>, it&#39;s pretty embarrassing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what r/uncensorchip is there for. I cannot recall you ever sending  a pm to the moderators regarding removed posts (many of which get reported before removal) In future be aware that you can do this and sometimes reported posts are then approved. </p>

<p>However this is not the issue and being honest with you i think many of your posts were/are reported because of the conspiracy2 tagging. </p>

<p>Many users don&#39;t like it, again it doesn&#39;t help with your sub being private. I&#39;m sure you can understand that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is not about multitasking it is about the state of mind you are showing yourself to be in. Do you not get that we are all one the entire universe is an organism we are just a small part, yet we have the capability to do so much.</p>

<p>It is time we stop this consumerism shit I&#39;m tired of all the lying in politics EVERYWHERE around the world. I&#39;m tired of waking up looking at the sky and seeing 20 airplanes doing some tricks in the air and making nice chemical clouds for me to live under. I&#39;m tired of this shit and EVERYONE&#39;s to blame.</p>

<p>Grow up see the consequences you have on everything around you. If this race doesn&#39;t survive and won&#39;t be allowed to join the communities  in space, well gladly I&#39;ll be happy. We have become pigs with no shred of dignity. We give awey everything that makes us special and ruin everything we touch.</p>

<p>Not all people are bad of course most are just wilfully ignorant and don&#39;t give a shit as long as they think their future is safe and they get to buy 120 dollar white tshirts. WHAT IS THIS SHIT!</p>

<p>Now go think about what you are doing and if you don&#39;t want to; well enjoy some more lifetimes</p>

<p>First of all you are promoting a private forum through posts and also promoting invitations through your tags in a similar public forum. You silently control who gets in based on arbitrary bullshit you thought of to &quot;keep your content safe.&quot; All the while you proclaim your private forum is better than this public one. (Remember the free of shills etc bullshit advertising v2? I do) Then you claim you are being censored when your bullshit is no longer tolerated? Enjoy that inflated ego son.

    <div class="md"><p>Posts get removed all of the time, many of yours do get flagged but i&#39;m trying to discuss this with you amicably. </p>

<p>Look at it from our point of view. All of your posts try to promote a separate but related subreddit. Imaging if i was to creat worldnews2 or similar and then proceed to post with [crosspost from worldnews2] after every submission, wouldn&#39;t last long would it?</p>

<p>Besides, if your sub wasn&#39;t private it wouldn&#39;t be so bad, however the fact that it is invite only(and i was invited months ago) makes things more difficult. What are new users supposed to think?</p>

<p>Or you could just continue to retroactively remove a third of all my posts from this sub, arbitrarily, because no one would really notice except for me anyway.</p>

<p>Because more than a third of your posts are InfoWars posts, a site that&#39;s decidedly not welcome and/or actively boycotted by the majority of the membership on this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are an idiot... If that is really how you see it I hope you are not a year above 18 because you have a lot of growing up to do. </p>

<p>First of all you are promoting a private forum through posts and also promoting invitations through your tags in a similar public forum. You silently control who gets in based on arbitrary bullshit you thought of to &quot;keep your content safe.&quot; All the while you proclaim your private forum is better than this public one. (Remember the free of shills etc bullshit advertising v2? I do) Then you claim you are being censored when your bullshit is no longer tolerated? Enjoy that inflated ego son. I have no questions as to why any PTwB would try to enslave people like you. </p>

<p>Good fucking luck on the trajectory you are headed. Its time to wake up. </p>
