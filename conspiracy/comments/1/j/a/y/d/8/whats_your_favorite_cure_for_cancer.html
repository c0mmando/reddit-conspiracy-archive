       I'm particularly fond of the one where someone slices into your skin, through your internal organs, and then pulls out a bit of tumor (fingers crossed while they're all up in you they don't accidentally leave something behind, like bacteria or a sponge or their shoe). Then someone puts an IV in your arm, pumps you full of a liquid chemical soup that kills a great deal of your healthy cells, weakens your immune system, and
       <em>
        hopefully
       </em>
       kills the cancer cells in the meantime. Then, at some point, radiation is used to thoroughly kill even more of your healthy cells, while either killing or emboldening the cancer cells (we're just not sure yet, but you should try it). After all that (and you're probably going to die anyway, so why not all that?), when you're bald and weak and feel like you're
       <em>
        just about to slip into the dark abyss
       </em>
       , your immune system fails and we shove a bunch of antibiotics and white blood cells into you and then you'll probably get better. Unless you don't. Either way, at this point you probably don't care. Either way, you're going to die some day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. THAT is MY favorite cancer cure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank goodness we have options about how we choose to die. That one sounds like the best.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Edit to add: SHAME on ANYONE who chooses to explore other options, by the way. SHAME ON YOU ALL. You should suffer the way we all think you should suffer, goddammit. If you don't want that, then you're a moron. You think life is yours to explore as you wish? Well, it may be ... for now. But that doesn't mean we won't make you feel like complete shit for looking for alternatives. Assholes who just want to search for something that works for
       <em>
        you.

       I joined this community to specifically comment on your asinine response...these treatments have saved lives and while they are not perfect, they have shown efficacy and some but admittedly not all situations.  Shame on you for denigrating treatments which have saved or more correctly prolonged lives (because like you say...everyone dies, so every life saved is temporary).  There is nothing wrong with looking for alternative treatments but there IS something wrong with ridiculing treatments which have shown efficacy despite their imperfections.  Moreover, cancer is a disease which affects people of all ages in all walks of life many of whom lack the resources to seek out "alternatives" or may simply lick the time to do so instead of fucking around with possible cures they place their hope in those treatments which have empirically shown to be effective.

       Of course most of the people who push the 'alternatives' haven't had cancer nor been in a position to treat it. I understand wanting to try anything when you're desperate, but most of the shit that flies is either someone trying to sell shit (snake oil) or someone trying to push an agenda (such as drug laws).

       In the last few years, I've paid very close attention to the natural treatments, and I can say, resoundingly, that if I am ever diagnosed (and I suspect I will be, given the genetic history of cancer in my family), I will turn immediately to the Gerson Clinic. Personally, I know several people who've extended their lives (after being given 2, 6, and 6 months respectively to live) by several years using the Gerson treatments when they were given a death sentence by their doctors (they went to Gerson as a last resort, but each of them expressed dismay at not going before they received radiation and chemo).

       That is a fair response; especially when cannabinoid treatments have demonstrated usefulness with regards to shrinking tumors and making them operable.  There can be a healthy medium between the two- like in most cases, neither side is 100% right and 100% wrong...I have had experience with family members forgoing treatment with standard medicine in favor of more homeopathic alternatives, almost always with negative results.  However point taken.

       Your response is extremely rude and completely void of compassion. As a pediatric cancer survivor I don't find it appropriate to sarcastically explain any process of treatment for a disease especially one like cancer. The way a family and/or patient decides to treat their own diagnosis is not something to mock. You should be more sensitive when addressing issues like this, whether someone is treating it via pseudoscience or traditional medicine that is up to them. Either way cancer sucks and is going to cause weakened immune systems, pain and discomfort. It's not like having a cold. Your response made me sick. I hope you never face decisions like the one you are mocking in this very reply. Have a great day.

       Anyone is going to take offense at anything at any given time, you know that, right? I'm not a stranger to cancer in any way, shape, or form (I've watched several members die very, very painful deaths from the mainstream treatment of cancer - some of which wasn't even from the cancer itself). I also watched a boyfriend die from treatment complications for testicular cancer (a very treatable kind, which he was literally shamed and laughed out of trying to treat naturally via dietary changes and other methods).
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the heartbreaking choices that go into it, but I also understand the mindset of people who like to mock those who seek alternative treatments. No light foot can be used when dealing with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       To that end, I hope you make a concentrated effort to assert this opinion on every single thread where someone's mocking someone else's natural healing choices when it comes to cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a VERY intimate thing, and NO ONE should be able to tell another person how to treat their disease, unless they ask for opinions.

       Right you've watched people with it, YOU have never had it. I do speak up when I see someone mocking cancer treatments like YOU are. If you've had so many family members pass one would think you'd be more sensitive to the topic out the gate. So I hope YOU think of your family and all the others in this world battling cancer and other deathly diseases next time you go on a public forum to mock and make fun of the ways people choose to treat their diagnosis. While I understand where you come from, if someone wants to use alternative medicine to battle their cancer what is it to you? Let them. There's no need to mock the alternative way of their own choice. Likewise, I find OP's original post insensitive and offensive- as marijuana has shown great success in many cases of treating cancer. No one way is perfect or a guarantee. There's never one way to cancer-anything, everyone is different, and responds differently.

       We AGREE on so much, you see? OPs post was to trash alternative treatments. Mine was to bring the "nasty truth" about what "mainstream treatment" is in comparison (and, yes, it was a bit lighthearted, but when you watch the way people like OP talk about alternative treatments, this is their tone, as well - my
       <em>
        feeble
       </em>
       attempt was to show EXACTLY how they treat people who choose alternative treatments and the insensitivity involved there). Funny how I get called out for it, but no one ever calls out people like OP. Why is that, do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       My
       <em>
        PERSONAL
       </em>
       belief is that everyone chooses exactly what they need to choose, if left to make a decision with their heart. PERSONALLY, I have no issue with those who would choose a mainstream treatment. I have no issue with those who would choose to treat it ANY WAY THEY WANT.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after watching a boyfriend die from cancer that he likely could have conquered if it wasn't for people like OP, I'm done pretending that it's okay to make fun of people who choose alternative treatments. And if I have to write posts like the above to show just how insensitive getting in ANYONE'S healthcare choices is, I will. Sorry if that upsets you.

       Good, I'm glad you selected the actual medical response.  Even while it's easy to describe in the barbaric terms you used, using demonstrably effective things is always better than wishful thinking.

       Definitely weed. I've smoked it all my adult life and I have yet to get any cancer, and that's all the evidence I need.

       I've never smoked weed and never had cancer, but my friend that had skin cancer smoked weed a couple years before she got skin cancer. So weed causes skin cancer.

       Corn. I've been eating it my whole life and have never had cancer, while my friend who doesn't like corn has had skin cancer 3 times. That's gotta mean something right??
