       I say that they power up the NIST Linux super computer grid to develop a new branch of physics so that this can be easily explained.  Then they could ignore the thousands of signatures from mechanics and auto-engineers of America.

       Toyota got slammed just as the government was bailing out GM and Chrysler, as I recall.  I figured it was payback on behalf of the US auto industry.  (Not that Toyota was innocent.)

       a car with a stuck gas pedal is pretty easy to deal with. used to happen with some frequency on cars of old. broken throttle return spring and bingo.

       trick is to put the car in N and kill the engine.

       I would be more surprised if it didn't when you hit a damn near immovable object in a partial-overlap at 100mph. Those particulars are rare enough that I don't think you'd ever see an epidemic of it.

       Don't forget what he hit before striking the tree. Many have theorized that it was the big ass metal backflow prevention valve and the steel security cage bolted to the cement slab that actually started to dislodge the engine
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the tree was struck.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the picture that was taken shortly after they removed the car the cage had been placed back there by crash scene investigators after photographing it in the location almost as far down the street as the engine was found. It didn't travel as far as the engine due to less mass, but it and the pipe were both down the street in the same direction the engine was found in.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qRBzqgm.jpg">

      </p>
      <p>
       Hitting a metal pipe sticking out of the ground and a big steel cage bolted over top of it at 45-80 miles per hour can wreak havoc on the car. Looking at the tire tracks that were visible before all the pilgrims started tromping through to pay their respects it is clear that the front tire passed to the right of the pipe and the back tire passed to the left, showing that the car was steering back towards the street but sliding at the same time, although it was angled just ever so slightly.
      </p>
      <p>

        http://i.imgur.com/gzVtUkE.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This also explains why the front driver's side tire was ripped off and deflected to the right instead of following the path the engine ultimately took. It actually struck the right side of the pipe.

       You think in a city of 3.8 million people and mere blocks from a Santa Monica Blvd. commercial district that there wouldn't be enough water pressure for one man to run a hose at the same time a backflow prevention valve was venting?

       Very serious. I work in Houston as a general contractor. The blow out looked pretty big and close to the house the hose came from. If there's a small leak pressure is greatly reduced. If there's a blow out the block should be out of water.

       Then you should be aware of the difference between domestic water supplies of potable water and the non-potable use irrigation systems. Los Angles has maintained a non-potable
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaimed_water">
        reclaimed water irrigation system since 1929
       </a>
       for things like parks and golf courses, or the grassy median strip where the accident happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, it's two different sources of water.

       Well if its a bs flow preventer that got knocked off then it was something tying into the main line. If it was no potable then no need for a black flow preventer.

       If. How's the guy gonna put on the attire he had on and grab the hose and hose the more he sprayed it downthe bigger the flames. On te latest CCTV video you see a flare up then a big flare up. That guy was there wiring for the wreck to add whatever he sprayed. Heat gives it as yaws the line being blown out. And him still having so migh pressure and the the flame a getting bigger.

       it has broken free. I don't think there's any data about how much energy it takes for an engine to break free, so all we could tell for sure is that the car was going at least that fast.

       the mounts would've been sheared by the forward inertia of the engine.

       i'm willing to bet if you factor the needed force to roll the engine that far, whatever speed is left from how fast he was going is about what is needed to shear the motor mounts.

       Depends on how much it tumbled. Someone did the math a week or so ago assuming 2/3 of the distance was tumbled (which would be fairly typical) and came up with about 80mph. Tumbling half of the total distance would put it at about 100mph.

       It would have had to have gone extremely high in the air to come down without significant tumbling forward. You'd probably see a bit of a crater or a completely demolished engine if that had happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's too dark in the video and pictures to tell if there are scrapes on the road, but there's definitely a trail of debris and oil where the engine tumbled. Seems like it went fairly straight to the curb, tumbled along the edge of the curb a bit, and then came to a rest barely up on the curb.

       I tweeted the official Mercedes USA twitter handle multiple times asking the same question. Never got a response. I would think a recall would be in order if the explosion was caused by the vehicle itself. My father worked for Mercedes for years before retiring. I showed him the video and asked if cars should do that. He said "fuck no they're not".

       Toyota beat GM and it pissed a lot of people off so they organized a PR campaign against Toyota. The cars are still much better so it was not that effective, but it did have an effect on those people who are more in touch with their TVs than reality. Mercedes does not compete directly with the entire US car market. It is more of a niche product and while they are Germans, at least they are white...

       my Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hastings hit the tree head on right?
       <br/>
       An engine is typically in the fornt of a car, right?  (it was in this case)
how did the engine get from Point A (his car) through point B (the tree) all the way to point C (100+ feet away from the car)?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT. its a fricken engine, theres no scratches on the ground or chips in the street? Did the engine land exactly where it was found or did it fly out and skid? Simple questions break down complex lies

       but isnt the engine essentially in the center of the car? even if its off-center a bit, its still large enough to cross the "middle line" of the car. Plus the camshaft was still attached aswell, which adds even more length. he didnt merely hit the tip corner of the car (obviously) as that would have made him spin out, so he hit it frontal enough to come to a complete stop instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep looking at pictures of his brand of Mercedes and i cant seem to see how an engine can go through or around the tree. but im not a physicist or a detective but it makes no sense to the common man like myself

       firstly, i imagine you're talking about the DRIVEshaft, the camshaft is a part of the engine.
      </p>
      <p>
       he did hit the corner of the car. that's what a front offset collision is. it doesn't make you 'spin-out', it usually makes the car rotate 90 degrees, if it's a solid hit, which it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       the engine didn't go THROUGH a tree, that would be silly.

       there's a video that will show you exactly how his wreck played out. this video is of a test conducted at 40 MPH. hastings was going 80-100 MPH.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you look at where the engine and debris is, you should see that it's in the right place. the road is uneven, it's very possible that his car began to skip, and may not have been facing straight when he hit. probably a little off angle.

       The video is great, im at work now and was only able to get a peak but it looks like it will straighten things out in my head. Good to have a mechanic as a source B)

       to me it's a waste of time to talk about a normal car wreck as if it's some mystical thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       wrecking cars is a science. this one was no different. i can tell it was a high speed wreck, but other than that fairly normal, from the after math of the damage. all the evidence of what happened is laid out in plain sight.

       the car hit as a front offset collision and turned 90 degrees, happens in front offset collisions.

       there's no outrage because it's a stupid thing to be outraged over.

       you think just a mercedes does that? any car in a 100 MPH front offset collision is capable of that. cars smash when they hit shit. when they hit at 100 MPH they really smash.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, most missles go farther than 150-200 feet.
