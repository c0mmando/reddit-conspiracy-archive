    <div class="md"><p>Excerpt from the stupendously awesome book <a href="http://yougetwhatyoupayfor.rwrite.org">&quot;You Get What You Pay For.&quot;</a> Written By A.Person...</p>

<p>Any centralised uprising could swiftly deliver us into fascism, so it’s not highly recommended. When we refuse to subjugate ourselves, those who have the weapons will make it clear for us that we have already completed the job. The services for imprisoning ourselves are no longer needed—the fences are erect. We’ll have to leave the way we came and we didn’t get here overnight. It’s going to take time.</p>

<p>How did we get here? Deals. Zillions and zillions of deals. How will we get out? Deals. Better deals.</p>

<p>Start now. Let every deal you make—count. Let every deal take yourself and someone else one step closer to dignity. Whether that means putting $75 into Grameen Bank instead of using it to pay for dark sex—do it. Whether it means claiming at least the territory of your own bed—refrain from sticking the tyranny in—make love! Whether it means going into the brothel to get your girlfriend out and having your head beaten in with an iron bar. Whatever it takes.</p>

<p>Whether it’s caring for chickens and getting to know them, sharing eggs. Whether it’s blowing up TVs or choosing a search engine that doesn’t leave cookies. If it’s annexing and cultivating land, or harvesting your own electricity… Whether it’s teaching your daughters and sons self defence, if it’s teaching children what heroes are, whatever it is—do it. Use your imagination. Centre your imagination in honour. Start now. Create safer spaces around you. Set out on a hero’s path in pursuit of freedom. Trust that you will influence others to make better transactions.</p>

<p>Zillions and zillions of transactions.</p>

<p>Wait. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Came here to say this. It&#39;s all we need to do. Anyone who knows how ridiculous this system is knows that a major part of that is because it&#39;s unsustainable. Which means it will come to an end all by itself. </p>

<p>All we need to do is stay safe enough to step in when the dust settles and say &quot;Hey, we&#39;ve known this was coming for a while, how about we do something different now?&quot;</p>

<p>In terms of something active? Try to become as self sufficient as possible. Try to &#39;opt-out&#39; as much as possible. Not to the point where you live in the woods in a cabin, but where if it all collapsed overnight, you&#39;d be able to survive. 
Grow your own food, buy solar panels, even just buying more locally would be a great help. Make friends with the neighbours, get fit and healthy, learn new skills, etc etc. If the system ends up in a <em>real</em> state of collapse, all of these things will be essential.</p>

<p>One thing i&#39;m trying to figure out, is how to make sure i only ever have as much money in a bank as i&#39;m prepared to lose... Although i guess if it gets that bad, whatever money i have won&#39;t be much use anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you&#39;re unfortunately right.. It would need a huge mass of people to ignore the system in place to generate something new that couldn&#39;t be suppressed, so spreading the word is definitely a good route.</p>

<p>Going offtopic a little, just out of curiosity to get someone else&#39;s opinion, I have a fear that unless we first figure out how to come to terms with our greed for power and other things, how would things ever change for better even we could overthrow the current leaders and take control? I could see myself in the place of some powerful people and doing all the same bad things they do, because it would feel great. I can fantasize about creating a perfect world for everyone, but in reality I think I couldn&#39;t do it that much better as the dark side would take control if it had the chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree, honesty is the key to everything. But changing the system before we are honest to ourselves wont change much in the end.
There are quite many countries in the world the size of each state, but still there&#39;s the same dishonest people driving the country to the benefit of the few. This problem doesn&#39;t go away with small size, although the scale might to some degree.
But yeah, that wasn&#39;t what you meant, the first step is to open the eyes of others too, maybe a critical mass is needed and things start to change on their own weight, just like they do now but to the wrong direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish it was easier to make people realize when the good takes over the bad. I myself can see bad within me, but I can also choose not to use it. I feel everyone has that choice. I have no fucking idea how to make others realize <em>that</em>, though.. &amp; yes, I feel that is the only thing we can do at this point in time. When the masses become larger, that is when we must make our next move. </p>
