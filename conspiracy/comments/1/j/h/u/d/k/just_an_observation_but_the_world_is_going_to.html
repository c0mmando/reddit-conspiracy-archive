    <div class="md"><p>The thing that just kills me is the ambivilance.  The complete unwillingness to learn from history.  The constant mind-numbing chorus of &quot;This is America!  Couldn&#39;t happen here!&quot;  We forget things so easily, and whenever someone draws a parallel it&#39;s a resounding answer of &quot;That WAS BACK THEN...THIS IS NOW&quot;</p>

<p>It seems like stupidity has actually won.  Like somehow our world was engineered to repeatedly run into a brick wall head first until retardation was the only viable result.  And these are smart people (book-wise) that believe that everything is a-ok, that our government would never hurt us.   Its because of this culture, though, this cocoon of media to condition us to ignore the void that sits right in front of our eyes.</p>

<p>That void, the loss of liberty, living like an animal that has been told they&#39;re being treated well enough times that said animal believes it, is coming.  The abyss creeps up on us every day.  I&#39;m sitting doing nothing.  I admit it.  If you&#39;re on here, so are you.  We&#39;re being swallowed, and with each day this metaphorical machine becomes more blatantly obvious yet callously insidious.</p>

<p>I pray that people will find a way to make this nasty beast upchuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1st off, the UK is fucked and think of it like the older brother of the US.</p>

<p>2nd off, the entire &quot;Russia will destroy your life if you are gay&quot; is sensationalized bullshit. Sure, I wouldn&#39;t walk around advertising it, but I could still say the same thing about multiple US states.</p>

<p>I lived in the US for the first 23 years of my life and in the previous 7 years, I have lived for 6 months to a year in Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Brasil and Serbia and to a lesser extent in France and Italy.</p>

<p>All I can say is that from day one after leaving the US (which was Budapest, Hungary), my entire bubble was burst. I thought Budapest would be some Aladdin-esque shit village with backwards laws and crazy people everywhere. I cannot sit here and name every specific of why the rest of the world is not AT ALL what you assume it is from US media/movies/television/etc...</p>

<p>But I can tell you that I had never left the country and when I did 7 years ago, I decided that I could never trust again the assumptions of the people in my country about the rest of the world.</p>

<p>You just have to see it for yourself.</p>

<p>I feel like I have MUCH more freedom, even in Serbia. I am allowed to be an adult here, I am not treated like a child and completely tied up in stupid laws like not being able to enjoy a beer outside of a bar while my friends smoke a cigarette. </p>

<p>Also, the way the cities are formed is far superior to the US grid. I haven&#39;t had or needed a car in 7 years and if I want to rent one, it is super easy, but why rent one? I can go to the other side of Europe for a $20 dollar bill, by plane, if I plan ahead.</p>

<p>I was once able to do a 15 city tour through 6 countries, every plane ticket was .01 cent plus airport tax which ended up around 20 bucks a piece. I can stay in hostels and meet people from all over the world, there are money exchanges EVERYWHERE, and the general vibe of Europe is great because countries are all so close together so they are already tolerant and accommodating for foreigners as part of their culture. The exact opposite of the US.</p>

<p>In Brasil, 6 years ago, the cars were running either completely on Sugar-Cane or were hybrids. I was blown away at how I had never even heard of that in the US. And the people were the nicest people I have ever met, because I was from the US, everywhere I went they would have me sample things for free, the entire culture was very family-oriented and it was the first time in my life where I felt absolutely zero racism amongst anyone.</p>

<p>I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the US, it is where I am from, it is my home. But I have had my US-based image of the world, fully-shattered and it scares me that I was intentionally led on to believe such a load of BS.</p>

<p>Also, I was in Istanbul a few months ago and it was fucking lovely. One of the coolest places eve. At the same time, I was reading sensationalized bullshit about Istanbul and seeing people who have never even left the US talk about cancelling their plans and crossing the city off of their visit-list.</p>

<p>Did you know that 21 people were murdered in NYC over a single weekend, like 2 months ago? Does that really represent the average person or experience in that city? Hell no. But imagine if you sensationalized that headline and the media spouted it all around the world. The only difference is that the rest of world is so used to travel and bordering multiple other nations, so they aren&#39;t stuck in a bubble like the US. Add to that, a media that scares the fuck out of you on a daily basis. And theres the problem!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would recommend a little travel, just to get a taste. The cheapest time to travel across the ocean is between the end of October and February. My friends and I once got round trip tickets to Amsterdam from Baltimore for $400 bucks round-trip, a week or two after Christmas. But that was a real deal!</p>

<p>And then we hopped a train from Amsterdam to Berlin for very cheap. And don&#39;t trust any of that Eurorail pass bullshit, those are the biggest scams ever. Stay in a youth hostel, most are extremely clean and reasonably priced, even if you request a private room.</p>

<p>Travel well!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I have a bad habit of swearing and sometimes it distorts my actual point.</p>

<p>I love the UK personally, but from a US point of view, it is much different from the rest of Europe. But most US citizens are not well-traveled and know pretty much nothing about the rest of the world, so when they look at, lets say, the UK surveillance state, or the &quot;ban on porn&quot;, they assume that the rest of Europe will soon follow, when the reality is that the UK/Australia/and North America are far more connected and tend to follow one another&#39;s lead.</p>

<p>The UK, and probably Germany, are two parts of Europe where I can get anything and know that when I am there, things are going to be more efficient and &quot;normal&quot; for me, then say Serbia, or even places like Italy.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how many people go to the UK and come home and start making generalized statements about Europe. That would be like me going to NYC, Miami, and San Francisco and then coming home to make generalized statements about the US.</p>

<p>Fucked was definitely the wrong word and I didn&#39;t mean it in a bad way, I meant it more like, &quot;Listen, lets not even get into the UK&quot;, because I feel like a discussion about would be too complex to have with someone who has never left the US.</p>

<p>And I guess I drifted towards the word &#39;fucked&#39; because the UK political system is getting pretty weird and it seems like the people there are kind of letting bad things get even worse. </p>

<p>But don&#39;t worry!!! You don&#39;t even want me to get started on how I feel about the US. The word &#39;fucked&#39; wouldn&#39;t even begin to describe how I feel about it. I could start a rant that would go on for hours. </p>

<p>There is a reason I left. I am scared for my country. At least the UK has the wisdom of experience engrained in its society and culture. My country is like a spoiled child who isn&#39;t very bright, but who grew big and strong and realizes that it can get what it wants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting perspective. I don&#39;t know enough about politics or global affairs to really have a decent well-backed opinion. I have only ever lived in the UK, so would probably come across as inexperienced when comparing countries but I do feel that the UK is a place where you can feel totally safe, and for a lot of people that&#39;s what matters. I have never really had to worry about the politics of the UK. In a sense that makes it a great place to be.
It&#39;s funny that you get people basing their opinion of Europe on their experience in the UK! We as a country feel so detached from the rest of Europe we often say things like &#39;Im going to Europe for my next holiday&#39;, or I had a mate tell me that the festival we went to last week &#39;almost felt like a European festival&#39;! It was a major face-palm moment. It annoys me that we cant put in the effort to at least make it sound like we think we&#39;re part of Europe!
I guess you&#39;re right in that fucked probably was a strong choice of word considering your opinion! No worries though, I often exaggerate my opinions, and how better to do so than that! 
Your description of america and the UK really made me think. You have an impressive ability to express your opinion (or just fact) in a thought-provoking manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the average person this may sound outlandish but here&#39;s a stretch on a conspiracy about why they wanna destroy his career in politics. </p>

<p>Initially Weiner was ahead in the polls. Then more of this sexting came out and it&#39;s being driven to a point where the MSM wants his career to be over. </p>

<p>The only thought I have is, maybe they can&#39;t trust him in a higher office. Imagine how sloppy and bad he&#39;s keeping these secrets of his personal life out of the press. Imagine if he was elected to mayor of NYC. A large testbed for NWO stuff. Police state, operatives in the shadows, controversial laws. What are the odds if he&#39;s the top dog in NY that he would let the cat out of the bag on all the conspiracy shit in NYC since 9/11?</p>

<p>If you were NWO, would you trust Weiner with the secrets NYC is hiding about everything? Imagine Weiner telling some woman on Twitter about some secret stuff?</p>

<p>They want to cover their bases and make sure a tight lipped &quot;yes man&quot; gets elected to run NYC. </p>

<p>This Weiner witch hunt is creepy. The fourth estate should go after people already elected and in power, not subvert the election process.</p>

<p>I think Weiner is a creep, and I would  never vote for him, but its not my call. Its up to NYC. Let them decide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/07/29/weinstein-lets-stop-the-crazy-huma-abedin-conspiracies/">Some interesting info about Weiner&#39;s wife</a></p>

<p>Unrelated:</p>

<p>I&#39;m having trouble trying to find the article I had in mind, but shortly after the Weinergate (his first scandal), I remember reading an article about how somehow Weiner pissed off Bush because he exposed something that Bush didn&#39;t want out.</p>

<p>This is the whole reason the Weiner scandal came to light in the first place.  It wasn&#39;t because he was &#39;caught&#39;, it was because they wanted him out for not playing along with the game.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have anything more specific, I&#39;ll keep looking.</p>

<p>Edit:  I was thinking of Eliot Spitzer not Weiner....  <a href="http://www.rense.com/general81/why.htm%E2%80%8E">Spitzer pissed off Bush</a></p>
