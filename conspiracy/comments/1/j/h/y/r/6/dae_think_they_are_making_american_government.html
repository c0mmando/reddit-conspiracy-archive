    <div class="md"><p>As of lately I haven&#39;t been so sure of the inevitability of the dollar collapse, at least anytime soon. I could be wrong but I&#39;m willing to entertain all possibilities here. This is my understanding...</p>

<p>The dollar is the World&#39;s reserve currency. I just found out what this really means:
1. It&#39;s the most popular currency in the world.
2. The currency most stored by the world&#39;s central banks.
3. The currency used to price international commodities.</p>

<p>Knowing that the Fed is actually a private entity controlled by elitist international banking cartel with total control over the printing and lending of the money, why would they give up their control and let the dollar crash? It seems as though it&#39;s in their best interest to keep the dollar in tact and in place as the world&#39;s reserve currency.</p>

<p>If you think about the dollar as the product itself, the people controlling that product reap the benefits the more people use that product - the more people around the world using the dollar as currency only solidifies the Feds control. </p>

<p>Just had this thought the other day. Could be way off but I thought I&#39;d put it out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fed doesn&#39;t really have a choice in this matter.</p>

<p>Also, The Fed is an outgrowth of a larger governing body, The World Bank. So if The Fed is destroyed or otherwise compromised, there are systemic redundancies that make it&#39;s loss a set back, but not much of one. For the World Bank, I mean. For Americans, it will be devastating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing keeping the dollar from collapsing is oil.  Google &#39;petrodollar&#39;, but basically all the world&#39;s oil is exported in USD, so countries are forced to buy/borrow/trade for USD, giving the US a distinct upper hand in trade.  The proof of this is in the pudding - Saddam was trying to sell oil in Euros, Ghaddafi in gold, and until recently Syria and Iran had plans for pipelines to east Asia, where China and India have already agreed to pay in non-USD currency/bullion.  As soon as countries can get oil without paying in dollars, we are fucked.</p>

<p>The truth is, the people in charge will do whatever it takes to maintain the legitimacy of the dollar, whatever the cost, because if the USD falls, the entire world will too, and so will all that power.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The only thing keeping the dollar from collapsing is oil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only think keeping the petrodollar in circulation is the U.S. military and its current status as the biggest bully on the block.  <em>That&#39;s</em> what&#39;s keeping the US dollar from collapsing and no longer being the world&#39;s reserve currency:  Not oil, but the military forcing everyone to continue trading oil in US dollars (the petrodollar).  Every time somebody tries to get off the petrodollar - Saddam, Ghaddafi, etc - the US military comes in and kills them.  The only thing keeping the petrodollar (and thereby the US dollar&#39;s status as the world&#39;s reserve currency) in place is the fact that the US military is there to scare other country&#39;s into not abandoning it or &quot;or else&quot;.</p>

<p>My gf the other day said when I explained this to her that it sounds a lot like the type of m.o. the mafia uses to offer &quot;protection&quot; to a neighborhood.</p>

<p>...O_o.  Holy shit.  I just realized that this is yet ANOTHER reason why the US doesn&#39;t support electric cars and such technology.  If it does, electric and nuclear technology diminishes the power of oil, and if the technology spreads globally (which it absolutely would), then <em>no one</em> would need or use oil, and if no one uses oil, then they won&#39;t use the petrodollar and the US will loose all power in the world.  No petrodollar status.  No reserve currency status.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s so important for the US to not only keep electric cars and technology from taking off here in the states, but from really taking off anywhere on the entire damn planet.</p>

<p>O_o.  Damn.  I&#39;ve always known the US was evil as fuck, but damn...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So maybe all these wars/invasions as of lately, starting with Iraq in 03 are really about maintaining the petrodollar.  So these really are banker&#39;s wars, funded and fought by US citizens so the owners of the dollar can keep it in place. So if we look at Iraq, Syria, Libya (and soon Iran) in this context, of trying to keep the petrodollar in place, these wars are actually &quot;good&quot; for the American people...the benefit to the citizens being an unintended consequence really, similar to being a subject on the side of the winning castle, your life as a subject stays intact, you might enjoy a few spoils of the war but it&#39;s not about you, it&#39;s about your owners and what power and resources they have. </p>
