       Alas, so true.  And to think that I voted for him.  Once thinking that any Democrat would have to do better than bush, and again because I really wanted to believe that he would do better in a second term.  The only thing he's done better is more of the same...
      </p>
      <p>
       And I find myself STILL feeling that he is better than the other guy would have been.. both times.

       hey y'all. I copied this comment around the last election with proof of Obama being an expansion of GWB. here is the comment though I'm not sure who originally posted
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope links still work
      </p>

       "100% of Americans should know that Obama has closely followed the policies of Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       The content below is from a comment that was deleted. I was able to copy it before that occurred, however. It deserves scrutiny so close to election day, regardless of which political candidate or party you support.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Oh and Obama has already very closely followed the policies of former President George W. Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       -On December 31, 2011, Obama signed the NDAA (
       <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text">
        http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text
       </a>
       ), giving him the ability to indefinitely detain any U.S. civilian without charge or trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Obama supports internet censorship/surveillance. He plans to issue an executive order this year that resembles CISPA if the bill is not passed. (

        http://rt.com/usa/news/white-house-cispa-order-821/
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       -Despite his claims, Obama has killed thousands of people, including civilians and children, with drone strikes. (

        http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drone-data/
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       -The president redefined the word ‘militant’ to mean ‘all military-age males in a strike zone’. This allows him to refer to civilians killed in a drone strike as ‘militants’ to avoid counting civilian deaths. (
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;amp;_r=2&amp;amp;amp;">

      </p>
      <p>
       -President Barack Obama signed the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act of 2012 earlier this year allowing 30,000 drones to be used on U.S. soil by law enforcement, government agencies, corporations, etc. (

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       -Recently, the Obama Administration told a federal court that civilians have no “reasonable expectation of privacy” in cellphone location data, and hence the authorities may obtain documents detailing a person’s movements from wireless carriers without a probable-cause warrant. (

      <p>
       -When journalist Abdulelah Haider Shaye reported on a U.S. drone strike that killed 14 women, 21 children and more in Yemen, he was arrested and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. After public outcry, Yemen’s president nearly released Shaye until Barack Obama called him on February 2, 2011 to request Shaye remain imprisoned. (

And work on this agreement has been done in an underhanded way that seems designed to keep details of it secret from the American public, perhaps to minimize opposition to it.(

       In June 2008, in the middle of the 2008 Presidential election campaign, Cheney had a rare press conference.  He wasn't concerned about McCain/Republicans winning the election.  He wasn't concerned about the election at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, he was so
       <strong>
        "lighthearted"
       </strong>
       that his mood was a news story itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the press event, Cheney quipped:
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/washington/03cheney.html">
        " ...
        <em>
         I might whisper in Senator Obama's ear and change his whole view
        </em>
        ..."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Cheney already know who was going to be president?
      </p>
      <p>
       No?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then why would he need to change Obama's view?  Why not McCain's?  Why not Hillary's?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would Cheney be lighthearted?  If he was certain that Obama would be the president, wouldn't Cheney be concerned about his own prosecution for war crimes?
      </p>
      <p>
       What
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-526811.html">
        magic, hypnotic phrase
       </a>
       would Cheney whisper to control Obama?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-526811.html">
        <em>
         "We understand that hearing us say this phrase is important to you," said Police Chief Moose in an open address to the then-unknown D.C. sniper.
        </em>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  It's too bad, but the video of Cheney making this statement is no longer available on the Internet.  If anyone has access to the TYT archives, it's available there from June 2008.

       Abner Mikva, the former Chicago congressman, federal judge and White House counsel to President Bill Clinton, puts a 21st-century twist on the notion that Clinton was "the nation's first black president." 
"I think when this is all over, people are going to say that Barack Obama is the first Jewish president," he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mikva, a powerful figure in local and national Democratic politics for decades, was one of Sen. Obama's early admirers, beginning in 1990 when he tried to hire the brilliant student and first black president of the Harvard Law Review for a coveted clerkship. (Obama turned him down, saying he was going to move to Chicago and run for public office. "I thought that showed a lot of chutzpah on his part," Mikva says with a laugh.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, Mikva's support for and nurturance of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has never wavered. He is one of many influential Chicago Jews who have been among Obama's earliest and most ardent backers.
      </p>
      <p>
       One longtime Jewish observer of the political scene, who did not want to be identified, said admiringly that "Jews made him. Wherever you look, there is a Jewish presence."

       I think what would be exhausting, but useful, would be to find all the little underlings that stayed in their positions under the change of president. There's no way to deny that from the republican morons. I don't remember any names unfortunately, but the head of the Intelligence Committee or something like that stayed the same under Bush and Obama.

       I mean I'm new to this sub but whatever, in my view presidents seem to pick a singular issue and tackle it, and everything else just stays the course out of precedent, like I think everyone forgot that Obama wanted his "legacy" to be affordable healthcare,  like Bush was national security, Clinton was trade and commerce and the list goes on , I mean I'm not x composing that I'm able to stay on my parents healthcare now until I'm 26 (or 24 I think I forgot)  cause I know I wouldn't be able to buy it for myself, and for the first time in 6 years my aunt working minimum wage will actually have health insurance, now that was of topic and what not, I just stumbled here browsing articles and thought I give my two cents

       Passing a national healthcare plan in the face of 50+ years of furious opposition was and is an astonishing accomplishment. When you lose your job in a year and get cancer 2 years later, you'll kiss Obama's ass in thanks.

       In June 2008, in the middle of the 2008 Presidential election campaign, Cheney had a rare press conference.  He wasn't concerned about McCain/Republicans winning the election.  He wasn't concerned about the election at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, he was so
       <strong>
        "lighthearted"
       </strong>
       that his mood was a news story itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the press event, Cheney quipped:
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/washington/03cheney.html">
        " ...
        <em>
         I might whisper in Senator Obama's ear and change his whole view
        </em>
        ..."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Cheney already know who was going to be president?
      </p>
      <p>
       No?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then why would he need to change Obama's view?  Why not McCain's?  Why not Hillary's?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would Cheney be lighthearted?  If he was certain that Obama would be the president, wouldn't Cheney be concerned about his own prosecution for war crimes?
      </p>
      <p>
       What
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-526811.html">
        magic, hypnotic phrase
       </a>
       would Cheney whisper to control Obama?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-526811.html">
        <em>
         "We understand that hearing us say this phrase is important to you," said Police Chief Moose in an open address to the then-unknown D.C. sniper.
        </em>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  It's too bad, but the video of Cheney making this statement is no longer available on the Internet.  If anyone has access to the TYT archives, it's available there from June 2008.
