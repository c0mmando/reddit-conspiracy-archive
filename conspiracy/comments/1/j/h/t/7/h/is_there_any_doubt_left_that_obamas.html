    <div class="md"><p>hey y&#39;all. I copied this comment around the last election with proof of Obama being an expansion of GWB. here is the comment though I&#39;m not sure who originally posted</p>

<p>I hope links still work</p>

<p>&quot;100% of Americans should know that Obama has closely followed the policies of Bush.</p>

<p>The content below is from a comment that was deleted. I was able to copy it before that occurred, however. It deserves scrutiny so close to election day, regardless of which political candidate or party you support.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Oh and Obama has already very closely followed the policies of former President George W. Bush.</p>

<p>-On December 31, 2011, Obama signed the NDAA (<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text</a>), giving him the ability to indefinitely detain any U.S. civilian without charge or trial.</p>

<p>-Obama supports internet censorship/surveillance. He plans to issue an executive order this year that resembles CISPA if the bill is not passed. (<a href="http://rt.com/usa/news/white-house-cispa-order-821/">http://rt.com/usa/news/white-house-cispa-order-821/</a>)</p>

<p>-Despite his claims, Obama has killed thousands of people, including civilians and children, with drone strikes. (<a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drone-data/">http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drone-data/</a>)</p>

<p>-The president redefined the word ‘militant’ to mean ‘all military-age males in a strike zone’. This allows him to refer to civilians killed in a drone strike as ‘militants’ to avoid counting civilian deaths. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;amp;_r=2&amp;amp;amp;">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;amp;_r=2&amp;amp;amp;</a>)</p>

<p>-President Barack Obama signed the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act of 2012 earlier this year allowing 30,000 drones to be used on U.S. soil by law enforcement, government agencies, corporations, etc. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/18/technology/drones-with-an-eye-on-the-public-cleared-to-fly.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/18/technology/drones-with-an-eye-on-the-public-cleared-to-fly.html</a>)</p>

<p>-Obama granted immunity to all government officials involved in torturing detainees. (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/us-cia-detainee-prison-deaths">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/us-cia-detainee-prison-deaths</a>)</p>

<p>-When a federal judge barred the white house from indefinitely detaining U.S. civilians, the Obama Administration appealed the decision and won the ‘right’ back. (<a href="http://anarcho-queer.tumblr.com/post/31832562803">http://anarcho-queer.tumblr.com/post/31832562803</a>)</p>

<p>-The Obama Administration and Lamar Smith (the creator of SOPA) are working together to have FISA passed. FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) allows the government to electronically eavesdrop on Americans’ phone calls and e-mails without a probable-cause warrant. (<a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/09/house-approves-spy-bill/">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/09/house-approves-spy-bill/</a>)</p>

<p>-When ACLU challenged the constitutionality of FISA, the Obama Administration asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the challenge. (<a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/obama-administration-asks-supreme-court-dismiss-aclu-challenge-warrantless">http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/obama-administration-asks-supreme-court-dismiss-aclu-challenge-warrantless</a>)</p>

<p>-Internet censorship has increased under Obama. The government has seized more than 750 domains in the past two years under a program called “Operation in Our Sites.” (<a href="http://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/library/factsheets/pdf/operation-in-our-sites.pdf">http://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/library/factsheets/pdf/operation-in-our-sites.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>-William Binney, a former official with the National Security Agency, recently said that domestic surveillance in the U.S. has increased under President Obama, and trillions of phone calls, emails and other messages sent by U.S. citizens have been intercepted by the government. (<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/exclusive_national_security_agency_whistleblower_william">http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/exclusive_national_security_agency_whistleblower_william</a>)</p>

<p>-Recently, the Obama Administration told a federal court that civilians have no “reasonable expectation of privacy” in cellphone location data, and hence the authorities may obtain documents detailing a person’s movements from wireless carriers without a probable-cause warrant. (<a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/09/feds-say-mobile-phone-location-data-not-constitutionally-protected/">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/09/feds-say-mobile-phone-location-data-not-constitutionally-protected/</a>)</p>

<p>-The Obama Administration argued in court earlier this year that they can spy on U.S. civilians with impunity. (<a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/05/warrantless-spying-challenge/">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/05/warrantless-spying-challenge/</a>)</p>

<p>-Even while denouncing Syria’s dictator, Obama has been arming Bahrain’s dictatorship with weapons that has killed several pro-democracy protesters. (<a href="http://rt.com/news/bahrain-iran-double-standards-us-319/">http://rt.com/news/bahrain-iran-double-standards-us-319/</a>)</p>

<p>-When journalist Abdulelah Haider Shaye reported on a U.S. drone strike that killed 14 women, 21 children and more in Yemen, he was arrested and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. After public outcry, Yemen’s president nearly released Shaye until Barack Obama called him on February 2, 2011 to request Shaye remain imprisoned. (<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/3/15/jeremy_scahill_why_is_president_obama">http://www.democracynow.org/2012/3/15/jeremy_scahill_why_is_president_obama</a>)</p>

<p>-Drone strikes have dramatically increased under Obama. From 2000-2008, Bush authorized a drone strike in Pakistan every 28 days. During Obama’s administration, he authorized a drone strike in Pakistan every 6 days. (<a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/01/11/obama-2012-strikes/">http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/01/11/obama-2012-strikes/</a>)</p>

<p>-The Obama Administration is training and arming 15,000 African troops to fight a proxy war in Somalia, possibly violating an UN Embargo. (<a href="http://anarcho-queer.tumblr.com/post/28715375995">http://anarcho-queer.tumblr.com/post/28715375995</a>)</p>

<p>-When a group of lawmakers sought documents that proved the Obama Administration illegally sold guns to Mexican drug cartels, Obama invoked executive privilege for the first time to keep to documents hidden. (<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/20/news/la-pn-obama-invokes-executive-privilege-over-fast-and-furious-documents-20120620">http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/20/news/la-pn-obama-invokes-executive-privilege-over-fast-and-furious-documents-20120620</a>)</p>

<p>-A few months ago, Obama’s trade documents were leaked. The documents revealed the Obama secretly gave big corporations the right to break domestic laws and violate national sovereignty. (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/obama-trade-document-leak_n_1592593.html?ncid=webmail1">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/obama-trade-document-leak_n_1592593.html?ncid=webmail1</a>)</p>

<p>-In 2009, Obama secretly cut a deal with lobbyist group PhRMA to reassure’ that industry would be protected against policies it disliked in exchange for support of the legislation and acceptance of other policies.” (<a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/1322331#.UHbZgsXA_Sg">http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/1322331#.UHbZgsXA_Sg</a>)</p>

<p>-President Obama deported undocumented immigrants at a faster rate then any other president in history. He is also close to deporting more undocumented immigrants than Bush did during his 8-year presidency. (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/20/us-obama-immigration-idUSTRE78J05720110920">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/20/us-obama-immigration-idUSTRE78J05720110920</a>)</p>

<p>-Obama has been extremely strict when it comes to whistleblowers. In fact, he has indicted more whistleblowers under the Espionage Act than all past administrations combined.(<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/11/obama-administration-whistleblowers-paul-harris?newsfeed=true">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/11/obama-administration-whistleblowers-paul-harris?newsfeed=true</a>)</p>

<p>-Income inequality is worse under Obama than it was under Bush. The 1% received 65% of every dollar created from 2002-2007. During the recovery, 2009-2010, the 1% received 93% of every dollar created. (<a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/%7Esaez/saez-UStopincomes-2010.pdf">http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2010.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>-In 2008, Obama promised to increase the federal minimum wage to $9.40/hour. The current minimum wage remains at $7.25. (<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2012/07/24/where-is-obamas-promised-minimum-wage-hike/">http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2012/07/24/where-is-obamas-promised-minimum-wage-hike/</a>)</p>

<p>-Obama has helped close hundreds of public schools nation-wide and replace them with for-profit charter schools. (<a href="http://socialistworker.org/2012/08/29/in-defense-of-public-education">http://socialistworker.org/2012/08/29/in-defense-of-public-education</a>)</p>

<p>-Obama claimed to oppose Free Trade Agreements like NAFTA during the 2008 campaign. But once in office he signed more free trade agreements - the best known of which is perhaps the KORUS FTA. (<a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20111021/WIRE/111029897/1082?p=1&amp;amp;amp;tc=pg">http://www.gainesville.com/article/20111021/WIRE/111029897/1082?p=1&amp;amp;amp;tc=pg</a>)</p>

<p>-The Obama administration is negotiating a further Free Trade Agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. And work on this agreement has been done in an underhanded way that seems designed to keep details of it secret from the American public, perhaps to minimize opposition to it.(<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/07/trans_pacific_partnership_agreement_tpp_could_radically_alter_intellectual_property_law.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/07/trans_pacific_partnership_agreement_tpp_could_radically_alter_intellectual_property_law.html</a>)</p>

<p>-Obama has been carrying out acts of war vs Iran. (<a href="http://www.blackagendareport.com/content/obama-provoking-war-iran">http://www.blackagendareport.com/content/obama-provoking-war-iran</a>)</p>

<p>-For instance, Obama personally ordered cyberattacks against Iran. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html?pagewanted=all">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html?pagewanted=all</a>) The US government considers such cyberattacks to be Acts of War. (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/31/washington-moves-to-classify-cyber-attacks">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/31/washington-moves-to-classify-cyber-attacks</a>)</p>

<p>Followed, or doubled down to make them even worse. Like 93% of GDP growth going to the 1%, instead of 65%. Openly asserting he can have US citizens assassinated (!!!) without any due process whatsoever. Deporting even more undocumented workers than even Bush. The list goes on and on.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In June 2008, in the middle of the 2008 Presidential election campaign, Cheney had a rare press conference.  He wasn&#39;t concerned about McCain/Republicans winning the election.  He wasn&#39;t concerned about the election at all.</p>

<p>In fact, he was so <strong>&quot;lighthearted&quot;</strong> that his mood was a news story itself.</p>

<p>At the press event, Cheney quipped:  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/washington/03cheney.html">&quot; ... <em>I might whisper in Senator Obama&#39;s ear and change his whole view</em> ...&quot;</a></p>

<p>Did Cheney already know who was going to be president?</p>

<p>No?</p>

<p>Then why would he need to change Obama&#39;s view?  Why not McCain&#39;s?  Why not Hillary&#39;s?</p>

<p>Why would Cheney be lighthearted?  If he was certain that Obama would be the president, wouldn&#39;t Cheney be concerned about his own prosecution for war crimes?</p>

<p>What <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-526811.html">magic, hypnotic phrase</a> would Cheney whisper to control Obama?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-526811.html"><em>&quot;We understand that hearing us say this phrase is important to you,&quot; said Police Chief Moose in an open address to the then-unknown D.C. sniper.</em></a></p>

<p>EDIT:  It&#39;s too bad, but the video of Cheney making this statement is no longer available on the Internet.  If anyone has access to the TYT archives, it&#39;s available there from June 2008.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who made Obama?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagojewishnews.com/story.htm?id=252218&amp;amp;sid=212226">http://www.chicagojewishnews.com/story.htm?id=252218&amp;amp;sid=212226</a></p>

<p>Abner Mikva, the former Chicago congressman, federal judge and White House counsel to President Bill Clinton, puts a 21st-century twist on the notion that Clinton was &quot;the nation&#39;s first black president.&quot; 
&quot;I think when this is all over, people are going to say that Barack Obama is the first Jewish president,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Mikva, a powerful figure in local and national Democratic politics for decades, was one of Sen. Obama&#39;s early admirers, beginning in 1990 when he tried to hire the brilliant student and first black president of the Harvard Law Review for a coveted clerkship. (Obama turned him down, saying he was going to move to Chicago and run for public office. &quot;I thought that showed a lot of chutzpah on his part,&quot; Mikva says with a laugh.) </p>

<p>Since then, Mikva&#39;s support for and nurturance of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has never wavered. He is one of many influential Chicago Jews who have been among Obama&#39;s earliest and most ardent backers. </p>

<p>One longtime Jewish observer of the political scene, who did not want to be identified, said admiringly that &quot;Jews made him. Wherever you look, there is a Jewish presence.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what would be exhausting, but useful, would be to find all the little underlings that stayed in their positions under the change of president. There&#39;s no way to deny that from the republican morons. I don&#39;t remember any names unfortunately, but the head of the Intelligence Committee or something like that stayed the same under Bush and Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize there is more to the presidency than illegal wiretaps right? It&#39;s actually a pretty big job involving a lot more than policies on information gathering. If you don&#39;t believe me, go ask all the army divisions in Iraq.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I&#39;m new to this sub but whatever, in my view presidents seem to pick a singular issue and tackle it, and everything else just stays the course out of precedent, like I think everyone forgot that Obama wanted his &quot;legacy&quot; to be affordable healthcare,  like Bush was national security, Clinton was trade and commerce and the list goes on , I mean I&#39;m not x composing that I&#39;m able to stay on my parents healthcare now until I&#39;m 26 (or 24 I think I forgot)  cause I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to buy it for myself, and for the first time in 6 years my aunt working minimum wage will actually have health insurance, now that was of topic and what not, I just stumbled here browsing articles and thought I give my two cents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In June 2008, in the middle of the 2008 Presidential election campaign, Cheney had a rare press conference.  He wasn&#39;t concerned about McCain/Republicans winning the election.  He wasn&#39;t concerned about the election at all.</p>

<p>In fact, he was so <strong>&quot;lighthearted&quot;</strong> that his mood was a news story itself.</p>

<p>At the press event, Cheney quipped:  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/washington/03cheney.html">&quot; ... <em>I might whisper in Senator Obama&#39;s ear and change his whole view</em> ...&quot;</a></p>

<p>Did Cheney already know who was going to be president?</p>

<p>No?</p>

<p>Then why would he need to change Obama&#39;s view?  Why not McCain&#39;s?  Why not Hillary&#39;s?</p>

<p>Why would Cheney be lighthearted?  If he was certain that Obama would be the president, wouldn&#39;t Cheney be concerned about his own prosecution for war crimes?</p>

<p>What <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-526811.html">magic, hypnotic phrase</a> would Cheney whisper to control Obama?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-526811.html"><em>&quot;We understand that hearing us say this phrase is important to you,&quot; said Police Chief Moose in an open address to the then-unknown D.C. sniper.</em></a></p>

<p>EDIT:  It&#39;s too bad, but the video of Cheney making this statement is no longer available on the Internet.  If anyone has access to the TYT archives, it&#39;s available there from June 2008.</p>
