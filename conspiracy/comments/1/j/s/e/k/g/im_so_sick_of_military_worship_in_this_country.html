        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why do I have to respect somebody because they&#39;ve joined the military? </p>

<p>Most of the people that have joined the US Military are either looking for a free pass to commit murder or they&#39;re too fucking stupid to make it in the real world. Seriously... I graduated High School in 2008 and everybody that joined the military was a fucking slacker or a fucking psycho. </p>

<p>I was born in 1990. When in my lifetime has the United States Military fought for my freedom? When have they defended my rights as a US Citizen? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have what it takes to join the armed forces and I commend any person that is willing to give his or her life to defend me and my rights as an American Citizen but I just don&#39;t think that has happened in my lifetime. </p>

<p>Am I misinformed? Am I ignorant? Or has military worship in this country gone completely off the rails? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate these generalizations. The U.S. Army infantry is disproportionately comprised of the sons of white, middle class families and they have an average IQ that is above national average. We did not &quot;fail&quot; in our tasks, we took on the most technical of tasks: surviving the firefight.</p>

<p>Now, your generalization IS somewhat my experience with most lower enlisted personnel in support units that don&#39;t do more than one contract. They see it as a steady paycheck no matter what and they don&#39;t really have to worry about th death and injury that we do.</p>

<p>Note, I said typical INFANTRY enlistee. IMO, trigger pullers are not people who can&#39;t &quot;hack it&quot; elsewhere. Thats the mentality that pisses me off. Some of the best damn men this country produced died over there and people on this sub only want to think of them as mindless, stupid, sociopathic grunts who couldnt hack it in the illusion of culture you call the &quot;real&quot; world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fighting is useful only to fend of those who show no mercy in their willingness to do you harm.</p>

<p>Past that it is completely worthless and needlessly destructive.</p>

<p>This later form is what we&#39;ve been engaged in for years now and quite frankly for most of the history of all time.</p>

<p>Somebody has always been the aggressor.</p>

<p>The time has come, however, where we have all risen above the notion of nation states and false geographical borders that somehow &quot;divide&quot; us even though we all have the internet and are more connected to each other than we ever have been in the entire history of all time.</p>

<p>This is why we now show no support to those who continue to raise up weapons of war and fight for the powers that be so that they can gain more capital and wealth at the expensive of our fellow men.</p>

<p>As an American I will always cherish my second amendment rights as they protect me and all other citizens from harm from not only other citizens that get too out of line, but an absurdly militarized police state and a government that is sliding more and more toward totalitarianism.</p>

<p>I will support a national guard on a small scale because honestly that&#39;s not even that necessary anymore, we have such advanced technology that there&#39;s really no need for such force in numbers.</p>

<p>This is another part of the reason why we do not support the troops. If they were actually defending our freedom then we would see our freedoms being attacked by others, but so far the only people who do so are those in our own government.</p>

<p>The troops go in and invade other territories in order to overthrow regimes which has been made plainly obvious over the course of history, most evidently in Vietnam where we completely didn&#39;t have to go.</p>

<p>Since when has it EVER been any nations duty to &quot;protect democracy&quot; in other parts of the world?</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t we &quot;protect democracy&quot; to Soviet Communist Russia and send our military raging in there?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we &quot;defend democracy&quot; in North Korea and China and &quot;liberate&quot; those people from their oppressors?</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that war is a racket, and that we are all being played hard on a global scale by wealthy elitists who care only for themselves and not the world which they enslave through their evil financial treachery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know who I have respect for? Doctors. That&#39;s something I could never do. I don&#39;t have the discipline or the intellect to make it through medical school. Plus you know, they save people&#39;s lives. I also have respect for Lawyers. That&#39;s another profession that I&#39;m not smart enough to pursue. And teachers. Becoming a teacher isn&#39;t exactly challenging, but putting up with kids day in and day out for 25, 30 thousand dollars a year? That&#39;s honorable. They&#39;re fucking heroes. </p>

<p>Those are all people who are worthy of respect because of their titles. Because when you know someone&#39;s a doctor or a lawyer you know what they&#39;ve had to go through just to get there. When you know someone&#39;s a teacher you know what they have to deal with. (There are bad teachers so perhaps that&#39;s not the best example, but you understand my point.) </p>

<p>I have respect for people from all walks of life, not just doctors, lawyers, and teachers. I have respect for people that have worked hard, that have contributed to society, that have actually done something. Like immunetoshills said, RESPECT IS EARNED. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of people that have been or currently are in the military that are worthy of respect. But my question is why do I have to AUTOMATICALLY respect someone because they&#39;ve decided to join the military? Why do I have to thank someone for their service without having any knowledge of their deeds or sacrifices? </p>

<p>You don&#39;t. As a veteran of Iraq, I&#39;m telling you that you don&#39;t. This thing you&#39;re complaining about is made up. If everyone else, NOT YOU, wants to do this that&#39;s their choice, you can only make choices for yourself. No one is forcing you to show respect to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow lol. I want to respond but based on your committed position I&#39;m sure it will be futile. Let me just ask you this: do you honestly believe people who enlist in the military don&#39;t have to do any work or have any skills to be accepted and remain in the military? If you believe that then you&#39;ve been misled. </p>

<p>And your position that lawyers, doctors, and teachers should be respected just because they went to school and took tests is ridiculous. You absolutely ARE contradicting yourself. Titles and letters after your name don&#39;t automatically warrant respect, respect is earned by an individual. Based on your logic, people without college degrees shouldn&#39;t be respected because in your mind they&#39;ve worked less hard than people who hold a degree. Have you ever had a bad teacher? Have you ever had any interaction with a lawyer? I&#39;ve had both. I&#39;ve had deplorable teachers before and I&#39;ve never met a single lawyer who wasn&#39;t a lying, snaky scumbag. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear you&#39;re just hard-up about the military. I can&#39;t think of any other conclusion based on your brand of logic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m simply saying to become a doctor you have to go through years and years of education and training. I respect that. You don&#39;t have to do shit to join the military, you just sign up. Afterward comes the hard work for some. </p>

<p>People without college degrees absolutely should be respected. Mechanics, plumbers, electricians, there&#39;s a wide array of jobs that you don&#39;t need a degree for that I respect immensely. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve met plenty of lawyers that are great people, and I&#39;ve met plenty of people in the military that are great people. I&#39;ve said it a hundred times there are people in the military worthy of respect, I&#39;m questioning the idea that they are automatically deserving of that respect just because they&#39;ve signed up. </p>

<p>There&#39;s good and bad in every walk of life, nobody is questioning that. But there is no area more glorified and overly respected than the military. Anytime you criticize a soldier people act like you&#39;ve just committed murder in front of them (which is, funny enough, exactly what a lot of soldiers are respected for). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have mental health specialists specifically for med school students. Those kids suffer from mental exhaustion. They live on an average 2-4 hours of sleep a day for the four years of med school and the three to eight years of residency. And all the while they have to work, and study, and take tests, and memorize the most ridiculous amount of information and actually apply it in a life or death situation after being up for 30 hours straight. And they do this for seven to to twelve years AFTER having completed their undergrad, which I&#39;d wager is more mentally demanding than boot camp and basic all by itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until they prove that theyve defended my constitutional rights and freedoms I wont give them that respect. NOTHING our military currently does clocks in on my radar as &quot;necessary&quot;. I also feel like so many people who have joined military/police/jobs in the legal system have forgotten that they have taken an oath to uphold the constitution and the rights of the CITIZENS. They forget/dont care/dont know that the government has no rights its self and if they go along with letting the constitution be violated...&quot;I was just following orders&quot;.</p>

<p>Yeah, if a mass majority of those listed above in my comment started to actually think about what theyre doing and started to stand up and say &quot;NO&quot; things would change pretty quick. You can protest and vote all you want but if the people who are ACTUALLY doing the deeds of the government stop and say no...it ends pretty quick. If you have no one to do the deed the deed doesnt get done. </p>

<p>The problem is too many people think they HAVE to do what theyre told and theyre too terrified to find out what happens if they dont. If the mindset were flipped on a vast majority over night it would take all of a week at the most for these issues to get sorted out.</p>

Look at it this way, if given an order to give their life in combat, they would without hesitation.

    <div class="md"><p>But he is right. Trying to deny the fact that a huge percentage of the people that you went to high school with are slackers and/or stupid makes you look pretentious. </p>

<p>What you are saying is that you are morally superior because you aren&#39;t judgmental. But of course you are. Not only is EVERYONE judgmental (despite their pretensions), you just judged the OP.</p>

<p>People that pretend they aren&#39;t judgmental and the biggest liars. There is no such thing. It is just a matter of what you judge people for. Do you restrict yourself to judging people&#39;s bad behavior? Or do you judge people for superficial crap that is none of your business or accuse everyone trying to influence their environment of being judgmental.</p>

<p>And politically, he is also correct. In my very &quot;patriotic&quot; (read right-wing pro-Republican) neighborhood where I grew up, there was plenty of pro-military bullshit. Out of the many in my high school that surely went to the military, I can only think of one that was not a scary nut job. He was strong academically and entered West Point. He was a nice person that never got into fights and was friendly even to me (the nerd). Everyone else I can think of that may have entered the military was full of asshole.</p>

<p>There is also no denying the many documentaries, reports, and various interviews we have seen of what the real military looks like. They are exactly what we fear. They are people who would likely be in prison for violent crimes if they were civilians.</p>

<p>The only military in the world that commits more war crimes than ours, are the people that we claim are terrorists or the military of repressive dictatorships and warlords. No civilized nation kills civilians like we do. They did in the past, but we did even worse back then. If you want to mention the USSR in Afghanistan, I will mention 4 million civilians murdered by Johnson, Nixon, and Kissinger in SE Asia. That is just one example, there is a very long list.</p>

<p>Being apprehensive of our right-wing pro-military (military fetish) culture is justified. Your calling out the OP for what is basically a true statement about the average military enlistee is a strawman and an ad-hominem attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we&#39;re constantly fed that these things are in the defense of freedom, liberty, and the civilised world, and that these wars are necessary to combat the evil, murderous terrorists that are lurking behind every corner and constantly plotting to kill your innocent family. If that was all true, i&#39;d be signing up tomorrow.</p>

<p>And quite clearly i&#39;m not justifying it, that&#39;s my point. And as for respect, you&#39;re absolutely right, nobody automatically deserves respect for joining the armed forces. Isn&#39;t that what we&#39;re covering in this thread? I thought i&#39;d made my position quite clear, in that i pretty much completely share the opinion of the OP?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But they aren&#39;t, they never are. Ask both sides of a recent war and they will firmly state that they all are defending themselves and their families. </p>

<p>False flag aside, our mindset about the whole world, how to perceive someone different (even in our own society) and how to exclude such behaviors/differences from normal social interactions. All these things are thought to us by the media (which is controlled and censored by a few) ... all these things provoke our reactions in a way they want us to behave, they are immoral and a direct declaration of war against anyone standing in the way of the system (or a perceived different individual) </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see many people standing up and fight on home soil. That&#39;s the thing that takes real courage. Standing up for your people, even if it doesn&#39;t influence you directly or you don&#39;t have any benefits from helping. That&#39;s the kind of people deserving respect... Not the ones running after bread crumbs killing people because they are unable to get a decent job.</p>

<p>I agree, but it also takes knowledge. If we took all out information from the MSM every day, we wouldn&#39;t know we had any reason to fight the people at home.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree that current wars are completely immoral, but that doesn&#39;t mean the people taking part in them are necessarily bad people. Some are, no doubt about it, but they&#39;re the minority. </p>

<p>Look man, you can&#39;t be mad at the people that join the military. Most of them do think that they are doing a good thing. They really think they are freedom fighters. You should also take into consideration most of them come back disillusioned to whats really going on in our foreign policy. Many even commit suicide. You should respect anyone that is willing to defend your freedom to the death, even if the current wars are just chess moves on the world&#39;s board for natural resources. </p>

<p>You should be mad at the chicken hawks that create these wars. The assholes who send men to die so that they can siphon off some military contract money from the American people for there own selfish gain. 
Yes military worship is part of the &quot;real american patriot&quot; bullshit that gets slammed into our face everyday. That is all part of the game. They need to create these soldiers to do their bidding. The best type of slave is the one who doesn&#39;t know he is a slave.</p>

<p>freedom. no. that freedom protection era is long gone. itd be more understandable if they were freedom fighers in ww2. but not now. many of the soldiers dont even believe in the war. they join the military for personal benefit in pay, education, some sick pleasure, whatever. bottom line is they dont give a rats ass about our &quot;freedom&quot; take away all the benefits and incentive of the military and see who still wants to fight for our &quot;freedom.&quot; but i dont blame them. when we live in a society like ours, its hard, near impossible, not to. i sympathize. and like you said, blame the politicians..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at this point in the Afghanistan war you may be right, even though I disagree. But post 9/11 you couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth, most of the people that signed up really thought they were defending us from terrorists and that our freedom was under attack. IMO most still do. Our freedom was/is still under attack, just not from terrorists, but from this machine that has built up in DC. </p>

<p>But all of that is mute, if there was a just war, people that were willing to go fight for us do deserve respect. The &quot;support our troops&quot; bumper stickers has now just devolved into simple war propaganda. </p>

<p>Because what our military actually does (both officially and &quot;accidentally&quot;) is horrifying. </p>

<p>We have and continue to kill innocent humans and do significant damage to the world.</p>

<p>Our military does harm to me, by making the entire world hate America.</p>

<p>Our military does nothing to defend me or my rights or my life. Their sole purpose is to defend the hegemony of the United States of Corporate America.</p>

<p>They day that our military does something for justice, I&#39;ll be the first one to great them with cheers and volunteer to help them in any way possible. </p>

<p>I come from a military family. It isn&#39;t like I haven&#39;t thought of joining many times in my life. It is too late now because I am too old. But each time I considered it, I came back to the thought that I simply would be unable to follow through with a command to kill a person I didn&#39;t believe to be guilty. I would end up being court marshaled for disobeying orders.</p>

<p>The people that do join the military clearly do not have a problem with that.</p>

Do you really those of us that thought we were fighting for our country in Iraq would refuse to fight at home? Fuck no! Lets rumble!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one example;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On September 16, 2007, Blackwater military contractors shot at Iraqi civilians killing 17 and injuring 20 in Nisour Square, Baghdad. The fatalities occurred while a Blackwater Personal Security Detail (PSD) was clearing the way for a convoy of US State Department vehicles transporting diplomats to a meeting in western Baghdad with officials of the United States Agency for International Development. The killings outraged Iraqis and strained relations between Iraq and Washington.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha, Nisour square! Did you know that the radio from the backwater trucks clearly has them saying &quot;They&#39;re wearing IP uniforms and firing at us!&quot;? Did you know the investigative party found lots of 7.62x39 casings at Nisour square but no AK47s, indicating that SOMEONE had fired a whole fucking lot of AK 47 rounds and then removed the weapons(spoiler alert, Blackwater contractors on DoS contracts dont use AK 47s)? This makes it look like they shot civilians.  This kills the truth. Did you know that Eric Prince wanted to bring the Suburbans involved in the incident to the front steps of the capitol building so that THEY could all see for themselved the damage those vehicles sustained by SAF,but congess didn&#39;t allow it? Did you know that the DoS RSOs HATE contractors and even the ones on that mission confirmed they were, in fact, fired upon first by people in IP uniforms?</p>

<p>No, you didn&#39;t know that because you don&#39;t have access to all sides of the story. The MSM has deepdicked you into being it&#39;s little whore. You&#39;re just buying into the media narrative created because the state is a little concerned the groups that could take it down might get some public support.</p>

<p>Blackwater changed its name because someone else bought the company from eric prince and then it was sold AGAIN to a new board of directors causing another name change. It was only 2 times BTW, your facts are fucked again. I wasn&#39;t employed by them, no hard on... I do have a hard on for the truth about things though, unlike you. You just want your feelings vindicated without actually looking at the raw data yourself because it might tell you something other than what everyone else thinks. Expand our empire?

Giving money to Afghans, GIVING, without any contract or promise of return on investment is not equivocal to empire building. it is equivocal to giving the homeless man money cause he doesn&#39;t have as much as you.

Two years into it, the agency’s inspector general had a look at the work thus far and found “little evidence that the project has made progress toward” its goals.&quot;</p>

<p>I find my time is well spent theorizing, speculating and contemplating ideas.  I also believe SM is fine in everyday circumstances, but we&#39;re reaching pinnacles that require a new way to view the world.  We&#39;ve learned so much since SM has been &#39;discovered&#39; and used.  Quantum Physics completely blows SM out of the water and scientists these days are grasping for a new way to measure their observations (which have been proven to affect the actual experiment they&#39;re witnessing).  If simply observing an experiment changes the results - then what are you left with?  This is just one example of how the way we go about things today, isn&#39;t suitable in regards to what we potentially know is out there (Dark Energy, Dark Matter etc ~ which make up more than 90% of the universe).  So you tell me, is SM still an acceptable way to progress when everything we&#39;re discovering is saying otherwise?</p>

<p>Meh, I&#39;m in the same boat.  Couldn&#39;t help poking fun at ya though.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s utter horseshit, but on the whole, i actually agree with the points you make. </p>

<p>I know that humans have the potential to be enlightened, non-violent, peaceful, and prosperous. Do i see us reaching that potential within my lifetime? Or the next generation&#39;s? Fuck no. If i genuinely had to place a bet, whether we&#39;re going to progress past this ridiculous state we&#39;re in now, or we&#39;re going to destroy ourselves over and over again and never learn? Fucking right i&#39;d be putting everything on the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for actually seeing through to the meat of my statement.</p>

<p>I too think that we have that potential.  But after witnessing firsthand the true survival instinct, I also am aware that deep down we are are also fucking animals.</p>

<p>The Military doesn&#39;t operate by brainwashing kids to kill.  It teaches them to use deadly force to keep themselves alive and thrusts them into situations where they will have to kill themselves out.</p>

<p>Train them day in and day out with the same group of people and they will commit even darker atrocities in order to protect those that they deem as their family than what they would commit simply in the name of their own survival.</p>

<p>I suppose that if we are ever to make an attempt at our potential for peace we will first need to admit the truth of our nature, but pride, greed and fear are going to be a tough fight.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. We live with a light coating of civilisation, and while we have the ability to build upon that and make it great, it takes fuck-all to blow it all away and for us to revert to survival instinct, which isn&#39;t pretty in any animal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Active duty Air Force here, and both of your reasons for why people have joined the military are plain wrong. When it comes down to why people join the military you get three real groups. The largest group, in my opinion is the &quot;free school/get away from home&quot; guys, people who can&#39;t afford to go to school and want to under their own terms, or they want to get away from home and experience something new. </p>

<p>The second group is &quot;A steady paycheck to live on&quot; these guys joined because the military provides a steady paycheck and they want that to either make sure they don&#39;t end up living under a bridge and/or provide for their family, this is where a lot of enlistees end up being. They get in, get married and stay in for the steady paycheck. </p>

<p>The third group is misplaced &quot;I want to go do some good for my country&quot; load of crap. These guys are the ones who came in for reasons you suggested, whether it be &quot;let&#39;s kill some hajis&quot; or &quot;i&#39;m too dumb to go to school.&quot; </p>

<p>You&#39;re point about why you should respect someone who enlists? When you enlist you give up everything in your life essentially, you can work 16-20 hours a day, seven days a week. You can be shipped to anywhere in the world and not be able to contact your family to tell them how you&#39;re doing or feeling. You&#39;re held responsible to a code of laws that can hit you harshly if you do something wrong. You&#39;re representing this country across the world and are supposed to project an image of courtesy and professionalism. </p>

<p>Being in the military also means being a part of a legacy, a brotherhood almost, while others chose to go be lawyers, doctors, teachers, scientists, you, a 18-26 year old decided to give up your &quot;golden years&quot; in the service of somethign much larger than yourself, an image, ideal, a way of life, and for that, regardless of what branch and how long you enlist for, if you join, you will have my respect. Without question until you squander it. </p>

<p>They serve many purposes. One of which is to help keep oil prices low so that we don&#39;t get into another 70&#39;s era energy crisis. Another is to have an ally on either side of Iran so that if we chose, we can enclose the last capable Arab government in a dual front war. They serve to make the owners of the contracting companies(to include Al Qaeda) rich. They serve to give our nations 2% per capita sociopath population an outlet so we dont have to deal with their outbursts at home. They serve to advance tactical knowledge. They serve to advance emergency medical procedure knowledge. They serve to give a bunch of people who would otherwise leave college 5 figures in debt a chance at an affordable education. They serve to maintain our military dominance throughout the world, this means China is still having to figure out if it wants to fight us over Taiwan or not. They serve to disallow an opressive theocratic sharia government being established in Iraq when all the foreign jihadists came in and started cutting heads off and preaching sharia. They serve to stop the Taliban  and therefore help better the station of women in Afghanistan A LOT. They serve to establish a place in the middle east where jihadis can more easliy come get their jihad on so that they dont have to waste money flying all the way to america before I kill them.</p>

<p>Soldiers are not tools, they are not robots, they OFTEN take the government they are &quot;tools&quot; of the fuck over! Tools don&#39;t usually kick the carpenter out of the tool shed.</p>

All of the other &quot;problems&quot; you listed as being alleviated by war are perpetuated by the system you serve, why would you fight for a system that leaves its students in massive debt and makes military service or a life of indentured servitude the only other viable option, that system is not worth dying or killing for. Jihadis and wahabis stem out of Saudi Arabia and have always been largely supported by US tax dollars, even today in Syria its the same shit. Saddam Hussein was a Baathist and secular, the Taliban was a lot better than a lot of the warlords and druglords that were running around, and neither of them ever attacked the US. The same corporations that make life difficult for Americans ship jobs over seas and buy trillions worth of junk from China to flood Western markets, your Federal bank prints money for their wars and sells bonds to China.

<p>Ohhhh... so when OPEC fucked us in the 70&#39;s that DIDN&#39;T cause an energy crisis due to not being able to produce enough oil for our society? Thanks for telling me that history is completely wrong. Your statement might have been true before the 50&#39;s... but it&#39;s not today. OPEC controls worldwide oil prices, they&#39;re too powerful and the smaller dogs can&#39;t compete with them so they just follow suit with whatever OPEC does.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Your&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re&quot; are certainly not synonyms. Maybe you need to go back to elementary school. </p>

<p>Allow me to educate you. Synonyms are words with the same or similar meanings. &quot;Your&quot; means belonging to you, related to you, or of you. &quot;You&#39;re&quot; is a contraction of the two words: &quot;You are&quot; as in &quot;You&#39;re not smart.&quot; They don&#39;t have similar meanings at all. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s use them both in a sentence: <strong>You&#39;re</strong> going to have a lot of problems in life if you don&#39;t learn <strong>your</strong> native language. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet another mistake. A Homonym is one of a group of words that shares the same spelling <strong>and</strong> the same pronunciation but have different meanings. That is not the case with your and you&#39;re. They do sound the same, but they are not spelled the same. Homographs are words that share the same spelling regardless of how they are pronounced. Again, not the case here. </p>

<p>The word you are looking for is HOMOPHONES, which are words that have the same pronunciation regardless of how they are spelled. </p>

<p>I think intelligence is a far more valuable trait than you&#39;re making it out to be.

<p>Intelligence useful for survival does not equal a full understanding of the english language. Evidence can be found in the fact that my mother has never done a damn thing to make her any money with her english degree. Knowing things like how to make fire with a bow drill set, where to best shoot the deer to maximize wound and minimize damage to useful meat, etc. are far more useful than knowing the difference between word types of the english language towards facilitating continued existence of our species when/if society collapses and even in the event that it doesnt, pioneers of new planets when our sun goes white dwarf will need that knowledge more than knowing a lot about words.</p>

<p>This is why SF requires a higher intelligence to attend selection? Cause they&#39;re so dumb that they actually weed out the dumb ones?</p>

<p>Actually, it is rare. &quot;Liking&quot; to shoot guns is not the same as being able to draw and put two in the kill zone from 10 meters out in under 2 seconds. Or be able to transition from rifle to pistol with only 1.5 seconds in between when the rifle goes down and the first round comes out of the pistol.</p>

<p>Do you know how to effectively explain the difference between successive bounds and bounding over watch? What is a 3-5 second rush used for? If you have a map and a compass but don&#39;t know where you are, how can you use that map and compass to find your location? You&#39;ve obviously taken the tactical driving courses I have too, right? You know how to properly pit, ram, read a corner to hit the apex, drive in excess of 40mhp in reverse? You know how to properly enter and clear a room with 2 men? How about 4? What if number 1 man button hooks? What is the M855 made out of? What is the maximum effective range for the SAW and 240B on a point target with bipod? Area target with tripod? You obviously also know a lot about machine gun theory, tactical medicine, and small unit tactics like me too, huh? How do you treat a sucking chest wound? What is a tension pneumothorax? Can you start an IV? I can. I have al these skills and knowledge available to me at my will. I have spent most of my adult life learning to operate and survive in the non-permissive environment. I have trained on HIGHLY technical weapons and equipment. I have had to learn to make split second decisions that could end my life or my buddies in the middle of the most chaotic environment on earth.</p>

<p>Yeah, these are real common skill sets and not special knowledge at all. LOTS of people know machine gun theory! Wait, no they&#39;re not and no they don&#39;t. There is, in fact, a special skill set required to be an &quot;operator&quot;. You think you know so much about me but you don&#39;t because you came to the conversation with contempt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling them stupid isn&#39;t fair. There are plenty of people who don&#39;t know what to do with themselves where the military is a great opportunity. That is far from the only reason to people enter the armed forces, but it is one that definitely gives people that might otherwise be a burden something useful to do. It is a valid way to make your way into life, let&#39;s not blame the tool, let&#39;s blame the builder. </p>

<p>Always and forever armies consist of the young settling the arguments of the old. Get mad at the people that run the armed forces, but I think it is perfectly ok to give the actual soldiers a pass and to say they deserve respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that lots of fuckups and people who have nothing better to do join the military, and so do lots of people just for the money and free education - however there are lots of others that join because they honestly love their country and want to make a difference in the world. Sucks that they&#39;re being used by dirty politicians, but if you judge this latter group by their intentions I do believe that they are indeed good, honorable people that deserve some props. </p>

<p>I&#39;d much rather err on the side of caution and show respect than to risk being judgmental towards a good-hearted fellow human and repeating the mistakes made when the troops came home from Vietnam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll chime in and do my best to hit on some of your points.  I had to give a moment and think about how to approach this but I think I&#39;ve figured it out. </p>

<p>I know we&#39;re all fed this bullshit from the news and media and tv and internet and gas station billboards and stickers on cars about &quot;Support the Troops&quot; asking for donations all the damn time. I&#39;m sick of it, you&#39;re sick of it, everyone is. That&#39;s a fact.  But even though it&#39;s in our faces every day it doesn&#39;t mean you have to respect someone because they&#39;re in the military, or saw combat, or deployed or whatever. That is your freedom. The behavior you see when people get out of service or get back from deployment is a term vets like me call &quot;<em>sergeant major&#39;s wife</em>&quot; syndrome.  Where you expect to get everything just because of your status.</p>

<p>Hell, when guys were drafted into the military for Vietnam, saw combat, then came back and people spit on them that created a bitterness. A very long lasting bitterness. And I think that bitterness is a learned behavior for anyone that deploys for a year in a place they really don&#39;t want to be but accept it as part of the job. Or maybe I&#39;m over-thinking it.</p>

<p>All the hero-worship stuff everyone in the comments is talking about basically stems from media outlets over the past 10 years getting <em>behind the troops</em> and the people following suit due to group think. Everyone had the yellow ribbons and american flags all over the place. Superficial patriotism.</p>

<p>That kind of thought is still present after the fact. You were 11 or 12 when large infantry divisions were being deployed to the middle east. I was 18 and part of those first few years of war.  The mindset then was, &quot;holy shit we have to do something they just blew up a fucking building in nyc aaahhh!!!&quot; We didn&#39;t look at it go, &quot;Ah, you know, that has to be an inside job and we&#39;re probably going to be wrangled into a war.&quot; So, without really thinking about it many guys just felt a calling to arms. It felt patriotic to join, not to &quot;look for a free pass to commit murder&quot;.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you a little about my time in the Army. I had a scholarship to go to school, graduated top 15 in my class, did well on my SATs but joined the military right after high school.  Not because I was a fucking slacker or looking for a reason to kill anyone. I just wanted to do something adventurous, something rebellious, something different. My test scores on the ASVAB (aptitude test for military) were so high I qualified for linguist. Now that, I thought, that was cool shit. So I took the language aptitude test (can&#39;t remember the name of it) and qualified for the highest tier of languages. I was assigned Korean and spent a year studying in California but got bored with language school, re-classed to infantry because I was not getting the challenge I wanted or the feeling of <em>serving</em> like I wanted. I don&#39;t regret it one bit. Eventually I was jumping out of planes and doing all kinds of cool stuff. We&#39;d go for runs in Ft Bragg and rub shoulders with bearded CAG guys (Delta) every now and then. It was just a badass experience. I ended up deploying to Afghanistan etc etc came back, got out, went to school, started a company, life goes on...</p>

<p>The reason I wanted to explain to you (and others) about my time in service was because I saw the guys I joined with getting out and saw younger guys replacing those ranks after most of the fighting was done (I say that lightly).  What we all saw happening was young bucks wanting <em>a piece of the action</em>. They wanted to deploy and shoot and get shot at and blow away the enemy and have stories to tell to chicks in bars and become a man through combat.  There&#39;s a big difference between men and women that joined due to 9-11<sup>*(I</sup> know I&#39;m in r/conspiracy) in 2001 and 2002 and people that you probably graduated with in 2008. The mindset is different. Do you see what I mean? If they wanted to join the military, people your age had to sit around for a while listening to the news about the war all the time and finally BAM it&#39;s 2008, &quot;WE&#39;RE GRADUATING AND JOINING THE ARMY/NAVY/MARINES/AIRFORCE!! FUUUUCK YEAH!!! GONNA GETSOME!!&quot;  </p>

<p>I can understand how that would be annoying.</p>

<p>In 2001 we were scared and angry felt helpless.</p>

<p>Now I could go on and on about where we are today and how we&#39;ve been duped into wars etc etc.. but that&#39;s not really the point. This is r/conspiracy after all. You guys have probably touched on all that shit. Part of why I&#39;m subscribed here cause I think it is interesting to discuss.</p>

<p>Anyways, I hope I could help explain why guys you graduated with were fucking slackers and psychos and why you don&#39;t have to respect anyone in the military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really sure what to say except thanks for you input. You make a lot of great points. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever thought about it like that before. My generation was pretty much raised on this support the troops mentality. Kids that are joining now and kids that were joining in 2008 remember 9/11, but they don&#39;t really have an understanding of the magnitude of what it was like that day. I remember feeling like it was the end of the world, but I didn&#39;t really understand what was going on at 11 years old. At that age I bought into the whole idea that we were in danger and our country had to fight back and our soldiers were heroes fighting the good fight. Maybe I grew out of it, maybe I just grew cynical. </p>

<p>If your war is just, I respect your military. I don&#39;t think that the USA has fought any wars since 1945 that have been just according to Just War Theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never respected those in the military. Anyone who willingly inducts themselves into such a rigid, hierarchical system is absolutely mad in my opinion. 
I do have respect for some of the skills these people may have developed. Their physical endurance, driving aptitude or medical knowledge for example. But the actual person is someone so far removed from myself that I struggle to even consider them as human, let alone deserving of my respect.
An unpopular opinion, even here in the uk, but I stand by it.
Some may ask, &quot;why all the hate for those who aren&#39;t like you?&quot; Because they, often unwittingly, make the world a worse place for everyone. Just look at the news, all the stories popping up about corporations, religious institutions or government agencies lying, breaking laws, avoiding taxes and stomping on the rights of innocent people. All down to hierarchical systems that are set up to serve those at the top, at the expense of everyone outside. Sure there are good people in these systems, but they are probably being used as tools by some asshole higher in the chain. I don&#39;t respect the organizations, so by extension I don&#39;t respect those who join.</p>

<p>Lets thank so and so for his service!  Great. But lets remember a lot of these troops are complete assholes who rape and murder for fun. Their human like most of us who arent in the military.

    <div class="md"><p>I love these types of posts because I can talk directly to my target audience...the military....</p>

<p>I have some questions, the first one is the most obvious, and I apologize in advance for shouting</p>

<p>WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU NOT SAVING US!!!</p>

<p>Um it is clear that the government you serve has been usurped by corporate interests that do not serve the people, not only do they not serve the people, they do harm to the people.</p>

<p>Your job is to protect the people, not the government....Why are you not organizing a coup against what is clearly a threat to every man woman and child.</p>

<p>There is no bullet that is as lethal as an economic bullet. By continuing the imperialist acquisition of other countries petroleum to feed the petro dollar reserve you are not doing a service to the people, you are serving the central banks.</p>

<p>So what I really see the military as is&#39; a buncha of people who are kept separate yet together, highly trained and equipped by the use of borrowed currency, curreny that will enslave the citizens you protect with debt...ie your family....and then once you have been trained and given orders as a collective, that you can not individually come together as a collective to understand that what you are doing to us, the people that you are supposed to serve, is the exact opposite of what you are supposed to be doing....why can&#39;t you see what you are doing to us, and thus yourselves?</p>

<p>The house, senate and executive branch have been compromised, they do not serve the people, theyt serve the central bank that clearly is in charge of the situation as they are in charge of our currency supply.</p>

<p>The direct threat to me, you and every single person on this planet is the central bank that is enslaving all with debt.</p>

<p>Instead of doing what you are doing now, you should be disobeying orders...using your training and equipment to hunt down and bring to justice the owners of the central banking empires that are doing thios to us...The information on where these individuals reside is obtainable information.</p>

<p>You are letting a company, a corporation destroy this nation, please, do the right thing and disobey your &quot;orders&quot; and bring justice to us and let us be able to move forward with peace and prosperity for all...</p>

<p>if you do not know about central banking by now, I urge you to educate yourself and know your true enemy, it is the one you are serving....
&#39;
please,please,please help us....we are slowing having our live eroded</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am imploring you, and anyone like you that you know...</p>

<p>There are very few ways out of our current situation, really only 2 that I see.</p>

<ol>
<li>collectively the people stop using the money, as that is what this really is all about, money. It is the faith and use of currency created as debt that has done this to us</li>
</ol>

<p>or 2.</p>

<p>The military somehow steps in and save us, and in essence the world.</p>

<p>If there ever was a movment to get going, it would be for the common person to ask anyone they know in the military...</p>

<p>&quot;why are you not saving us?&quot;</p>

<p>and to anyone in the military who is talking with others in the military, why are we not saving the people and in essence ourselves?</p>

<p>this is as easy as doing some warrant style arrests, rounding up the owners of the central banks and their immediate directors so as to stop the ability for top down orders to disseminate.</p>

<p>Then step in and suspend the current administration, have immediate open elections to replace the current usurped positions.</p>

<p>The people must start treating the military with the respect it deserves, but only when the military realizes that it is our only hope....</p>

<p>We are not the enemy, we are the people. Please help us.</p>

<p>Regardless of what your motivations for joining were/are, if you do not stand up for yourselves, your families and people you do not even know. Eventually you will have to reassimilate back into the civilian life. You will have NOTHING to assimilate back into if you do not stop this one single corporation that is both your master and our tormentor.</p>

<p>Enough of you must simply gain the courage to do it. Know that the truth of what central banking is has been exposed, and there are enough people who understand and will support your actions.</p>

<p>True leaders are not voted into leadership, they those who show strength and step up when no one else will, and those who will risk their lives for what is right for not only themselves but for all.</p>

<p>If your reading this and your not in the military, not paid to downvote or counter what I am saying...and this post is not in shadowban....please lets start together, in large droves, asking the military to save us....please save us from a life of economic despair that will not only effect us the people, but you the soldier...</p>

<p>that&#39;s the thing, people are looking at you as if you are the problem, the &quot;thing&quot; that will take our liberty. the ones who will stuff us in camps....</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see you like that, I see you as the ones who can be our knights in shining armor the ones who can rescue us...</p>

<p>I&#39;m am simply begging you, all of you for help...and I think that&#39;s the problem...</p>

<p>we, civilians, have through propaganda , been trained to fear you, to see you as not us, when you are very much us, and we you</p>

<p>So instead of us, the people fearing you, we must simply ask you to help us...</p>

<p>Please, help us, only you have the training and equipment to do it.</p>

<p>I think you just need to know that we need your help</p>

<p>no one has simply asked nicely</p>

<p>please help, someone hs to stop these people, their killing us and they are killing you...</p>

<p>if you are real, simply share this post with others that you know who are in or connected to the military and know that some of us still believe in you and that somehow you will find a way to save us from these evil, evil people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you specialist Weber...all a man can do is the best that he can....</p>

<p>I would all most guarantee that a majority, at first, is not needed....what I think the military needs to see, is enough men step forward...then like dominoes the rest will fall in line....many in the military know what is wrong and what the problem is, but are too afraid to act.</p>

<p>If enough men will step up and act, I know others will join the fight...</p>

<p>and there will be no fight, all you have to do is arrest a bunch of old assholes and put them in jail....I&#39;m pretty sure the only thing you guys will need are handcuffs</p>

<p>I feel the best approach is for the lower ranking individuals to form some type of consensus and then to approach the commanding officers as a group, and thus up the line until enough soldiers are aware and there is a group consensus that form a majority...</p>

<p>at that point it pretty much comes down to doing it...now I am not suggesting any violence, just the opposite, the killing and war will stop when the central bankers are in jail and our currency has been returned to a nationalized debt free monetary system....we need to put good people, such as myself, in office who understand the role of money in our society and that it must not be allowed to be debt based and privately owned....this is a crime family that has operated since 1694, the only reason the keep on coming back is because they have remained free enough to keep on coming back...like a bad horror movie....they need to be stopped once and for all...and the world must be educated on the evils of money printed as debt...there is NO power equal to the usa armed forces...I say its time to step up and do what your supposed to do...protect the people....and I also think it is time for we the people to ask for your help....if you have &quot;balls&quot; post this link to the military forum...it would be interesting to see what the response would be....i&#39;m not sure if they would have the courage to speak freely however?...it will take courage and the will of the people...</p>

We are just as hated and just as powerful and idly sitting by. The reservists and guardsman alone outnumber the police and such. We are just as trained and possibly even better trained.

    <div class="md"><p>Just a guy who used to run a small construction company, was one of the best at the time, lots of famous clients.... but basically forced out, LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE I KNOW...because of being over burden by government regulations and over taxation....</p>

<p>they want 40% and have made it basically &quot;illegal&quot; and or created an environment where NO ONE can play by all their rules....in short time, ones dream, running their own business, becomes their worst nightmare, just like home ownership became for many....</p>

<p>basically my understanding of the country was that it was a place with opportunity and freedom ....and that has lots of that has to do with MONEY....&quot;freedom/economic freedom&quot; in many ways was what they were talking about in 1776....but because no one formed a coup back then and focused on rounding up ALL of them....they were able to keep coming back....Jackson should have gone international and imprisoned them, shut them down forever, and basically EDUCATE THE MASSES about money printed as debt....no one can pull the scam if everyone knows how it works......</p>

<p>the problem again central banking, money printed as debt</p>

<p>a company, a corporation is DESTROYING THIS PLACE ...for all, civilian and soldier alike.....</p>

<p>if I said &quot;hey, cocacola is killing us all, we must stop drinking it and stop them&quot; somehow I don&#39;t think anyone would be too hard pressed to do it....</p>

<p>we have the SAME EXACT THING....cept&#39; cola is not the product MONEY IS THE PRODUCT...</p>

<p>currency is NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A PRODUCT THAT IS CREATED  AND THEN &quot;SOLD/LOANED&quot; TO THE PEOPLE..</p>

<p>THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT A CLEAN DEBT FREE MONETARY SYSTEM FOR THE CITIZENS....</p>

<p>NOT PROTECT A CREDIT SCAM FOR A BUNCH OF GANGSTERS...</p>

<p>No not only will you not be taken down, there are people that would volunteer to climb down a 500 sewer pipe in order to slap cuffs on these assholes...</p>

<p>we are talking about a small group of people and their associates...the creators of this money as debt nightmare....</p>

<p>for example if builderberg meeting were stormed....a large part of that group would be the people, however, they certainly would be able to lead you to the owners, however many would be there....</p>

<p>Jp morgan,goldman sachs,nm Rothschild, moses sief, cheveron ....to name a few....these and others are the owners of the central banks</p>

<p>I do not trust anon....I believe them to be &quot;them&quot; and it is a trap to route out dissidents as well as blackmail and procour new talented hackers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, but I think there is one reason to join the military you may have overlooked: <strong>Money.</strong></p>

<p>There are plenty of people I know that have joined the military simply because they need funds for college or for their family and don&#39;t really have any other choice. With the ever-growing rise in college tuition a lot of people are taking advantage of the &quot;Free College if You Don&#39;t Die&quot; offer they have going. In quite a few cases the military (no matter the branch) will support a man, his wife, and his children all towards compensation for enlisting and making it through the necessary training.</p>

<p>I find it very interesting to ask those in the military why they actually enlisted... what are they fighting for? And they, more often than not, say they don&#39;t have a choice. They would rather compensate strenuous years of their lives to not have to worry about paying for college. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>@OP - I&#39;m a former Marine myself.  I rarely talk about it, much less brag about it.  I was injured and discharged with a settlement.  Ok, life goes on.  But when people see my USMC tattoo or find out I was a leatherneck, something switches in their brain that either makes them love me or hate me.</p>

<p>Today, I agree that we should respect those who have made the sacrifices to serve.  We should also be thankful to those families who endure.  I&#39;ll share a moment of &quot;hoorah&quot; with others who have served.  But none of that means we need to be gung-ho about what our Dear Leaders direct our military to do.</p>

<p>The federal government has the Constitutional duty to raise an army in defense of these united states.  The United States of America does not have the authority to police and bully the rest of the world.  Maintain our embassies and our bases for strategic superiority, yes, but not overthrow those that do not bend to our will.</p>

<p>America first, as in take care of our starving, our homeless, our uneducated, our dying, our sick, our needy, our elderly, OURS first.  Bring our men and women home and invest in our communities, our culture, our economy.</p>

<p>But we won&#39;t do that. We will be the knock on the door moments before a gun is pointed in someone&#39;s innocent face in the name of democracy and peace.  We will be the hired guns protecting the oil wells.  We will be the cannon fodder thrown into false flag operations.</p>

<p>And we, as civilians, must remember, it is not the individual soldier, sailor, airman, or marine that we should blame.  They are following orders because they believe they are serving the greater good. (Okay, granted there have been a few radicals...)  Should we &quot;worship&quot; them, or the military in general. No... but would should be thankful they are willing to volunteer for such service -- for us.</p>

<p>And when they return home, battered, broken, lost and in pain, we should love them and accept them and as a nation help them heal.</p>

 My husband always wanted to be a soldier since he was a little boy, so for him he is living his dream.  I&#39;m pretty sure that doesnt qualify him as stupid and a slacker.
  Now about military worship.  I don&#39;t believe in  it and I dont think one should automatically respect some little twerp in his private tags who dont respect anything at all.  I do however respect those that have been in a while, but there is a difference to me when I say respect and worship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to realize that everyone that joins is an individual, although there are a few common reasons, everyone has their own. I joined in 09, fresh out of high school. For me personally, I wanted to put myself through the most difficult thing I could think of, and this was it. School is easy, learning has never been a challenge, so college had little appeal. I will say it is difficult for completely different reasons than I expected.</p>

<p>I do agree with the worship mentality being wrong though, a few guys I work with were given the opportunity of serving, or going to prison. Surprise surprise, still shitty people.</p>

<p>The notion that someone only wants to commit murder is ignorant? The notion that someone is stupid is ignorant? There are plenty of murderers and plenty of stupid people out there.

<p>It&#39;s an entirely different culture than wherever you&#39;re from. It&#39;s an entirely different set of circumstances. In my post I only ever talked about my experiences and the world I live in. That&#39;s all I know. </p>

<p>So far you&#39;ve called me a redneck, a bastard, a twat, stupid, and ignorant all in the name of defending the US Military, an organization which you claim to have no affiliation with. What makes you so passionate about the US Military? </p>

<p>And every time that I see a soldier on a plane, I always think: You know what? I should give him my seat. It would be the right thing to do. It would be easy to do, and it would mean a lot to him. I could go up to him: Hey son - I get to call him son. Hey son, go ahead and take my seat.</p>

<p>Because I&#39;m in first class - why? For being a professional (beep). This guy is giving his life for the country, he thinks, and so he has to...</p>

<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>

<p>But that&#39;s good enough. That&#39;s good enough, the fact that he thinks it. I&#39;m serious. He&#39;s told by everybody in his life system that that&#39;s a great thing to do, and he&#39;s doing it. And it&#39;s scary, but he&#39;s doing it, and he&#39;s sitting in the (beep) seat, and I should trade with him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not rich, it thinks its rich, or the people do, but if you consider living off a credit card rich, well then.</p>

<p>You see the mass of accumulating debt coupled with your imperialistic killing, not to mention you have been spying on your allies, puts you in the very precarious position.</p>

<p>You like others may be able to say, well, it&#39;s not the people of so and so country, it&#39;s the government</p>

<p>how do you think you &quot;americans&quot; are viewed around the world? a positive image?</p>

<p>no not really, there comes a certain point where one from another country can no longer stand back and say &quot;well, it&#39;s not the people, it&#39;s the government&quot;</p>

<p>lets look at some facts.</p>

<p>Since 191 you have killed more people than hitler, regardless of what &quot;figure&quot; you use.</p>

<p>Instead of rounding people up, regardless of what figure, you have simply invaded country and killed people, instead of it being hitler killing jews, its americans killing muslims</p>

<p>and now, you have been exposed as &quot;spying&quot; on not only your own citizens, but your supposed alies</p>

<p>and then lets factor in the economic bullying...</p>

<p>Basically the usa has become the modern day equivalent of  Nazi Germany...</p>

<p>and instead of you coming in to save the day, it will be the world that will have to stand against you , as you have now become the new hitler...</p>

<p>your system does not allow for an on going dictator, but as everyone now knows, these &quot;leaders&quot; are not in charge....your money is....</p>

<p>Soon you will see a move from China,Russia, and the rest of the world to economically iscolate you. To remove you from reserve status. The bankers that run your country will not stand for this. But you will be too weak if the entire world gangs up on you...all you will have is your nuclear option</p>

<p>it&#39;s hard to admit, but we the usa, have become the new Nazi Germany and we are the killers....standing apathetic in the face of such atrocity and being complicit is a crime...and regardless of your opinion of  your role in it. You will be judged very harshly  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does it matter what they did two generations ago? We&#39;re talking about 2013. </p>

<p>Yeah the motherfuckers that fought and died during the civil war and WWI and WWII they were fucking heroes. Our country was in danger and our rights were at stake. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the here and now. The soldier that may be gone tomorrow, why do they DESERVE my respect? What has he/she done that is honestly commendable? There&#39;s a lot of soldiers out there that have no idea what they&#39;re getting into, maybe they&#39;re brainwashed maybe they&#39;re stupid. But there&#39;s a lot of soldiers out there that know exactly what they&#39;re getting into and I have no respect for them. </p>

<p>I honestly believe that without the US military presence around the world right now we would be better off as a country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well WWI was &quot;the war to end all wars&quot; but then it didn&#39;t work out that way so another generation of Americans went off to fight on the other side of the world.  Both of those wars are believed to have been for so glorious of a cause that it is indisputable.  When I still regularly spoke with idiots they would beat their chest and say that their father or grandfather or granduncle would kick my ass because they fought in the war.  Big fucking deal - every mother fucker out there has a relative who fought in that war.  At least with WWII it is literally what everyone who was capable was forced to do - or they would be in some really bigs troubles.  Fuck all that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Familiar perspective.  Very similar to how I approached things when I joined the Navy in 2004 (graduated HS in 2003).  Got out after 5 years because I was tired of the bullshit (and TRUST me, for an intelligent individual you will hate your life.  As much respect as I have for military personnel being willing to die for their misguided view of what &#39;serving your country&#39; means, 99% of them are bricks).</p>

<p>If you do enlist, unless you buck-up and actually &#39;try harder&#39; in school, your only likely course of action WILL be to join the US&#39;s Paramilitary Police Force.  And then you will slowly sink into the pit of filth that is the enforcement side of the American criminal justice system.</p>

<p>The statistics on this pretty much speak for themselves. Prior military personnel generally carry the path they went into the military with once they leave.  If you join without a direction and without drive, you will either serve your twenty and die within ten years of retiring, or you will get out and jump into one of those dead end jobs.  So, your lack of effort is in troubling conflict with your plans. </p>

<p>The only thing that kept me going while I was in the Navy was really integrity; I had obliged myself.  The experience, beyond shore leave, was abhorrent.  I basically did a lot of soul searching trying to justify the MASSIVE mistake that I had made.  And at the end of the day, I came out with the personal philosophy that I had sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the US, and the democracy that it allows to exist.  For a little bit, this helped me out, giving me a different perspective than I had had going in.  Shortly after absorbing this notion into my ethos, though, I realized that it was basically meaningless dribble to any politician or military officer.  Most would circumvent the constitution if they could, and frequently do...</p>

<p>From my perspective: no matter what your objective is in &#39;serving your country&#39; you will not feel any better after leaving the military.  You will feel empty.  As though you had wasted 4 or 5 years of your life for no reason.</p>

<p>Now, I can&#39;t speak for your (future?) experience, but that was mine.</p>

<p>After I got my honorable discharge (yay!), I went to school for a degree in Computer Engineering while working for a cyber security firm recently acquired by one of the big MIC contractors.  The ONLY reason I got the job was cause I&#39;d been programming since I was a freshman in high school and had a VERY good grasp on the concepts required to be good at developing low level security software.  I made good grades without trying in high school, and ended up graduating from a top 100 public college with a <em>summa cum laude</em> while working full time (at said cyber security firm).</p>

<p>Although you do seem lucid and reasonably intelligent, your perspective as elaborated seems to be as well thought out as the effort you put into your academics.</p>

<p>You can serve your country by using your intelligence, instead of just being some grunt cleaning toilets and swabbing decks (or dicks, if you are a corpsman).  And unless you start now, you&#39;re going to be well behind the curve for the Cyber Security craze.  I would recommend you seriously reconsider your impulse to NOT go to college and get a degree.  Cyber is ridiculously technical operationally.  It requires a large amount of both area-expertise and an extreme breadth of knowledge.</p>

<p>In that regard, you are already WAY behind.</p>

<p>p.s.  Sorry for the length, and I&#39;m not attempting to criticize, necessarily.  It&#39;s just that your perspectively (and I can&#39;t stress this emphatically enough) was the exact same as mine.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Military or not, you&#39;re going to have to work your ass off to make something of yourself.  Why put yourself through the misery of the military?</p>

We also have to face it, being a healthy country requires resources that aren&#39;t readily available in our country so we have to protect interests worldwide. The problem lays in our leadership that is so corrupt that nowadays every action we take is to put money in a rich mans pocket.

    <div class="md"><p>no world power wants to close off international shipping, but fear of an aegis cruiser keeps many localised threats from even popping up. 300 years ago, piracy was an actual threat to world order. without one or several naval powers with global reach things might revert back to that. twice in the last century there was a sustained free for all on international shipping. it was very ugly.</p>

<p>the first pieces of international law ever ratified were specifically targeted at piracy. i&#39;d hazard a guess to say both russia and china are quite happy the us navy does what it does, but i also doubt they&#39;d ever say it.</p>

Do you think the countless wars of conquest the United States has embarked on since its very inception were not violating someones natural rights, no but the mythos of American exceptionalism paint those as good wars against bad enemies when the truth is much dirtier.

<p>You literally give your mind and body to the government and then are required by law, to do whatever you are told. If you don&#39;t, you are punished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t lose respect for them but I don&#39;t automatically respect them more. It actually makes me really sad to see people join the military, especially really smart people that could make a great life for themselves without the assistance. I mean if you make it through, and a lot of people do, then that&#39;s great. But to see smart kids dying for no reason is just a bummer. </p>

<p>What&#39;s worse, in my mind, is if they make it through they often come out as completely different people. When you join the military they break you down and build you up in their own image. It&#39;s a form of brainwashing and there&#39;s a lot of people that look at the world differently because of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worst outcrop of herd life [is] the military system, which I abhor.  That a man can take pleasure in marching in fours to the strains of a band is enough to make me despise him.  He has only been given his big brain by mistake; unprotected spinal marrow was all he needed.  This plague-spot of civilization ought to be abolished with all possible speed.  Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism - how passionately I hate them!  How vile and despicable war seems to me!  I would rather be hacked in pieces than take part in such an abominable business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a guy who used to run a small construction company, was one of the best at the time, lots of famous clients.... but basically forced out, LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE I KNOW...because of being over burden by government regulations and over taxation....</p>

<p>they want 40% and have made it basically &quot;illegal&quot; and or created an environment where NO ONE can play by all their rules....in short time, ones dream, running their own business, becomes their worst nightmare, just like home ownership became for many....</p>

<p>basically my understanding of the country was that it was a place with opportunity and freedom ....and that has lots of that has to do with MONEY....&quot;freedom/economic freedom&quot; in many ways was what they were talking about in 1776....but because no one formed a coup back then and focused on rounding up ALL of them....they were able to keep coming back....Jackson should have gone international and imprisoned them, shut them down forever, and basically EDUCATE THE MASSES about money printed as debt....no one can pull the scam if everyone knows how it works......</p>

<p>the problem again central banking, money printed as debt</p>

<p>a company, a corporation is DESTROYING THIS PLACE ...for all, civilian and soldier alike.....</p>

<p>if I said &quot;hey, cocacola is killing us all, we must stop drinking it and stop them&quot; somehow I don&#39;t think anyone would be too hard pressed to do it....</p>

<p>we have the SAME EXACT THING....cept&#39; cola is not the product MONEY IS THE PRODUCT...</p>

<p>currency is NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A PRODUCT THAT IS CREATED  AND THEN &quot;SOLD/LOANED&quot; TO THE PEOPLE..</p>

<p>THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT A CLEAN DEBT FREE MONETARY SYSTEM FOR THE CITIZENS....</p>

<p>NOT PROTECT A CREDIT SCAM FOR A BUNCH OF GANGSTERS...</p>

<p>No not only will you not be taken down, there are people that would volunteer to climb down a 500 sewer pipe in order to slap cuffs on these assholes...</p>

<p>we are talking about a small group of people and their associates...the creators of this money as debt nightmare....</p>

<p>for example if builderberg meeting were stormed....a large part of that group would be the people, however, they certainly would be able to lead you to the owners, however many would be there....</p>

<p>Jp morgan,goldman sachs,nm Rothschild, moses sief, cheveron ....to name a few....these and others are the owners of the central banks</p>

<p>I do not trust anon....I believe them to be &quot;them&quot; and it is a trap to route out dissidents as well as blackmail and procour new talented hackers</p>
