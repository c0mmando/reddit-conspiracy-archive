       Then they immediately used their new power to print money to pump up the economy in the roaring 20's, and then crash it in 1929, buying up assets for pennies on the dollar.  The children of those who survived the resulting Great Depression were sent to WWII.

       Correct. Depression are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a natural part of the "business cycle". They are intentional. And, for the record, the "Great Depression" was not ended by World War II. It was ended by the economic boom
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       World War II. The war was
       <em>
        part
       </em>
       of the depression.

       The "Broken Window Fallacy" basically means "That Which Is Seen, and That Which Is Not Seen". Now, this relates to the Great Depression because in school we are taught that, because of increased spending due to World War II Military production, World War II ended the depression. But as with almost all of of the history that school teaches, this is incorrect. The reason it is a fallacy is because at first glance it would seem that a lot more people had jobs as a result of making jeeps, tanks, bullets and such. And they did. But. The general prosperity of the population didn't improve at all. Remember that in World War II there was rationing. So, no matter how much money you had, it wold do you little good. You were allowed only so much gas, sugar and such. Remember also that pennies in 1943 and 1944 were made of steel and were gray in colour. I actually had a few of these. No copper at all, since all the copper went to make bullets.
      </p>
      <p>
       No civilian cars were made between 1943 and 1945. There is no such thing as a 1943 Chevy or a 1945 Ford. They didn't and don't exist. That is why 1941  Chevy's were so prized, as they were the last pre-war Chevy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the great depression ended in 1946: no matter what the school history teacher tells you.

       I'm sorry for being brash, but I find it ridiculously frustrating when someone openly admits being too lazy to search the internet and expects to be spoon fed.  One can educate themselves on the broken window fallacy in all of 5 minutes with a simple search of wikipedia.  It's absurd.   Why should I support the laziness of others?

       I can understand that frustration, but I don't sympathize because I like being able to share knowledge. If someone wants an answer to a question I'd rather give em an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's often more enjoyable for me to hear other people answer a question than to see a dictionary definition or wiki article posted. I like communication between people.

       You do have a point though, that feeding such laziness when it's just as quick to look it up can stunt a persons intellect from growing.

       Here is a chart of personal wealth from 1928-1942, you can see the economic gains on wealth are pretty dramatic from 1933-1942 DURING the war. This was largely due to the mass industrialization of America to support the war effort, but jobs are jobs in the end.

       The war ended in 1945. Yes, 1933 was the low point, agreed. But prosperity (the opposite of depression) didn't return until about 1946. Jobs in the war were a result

       the war, not because of economic growth.

       I dont know anything about conspiracy and the Titanic but I seem to remember that it's sister ship was the olympic which I believe was the identical craft.
There was also the Brittanic which was the third sister ship, not sure if it was also identical.

       Don't forget prohibition. The income tax was passed to make up for the loss of tax income from banning alcohol - they knew they couldn't do that before they had another income set up before. Prohibition couldn't pass or work until the income tax was established.

       I see what you are getting at, but you have your Historical dates confused. The Federal Income Tax was introduced in 1914. Prohibition was introduced in 1920 and ended in 1933. You are correct in that prohibition was ended due to tax issues. Namely that because Alcohol was't been sold, it wasn't generating tax revenue. In 1933, as a result of being in the worst part of the depression, tax revenue was badly needed. So Alcohol was again legal for sale thus generating tax revenue. Prohibition was started because of a morality issue and was ended because of a money issue. Apparently money, then and now, was more important than high moral standards. Am I implying that prohibition should have been left to stand ? Yes, I am. Marijuana should have been allowed to takes its place. The world would have been much better off.

       I know income tax was before prohibition. They were pushing for prohibition, but knew they'd lose all the tax from alcohol sales so it wouldn't fly. The answer was the income tax. Once that income from income tax was established, it paved the way for prohibition to succeed.

       Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't 1914 come before 1920 ? Meaning that the Income Tax came before prohibition. The two were entirely separate and unrelated just prior to 1920.

       Income tax was in 1914, prohibition was 1920. What the hell's so confusing about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       They knew the gov't couldn't afford to ban alcohol because of the income loss. The income tax of 1914 made it possible for prohibition to pass because the income tax replaced the income from alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prohibition and the income tax were very much intertwined - the prohibition movement had been going on since before 1850 and grew stronger all the way until its fruition in 1920.

       Agreed. But I was under the impression that prohibition was introduced as a result of religious morality. Perhaps you would like to provide some research to support your assertion. My middle aged brain likes to learn a thing or two now and then. :)

       The income tax wasn't the reason behind prohibition, its revenue generation simply allowed prohibition to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prohibition was morality driven yes, by the church and the women's movement of the day. The advent of WWI also didn't help anything as almost all the brewers of beer at the time were German companies, and there was a mass anti-German sentiment at the time and much propaganda against them occurred.

       You think this way only because you grew up with Alcohol in your culture. If it wasn't part of your personal culture you would never have known what you are missing. Alcohol has harmed countless people and killed countless people. Marijuana - zero. Do the math.

       Marijuana HAS harmed people. I was one of them. I spent days in jail for possession and years on probation, all at great personal and financial cost. All for a roach. 
You just think alcohol is harmful because you grew up in THAT culture. And as far as not knowing what you're missing, when I lived with devout Muslims in college, they drank more and harder than anyone I've witnessed in my entire life, because it being taboo in their culture made them crave it, by their own admission.

       In the US Constitution it states (I am paraphrasing here) that the issuance of money is the legal domain of the Government.

       Based on what?  The Constitution grants the federal government the power to declare and fight war via an act of Congress and the President's power as Commander-in-Chief.  U.S. participation in WWI was authorized under these rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're mixing up "illegal" and "immoral."  The morality of any war can certainly be questioned or disagreed with.  But legality? By virtue of our own laws as a sovereign nation, our participation in WWI was legal.
      </p>

      <p>
       No.  Even if the Federal Reserve were not a government agency (it is, since the governors are appointed by the government and the entire agency can be created, destroyed, or altered by an act of Congress), there is nothing in the Constitution that prevents Congress from creating an agency to coin money, which is exactly what they did with the Federal Reserve.  This is no different than the Congress creating the Department of Transportation and FTC to regulate interstate commerce, or creating the USPTO to handle their authority under the same section to create a system of patents and trademarks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Merely because Congress has been given the power to do something in the Constitution, you seem to think Congress members themselves must do it?  Like Congressmen have to spend their off hours in the basement of the Treasury running printing presses with no help...  Obviously not; Congress has the power to delegate their non-legislative duties to agencies they create through legislation.

      <p>
       First, the 16th Amendment was obviously properly ratified.  The required number of states signed it within the required amount of time.  Period.  Since you're the one that made the initial claim (that the income tax is "illegal"), it's up to
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       to prove that claim, not me to prove the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, even without the 16th Amendment, the income tax would be legal.  There were income taxes before the 16th Amendment, dating all the way back to the Civil War.  The 16th Amendment was passed to reduce litigation over whether the tax was legal, but the Courts had already confirmed numerous different income tax structures as Constitutional before the Amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.  You don't need to capitalize "illegal."  Unless you're someone who thinks that capitalization of a word has a significant legal effect.  Which might be the case, judging by your posts thus far.

       You're the one that claimed it wasn't properly ratified.  Why do you think it wasn't, and what is your proof it wasn't?
      </p>
      <p>
       41 state legislatures passed the Amendment, when it only needed 36 to pass.  Secretary of State Philander Knox verified those passages and, after review of those passages and the Amendment, verified the Amendment as added to the Constitution.  Nothing about the passage of the 16th Amendment was noticeably different than the passage of any other Amendment before or since.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're arguing against the dominant paradigm.  It is your responsibility to show me why the dominant paradigm should be rejected.  It is not my responsibility to spread/prove the dominant paradigm that the 16th Amendment is a real thing that exists in our Constitution.  That is the way logical argumentation and burden shifting work.

       Let me ask in a non-controversial way:  I assume you accept that the 15th and 17th Amendments are properly ratified (or maybe you don't), as well as all of the others.  Based upon what proof do you accept that the other Amendments to the Constitution are ratified?  I will be happy to provide the same documentation for the 16th Amendment.

       I'm not asking for a moral argument against war. I'm asking for a citation of a US law against it, especially one that was violated in order to join WWI. Bearing in mind that laws are made by those in power and that they've much to gain from warfare I think an actual law against it is unlikely. Please show me how I'm wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, while murder is illegal, there are forms of killing that are not. Executions by the state and killing in self defense are both legal in the US. I imagine many in the US would argue that war falls under one or both categories just a vehemently as you argue that it does not. That's why I need a law cited to accept the claim that "war is illegal".

       Now where's the bit in international law that says wars are illegal? I've heard for most of my life that certain nations have treaties and alliances that can result in one nation being called into a war to support an ally that is being attacked. If war is categorically illegal under international law that would seem to be wrong.

       What the fuck kind of world do you live in where laws dictate morality? First of all, you know fuck all about my moral compass jackoffski and don't act otherwise.

      <p>
       Second of all, I'm not arguing that war is morally right. You're conflating a questioning or requested citation of you're unsubstantiated opinion that war is illegal with a declaration that it's moral. This is one the lamest argumentative tactics that I've ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to have a bad habit of confusing your feelings, with written law. If you had said "War is immoral" there wouldn't be much to argue about here. But saying "war is illegal" which involves an actual system of rules that humans have put down on paper makes this a whole different kettle of fish. Unfortunately you are so weak a person that someone asking for your evidence of a factual claim is treated like a personal offense. You should consider becoming a clergyman, you could make serious bank in a field where lashing out at questions with bullshit is the norm.

       Technically, you gotta go back to 1871 (probably even further). When the bankers got the Act of 1871 passed. Right after Andrew Jackson fought so frickin hard. The scariest part, my history class didn't address any of this crap.

       Civil war was the east india trading co vs the US. It was under the guise of the fight for slavery. But, the americans instigated the civil war by tempting an attack on fort sumter. And because the Trading Co couldn't win the war, they took to covert means of take over. We are now owned by foreign interests. And you're so correct, our White House now has foreign enemies living within it, running our politics and military.

       I had a similar issue in the University modern US history class I took. Our professor was a self-described hippie from the 60s. We covered both WWI and WWII in less than two weeks discussion...but then spent 6 weeks on the Civil Rights movement, as it was his opinion that it was the most crucial event in our history. BS.

       US History classes suck. It's annoying how they explain history, as if it's so black and white. Well, unless it's civil rights, ha. But seriously, most history teachers explain it as "this is what happened. Anything you say otherwise is wrong."
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality...No one knows what went down. Only the people who were alive. Even then, most people alive didn't know what went down. History is biased, no matter who tells it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to get an accurate picture of history, would be to have a camera in the sky. Filming everything on earth. Maybe, in heaven, there will be a youtube of history. That's the only way you'll get the truth. If heaven doesn't exist for you, then i'm sorry you can't be blissful.

       I never saw one either. But I did see one in Chang Mai, Thailand. That's where I went at 3am one morning while suffering some nasty food poisoning. I begged them (in english, which they didnt understand) to find me some kind of western breakfast cereal (in my state, thats the only thing I wanted to eat!)   I can't remember what I bought in the end, but it wasn't cereal.

       Lol I guess you didn't read past the first page then. That site actually has explicit instructions for implementing democracy 2.0 in multiple places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any US citizen can run for office under this platform. People are already doing it. There is a system in place to implement D-2.0 called adhocracy. You can learn how to use it from the most recent post on the blog.
      </p>

       Democracy 2.0 is an anti-idealism movement. It's s realism movement.

       I did indeed read the first part of the page, and all the other parts too. It states in general terms what is wanted. It doesn't provide any concrete way to force (peacefully or otherwise) the Government to either abdicate or act morally.

       Every city, state, and nation has it's own rules/regulations for running for office. Anyone who is interested can run for office after filling out the necessary paperwork. Anyone who is interested in promoting democracy 2.0 can set up an adhocracy.de account. Just because it's hard work doesn't mean it's impossible. I can't do it because I'm traveling the world for a year and I think that is more important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a democracy 2.0 candidate is elected to public office, the people can literally control what happens with their environment. Because everything will be out in the open, and the public is controlling all decisions, any assassination will be extremely suspicious. The powers that be simply won't be able to get away with it. If one D-2.0 candidate gets killed, someone else will gladly take their place. Hypothetically, if a D-2.0 candidate was elected to President, he/she could actually dismantle the US military as well as the alphabet soup agencies. Once they are eradicated, what can possibly encroach on his/her power? Corporations will lose their "lobbying edge" because anyone will be able to lobby ideas for free in democracy 2.0.

       There is no "inherent evil." You've been reading too much fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality is a complex system and that means that every actor within the system is a system within itself. People only EVER want to do what benefits them. There is only currently evil behavior taking place because that is beneficial for the rational actors carrying it out. No one gets into power because they are a legitimate villain. It's ridiculous to blame this shit on "satan."

       I was referring to the Governments clearly Illegal actions that are clearly harming or killing people. When people get killed without warning and for no reason, that is evil. The Government
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       evil. There is no other way to describe it. It has nothing to do with reading fiction. This is nonfiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, If you claim there is no "inherent evil.", then why the need for cryptocat ?

       I think his problem with the word "evil" is that it has a magical, villainous feel to it. Government officials don't commit heinous acts just to be evil, they do so because they're greedy, and those things just happen to lie on the path of greatest self interest. For anything to significantly change, we need to make these things no longer in their self interest. But that's the hard part.

       To me evil implies that they do it for no reason other than sadistic enjoyment. It's kind of like an evil person kills people for fun, while a greedy person kills people for money. You could argue that the greedy person is also evil in that case, but it leaves out the fact that his primary motive is material greed.

       The US Government needs to get their collective asses out of other peoples Countries and stop killing people with these chickenshit drones. If they want to kill people they should march in with rifle in hand and get it on. The US wants to be an "Empire". But they are digging thier own grave: Literally.

       Umm, I would hope MANY things encroach upon the power of a President. He's not a Dictator, and represents less than 1/3 of the base Government established under our Constitution. He should technically have the same functional role as the Queen of England...public appearances and staying the hell out of The People's business.

       Serious question, I too am Canadian, born/raised, my grandparents immigrated here after the war. I also count my blessings, but I wonder for how much longer....is our govt very different really? Is cosmetically and on-the-surface a better reality? As for cosmetics....we are exceptional at that, the tar sands "reclamation" is a prime example. Don't get me wrong, I love our country, and I have driven it coast to coast and have been awe struck by her beauty, her people, and her vastness (fucking Ontario is one hell of a drive through!) but I don't see much difference in how it's run compared to our big brother next door...

       You ask some good questions. Are we (Canada) any different than the US ? Yes, and no. We are different in that we have the well known Canadian politeness. This, for the most part, extends to
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       of the Police and Government. Here, in Kingston, Ontario, the Police are actually quite reasonable and professional. But when you go into the down town part of Kingston every other store is empty and/or boarded up, largely as a result of the 2008 economic non sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other parts of Canada people are getting shot and killed by the Police. The Police don't seem to taken to task for this. This has been going on for about 13 or so years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Tar sands are a really bad environmental catastrophe waiting to happen. Not to mention the economic mess that it stirs up, as it costs a great deal to get the product out of the sand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Federal Government is as beholding to Israel as the US Government is, sadly. And if we, in Canada, criticize Israel, that amounts to "hate" speech, which is just bullshit. Our Federal Politicians are, maybe not as out right evil, just as misguided and sometimes stupid as the US counterparts are. Like allowing American Police to have jurisdiction is Canada. It will be a frosty day in Hell before I will bow down to an American cop in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part, yes, life in Canada is pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too have traveled across the country and back. To say that it is vast is an understatement. But the people, by and large, are wonderful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States has always seemed to be about 25 years ahead of Canada. By that I mean that they (the US) are what we will become. I don't know if I like that at all.

       We are on the same page then. Thanks for the reply nighthawk. I live a few hours west of Toronto, cops here are ok but visiting Toronto has made me a bit of a skittish cat these days....I have participated in a few peaceful protests there and felt like I was in a foreign country and was fearful for my safety from them not my fellow protestors. Never thought there would come a day when we would be arrested for just "being there" or sporting a mask, or banging a pot. Never thought I would see my beautiful countryside polluted with nothing but soy and corn and bullshit ginseng. Never thought I'd see livestock held prisoners within 4 cramped walls, my kids cant moo at the cows on our sunday drives...we rarely see them anymore. Never thought my lakes might die and the fish run out. Never thought everything I own would be made in china or that Walmart would be my only shopping choice (I have a choice but I have to leave my city for alternatives) never thought my country would be one of the biggest threats to the environment. Never thought my country would waste billions of tax payers dollars to build super prisons for pot heads and cut education and social security to save a buck. We need to take back our country and it saddens me that a lot of us just can't be bothered to care or, are too scared to care. I know I don't like that at all.

       I am with you. But it seems that people, that I relate to in person, like my roommate, just don't believe anything but the corporate media and don't want to hear
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       else. They think Muslims are evil and crazy. And this is in
       <em>
        Canada
       </em>
       . You asked me earlier how are we the same as the US ? This is one of them. This is not only Ontario, this all across the country. Canadians are just as much a sleep as Americans are. Some Canadians are just plainly stupid and some need their blinders. I have lived with and met members of our Military (Kingston is a Military town) who should know better, who prefer to have those self censoring blinders on. They all have a good life and to acknowledge that our world is really fucked up would destroy their little dream bubble. It is this dream bubble that people live in that prevents anything from getting done. Everyone here has too much to lose. This is why they are scared. They will put up with Government intrusion. As long as
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       don't get their doors kicked open. And remember this is still in
       <em>
        Canada
       </em>
       . So much for community. Yes, it does seem like a dream at times. But soon when the nightmare hits everyone will panic.
       <em>
        Then
       </em>
       when you tell them "I tried to tell you" they will
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       freak.

       I don't know if you are old enough to remember, but back in 1971 there was the "FLQ" crisis in Quebec where a Federal MP James LaCross was murdered. Our then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau enacted the "War Measures Act" in Quebec. This was basically martial law. All rights of any kind instantly suspended. Imagine. This could easily happen again and with much less fuss then in the States. In some ways Americans are more free then we are in Canada.

       My sentiments exactly. 
I had family in Quebec in the 70s, however Trudeau was worshiped in my house growing up (more so Maggie but hey, she was our Jackie K). I'm a woman, born in 1970....that puts me at 32 and yes I know math.

       If you were born in 1970 that would out you at 43. Correct me if i am wrong, but this is 2013, right ? I am a man born in 1961 and am 52. But, ok, a Lady is allowed to hide her age. :)

       I remember the FLQ bit as a boy of 10 years old then. I was shocked to hear of the killing of a Federal MP. And, yes, I always loved Trudeau. The one politician who had some
       <em>
        balls

       . unlike Harper who is a spineless wimp.

       Is there really any illusion if you sit and think about the process for two seconds though? You get to choose between two people with highest amount of money among the candidates, funded by the people with the most money in the world. This has baffled me from an early age, I never understood why people thought it was fair.

       I think this isn't as accurate as they'd like us to think. I don't think they would be prepared to tell you the truth. I mean, they are probably much more so prepared than they were a few years ago but for all out civil unrest? I don't know. The sooner the better I say. Lets find out.

       Depends on how wide spread them riots are. I'm sure there were a lot of people ignoring the riot in Oakland via Occupy/Cointel back in 2011. Also, the media seems like a glorified mouth piece for uncle sam so I'm sure there's a lot of other stories that could get more play.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless it was riots coast to coast, I don't think it'd be that hard to sweep under the rug. If it were coast to coast, I think the government would try and fail anyway. A recent relevant quote from a comic series I've been reading comes to mind:
      </p>
      <p>
       "When an old order passes, it doesn't always realize that it's dying. In this case, the entire world system that has persisted since capitalism emerged out of feudalism is crumbling, but it pretends not to be."

       It's like a cruise ship. The greatest cruise ever. Everybody is partying hard, really really hard. It's an all inclusive cruise and they've been drunk since they left the dock. Awesome food in the buffet, live music every night, pool, hot tub. Everything. Even the crew is partying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The captain is distracted by the band, and lightly bumps a chunk of ice in the water. The deck jolts a little, no big deal. The passengers keep partying and the captain sails full speed ahead. The band keeps playing, drinks keep flowing. The party continues late into the night. Everybody is fucked up drunk, they don't want the good times to end. Suddenly the deck jolts hard to the left, and the lights dim. The ship creaks and sways. The captain shouts over the intercom "Everyone remain calm, no need to be alarmed", and they party on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not many people notice the water flowing into the lower cabins. Everyone is up on deck, drinking. First a few drops, then a light trickle, soon it is ankle deep. Concerned, a few people head up on deck to alert the rest of the ship. They inform the bartender, he's too drunk to care. They start telling the other passengers, about the water. No one cares, they're too drunk. The crew will take care of it. The water is knee deep in the lower cabins. The party continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       The captain sends his crew to ready the life boats. Being careful not to alert the passengers. The crew loads into the lifeboats and abandons ship. The passengers party on. The bartender has disappeared, they can pour their own booze. They soon realize, that most of the crew has departed and the dance floor is getting wet. All the booze is gone. suddenly the music stops, and everybody freaks the fuck out. They scramble for the remaining life boats. There isn't enough room for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that can, flee the ship as it tilts further into the ocean. Those that cannot escape are brought down to the depths with the ship. In the life boats, the passengers start to sober up. Soon, they realize captain and his crew have departed with their cash, The party is over and no land is on the horizon.

       "Terrorists" are the Three Letter Agency scapegoat and never a real threat. Nevermind they were trained and armed by the US. Not even the USSR with thousands of nukes provoked so much fear and destruction of civil rights. It's one big ploy to control us.

       Those that seek power, control, authority, and manipulation of minds will never stop until they've completely enslaved the masses. They will herd the people as cattle and impose restraints, restrictions, limits, and the like that will be readily accepted by most as they will progressively become the norm. The average, typical, and unassuming individual is just attempting to get by and not die. Therefore, they only learn to live within the lines drawn and wouldn't dare to question the status quo in fear of the worst that has been presented as highly likely; wherein the worst is actually, just that, the worst. Extremely rare and unlikely. But, dictation and direction given by those entrusted with such nonsense will create a sense in the majority that they must cower in the corner, piss running down their leg, tears being shed, curled in an ass-ball waiting for death.

       We lost our testicles because we were convinced that anytime we would set foot outside of our own homes, the world had it out for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basic "divide-and-conquer" mentality used on the majority of the population and has been a tactic utilized since humans first figured out that a group is strong while a single individual is weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you keep everyone always worried about maintaining basic necessities along with the fear of interacting with anyone not on "The Approved List of People" and you effectively keep anyone from actually questioning the life they now live in.  Or how it got that way to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add on to that a fear of the intangible (which happens to always be the scariest things our minds can imagine) and it becomes very unsurprising that not only have we lost our testicles, many of us willingly chopped them off in the name of "safety and security".
      </p>
      <p>
       If we really want to fix this problem we need a group that actually believes in supporting ALL of its members, rather than treating them as disposable resources that can be used to fuel the livelihood of a few at the very top.   People feel safe when they both can see and believe that a group really does care about them as an individual.  Trust starts to form between members.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is dangerous to anyone who wants to keep us divided as individuals.  Because if individuals can trust each other, they can band together to push actual change, an actual paradigm shift in how the system currently operates.  A person by themselves can no longer change the world.  And they know that and obviously would prefer keeping the status-quo.

       while i agree with your general argument, "we" didn't shut down the embassies. most everyone  I've spoken to believe its a scare tactic by our own government so that we are "reminded" why we "need" them.

       Yeah, but those are there for a reason... Did you know 1 in 7 black males between 20-30 years of age is in US prison right now? And that blacks typically receive 10x the sentence length for breaking the same drug laws as whites? And that the 13th amendment to the constitution that ended slavery has an explicit clause that allows for forced unpaid work as long as the person has been imprisoned?

       Who exactly is this "poem" (ditty? prose?) directed at? Preaching to the choir must be an easy way to get karma. I mean sure, it's all true. But that's like writing a poem to a bunch of doctors, detailing why blood, or water is important to the human body: They're pretty aware. Perhaps you should tell the non-doctors.

       There are easily a few hundred people reading the OP who've never considered what the OP is saying. Actually, its probably much much more. When you get a post we can all agree with to the point where it gets a few hundred upvotes, it gets closer to the top of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and has the potential to exposes thousands, if not more, to thoughts theyve never considered.

It's a shitty life, but we are the middle children of history, we aren't special and we won't do anything to fix the problems.  It won't be until maybe hundreds of years from now the government will get too big and choke on it's own fat and finally fail.

       Sure there are the vehement statists who will take it that way, but people who aren't open to considering an alternative viewpoint —especially when their current view point wouldn't even be the case if they took the time to actually look at the evidence—will ignore you regardless. There is no easy way to tell someone something they vehemently believe is fundamentally wrong and/or an utter lie. These are not the people who this message is directed to, and people who can't accept hard truths, or are even consider the possibility that they could be true, will wake up or not wake up regardless of how much we coddle them. And honestly, anyone who isn't even open to considering that the war or terror is lie, would only be detrimental to this 'movement' anyway. We need people who can think critically, objectively, and open-mindedly—anyone who would be offended by the OP almost certainly does not have any of those traits, else they wouldn't be offended.

       Being lacking in understanding and thus believing you can't do anything about it, and there actually being nothing you can do about it are two very different things. There is a whole lot that we, and they can do. For 'them', though, the first thing they need to do is be open to the fact that their viewpoint could be wrong. There is very little anyone can do here to foster the facilities of logic in people who have spent 20, 30, 40, 50+ years devoid of it, and there is no point in wasting our time trying to wake them from their comatose.

       Be proud of the fact that you have opened your eyes and are able to see what is going on. Most of the population in America, or the world for that matter, have yet to reach that point. However, simply knowing that it is going on is not enough, unfortunately. Everyone in this 'movement' needs to understand not only what is happening, but how it is happening, how long it has been happening, what the 'agenda' plans to happen next, how we as a public can stagnate it's happening-ness, and how we as a public are complicit in the happening. It's important to note that they are not in control as they would like us to believe. The conspiracy community is heavily infiltrated with disinformation (it would stupid of 'them' not to do so), and it is the primary cause of the hopelessness expressed by this community. Tragedy And Hope and the Wikispooks site, listed below, give, to my understanding, the most accurate representation of how things actually work.

       I think we both know that would be a terrible idea. However, if that is the only thing you can think of to do, please do not take any offense to this but, you have a lot of research to do in regards to how the system works, and what you can do about it (I will add some links to help you out at the end of this post).

       I'm sure we're all on lists just for being in this sub. But hey, if you're not on a special list, you're not doing enough haha. Be proud that you're on a watch list by a totalitarian, immoral government. Anyone who isn't on a special watch list, is the same kind of person who allowed things like the holocaust to happen.

       I won't disagree that a lot here are hopeless (however I would argue that is due to a lack of understanding of the situation in it's entirety and thus a lack in understand of what we can do to stop it), and I won't disagree that there are definitely 'arm chair generals', as you call them, however just because someone isn't out there in the streets wasting their time asking for our criminal government to give us back the shit they stole because we were too wrapped up in who Paris Hilton fucked this month or hating the evil muslims who bombed us  to realize they were stealing it doesn't mean we aren't doing something. Protesting is pointless when you have a government who couldn't care less what the people have to say, where you have a media who will only report on things which divide the people or maintain the status quo, and where you have 90% of the population too wrapped up in their own lives to even care about what you're protesting about. The number one thing people need to be doing, and I see it a lot, is educating themselves. If someone is constantly debating and discussing and evolving their arguments and their beliefs structures, they are actually being much more efficient than those in the streets, most of whom actually think that if only they yell loud enough the government will give them their shit back—meawhile they are driving home in the exxon powered car, to use their chase bank accounts to buy new clothes that they don't need, and following it up with a nice monsanto crafted dinner; It's like protesting vegetarianism and then going home and eating meat. There will be a time to get up and do something, but right now, we must educate ourselves, educating others, and reduce our dependance and supporting of the system as much as possible, else we are shooting ourselves in the feet.

       If that's what you want to believe, then there is nothing I can do. Of course, it is possible that that is the case, but we cannot accept defeat, especially when there really is so much hope. If you got your leg cut off in the middle of the forest, would you just sit there and say 'well I'll probably die so I might as well give up"? Of course you wouldn't, you would do every last little thing you could to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, onto what you can do: Well first it's important to better understand how things work.

       All links listed above is well into a few hundred hours of research. I would recommend checking out the documentaries first (after maybe the bottom links), as they are the easiest to digest when you aren't really feeling like putting extensive work into this stuff. Keep fighting the good fight my friend.

       "'There are none more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free', except those who falsely believe they are enslaved." There is hope. There is a chance. And even if there isn't, when your children ask you what you did to try and stop this shit, you better have something good to say. Fuck what everyone else does or says. Fuck it if you feel like you're doing this shit alone. That doesn't absolve you of responsibility. Most of us who are in this fight are surrounded by people who dont pay attention or people who know but are too lazy to do anything. Be the change you want to see in the world. God bless, man.

       Upvote! I am guilty of this too, but we always talk about what we need to do, but no one seems to really fight for anything. And when people do fight for a cause (Trayvon Martin thing and Occupy protests), people belittle them and say they are stupid for fighting. You can't win.

       I really dont want to spend the next hour explaining why the Trayvin Martin case had nothing to do with race and was nothing worth protesting over, or honestly even remotely news worthy (despite how the media spun it) but fortunately for me, this was one of the few times where just about all of reddit used their brains and got on the same page, and you can look into just about all of the top posts on politics or news on the matter to get the facts on the case if you feel so inclined.  Im sorry to say but if you felt like protesting over Trayvin Martin you are missing just about the entirety of the facts of the case (and probably need some new sources of news).
      </p>
      <p>
       Occupy: i dont see why anyone here wouldnt support Occupy at least in its infacy, but now its just become a liberal circle jerk over run by the left, just as an equally worthy movement, the Tea Party, got over run by the Koch brothers and the right. Both started out awesome but got turned on their heads and pulled into partisan politics. As long as youre not disillusioned that by somehow giving the government
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       power we can prevent the government from fucking us, then by all means, head over to Occupy (of course know that you get on a special NSA watch list when you go to protests).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, just know that while it feels like youre doing somethig, youre really not doing very much.  It's not that protesting is pointless, its that conventional protesting is pointless under the current control system—protesting only works in an actually democracy/republic, something i think most realize we dont have, and This can be seen with any protest in America in the last 50 years. What happened to the people protesting Vietnam? They gave up and are now probably slaving away at a 9-5 and melting into their couches in front of their TVs. Did their massive protests do
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to stop the war? Nada. Zip. Same with Iraq. Same with Occupy. Same with everything else. All you are is a fly buzzing around the head of the elite. Until you have millions of flys buzzing around their heads, theyll just swat you away and youll get exhausted without having accomplished anything (and even then its still
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       money funding your funding them); protesting doesn't raise awareness anymore either, because anything which can't be used to divide people or to push the status quo won't make it only TV. And  We dont currently have nearly enough people unhappy with their situation, or at least we dont have enough people who are unhappy who also realize that its not the other team's fault (democrat, republican)--that both are equally complicit in this shit and both are equally lacking in any real control. If you think that Congress or even the President really has much say in how things go, im sorry to say but you need to do some more research. Our country is run by intelligence agencies (CIA, NSA, FBI, etc)   and non government organizations (Council On Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, UN, etc) and the corporations they own, at least in regards to things that matter. They dont care about gay marriage or abortion or whatever because these things dont affect them. These are what  the media (all of the major news channels owned by members of these NGO's) tells us to argue over, and we all think we are making a difference by doing it when it couldnt be further from the truth. This is a sad truth but its the reason everyone puts so much effort into fixing this country and it just gets worse: because the actual problems and the actual people in power are never even mentioned. Protesting something that isnt the problem (only perceived as a problem) or something that is the problem but something which will not be affected by you yelling at it, is a waste of your time. Especially when youre going to drive home in your Exxon powered vehicle and get on your windows PC to log into your Chase bank account and pop into the microwave your Monsanto crafted dinner. If you want to efficiently protest you need to boycott and buycott. But for you to do that efficiently you need to educate yourself on how things work and how the money you spend is funneling itself into the corporations you hate. If you want to make a difference, educate yourself. There is truly nothing more important than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protesting right now is kind of similar to protesting meat production but going home and eating meat, and being upset that all your hard work isnt making a difference.  The next step up is actually stopping supporting that industry, but even then anyone who is/has been vegetarian or knows one, knows that its not doing anything more than making them
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       like theyre making a difference--.01% reduction in meat eating wont stop the industry. If you really want to make a difference you need to educate yourself and educate others. Im not a vegetarian or anything like that but i think its a pretty accurate analogy.
      </p>
      <p>
       First you need to walk the talk. Second you need to make sure youre walking in the right direction. And third you need to push other people in the right direction.

       This is a self-absorbed, "I'm so high and mighty", bullshit post.  If you're so wise and well versed OP, why don't you lead some real revolution instead of cowering behind some computer posting meaningless crap?  Sure, our government may have closed some embassies, and issued "travel warnings", but I don't know of a single person who didn't travel as a result - no one cancelled their vacation, no one "cowered in their homes".  Nothing changed - people went about their business, even if the government tried to get everyone spooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of other ways in which the terrorists have "won", but this recent embassy thing is not one of them.

       That's a nice poem but technically meaningless and nothing we didn't know. It's not to say they won but it's to say at the moment, technically they are winning, so long as they're operating.

       WOW! America...if i got this right. Is " a spineless puddle of pussy drippings, who can't do anything except make excuses for their jack-booted dictators" Like really. I understand people are very ignorant to the veil over their eyes. I get it, I really do. But to call the whole country that? You really must be comfortable in that chair of yours. Please please say that in public in a crowded place. I just want to witness how brutally fucking beat you get. Now here is the kicker. You will reply with your bs BUT you literally just called your own country no less than pussy drippings. So it does not matter what the fuck you say. You will forever be a traitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALSO what you read in your little history book. What you are so sad to see come to naught. Is nothing but an illusion, but of course you already knew that huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: This is of course assuming you are American. If not please learn to keep you mouth shut. You have no say in our affairs.

       Wow.. breathe slowly count to ten backwards.

       If you had said that to begin with, because clarity, it would already have been resolved and you wouldn't have gotten all flustered. The root of all problems lay within yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to address your angry question. I was simply emphasizing on the functionality of your balls. I don't know why you got all upset. Rebel balls are the best balls. Hell I'd like to have a set of rebel balls.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be elated that I pointed out the awesomeness of your functional balls. Because someone randomly reading your comment may have misconstrued your intended direction and accused you of being an inept pussy pretending on the internet that you actually have balls. And challenged you to a rebel balls posting duel.

       I am in agreement, but most of those terrorists were not elected by the republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those within the military and intelligence agencies create and use terrorists and set them loose upon the global community. Terrorists are weapons in their own right manipulated by so-called intelligence. The military and intelligence agencies are instigators and muck rakers causing instability and fear deploying theoretical chaos. They were not elected and remain largely unknown.

       Under UK Common Law, War is illegal. Under Maritime law it is not. Maritime law however, is completely voluntarily so long as you are not within the confines of a vessel. I hope that clears that up. UK Common law has been the basis of many codified and un-codified constitutions throughout the world, in short, "Neither cause loss nor harm", would mean War is illegal. To make it legal you need  Maritime Law, which gives rise to an authority being able to break common law. This used to be quiet difficult and use to require quiet a bit of maneuvering, especially if you haven't been attacked. But telling a great big whopper seems to do the trick, especially if it's delivered by Aunty Beeb.

       I loved the vintage photo Drudge put up of children hiding under their desks. "Duck and cover". Yep. This whole thing has been pretty ridiculous and no one I know has bought into it, which is a relief.

       I'm sick of this lame blame-the-victim mentality. People are fucking PISSED. It's not like we just
       <em>
        let
       </em>
       them do this. We have very limited control over the federal government, by its very design. I don't know if you're aware, but we don't get to vote on any federal policy. Additionally, all this shit is happening in secret anyway. There's simply no course of action. What are we supposed to do? Honestly? Wait until next year until we get to vote again for a bunch of people who are lying to our faces? Keep playing by the rules of the system that's fucking us in the first place? It's clear that congress has no fucking control over the situation anyway and that the strings are being pulled by some shadow entity, so not like that even matters! What do we do when the enforcers of the rules don't follow the rules themselves but still hold us to following the rules?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're a nation of 300,000,000+ people, separated by thousands of miles and 50 states, it's not so simple to all come together en masse on the capital like we see happening elsewhere across the globe.
It's not that people are compliant and apathetic, it's that there is no course of action for us to hold these people responsible. We either have to sack up and storm the capital or do something like making a complete and total switch to Bitcoin or some other alternate currency in order to defund the beast.

       Shut the fuck up. I'm not excusing anything. I'm explaining why it's not so cut and fucking dry. This isn't the seventeen-fucking-hundreds, you stupid fucking cunt. We can't all just jump on a fucking boat and take over another continent to inhabit and flip the bird to the most powerful and well-funded military force on the planet. The situations are not at all parallel.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't even know who is pulling the fucking strings. Whose heads do we put on pikes? Clearly congress doesn't have control of the situation, so what good would removing them do? Clearly it's not the president. Or the justices. Are we gonna storm the pentagon too? What about all the DHS field offices? Police offices with their stock piles of military equipment, tanks, drones, armor? Military bases? Across all 50 states?
      </p>
      <p>
       How the FUCK do you even organize 300,000,000+ people anyway? How about you propose some solutions instead of being some self-righteous tough guy who blames everyone else for their problems.

       We don't want to give up our expensive trucks/cars, homes. x-boxes, cell phones, fast food, booze, drugs (both illegal and legal) and our cushy beds. Just for a revolution that will kill the dollar, and send this country into hyper-inflation, and everyday hardships like in poor undeveloped countries. We want to maintain the status quo of narcissism, and not have to suffer for freedom. It's that reality which is simple, and it apples to every top economic country as well not just America.

       Dodge Rams are not all made in China. In fact many parts are made in Japan and USA. Besides I think the Chinese would object to their parts as cheap shit.

       Still though. The statement has nothing to do with lack of balls. It has to do with the fact that Americans do not like to give up their power, prestige and vanity (narcissitic personality) or egocentrism.

       However you seem to take delight in the evil dragon dying. You might be careful what you wish for. This dragon has a nuke arsenal and just might burn down the whole world with it's last breath  of fire. You can ask the Japanese how many times the dragon spewed it's flames.

       Bad news. The last of the small Dole factory except for a tourist spot. Is designated for 5000 home development and a mall. Pineapple is all but gone here. We grow the best weed here though. Kona Gold

       No no no stop it. Our elected wonderful officials are working to stop what they allowed right now. They didn't know we wouldn't like be watched... after. Truth is we need someone or some group to stand up and give us some thing to stand with. But that person or group will have a death sentence and in America death is the most feared.

       No that's a bad analogy. Wolves have a social hierarchy. If there is no alpha in a pack, a beta steps up to take the position as alpha they don't wait around for some random alpha to show up and lead the pack.

       Very true about the drug thing. What I remember most about the DARE program in school -specifically- was that not one DARE officer talked about prescription drugs/pharmaceuticals. Either they didn't know at the time what was about to hit, or they did a damn good job covering it up.

       DARE made me not trust police when I realized pot was not meth and that I had been pretty effectively brainwashed. I ruined friendships because of my brainwashing that pot is pure evil. How can I trust anything they say now?

       I see what you're saying.. You mean you ostracized or cut off friends for using pot, when it wasnt a big deal, and was demonized by DARE? I understand. In my first philosophy class in junior college (I swear it was harder than my 4 year) we learned via Immanuel Kant to never accept anything as true, from anyone in a position of power, or otherwise, if there is no proof to back it up. I apply that to everything I do in life. In business, it's saved me thousands of dollars. I can also sense a scam artist a mile away, and I can see two steps ahead of my competition.

       But it was police officers, in my school, when I was in 5th grade. I had the faculties to realize I didn't want to be Christian even though my parents made me go every sunday, but I somehow couldn't put together that perhaps I shouldn't believe everything said by the police until I was like 20. It takes a lot of courage to openly buck the system like that when there's no one who agrees. This was in Oklahoma, a hotbed of authority-worship, I'd like to add.

       Sure, I understand. Sometimes the part of the country you're in makes a huge difference. A small town looks at crime under a much more powerful microscope (scrutiny), than a large city.

       I've thought of the Oceanic area.  It scares me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wildlife in Australia includes some of the nastiest and deadliest insects and animals on planet Earth.  And that's just in your yard.  (Spiders and snakes.)  Then there is the beach.  I'd rather not be stung by a jellyfish the size of my fingernail.  Nor be put in a medical coma for weeks while the venom ravages my body.  Definitely not be awake while my body is in agony for weeks.

       How is New Zealand for hazardous, nay deadly, outdoor climate?  I've read amazing things that have me wanting to visit the country.  Some places, like Christchurch, are reputed to be bucolic places of yesteryear.  Others, such as the Glowworm Caves, are described as miracles of nature.

       <a href="/r/newzealand">
        /r/newzealand

       and look at some of the moving to NZ FAQs?
Christchurch... Some people called it the most English city in NZ, but a lot of the older buildings have gone since the 2011 earthquake. The rebuilding finally appear to be picking up in earnest, and there's plenty of work there in the construction and trades sectors.
Other than that, the major cities are Auckland and Wellington, where you'll no doubt find work if your kind of job (like mine) happens in a high rise office tower.

       it sounds like the only person the terrorists have beaten is you. Open the curtains and take off the hat, dude; that's society out there passing you right the fuck by as the rest of us go on with a little thing called "our lives." You're the one sitting in a chat room scared like a little bitch finger-bangin' your keyboard like Don Quixote without all those pesky wind mills to get in the way. You think our freedoms are being trampled on? seriously? If this is your response to our freedoms being trampled on you're the one who needs to turn in his testicles; go talk to a muslim about the people in their village who have been killed by actual  oppression; or study 1/1000th of world history to get one iota of the  perspective on what, exactly, oppression is. Join the fuckin' military if you're such a god-damned tough guy; i bet they wouldn't even let you on the bus. You're a twat.

       Remembering all the bad things we've done to each other in the past only makes the human race hate itself. That sounds wrong but were really all on the same team, but we make up these fake excuses to make other humans enemies just so we can finally use all these fancy killing machines that would otherwise gather dust. As they should.

       Forgive, but when it comes to history, please do not forget.  I believe we are all definitely on the same side, or at least we're all in this together, maybe the concepts are not synonymous, yet I definitely want less fighting.

       But the world so bad and history just repeats itself. We just need to keep in mind why we cant forget while we teach the younger generations around that ideal. Like the worlds largest/necessary group lie.

       That love which is blind to the faults of loved ones is no love at all.  Gandhi said that I think.  It is loving to find a problem, if the intention is to by doing so make things better.

       So yeah my 'love' is not blind and infact your quote just makes it sound like its the mother fucking right thing to do because I was taking into account our faults. Take that Gandhi your knowledge only worked in your own niche. But I can't say that because we don't know if it even was Gandhi who said that.

       You ask some good questions. Are we (Canada) any different than the US ? Yes, and no. We are different in that we have the well known Canadian politeness. This, for the most part, extends to
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       of the Police and Government. Here, in Kingston, Ontario, the Police are actually quite reasonable and professional. But when you go into the down town part of Kingston every other store is empty and/or boarded up, largely as a result of the 2008 economic non sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other parts of Canada people are getting shot and killed by the Police. The Police don't seem to taken to task for this. This has been going on for about 13 or so years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Tar sands are a really bad environmental catastrophe waiting to happen. Not to mention the economic mess that it stirs up, as it costs a great deal to get the product out of the sand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Federal Government is as beholding to Israel as the US Government is, sadly. And if we, in Canada, criticize Israel, that amounts to "hate" speech, which is just bullshit. Our Federal Politicians are, maybe not as out right evil, just as misguided and sometimes stupid as the US counterparts are. Like allowing American Police to have jurisdiction is Canada. It will be a frosty day in Hell before I will bow down to an American cop in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the most part, yes, life in Canada is pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too have traveled across the country and back. To say that it is vast is an understatement. But the people, by and large, are wonderful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States has always seemed to be about 25 years ahead of Canada. By that I mean that they (the US) are what we will become. I don't know if I like that at all.
