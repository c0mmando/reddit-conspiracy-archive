       My university has an interdisciplinary studies program which allows students to craft their own major in cooperation with the faculty. I'm combining anthropology, political science, and philosophy. My thesis is going to be about how to take conspiracy theory seriously and the importance and stakes of doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thought y'all would find this cool and that it might even inspire some others to do something similar if the opportunity's available.

       You are taking 3 useless degrees and combining them into 1 super useless degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are wasting your parents hard earned cash and you should be ashamed of yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop wasting their money and waste your own. Every single person in this thread knows you aren't going anywhere with that degree and I seriously feel bad for your parents for enabling this non sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not even dare compare parents paying for a business degree to parents paying for a "conspiracy theory" degree that doesn't exist.

       You fell into the college trap and you should be the one to pay for it. Not your parents

       "Useless" if it doesn't make you money working for a company?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's one thing about the whole "college trap" thing I don't understand.  I mean, I agree college is way overpriced and often you learn more outside of school than in.  For sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weird thing is that the college trap people seem to gear their analysis towards "What will make you money," which is odd, because that's perpetuating the same system and reasoning that led college to get so overpriced in the first place.  Justifying a degree in philosophy by saying that you can use it to become a corporate lawyer and make money actually makes me throw up in my mouth a little.  A degree in philosophy is there to teach you philosophy.  What's wrong with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Learning for learning sake is worth more than a shit ton of useless money, in my view.

       Oh ok, so you just have a problem with the humanities and people that think learning is intrinsically valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know philosophy is one of the best majors for becoming a lawyer?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could graduate, go to law school, and make hella bank working for a corporation. Money well spent!
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe im just interested in learning and doing something i enjoy after college? And maybe my parents understand and support that!
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly at first I thought you were just saying, "hey you're really privileged!" I think about that a lot and its why im doing this. But I guess you only have a problem with privilege used for something beyond reproducing itself?

       He's obviously someone who thinks STEM education is the only
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       education.  Someone who doesn't see the intrinsic value of having knowledge and learning.  Although you could easily learn all of that stuff yourself for free(or relatively cheap), most college courses are shaped to mold your thinking into a "coincidence theory" rather than a reality based curriculum.  For starters you should read the book: "Foundations: Their Power And Influence" by Rene Wormser, it describes the documented fact that colleges and universities are compromised and are being used to bring about a socialist world government through gradualism.  It describes the findings of the Reece Committee on Tax Exempt Foundations in 1954 and the implications from the hearings.  It's a mind blower to say the least.  Also will make you not want to go to college.  It's a bad idea, honestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also read "Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes" by Jacques Ellul, he lays out pretty well that the more "education" you have the more susceptible to propaganda you become.

       Awesome man. I really think we need to change the definition of conspiracy theory or at the very least dissuade the majority who relate anything conspiratorial to the tin foil hat stereotype. 
I think it would lend us much more credibility if we were seen as what we are, critical thinkers. 
Also i have seen this in many cases, people who have the knowledge because they have researched but rather than bringing those who doubt what has been said closer to the truth are actually alienating them by acting immaturely and quite frankly very rude. This is why i am glad to hear that you will be majoring in this since your degree will lend you (to others at least) credibility for you academic success and so forth. Sorry for rambling but i really would like to enforce this concept of critical thinking, knowledge and growth everyday, and to educate those who have been misled and misinformed. 
I wish you the best of luck my friend

       Interesting choice of invective. Its barb is predicated on you
       <em>
        being
       </em>
       the adult, meaning you must value the subjective, transitory, social construct - applicable only in the absence of critical thought - as if it is something to aspire to or be proud of.

       I think I might enjoy corresponding with you after all. It'll be a sort of black comedy sketch show wherein we see what happens to the retard in a room full of chainsaws.

       Part of my interest in doing this is changing that gut reaction. The few times ive seen this happen (in myself and others) have been beautiful, and i think its a discursive struggle we shouldnt shy away from. Ive thought about calling it deep politics because that fascinates me too but I am also interested in studying the bullshit conspiracy theories and what's at stake with "conspiracy theory."
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing's set in stone though, and there also may be a lot to gain from calling it deep politics cause few people are familiar with that term. Being able to differentiate the cooption of conspiracy theory from issues concerning deep politics is really important, but that can be done under either header, since studying conspiracy theory includes studying it's cooption.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if we clearly differentiate ourselves from those coopting conspiracy theory it is always something that can be used to label us (by the same people even!) so I dont think its a battle we can avoid. I think the boston bombing is a really good example of this: first they highlighted that jahar and tamerlan subscribed to conspiracy theories, then they moved to paint those as right-wing and white supremacist. Ceding conspiracy theory to those people makes it all the more potent as a prejorative label that can be unfairly and inaccurately applied to others. The problem with white supremacist conspiracy theory isnt that its conspiracy theory, its that its white supremacist, and people interested in deep politics (hopefully) arent going to start criticizing them for the former rather than the latter.

       For me, 'politics' is loaded term, too. It is the non-governance, the non-policy around which various humans blather at best; conspire at worst; or otherwise meander forth in mediocrity.

      <p>
       I am interested in policy. I am interested in governance.

       Sadly, I am also interested in the absence of these things in arenas where there should be nothing but.

        I really think we need to change the definition of conspiracy theory or at the very least dissuade the majority who relate anything conspiratorial to the tin foil hat stereotype.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The important thing is that we need to change it. When people think of conspiracy theories (when I talk about them in my daily life to people who don't already know me) they generally give me a look first like i'm psychotic or that I must believe that I'm getting abducted by the mothership every night.
      </p>
      <p>
       That couldn't be further from the truth, but until we as a community can distance true conspiracy theorists -- the truth seekers, free thinkers, those who are objective with no confirmation bias -- from those who jump to conclusions based on no evidence, our community is destined to fail, unfortunately.

       Good to see more people who are thinking like this! Too many people cannot grasp how tiny we are compared to the universe. Once we step back and see this perhaps our(not as in you and me but the majority who believe happiness is measured by how much stuff we have) inflated egos will subside :) Until then continue your pursuit of knowledge and truth, keeping a critical mind, and question everything!

       Well said. Iv'e found that people do not switch mindsets in an instant, but if you keep making them aware of issues in an unbiased and calm way, they eventually start to listen. I think 911 is the key. It's such a big event but is so obviously a false flag that once you realize the truth everything else gets turned upside down and you can start re-building.

       Because one of the most prominent conspiracy theories of the 20th century was that satellites were being launched into space for purposes of global mind control, and it was believed by conspiracy theorists that a reflective metallic head covering would prevent that control. And so conspiracy theorists wore tinfoil hats, because it was the most readily available reflective metallic head covering at the time.

       Yeah this stuff is fascinating, and I think it's one of the least understood facets of conspiracy theory by people unfamiliar with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be sure to keep y'all updated, and appreciate the links to stuff on this specifically. it's really important but there's surprisingly little discussion of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The skeptic doublespeak is really frustrating. If you haven't already checked it out, I think rigorous intuition is an incredible blog which does a great job of reclaiming skepticism for those that take conspiracy theories seriously.

       This is up there for "most annoying thing in the world" for me.  "Skeptics" who defend and parrot the status quo.  A most Orwellian abuse of language.  Imagine when the Catholic Church was in charge, with the priests being skeptics and calling Galileo a conspiracy theorist.

       Sounds fun.

      <p>
       You're going to run into some barriers though when you try to use "alternative" sources to cite conspiracy theory.  Such sources are not recognized as credible in academia.  You'll be limited to using them as primary sources when you're discussing theory of conspiracy theory.

       I will, thanks. One of my theories is that cia-kgb cooperation was extensive and that the narrative of cold war antagonism between the US and USSR was constructed for their (and others') benefit. His work on US financing of soviet industry certainly lends some plausibility to this theory. This is the first I've seen of others looking in that direction. And I've been meaning to read his book on skull &amp; bones for ages.

       Pro tip 1:  Take an international view of conspiracy.  I.e., don't take a view of only U.S. conspiracies or U.S. public discourse on conspiracy.  Many nations don't have the same mafia-style mechanisms for neutralizing conspiracy talk via creating toxic radioactive discrediting/ridicule around conspiracy hypothesizing.  Many regions (example:  South America) have been on the receiving end of U.S. conspiracies and belittling such conspiracy ideas is not possible by mainstream politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro tip 2:  If you don't believe in conspiracies, then you don't believe in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro tip 3:  Construct a psych profile of the typical conspiracyphobe.  This tactic is used frequently to intimidate non-conspiracyphobic people.  Case in point:  Tom Hanks, Hollywood conformist, Teacher's pet, wants to be popular, terrified of acknowledging non-conformist thought, terrified of being seen as non-"normal" and "outside" consensus thought, currently producing two "Oswald Did It" films including "Parkland" which will arrive this autumn during the weeks before the 50th JFK Assassination anniversary.  TL;DR - They will psych profile you.  Deconstruct them first.

       Awesome, I once thought about doing a similar paper but then decided to write about Anarchism instead ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it will get tricky if you start going into connections with occultism and intelligence agencies, but IMHO they're essential to understanding how a NWO-type conspiracy could actually work. A look at the differences between
       <em>
        1984
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Brave New World
       </em>
       might also be helpful in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be interesting to look at the methods and psychology behind some documented conspiracies and hoaxes. Here are some suggestions:
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The historical Bavarian Illuminati, and their use of Freemasonry to become a secret society within a secret society
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due">
         Propaganda Due
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare">
         Psychological warfare
        </a>
        , MK-ULTRA, COINTELPRO, Operation Mockingbird, etc. (but of course, these are just government operations classified for reasons of national security, so move along, nothing to see here...)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Hoaxes:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Protocols of the Elders of Zion
       </li>
       <li>
        The theory about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_is_dead">
         Paul McCartney being dead and replaced by a look-alike
        </a>
        , which seemingly started as an innocent joke but took on a life of its own, fueled by the whole Beatles mythos
       </li>
       <li>
        The modern
        <a href="http://www.world-news-research.com/californiasi.html">
         Bavarian Illuminati
        </a>
        at Berkeley, part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mindfuck">
         Operation Mindfuck
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        The use of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation">
         disinformation
        </a>
        by intelligence agencies, and their likely involvement in creating/diverting the 9/11 truther and Occupy movements
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I also find the concept of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion#Main_cognitive_distortions.5B1.5D">
        cognitive distortions
       </a>
       useful for understanding the fascination with conspiracy theories, because most people's reaction when first confronted with a good convincing yarn about how everything is controlled by evil space lizards, is indeed to feel helpless and depressed. Hence the generally crappy level of discourse on conspiracy forums.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this helps, sorry I got a little carried away ;-)

       The key thing that needs to be proven is
      </p>
      <p>
       conspiracy theorists =
       <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/">
        abductivists
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       non-conspiracy theorists = deductivists
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be objectively argued, and possibly proven, which thought process is more likely to yield the truth. It can also be argued that specifically one group uses one type of reasoning and the other group uses the other type of reasoning. This topic needs an academic paper.

       Holy shit yes. I took intro to cogsci a year ago and while we discussed induction and deduction briefly abduction was left out entirely. This makes so much sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I just realized I arrived at one of my best (hopefully) theories partially via abduction: george HW bush is and has always been the (or a) head of the cia. Its something big theyd want to keep hidden (conflicts of interest), makes sense from the cia's organizational perspective (the fewer heads they have, the more secure secrets are), explains mk ultra and the 1971 un convention on psychotropic substances (which happened while HW was ambassador to the UN), and recognizes that the cia is liable to keep its top leadership a secret, which is one of the easiest things to do but also the most important.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no proof, but arrived there after noticing how odd it was that 1947 was the year the cia was founded, roswell happened, bush was photographed with skull and bones (taken down from wikipedia after I realized this), and the first national debate tournament was held (at Westpoint,  there and for the next 20 years). Skull and bones was founded by yale debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And... given the business plot and operation paperclip, as the son of prescott bush and a member of skull and bones he was the perfect candidate for conspirators with the long haul in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the kind of thing that could be kept secret by such a tiny group of people that it would be virtually impossible to arrive at via anything BUT abduction.

       Right. Here's the thing though: abduction is based on all of the data you have available to you. The data every individual has available to them will be different, and hence people may arrive at different conclusions even though each uses sound reasoning. The other thing is that there is never a guarantee you have the right answer, only that you have the best answer you can come up with, or maybe several probable but separate scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we end up in a world of uncertainty, and there is never a firm authority to tell us we're right, that we're doing good, and that everything is ok. It's basically a lifelong process of continual learning, and continually discarding things that were perhaps once comfortable assumptions that were taken for granted, but that have been shown to be false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the world of uncertainty and continual learning is much more realistic than the world of concrete truths constructed around us like a castle to keep us safe. But the concrete doesn't exist and never has existed. Instead we have to become intelligent, skillful, courageous, and reflective in order to exist in the real environment where there are no guarantees that we can predict the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's why it's so important. The false certainty people consume has a dire price. It creates diametrically opposed groups each so certain about their world views that they try to destroy each other. Look at any fault-line across society. Instead of being alert, aware, and questioning the world all the time, they turn outwards and try to destroy the other point of view in order to make themselves feel safe and certain. It will destroy humanity if people don't accept reality as it is and deal with the uncertainty on their own.

       Willdo man; Berkeley is on my top 3 list. I am not sure what their PhD packages look like, as far as stipends go, but the school alone would drive me to take a lower package. That question "what do you want to know" seems to be the key to really landing a good spot, fellowship, etc.; coincidingly, the hardest f*ing question to answer (in the narrow PhD-research sense).

       The best thesis are the ones that remain objective yet still prove a point.
Your best bet is to examine the 'ingredients' that allow conspiracy theories to exist.
Select 10 popular conspiracy theories and examine the elements of each event that allow a conspiracy to take place.
You'll score higher marks if you try to remain objective. It'll turn less people off if they believe that you're not trying to prove to them that aliens from nibiru flew hologram planes into the twin towers to cover up the Jews killing JFK in a satanic pact sealed by princess Diana's death, under instructions of the archons that caused the gulf of Tonkin incident lol.

       There really are conspiracies. Some are widely accepted as true (like iran contra), while others (like 9/11) have been surrounded by loads of disinformation in the form of false  conspiracy theories (circulated by government agents, people looking to profit from people's interest in conspiracies, and people fooled by the first two groups) as well as the attempted debunking of true ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't think 9/11 was an inside job, check out the blog rigorous intuition. Its section on 9/11 is really well done and is especially great on why truly being skeptical requires taking conspiracy theory seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also a lot of double standards in play, which has a lot to do with how deep politics and covert organizations have manipulated conspiracy theories as well as the discourse surrounding them. Someone else in this thread already posted about how the term "conspiracy theory" was first circulated by the CIA in an attempt to discredit anyone that claimed lee harvey oswald didnt act a lone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's the politics of the label "conspiracy theorist." Did the msm ever call bush et al conspiracy theorists for claiming that 19 hijackers, under the auspicies of osama bin laden, conspired to destroy the twin towers? Are fbi agents conspiracy theorists for charging jahar tsarnaev with conspiracy due to their theory that he and his brother were responsible for the boston bombing? Being labeled a conspiracy theorist can be stigmatizing and ascribing to more mainstream views can enable people to avoid this even when they're espousing conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the existence of bullshit conspiracy theories (a la a lot of the shit alex jones spews) should encourage us to take conspiracy theory more seriously. Once we get over making fun of him and his ilk, what do we make of him? Is he just doing this for money? Is he part of a government psy-op?
      </p>
      <p>
       While these are only questions, we shouldnt be afraid to also formulate them as theories as long as we recognize them as such. After all, there really are conspiracies. Universities pay string theorists to do their work, and they haven't even proven strings exist! Theory has limits, but it also needs to be taken seriously.

       Why the desire to label it a "conspiracy theory major". Why not majoring in history and a double minor in anthropology and philosophy. You seem to be complicating a very simple process in University.

       <em>

       A lot of the desire stems from what I talked about in the comment you're replying to. The label "conspiracy theory" provokes controversy and evokes double standards and for that reason alone the discursive stakes are high.

       The soul purpose of the education system is to put you debt and for you to find a job to pay off that debt. What job do you think your going to get with that independent study?
      </p>
      <p>
       We all love conspiracy and we spend many hours learning and watching.  You do not need a degree in it to make it your passion in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get your degree in something that can earn you money if you plan on working for the man. This degree sounds like a liberal arts bullshit degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a dream crusher. This is reality.  You can still pursue you passions of conspiracy.

       I appreciate the advice a lot - but  you may be overestimating the amount this major will restrict what I can do after college.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not sure if ill go to law school or grad school, or become a journalist or 
a novelist or a musician, but those are all possibilities as of now. Im lucky enough to have options like this even as a conspiracy theory major.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really am committed to legitimizing conspiracy theory as a field of inquiry, a task that has an importance which transcends whatever my future career is. Hopefully it'll contribute towards making college about more than job training too.

       Becoming a journalist, novelist, or musician was a possibility without the degree. Same with creating documentaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of learning from books or youtube or podcasts, you want to spend a ton of money on a college class that doesnt help you with paying off that ton of money you paid for the class.
      </p>
      <p>
       College, as much as the universities try to make you believe, is not the only source of education.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop defending your degree for 5 min and ask yourself why you need this degree. Not want, need. You can do all the things you want without the useless degree.

       You need a degree to get into grad school but when you say I want to get into grad or go law or be a musician or be a writer it leads me on to think you dont know what you want. You can persue your dreams almost all of those without college. So why not focus on the one field that you can enjoy that will actually make you money.

       As an academic subject, I believe it would be quite impossible to study conspiracy theories as collective genre because the spectrum is so diverse with regards to type and plausibility. I would hazard an opinion that attempting to generalising the subject as a whole would be difficult and some-what useless. In much the same way that trying to group political or religious perspectives raises difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I don't think there is much cause for the academic study of any single conspiracy theory either. A conspiracy matter-of-factly ceases to be a conspiracy if there is evidence to prove the position. Thus any author on the subject must succumb to a dichotomous dilemma: He can either write about something that is no longer a conspiracy and call it one regardless, or write about a current conspiracy in the knowledge he will have no factual data for his conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I believe despite it being an interesting topic worthy of a great deal of attention, trying to capture its essence any academic sense would be rather futile.

       Please give some examples of theories later confirmed.  Dunning says there are none.  I think he's talking about theories believed ONLY among the conspiracy-theorist community, and not suspected among the general body politic.  For example, if lots of people thought we were sending weapons to the Afghans when they were fighting the Russians, and later it turned out to be true, that's not an example of "a theory that was later confirmed".

       That is an example of "a theory that was later confirmed." There is no homogenous conspiracy-theorist community distinct from "the general body politic."
      </p>
      <p>
       Things happened the other way around. Members of "the general body politic" were painted as conspiracy theorists by the CIA for claiming that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone.

       Let's stay on the Afghan example.  Did not some establishment people say right away "I'll bet US govt is supporting the rebels", with no proof ?  So it never qualified as a "conspiracy theory", by his definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I'd say there IS a separate conspiracy-theory community.  If someone refuses to believe any fact (no matter how well sourced) that conflicts with their beliefs, accuses anyone who disagrees with them of being "part of the conspiracy" or a "sheeple", and believes just about EVERY conspiracy theory ever put forth, they're part of that community.  "Normal" people don't behave like that.

       The claim that conspiracy theories can ONLY ever be true if formulated by "establishment people" is pretty ridiculous. And, to be honest, it sounds like a conspiracy theory (i.e., there's a conspiracy of "non-establishment people" to invent fake theories!) Are you an "establishment person?" If not, sounds like your theory can't be true ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's pretty absurd to change the subject. You asked for an example that contradicted your theory, I gave it to you, and then you say "no, wait, let's go back to one that confirms my theory!" That sounds suspiciously like what you're accusing "conspiracy theorists" of doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       People that refuse to believe facts that conflict with their beliefs can be found in every community. Some conspiracy theorists accuse people of being sheeple. Some people accuse others of being conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly makes somebody "normal?" Why can't someone who thinks there are conspiracies be normal?

       If I understand Dunning, he's not saying "conspiracy theories can ONLY ever be true if formulated by establishment people".  He's saying "it's not a conspiracy theory if mainstream people believe it", and "no conspiracy theory ever has proved to be true".
      </p>
      <p>
       I gave an example, you said you refuted it, then tried to change to another example.  I said stay with first example, told you why I disagreed with you.  What's wrong with that ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I gave you a definition for telling conspiracy theorists apart from "normal people".

       That's a self-serving definition which creates double standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, the FBI claims that jahar and tamerlan are guilty of the boston bombings. They have been charged with conspiracy. Their claims are thus a "conspiracy theory" and "mainstream" people believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's go back to JFK again. People claimed that LHO didn't act alone and was aided by the CIA. That's a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if "mainstream" people believe it, it's not? How is that possible when your criterion for someone not being "mainstream", or "normal", and being a part of "the conspiracy theory community," is
       <em>
        believing conspiracy theories?
       </em>

       You should minor in criminal justice, if at all possible.

       Sounds arbitrary, but I feel the two would be an excellent combination, and you'd be able to freak out a good number of criminal justice students in the process.

       Holy shit yes. I took intro to cogsci a year ago and while we discussed induction and deduction briefly abduction was left out entirely. This makes so much sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I just realized I arrived at one of my best (hopefully) theories partially via abduction: george HW bush is and has always been the (or a) head of the cia. Its something big theyd want to keep hidden (conflicts of interest), makes sense from the cia's organizational perspective (the fewer heads they have, the more secure secrets are), explains mk ultra and the 1971 un convention on psychotropic substances (which happened while HW was ambassador to the UN), and recognizes that the cia is liable to keep its top leadership a secret, which is one of the easiest things to do but also the most important.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no proof, but arrived there after noticing how odd it was that 1947 was the year the cia was founded, roswell happened, bush was photographed with skull and bones (taken down from wikipedia after I realized this), and the first national debate tournament was held (at Westpoint,  there and for the next 20 years). Skull and bones was founded by yale debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And... given the business plot and operation paperclip, as the son of prescott bush and a member of skull and bones he was the perfect candidate for conspirators with the long haul in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the kind of thing that could be kept secret by such a tiny group of people that it would be virtually impossible to arrive at via anything BUT abduction.

       Why the desire to label it a "conspiracy theory major". Why not majoring in history and a double minor in anthropology and philosophy. You seem to be complicating a very simple process in University.

       I still feel you need to sand down your ideas, what i get from your response is you want to write about how
       <em>
        important information
       </em>
       is controlled. How it is packaged, spread and received, how this process leads to such a kaleidoscopic of differing views.

       I don't know what I want to do, it's true. But I can do all the things I listed no matter my major, so it seems like my career decision bears on how much money I'll make more than that.

       Very true, the internet definitely changes a lot. I wouldn't underestimate the radio though, its one of the few times people listen to music that they themselves dont pick.
