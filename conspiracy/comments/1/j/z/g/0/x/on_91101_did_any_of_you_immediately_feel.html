       I was just 15 years old but my father said that he thought that "the attack was an inside job" and that "Bush is crazy and will probably use it to start World War 3" just hours after the attacks.  My dad is not one for conspiracy theories and up until that point he identified with the right of political spectrum.

       I thought for sure the aircraft had come in at a steep dive to get maximum effect by starting fires as low to the ground as possible.  I was stunned to see the planes hit so high up.  It made no sense.  To hit that high up would cause most people to run like hell and get out, they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time of day was wrong too.  The big shots were not at work yet when the first plane hit.  To get the most out of the effort, the right time would be about 2 pm when the buildings would be as full as they will ever get.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the bad guys 'planning', they did a shitty job, but if it was an inside job they got it right with the least number killed and maximum special effects.

       To this day, I still remember watching the footage of something-that-wasn't-an-airplane crashing into the Pentagon on the news once just after it happened, and then never, ever seeing it again. It seemed pretty clear that whatever hit the Pentagon was not human piloted as it dove very steep, pulled up at the last moment and then it seemed like there was not enough left afterward to have been an airplane.
      </p>
      <p>
       That along with the coincidental training by the military at the same time made me very suspicious .. but the part that really bakes my noodle is that they didn't even bother to try and answer all the questions people had.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was all for real, you'd think that they would want ALL the information to be able to figure out what happened .. unless they already knew what happened. But instead, it seemed like it was a matter of getting the ideas to catch on and then they just ran with it.

       I was 22 and from the beginning I felt that something was very suspicious, that there were secret things going on beneath the surface. I'm also Canadian and have felt pretty distrustful of the American government for as long as I can remember.

       seeing WTC7 come down the same day seemed odd at first, I didn't think through how long it would have taken to wire up that building and the implications.

       I did know as soon as it happened, that it was too convenient, a president dropping low in the polls, and knew this would be used as an excuse to invade iraq (even though they had nothing to do with it)

       I was 18. It was a trip. Nobody knew anything except for what the msm was telling us. I'm positive had it been yesterday social media would have been all over it to the point the story would have been different then what it is. There would have been millions of hours of footage to go off to start.

       I honestly thought NOTHING about that for 3 years. Didn't even know there was an alternate theory until 2004. When I was told about building 7 and I started looking into it.

       Same here. I was in my late teens when it happened and didn't really know what to think at that time. It wasn't until years later that I started to hear theories going around that it was an inside job. Of course, being the pessimist I am, I started to do some research on it and found a lot of discrepancies with the entire event. The more I looked, the more I found. Now I'm at the point where I just can't believe so many people still believe that we had no idea about this attack at all, or any involvement for that matter.

       I was in high school at the time. My history teacher turned on the news, and we all watched, eyes glued to the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was the clip of people cheering in the streets somewhere in the middle east shown on Fox News (I think it later turned out that this was recycled footage, wag the dog style). A girl then spoke up and said "Fuck those people, we should bomb them and let them see what it feels like!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I spoke up at this point, normally keeping quiet in class. I said "Hold up a minute. First, we're Americans. We believe in free speech. As detestable as that cheering is, it is their right, even if they aren't Americans. Second, no nation has claimed responsibility. It's not time to bring out the big guns yet. It's time to let the FBI and CIA do their jobs."
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire class turned on me. "Whose side are you on, asshole?" "Fucking towel-head lover" etc. The teacher calmed down the class, turned to me and said "I get where you're coming from, but you're flat out wrong."
      </p>
      <p>
       Later that day, in the hallway, I saw a muslim girl. I just stared at her. She probably thought I was feeling the hatred that everyone else was feeling, but all I could imagine was what she was going to go through for the next few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I left that high school before the year finished.

       I admit, I was intrigued for about 5 minutes. Then they fucked it up and outed themselves. They, now as then, were too pushy with the narrative, glossing over the huge holes in favor of 'we're under attack, trust us', over and over.

       I'm willing to have a discussion as long as the other side is too. When the other side ignores my questions and posts videos at me that basically amount to "hahaha, look at all the stupid sheeple", that shows that
       <em>

       have no interest in having a discussion.

       What a way to show expanded focus. Again, I posted the video as a way to start a discussion, not push a view on anyone. If you read my initial post, it isn't trying to stuff an idea down anyone's gob, it's meant to express notions which I think are closest to what actually transpired. It doesn't mean I think anyone else's are wrong.

       I was totally along for the ride. Really up until recently I dismissed most of the evidence presented. I would read about it or watch a documentary then found how adamant people were to negate the theories. So, I thought there must be something I'm missing. Turns out most everyone just follows and thrives in a group minded setting hence why its so easy for this curtain to be put over our eyes.

       Glad you came around. It seems like more and more people are starting to figure it out about now. Just make sure you remember to be suspicious of the government and the media for every. single. little. thing. from. now. on. because there will be more and more lies coming, and they are good at fooling us.

       I was the opposite. Up until that point I was not much of a conspiracy theorist, but pretty early on (I think the next day) something inside my brain just kinda clicked... I googled "Osama Bin Laden" and "CIA"... and my life was never the same again.

       I happened to be home that entire day rebuilding my kitchen and had a bigscreen on with cnn playing from early that morning and then swapped back and forth to others all day in horror when this all went down.  (I watched msm back then, total idiot move)  I remember the story of the vans filled with explosives being captured and some other stories here and there about the other vans that were found and the occupants mentioned as being israeli)  The whole time though they were insisting they were almost sure it was al-CIAda, binny, all that jazz.  Then I remember the shocking (

       I was in the 8th grade and my parents took me out of school for the day and I remember seeing the buildings on fire and thinking "well that sucks but there is no way that it would fall so surely we can clean up and rebuild" I mean the building was pretty well intact at that point nothing more than a small fire. Then the buildings started to fall before my eyes. Even at that age I knew that that was physically impossible look at a normal house fire those things don't just fall straight down in on themselves how often have you seen the charred skeleton of a house still standing after they put it out and yet I am supposed to believe that the plane hitting toward the top is supposed to collapse it at the top? Surely heads would be rolling somewhere if they hadn't planned on a building that size getting hit by something. Didn't the empire state building get hit by a plane and not fall down? I was willing to look past that but then the buildings just kept falling. Even WTC7 which wasn't hit at all not even by falling debris. I knew right away that there had to be more too it and that these sort of things shouldn't happen, though I was probably to blissfully unaware as to the scope of the problem. Then when they showed the pictures of the pentagon and said that not only was that whole wing of the building emptied for the day but that there were no plane parts to be seen which even fireworks leave behind something why would a plane leave  0 parts on the ground, and why wouldn't there be impressions of a wing on either side as a plane would leave. There was just a round whole and no debris on the ground outside I knew it was probably not what they were saying it was. After that were those ridiculous adds and people singing to raise money for the cause and politicians saying 9/11 every chance they got. I don't think any of us will ever truly know what happened that day other than the people who orchestrated that but look at the fruit of the tree on this one. Not only that but if Osama Bin Laden was the culprit why then were we going after Sadam Hussein? Death and destruction have been all that have followed this and they have used this as a way to push through things that the American people would never have imagined. Now they have classified who we are even fighting against. Not even Congress is allowed to know who we are at war with and we aren't allowed to know how they vote on legislation. If it wasn't an inside job why does nothing the insiders say add up? If they are really the honest good meaning government of yesteryear that we all remember and they are just responding to an attack then why has the war not ended now that we killed him? Why were all the emergency services told to stay home or be apart of a drill taking place involving the exact same scenario? I think you would have to be crazy to believe the official story it just doesn't add up no matter where you are looking

       You are absolutely right. My grammar is atrocious, I work on it a lot though it has really never been a strong suit of mine. Thank you for pointing that out to me, perhaps that is just what I need to remember to proof read my posts in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had never seen a lot of the pictures you had linked to. I appreciate you showing me another side to the story. Maybe it is just my ignorance to the facts at hand but it didn't seem all that conclusive. The eye witness testimony speaks first of green plane parts and wheel wells that belong to smaller planes, then goes on to say it is blue and red like American airlines and everything fits. The article reads like the writers don't even believe what they are saying. The engine part did appear to be from that sort of plan, though the presence of other plane stuff seems odd but maybe that's just me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as building seven I will conceded there very well could have been damage to the building. There does appear to be cosmetic damage, and there is no telling how extensive the damage was. Both of the other buildings collapsed in on themselves so I think we can all agree that in order to collapse in on itself it would have to have been a pretty unlikely set of circumstances. A critical support beam or several depending on the building specs must be taken out near the bottom, it would have to be hit in just the right way. I have yet to see a building collapse like that before or since, outside of controlled demolitions. If it were possible for some damage to the side it certainly would be a fluke. You expect me to believe that occurred three times... because a plane crash toward the top off the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am certainly not an engineer or a scientist, and I don't build sky scrapers for a living. So I must defer to the judgment of those that do. Ae911truth.org has about 2000 engineers and architects  and thousands of other supporters who swear it couldn't have happened that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit I have no idea what I am looking at where you mentioned 125 people dying. I don't remember there being any deaths perhaps I have forgotten important details over the years, but I can't tell at all what that diagram is trying to tell me and how that would relate to a death toll. I realize that it must be where the plane crashed, and I see that it is color coded but there is no key to say what the colors mean perhaps you could educate me.

       Suspicious at first. When I saw building 7 fall, to me, it was obvious that there was more to the story. Then no investigation. Still amazed that people aren't more curious.

       actually i think the crew of the flight that went down in Pennsylvania threw the plan off. if it had been shot down, it'd have probably broken up more. as far as i know it hit mostly intact.

       I was about 22. Was suspicious the first day when they were like "OMG we are so surprised by this!" and then fifteen minutes later "This is the VILLIAN. Look at him, its OBL he's so eeevilll"

       It just wasn't a plausible way for an investigation to go down. It made perfect sense if you want to invent a new enemy.

       Was solidified when afganistan was like "sure we'll extradite OBL, just show us your proof." and bush says "no prob, I'll get around to that any day now..." ... 12 years later and we're still waiting for that proof.

       I was 20 at the time. I started watching the news after the second plane hit. I've always liked watching buildings come down in a controlled demolition. As soon as the first tower came down I immediately became suspicious.

       I was 20 and had been up all night doing knife-hits of Hashish at a buddy's house about an hour away from where I lived at the time. Someone in the other room decided to flip on the television. I just remember him saying "Holy fuck... a plane hit the WTC". We all came in to watch a bit just as the 2nd plane hit. The first thought that crossed my mind was "we pay lots of people money to sit around all day hoping to God they get a chance to jump in a jet and intercept shit". We wound up jumping in the car and driving home shortly after, my friend was pissed primarily because his sister had enlisted recently and was likely about to go to war; I was pissed because I was certain they were going to cancel the Tool concert which was two days later. (they did. Tool didn't come back for another year or so i think...)
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until later that evening I saw the footage of the towers collapse. Honestly I got very scared. The fear was not sourced in any perceived or contrived foreign entity; it was the fear of realizing exactly how little people in power care for the lives of others. All those things like COINTELPRO and MK-ULTRA suddenly became very real and no longer just likely history, it was happening right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The single most polarizing aspect of the entire experience was talking about it back then. To speak of the many Bin Ladens, of Demolitions, of Interceptors, of NORAD, of noplane@pentagon, of Pretext-For-War, of Molten Steel... was to be ostracized. I had nights in a kitchen where I was the one person in the entire fucking restaurant with an anti-war position. I had a term for that terrible moment when the person arguing with you actually considers the information, then it crashes into the person's societal structure of beliefs, forcing them to re-evaluate their beliefs. I called it "State-Sponsored Denial" and it usually results in people summoning the kind of anger they'd use to defend their religion or way-of-life, and dismissing your points in classic ad hominem fashion.

       I didn't get up until, like, noon that day.  I got up, got around and went to work, where everyone was watching the tvs.  They said, "Planes flew into the world trade center today."  I looked at the screen and shook my head.  I couldn't put my finger on it, but something wasn't right.  It just seemed so unbelievable.  When they elected another Bush, I knew something was wrong.  This just doesn't happen.  By-the-way, if everyone wants to find a bogeyman, look no further than George H.W. Bush...Bay of Pigs, Dallas '63, Watergate?, Reagan attempted assassination?, cocaine smuggling from South America...everyone should know who G.H.W. Bush is.

       When the second WTC tower was hit I raised an eyebrow, when the Pentagon was hit I felt something very fishy was  going on. The Pentagon strike is still the one the focus was diverted from asap. and releasing those couple of frames from the most surveilled of the targeted buildings only aided the theory.

       Along for the ride. Bought it hook line &amp; sinker. It wasn't until I heard about Bush having the Bin Laden's family flown right out of the country &amp; their business relationships together that I started getting curious. Then I saw all of the footage from Firemen, Police &amp; Bystanders saying multiple bombs went off throughout the buildings &amp; no Pentagon footage or wreckage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final thing was I saw how much concentrated heat it takes to cut iron girders and I felt totally confident the planes could not have brought those buildings down by themselves.

       things we openly discussed were the hit at the pentagon, the possibility of a false flag operation, and the possibility that it was a real attack carried out by militant muslims.

       Fifth grade for me, it's kind of scary when you think about it-all the people who were in elementary school when 9/11 happened, I can't remember a year in school I didn't have to write an essay on what 9/11 meant to me...I always felt weird writing it-for one I was too young when it happened to know anything other than what I was directly told(living in WA-not exactly nearby). And two I felt it was weird we did it EVERY year...seriously till senior year-eventually it became weirdly similar to documentaries I'd seen at the time of North Korea-lol! Obviously a thought I kept to myself.

       I was around 14 when it all happened. I remember leaving school on our busses early that day (in northwest Arkansas). My friends and I were not really worried because we are in the heart of America and didn't really understand the situation to the full extent. People were saying we were under attack. Some teachers were pulling their T.V.s out and watching the news. I didn't get to watch much of it until we got home. That night, I was annoyed about missing the new episode of "Who's line is it anyway?" My brother threatened to punch me for saying that... As we watched the news though I couldn't help but say it looked like a demolition site. I remember I used to watch controlled demos on tv and was very fascinated on how they did it in Vegas and LA. Then building 7 collapsed without anything touching it and I that made me VERY skeptical then. As I got older it seemed that tv and news stopped mentioning building 7 altogether. Even on 911 news specials that I saw last year it was not mentioned once... I argue with my dad from time to time about it but he never takes my word. He says conspiracy theorys and whatnot so I just stop talking with him about it. I think he is coming around though because of the NSA.

       I thought for years they blew up wtc7 because it had become too damaged. I remember something on the news saying they were going to demolish it or something. It was only a few years ago that I found out that they changed the story or reported it incorrectly. Also I believed the story 100%, I had even dumped a liberal GF that had accused Bush of masterminding the attack...

       I was in fourth grade and I clearly remember asking my classmates if the official story really made sense to them. Even back then I was skeptical... jesus. My 8 year old brain could somehow see that it's nearly impossible for a massive building to collapse just from being hit by a plane. But to see it happen twice?

       Not really, but I'm not particularly suspicious of it now, either. I think it's quite likely that the US government knew it was coming, but I don't buy into the super nano ultra micro thermite or cruise missile or cold fusion device or any of those similar theories. I believe, both then and now, that the buildings were brought down by the planes and the resulting fire and debris damage. Who exactly was behind the attack, however... That's up for questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for back then... I actually researched current events in the school library on that day and initially came to the conclusion that the Chinese did it, because Bush's people had lost a spy plane in China just a day or two beforehand.
