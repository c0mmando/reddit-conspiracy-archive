    <div class="md"><p>As in a corporate shill? If he doesn&#39;t know what they are then don&#39;t waste your time.  If he doesn&#39;t know by now that policies and legislation in western Democracies,  particularly the US, are heavily influenced by lobbyism then you really are talking to a brick wall.  People like that will always be skeptical  because it&#39;s not mainstream - just wait until it gains popularity; people like that tend to fall in line with everyone else and act as if they knew all along.. so focus your attention on people with open minds, a functional brain, and keep reading. </p>

<p>This is only one example of what is admitted, years ago I might add. Imagine everything that is actually goes on today. Would an organization with endless resources remain neutral on social media and let the public form their own opinions, or would it be worth the chump change to pay a few people to literally post all day long in an attempt to sway the public&#39;s opinion of their agenda or product? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not even the worst of it - there are more PR agents in the USA than there are journalists. Most of the stories that reach mainstream media were written by a corporation that specialises in PR - their services cover either governmental or private interests. Shills are the face of a much larger, evil, propaganda system. </p>

<p>I was totally miffed to find that OP, or anyone, would deny the existence of shills. It really is shocking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For many reasons:
1) My husband and I enjoy arguing about anything. Usually our points are understood by the other but he shut this one down without looking at my evidence (which I agree did not pin point precisely, you had to look at a lot of different things to put the big picture together.)
2) This shill stuff in itself is monumental. Everyone should see that this is going on. There&#39;s no way for people to come together while this tomfoolery is allowed to take place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s many instances I can share with you. The main one that started me down this rabbit hole was when the Alex Jones Sandy Hook conspiracy video came out. It drew my attention because I enjoy viewing controversial things but don&#39;t really get sucked in. However, when I started searching for answers to questions I had stemming from the video, I couldn&#39;t find them. I couldn&#39;t understand why no one was talking about it. Regardless of who created the video, it did leave me with some untied knots. Then when I went to reddit I found that anything posted about it was automatically downvoted and people who were not typical of certain subreddits were bashing anyone who posted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These sockpuppets are swarming all around social media these days, manipulating voting, reporting the most important information so as it gets &#39;disappeared&#39;.  They are mainly working from US military bases.  There are teams who work closely in coordination, especially around Reddit, they have projects in specific Subreddits where it is their job to create a propaganda thread e.g. about the HPV vaccine (you know, the covert sterilization program).  They then manipulate the votes until the post is highly visible, they downvote anyone who&#39;s posting anything too logical/informative, and they use their thousands of accounts to make to fake the general consensus, making it seem like everyone thinks the HPV vaccine is wonderful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much for this information! I&#39;m a very busy business woman,mom,etc. So the time I spend on the internet is limited. I don&#39;t often post but I read a lot. My background is in data analysis and I&#39;m very good with picking up on behavioral trends. I&#39;ve always come to r/conspiracy so I recognize how drastically the behavior has changed on this subreddit and others. It was around February with the Sandy Hook conspiracy video that I really noticed the suppression. This freaked/freaks me out how easily people can be fooled by this method. It makes me so mad that all of this crazy stuff is going on with out country and I hear people try to reason and rationalize why it&#39;s not so bad. What exciting times we&#39;ve yet to face. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome noroseglasses, some people like yourself are good on picking up on these trends, others are blissfully unaware.  The same thing has happened on all major conspiracy sites recently, cyber armies have been sent in.  This is a form of censorship on the Internet.  Hopefully the Reddit community will find a way to counter this, those at the top are fully aware of it.</p>
