        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Being a student of comparative mythology and ancient societies, I was obviously intrigued when a friend of mine &quot;tapped&quot; me for access to a little club he said had &quot;carried on the secrets of the ancients.&quot; At first it was just a bunch of guys hanging out, half-heartedly (and half-jokingly) fulfilling traditional ritual obligations for the sake of decorum, and not really taking the thing seriously at all. But then as the years went by more doors were opened for us: betters dorms, lower tuition, first placement in great classes, and later, interviews with folks at great companies who had taken the same path as us. Now, 7 years later, I have a much better job than I ever imagined, and an opportunity to go even higher. I&#39;ve also discovered brotherhood, and spiritual growth, and feel I have a greater understanding of our universe and my place in it.</p>

<p>I just wanted to say that you shouldn&#39;t be afraid. I don&#39;t want to control anybody. The names I have learned and the things I have called upon don&#39;t want you to hurt you. The teachings Adma brought from the hill at Edessa to Ṣapānu; the words Adapa smuggled from there to Eridu; the mysteries Abram brought from Ur and left for Solomon in Machpelah. My elders carry on this legacy, and it is my belief that the world would not be as it is without them. </p>

<p>Ours is a tradition of peace and understanding, and I hope someday the world will be ready to carry the torch. For now we will light the way.</p>

I don&#39;t hide my college transcripts and all I learned from its education behind the name of some club I don&#39;t talk about.  Regardless of the actual intent, it is the &#39;secret&#39; part of secret societies that is the problem.  And for that, you can stick your club up Adma&#39;s ass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/rel_chu_att-religion-church-attendance">If you look at the trends over the last thirty years as far as church attendance, especially in the UK and across Europe,</a> there is no need to keep these little boys clubs in the shadows any longer, if indeed it is the big bad Vatican they fear.  You are not going to be burned as awitch or stoned as a blasphemer.  The Spanish inquisition is not happening now if you came out of the closet, so to speak.  However, when you say you got perks at college and lower tuition and a great job and all the nepotistic &#39;secret&#39; society benefits, you aren&#39;t coming out to talk about the secrets of Ur.  That is completely beside the point of the inner circle fraternity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I contend that only the High Priest was allowed into the Holiest of Holies because that is an excellent way to cow the masses.  Create an untestable almighty force that will smite anyone of a lesser personage if they blaspheme in entering and create a couple of burned dead bodies to show the aftermath of God&#39;s wrath.  Then, we go inside with impunity, you are revered.  This isn&#39;t a miracle.  It&#39;s a parlor trick.</p>
