       Hi everyone, so I ve been lurking around reddit for a long time finally made an account a while back and recently started being more active. Anywho, I have alway been aware that the reality I was presented growing up was'nt reality and I have always searched for and been open to the truth; lately I cant tell if im just letting r/conspiracy get to my head( literally always reading something on here) or if im just becoming more aware... Example I was just reading through all of the petitions for states to secede from the US and was about to sign it when I realized whatever the govt responds with one things for sure no ones going to like it because our gov is notorious for being fu**ed up and I do believe we are headed for civil unrest, back to why I didnt sign it, I figured they have the names of those who chose tobe dissassociated with the US could there be reparations for those that chose to put their names on that? Now I know thats a bit extreme but I try to stay ahead of the game and I do believe in alot of topics we discuss here at r/conspiracy I also believe somehow they all tie together. I try not to believe everything I read because lets face it a good amount turns out to be crap. Im not a cooky person im quite normal but latley Im taking these things more seriously and I can see that I am more afraid than anything latley its starting to make me question myself I know I was totally babbling but im wondering if I just need another reality check.. Thanks guys :)

       What?
      </p>
      <p>
       You should always sign you dissenting opinions regarding the government (published on the government's website) with your actual name and address.
      </p>
      <p>
       What could possibly go wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the government really wants to help make sure your stay is as comfortable a possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a serious note, who actually signs those things?  A petition?  A fucking petition; are you fucking retarded?

       They would definitely have your name if you signed it so your paranoia about that isn't unjustifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said I signed it anyway because i really don't care.  If the US devolves into such a state where you face repercussions for signing a stupid petition that never has a chance of causing a state to secede anyway... I ready and willing to be an enemy of the state at that point anyway.

       I'm done living in fear of everything.  Terrorism, big brother, who wins the election, bird flu, nuclear winter, aliens or whatever else they come up with.  Not afraid,  don't care, STFU.

       I remember reading about the succession petitions on yahoo news. This was the comment I posted on that article: 
[
We should let Texas out, and then force them to use a non-dollar currency. This will make them so poor they'll need a loan.
We then make the IMF loan them a huge sum of money, but have that money go toward helping a few rich people only, who build
big construction projects from American corporations in Texas who only hire Americans who temporarily immigrate to Texas. 
Then, we send in some financial people who say, "look, you owe us a lot of money, can't pay your debts.. sell your oil to 
us: real cheap". If the Texans elect a leader who says, "Texas oil will go toward helping Texas citizens", then we just 
send in the CIA sponsored jackals and have them assassinated. Or if the jackals fail, like they did for Saddam, then we 
just invade them, saying that Texas citizens are terrorists and that we have to go to war or else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait.. that would just be a repeat of what America's foreign policy has been for South America and the Middle East for 
the last 70 years or so. Oh well, who needs to be original anyways, when you got a news agency like Fox News and a 
population of genetically inbred irrationally overly suggestible tools who think every insidious chess move you do is 
"cool". U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!

       Reality checks keep you honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should ask yourself daily if you're being a cosmic schmuck. An unwitting tool to those who would manipulate you for their own ends. The likelihood is that you're
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being a cosmic schmuck. But if you start wondering about it the chances go down even further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Live a good life, help people and keep your cool, bro.

       The main, main thing (and this is easier said than done, of course) is to simply work at
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being afraid.  I mean think about it.  If the government IS all fucked up, then would you rather live sucking government cock for another 60 fucking years until your miserable life is over and you finally die (sooner if you're lucky) or would you rather possibly 1) live a bit of a shorter life because 2) you spend it at least fighting (directly or indirectly, quietly or loudly) the obvious injustices that you see going on in the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about what the common denominating factor is in both of those scenarios are:  Your life
       <em>
        sucks
       </em>
       .  It's shitty.  In both scenarios, it's crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it'll either be shitty because you spend it as a warrior fighting TPTB and maybe ending up getting harassed (or killed, tortured, hurt, etc) in the process (in which case at least your fighting for what you believe in), or it'll be shitty because you end up an old fuck knowing that you went quietly into the night saying "yes, master" to the ass fucking your government overlords are giving you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing that obliterates the consternation and difficulty that you're experiencing is working on analyzing and getting rid of your fear of what might possibly happen to you if you continue to educate yourself and pursue
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't stop pursuing it.  Remain a stealthy, quiet warrior if you don't feel comfortable being boisterous about it.  Educate yourself and learn as much as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chill, live your life as best you can, be as cool a person as you can be to yourself and to others, and - as you keep educating yourself and reading up as much as possible on what exactly is really going on in this dirty, nefarious, fucked up, shitty, dark ass prison planet of a world - be ready to get up and fearlessly fight against TPTB if need be.
      </p>
      <p>
       That' my op anyway.

       Reality as we know it is changing faster and faster (as far as the general public goes). You are not crazy, since early 2000, every year has been a struggle for sanity for me. I started seeing things that connected to other seemingly unrelated issues. Always keep things in perspective, but never let yourself think for a moment that you are crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of thousands of people are in the same boat that you are, rifling though so much info that it is overwhelming. Take everything lightly until you research it yourself. You are not alone, we are all fighting for the truth.

       I don't think you're getting in too deep, but I do think it's importance to find balance in your awareness. Continue to question and analyze, but try to maintain a sense of calm about it.
      </p>

       This is the way things are. It's nice to know truth, but do not let it consume you.

       I personally think (and I'll probably get down votes for this) that you're in too deep. Some things I read on here are just silly and I feel like some of them are created in the hopes of doom or downfall. I mean I get it, people want adventure and what not, but there's a place to separate ideas/fantasy from reality. That's just me though.
