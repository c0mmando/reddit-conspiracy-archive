    <div class="md"><p>The next step in human evolution will not be a physical adaptation to environment. It will be a shift in collective consciousness. The powers that be fear that this next step will be the end of the age of consumerism and currency hoarding. Knowledge of the universe and a higher understanding of your immediate surroundings will increase. People working eight hour days as obedient slaves to debt and consuming things in record numbers year after year will fade. Control by paranoia and fear will fade. Human consciousness at the base level will rise beyond current comprehension. I&#39;m not saying this will happen in our lifetime. Shit, we may not even realize it for a thousand years, but I have a feeling that the Internet was a start. 9/11 being exposed will be another step. The steps of evolution are exponential. We are still on the slowly rising line, but eventually it will build up speed and crush this current level of consciousness. Do we really need to downvote people in this subreddit?  All non-aggressive ideas should be respected here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The endgame is the denial of life. The universe is being stripped of it, as it succumbs to a plague modeled in the vision of the ultimate aryan genetic superiority: the grey alien clones.</p>

<p>We were all unfortunate to have been born in this galaxy, on this planet. Perhaps in another incarnation or something we&#39;ll truly escape the single most substantial flaw to the universe: the grey aliens.</p>

<p>The endgame is the same as the endgame for a virus. A virus kills its host, and it remains there, inert, as a testament to an error.</p>

<p>You must understand: the most efficient model for an invasion is not to concentrate on a single target with an overwhelming force, but to spend the majority of your time traveling and germinating the seeds of destruction to a maximum number of nodes on an infinitely vast chessboard. The universe is vast, so I would imagine that most of their efforts are simply in infecting the maximum number of galaxies in the minimum amount of time, possibly even in a manner that doesn&#39;t arouse too much suspicion from other aliens, who perhaps BLAME us for the fact that we&#39;re human and have a vulnerability to highly intelligent conspiracies.</p>

<p>You could say our <em>planet</em> is being stripped of life, but we don&#39;t even have evidence of life in the rest of the universe.  And alien greys? Sources please.</p>

<p>What this implies is that someone interfered and made a mistake.  They are fixing an error.  What error?</p>

<p>Also, even if all life on the planet were destroyed we have evidence that nature would again, find a way to produce life.  Whether it started up again in 100 years or 100 million years, we have evidence that life would start up once again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What do they have to gain?&quot;
The concept of gain/loss is laughable. The question is: what do they have to lose? They have everything to lose, which is what they gain. They gain by losing because they&#39;re tired of being able to gain so easily. When a culture has limitless technology, they&#39;ll inevitably live alone, in a television video game inception reality, snorting a kind of oxygen cocaine that somehow doesn&#39;t have withdrawal symptoms, engaged in a constant intellectual orgasm, desperately trying to be the last to ever have had the luxury of living that way. All conceivable variables involving life have been completely solved for them. The pursuit of the great error- the ultimate seed of destruction, is all they have left to live for.</p>

<p>&quot;..alien.. sources please.&quot;
We have mathematical evidence for imaginary numbers, but if someone said, &quot;non-real numbers? evidence please.&quot; You&#39;d have a hard time convincing them without first teaching them some inferences to advanced calculus. Simply saying, &quot;root(-1)&quot; could easily be disputed. </p>

<p>Anyways, here&#39;s a link to a youtube video playlist: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6N-CZELzviJ6FxxDa1VoLhpnRREKJu7_&amp;amp;feature=plcp">www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6N-CZELzviJ6FxxDa1VoLhpnRREKJu7_&amp;amp;feature=plcp</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ll find that the scheme in its entirety is simply too brilliant to have been fabricated by mankind. Rest assured, a person will always have to believe that aliens exist in order to completely prove it. It&#39;s just easier to believe when you&#39;ve investigated every clue and inference properly, with a mind that is capable of shame and devoid of attitude.</p>

<p>&quot;.. they are fixing an error. what error?&quot;
The number of dimensions in the universe was proven mathematically in the early 17th century: ~2.718. The universe is a universe because it is an e-verse. This is the nature of the error- things die, and the first person perspective of being capable of dying is mathematically impossible. It is an error that is committed in human weakness, but provoked by a divine conspirator, and ultimately moderated by a single perpetual cyclic inevitability: the birth and eventual slumber of God.</p>

<p>Perhaps the goal is in part to potentially summon the physical incarnation of God himself (because they feel that only God could truly damage them and they desperately want to be capable of experiencing mortality).</p>

<p>&quot;..we have evidence that life would start up once again.&quot;
Perhaps if God himself were summoned, the result would kill everything in all galaxies across all permutations of the time-space continuum.</p>

<p>Also, another (probably better now that I&#39;ve had longer to think about it) answer to this question is that the aliens and conspirators and what not are just a bunch of fucking assholes and their endgame is just to continue suppressing mankind because they&#39;ve already been getting thousands of free underground bases out of it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf7vLXf5bNo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf7vLXf5bNo</a></p>

<p>So.. it&#39;s probably not that epic as I&#39;d probably like to imagine it, but w/e. It still exists (the conspiracy part, but maybe not so much with the stuff about gods and higher powers, though it doesn&#39;t take much to be a higher power than a human), and it&#39;s not like some irrational nonsense that a few people pulled outa their ass. There are MANY different lines of evidence supporting conspiracy theory, and they all tend to be VERY consistent with one another.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever thought that maybe now we are living in this &quot;NWO?&quot;  I mean everyone is scared shitless due to religion, the world ending, and various governments around the world, especially ours (USA).

<p>They can look at all of our online activity no matter what.  If they want to come into your house they can. If they want to lock you up and throw away the key they can. I mean the law says they can&#39;t but if they really want to the patriot act will allow it.  They have people like Alex Jones and all of the doomsday people who predict the end of the world and the inevitable governmental take over set up for us just long enough to keep us fearful of the next thing. They dangle just enough &quot;plausible&quot; evidence and allow a few thought provoking youtube videos to get through to keep the people who aren&#39;t afraid of religion and the various other controlling instruments they have in place I am telling you.

<p>Not sure what you are trying to say here.  Must be a typo. But yes, with UN, NATO, EU etc the World Government/World Bank is already happening. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;Problem&quot; the tyranny is hidden at the moment, they are waiting for the right time (economy collapse, iran war...) to roll it out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think tyranny is as hidden as you think.  While there are indeed a vast number of americans that think everything is hunky dory, most are not stupid and have witnessed the current threat of the government.  I think incidents like Occupy Wallstreet, the Anaheim protests, stories of various people being killed in their own homes trying to protect themselves, and just the all out recent brutality of many police forces have  brought a lot of people into the fold who now realize that our government and the police don&#39;t really give a fuck and have are a threat and have the potential grow even larger.  </p>

<p>And everyone knows if the government wants something from you they will get it.  No matter what.  If they have some laws they have to bypass then so be it.  FBI, CIA, Secret Service, Private Contractors, they don&#39;t operate within our laws and nothing we say or do is private unless we are absolutely sure it is not documented in some way.</p>

<p>The economy collapse, well we will find out at the end of this year when the fiscal cliff thing happens.</p>

<p>The Iran war will not happen.  Or at least not an all out nuclear WWIII type war that everyone is thinking.  </p>

<p>What I think is going on is that like I said, they are letting people like Alex Jones tell their story.  I think they keep him out there for the people who are not afraid of the government.  Who are not afraid of religion.  Who are not afraid to exercise their rights in front of police.  People like him are scaring people into thinking this take over is going to be bigger than it really is and keeping fear alive where it would have otherwise died. If it were really going to be as big as AJ/They say it is then he would be shut down really quick.  All the videos of him saying oh &quot;I am not suicidal, I can drive a car, I don&#39;t plan on having any accidents.&quot;  You think that matters to them?  You become a problem you get thrown away.</p>

<p>Yeah i know but they sure will increase there use.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/poll-35-of-americans-would-wear-electric-shock-bracelet-in-order-to-fly/">Poll 35% would wear shock braclet</a> i am already shocked that 35% would do it. </p>

<p>When they want the people to wear it in a new world order they have no choice.</p>

<p>Sure its somewhat open but what i meant was nazi like open tyranny.</p>

<p>Meaning it gets easier to control many people</p>

<p>Infowars is pretty big site now they can&#39;t kill him, it would underline his information to much like William Cooper. </p>

<p>They only try to discredit him.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t do this today like 10 years ago we have the internet information is spreading to fast. (doesen&#39;t mean they don&#39;t kill other people).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t see a dictatorship rising Nazi style and a whole world take over to that extreme.  While you have been the one to provide, I think the best, examples so far I still just don&#39;t see it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll concede a to the possibility of a world government, even a world bank.  But I just don&#39;t see the extreme wipe out and forceful takeover that everyone seems to think is going to happen.  And again even if it does I don&#39;t think it will last.  That kind of thing never lasts as history has shown us.  </p>

<p>And those 35% of assholes that would wear that bracelet are fucking stupid.  I saw that when you first posted the link and was thinking who the fuck are these people?! I would never travel again if that crazy nonsense was implemented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you mean.</p>

<p>This planned is carried out since generations and they are always trying to accomplish the most without moving to fast and waking people up.</p>

<p>Another thing this will be triggerd by a special event (False Flag Operation, Economy Collapse, Iran maybe etc.) like i said before there will be a mainstream Story that sells the tyranny.</p>

<p>(Look back at Nazi germany Hitler did says the jews are responsible for everything bad, WWII started with a False Flag)</p>

<p>Same could happen this time with &quot;terrorist&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Suspected Terrorist&quot; (Muslims) would get first in the FEMA Camps.</p>

<p>They would maybe even do a Hitler 2.0 and after WWIII they say World goverment is the only solution to stop war.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how exactly they want bring a New World Order obviously but these are real possibilitys.</p>

<p>I would already not fly lol .The options between radiation or sexual abuse aren&#39;t real options.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Space travel is so far the only plausible answer I have been given.  Even then I don&#39;t see why they would have to take over the world or destroy half the population for space travel.  </p>

<p>If it is for slavery/harvesting minerals, my question is why?  With hardly anybody left to rule whats the point?    </p>

<p>And I can&#39;t really argue with that.  That goes without saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The next step in human evolution will not be a physical adaptation to environment. It will be a shift in collective consciousness. The powers that be fear that this next step will be the end of the age of consumerism and currency hoarding. Knowledge of the universe and a higher understanding of your immediate surroundings will increase. People working eight hour days as obedient slaves to debt and consuming things in record numbers year after year will fade. Control by paranoia and fear will fade. Human consciousness at the base level will rise beyond current comprehension. I&#39;m not saying this will happen in our lifetime. Shit, we may not even realize it for a thousand years, but I have a feeling that the Internet was a start. 9/11 being exposed will be another step. The steps of evolution are exponential. We are still on the slowly rising line, but eventually it will build up speed and crush this current level of consciousness. Do we really need to downvote people in this subreddit?  All non-aggressive ideas should be respected here. </p>
