    <div class="md"><p>thanks for asking.   if there&#39;s a conspiracy involving israel fine, but it seems obvious that there is an anti-israel campaign here that has nothing to do with conspiracy.  It is detracting from all the interesting and relevant conspiracies.</p>

<p>some think it&#39;s an effort to make the subredditl look bad, but I really think there are white supremist and anti-semites with an agenda here.  they are being successful and it seems that mods could be more vigilant in deciding which posts are worldnews and not conspiracy worthy... really an infographic about the loss of palestinian land is a conspiracy?  #1?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moderation philosophy here is to encourage the users themselves to get rid of the crap by downvoting the short, spitefully sarcastic comments from trolls/shills while also providing sources when possible and fostering genuine debate in all comments. If users here are diligent in posting comments that are well written and encourage debate, than those shills who post bogus/spiteful content will become more obvious and can be dealt with accordingly.</p>

<p>We routinely ban users who <strong>consistently</strong> post comments that are derogatory of the sub itself and the users there-in. Users who post spiteful comments which slide/derail genuine conversations or contain belligerently hateful language are regularly banned. Please feel free to report any user that you feel is being disrespectful or using language that hinders authentic debate/discussions.</p>

<p>In terms of the specifics that you mentioned at first, the conspiracy to protect the image of Israel is very relevant to this sub; likewise, the overlooked oppression of certain groups of people is very real and noticeably conspiratorial. If the sub is getting flooded with zionist-apologists because of the newsworthy topics being posted here, then vehemently oppose their claims with respectful, well-sourced documentation and logical arguments. If the truth is threatening to their world-view, than they will resort to violent language, which makes the voting-job of all the users, and the potential banning of users much easier. Wouldn&#39;t you agree? </p>

<p>There are several users who participate on this sub who certainly consider themselves to be &quot;conspiracy debunkers&quot;... What would happened if we banned all those users who ask for sources for example, or who attempt to debate the posted content? The role of the conspiracy debunker is actually pretty important to this subreddit. After-all, aren&#39;t we attempting to get at the truth of whatever topic is of discussion? Discussions need to take place, and as I mentioned above, users here should be able to defend what they believe to be true, using cogent sources and respectful, logical argumentation to respond to the claims/questions of the debunker. This strengthens the knowledge, and research abilities of the users of this sub...</p>

<p>We take a very hard stance with crossposts to conspiratard, and I&#39;ve been personally messaging users that I see post the short spitefully sarcastic comments. I tell them to authentically debate with genuine questions and sources or they will be banned. If I see users continue on, I will ban them. </p>

<p><strong>In short, I think the users of the sub itself needs to call out users who conduct themselves in a disrespectful manor, report them when necessary, and authentically debate users with sound sources and logical reasoning.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Does this not apply to the well known anti-semites that post here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it does. I do message the users of such posts as I see them. I would encourage anyone else to message them as well; not in a confrontational way, but simply reminding them that the sidebar asks that everyone be respectful, and post content to encourage debate, not to offend...</p>

<p>With regard to your comment about racism, the moderators here must be cognizant of this subtle gray area within the topic of zionism or jewish zionism that many users dance around. There are conspiracy theories related to jewish influence, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware. We try to be an open forum for any conspiracy topic, but admittedly, such conspiracy theories skirt around what could be seen by some as racism. In short, we take a hard stance against hate speech, removing a lot of material, but we allow somewhat offensive content because the controversial nature of the specific topic of &quot;jewish/zionist conspiracy&quot; is difficult to discuss without sounding racist to some. However, certain slang words are not acceptable here, and we do encourage other users to help the mods by reporting offensive content so that we can reprimand when applicable. We simply have to look at it on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the overall participation of specific users, how long they have been active in the sub, and what exactly is said with what frequency... We try not to ban many users in general unless they are belligerently hateful, confrontational, and generally troll or try to anger people. Many users that you are concerned about are not direct to other users, so we hope that others here use the power of their vote and report ability to help with the vast majority of problems. </p>

<p>This very topic is something that is extremely difficult to manage from our end. We have users who participate regularly, who have been here since this sub&#39;s creation, who subscribe to the jewish conspiracy. I make it a point to message users about their comments if it is confrontational. I can honestly tell you that we vehemently oppose racist-hate speech, but we will not ban users for just being controversial or offensive. Again, we remove comments as they come in and regularly message/confront users who skate on that fine line.</p>

<p>As of recently, I have personally made an effort to foster an environment of authentic debate, limiting ad hominem, strawmen, and offensive language as much as possible. I want an environment of authentic debate here; so yes, I have tried to message and call out users who post content that is disrespectful, regardless of the content/opinion. A banning crusade will not stop the &quot;racism&quot; on this sub due to the very nature of conspiracy theories and the interrelation of zionist conspiracy with many other topics in this community. However, I&#39;ve got to stand up for the vast majority of users here...most participants here stray away from the use of the &quot;jewish&quot; qualifier, discussing at length the political philosophy of zionism and its interdisciplinary relation to many other topics of discussion. I would say that very few users here even post what you would consider to be &quot;racist&quot; content, so I think you may be inflating the problem to some extent. Regardless, participate in a way that is respectful. Challenge users who offend you, and report when necessary. Cheers.</p>
