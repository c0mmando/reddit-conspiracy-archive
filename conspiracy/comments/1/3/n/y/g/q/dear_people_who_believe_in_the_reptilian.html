        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>i want to understand this theory and allow a believer to convince me it&#39;s real while i play devils advocate until either i believe or i can&#39;t be convinced. i know very little about it and i refuse to call bullshit until i&#39;ve heard the evidence for a theory. i am agnostic and always allow any missionaries a chance to pitch me their religion while i attempt to &quot;peer review&quot; their theory. this also goes for conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>i am always willing to believe anything if you can prove your case. with that said here is the etiquette for what i will follow:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>it will be private: as in all done within PM, if i share it i will remove any identifiable info, and that&#39;s only if you allow me to share it.</p></li>
<li><p>i will be open minded. as in i am convinceable, unlike almost all debates.</p></li>
<li><p>i will challenge your evidence if it doesn&#39;t hold up. so i will hope you will also be open minded and convinceable if i can explain how/why your evidence doesn&#39;t hold weight (if your evidence doesn&#39;t hold up) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>please just PM me with your opening argument and we will begin. anyone else feel free to comment with your ideas or whatever you find relevant. </p>

<p>i honestly want a real discussion that isn&#39;t bias with pre-judgement (at least on the so called &quot;against&quot; side)</p>

<p>so any believers PM me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever tried &quot;proving&quot; climate change to people who don&#39;t believe it?</p>

<p>Have you ever tried &quot;proving&quot; that Fox News lies to someone who can&#39;t stand hearing that?</p>

<p>Anyways, as a conspiracy theorist, here&#39;s my main focus for my political arguments: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6N-CZELzviJ6FxxDa1VoLhpnRREKJu7_&amp;amp;feature=view_all">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6N-CZELzviJ6FxxDa1VoLhpnRREKJu7_&amp;amp;feature=view_all</a></p>

<p>An extended interview with John Perkins, and the historical research documentary by Bill Still (The Money Masters). These 2 lines of evidence are supported by many others, and are very consistent amongst each other. There&#39;s also of course many other stories that are all consistent, that deal with suppressed free energy science.</p>

<p>Basically, for a person not to believe in conspiracy theory, they have to be very ignorant of history, especially the economic history of Earth.</p>

<p>When people make &quot;arguments&quot; and &quot;debate&quot; something, it&#39;s like giving them free reign to just inject whatever &quot;truth&quot; they want and just act like it&#39;s not opinion. This really isn&#39;t a productive way to reach out to people. People will always just believe whatever they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was told quite a while back that David Icke (I believe he&#39;s the most well known &#39;reptile alien&#39; theorist out there) does not necessarily believe they are actually reptilians, but in fact is using it as an allegory for the separate existences that the true elite (the .001%) live and that he&#39;s able to speak openly and freely about it without allowing for people to accuse him of racism or anti-semitism. </p>

<p>However if you want to talk about the people who believe in reptilians then I&#39;m also happy to listen, but unless there&#39;s even a shred of evidence to it, or even a realistic working theory I&#39;m going to wait this one out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, I love Jesse Ventura. He&#39;s gets so passionate about his politics and and when he hosts his show he definitely draws back to his wrestling career. I love impersonating him, he&#39;s got one of those instantly identifiable voices, &quot;whoa whoa whoa, you&#39;re telling me that these people are after me? Impossible. I&#39;ve been a Navy Seal, Governor of Minnesota FOR 4 years, I&#39;m here to crack down on these ____ crooks.&quot; </p>

<p>But that Reptilian bullshit is nothing but a pit of lies. The only way I will ever believe that these creatures exist is if I see one myself, and I&#39;m sorry, but these eye &quot;shifting&quot; videos are nothing but lighting capturing shapes of the eye at different angles. </p>

<p>Also, there is absolutely NO scientific evidence of Reptilians ever existing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story goes that lizard people came here from the Draco star system for the main purpose of colonization and the mining of gold. Apparently they live underground. The story has some of them being able to shape shift into human form by drinking human blood and eating various body parts. Some stories have the greys working for them. Some stories have the elites of the world making deals with them for power. I fucking love conspiracy theories, but this one is pure bullshit.</p>

<p>Edit: I should clarify that most conspiracy theories are bullshit, but this one is far to outlandish to be taken seriously. It&#39;s a good story though. Look into the Dulce base for more info on the lizards. Apparently some security officers from Dulce have said that on the lower levels of the base the lizards run shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard anyone say that the lizard people were not physical beings. Now getting into spirituality and people being controlled by use of the reptilian brain that all mammals are born with is an issue I&#39;ve never heard discussed in conspiracy circles. We are all physical beings, so it makes sense that we bring thoughts and ideas down to the physical realm. As an aside, I do believe in Heaven and Hell, but my beliefs are far from mainstream Christianity which I believe to be apostate. However, to each their own. Have a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the whole reptilian/mammalian brain thing is a useless distinction, since the &quot;reptilian brain&quot; portions are actually quite small in reptiles, and the behaviors attributed to the &quot;reptilian brain&quot; do not actually typify the behavior of reptiles, and the structures and behaviors of the mammalian and neomammalian parts of the brain exist in reptiles, too. It&#39;s just a useless distinction that tries to make evolutionary history into determinism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to sociobiologist Steven Pinker: &quot;In all societies people have a wariness of snakes; one sees it even in laboratory-raised monkeys who had never seen a snake. We know from herpetology that snakes were prevalent in Africa during the time of our evolution, and that getting bitten by a snake is not good for you because of the chemistry of snake venom. Crucially, that itself is not a fact of psychology, but it helps to establish that what is a fact of psychology, namely the fear of snakes, is a plausible adaptation.&quot;</p>

<p>The triune brain model popularized by Carl Sagan&#39;s &quot;Dragons of Eden&quot; proposes that mammalian brains have evolved in 3 complexes, starting with the Basals Ganglia (Reptillian Brain or R-Complex) and adding the Paleomamallian and Neomamallian.</p>

<p>Whereas the neocortex (the newest evolutionary addition to the human brain) is what we utilize for; language, abstraction, planning, and perception, the &quot;reptillian brain&quot; which directed the existence of our premamallian relatives, informs more basic instinctual behaviors such as; aggression, dominance, territoriality, and <strong>ritual displays</strong>.</p>

<p>There is an idea in our culture, that psychopaths are able to be powerful in a way that people more empathetic to others don&#39;t have.  Psychopaths are able to exhibit a honeybadger attitude and potentially worry less about reprecussions that others might consider.  The Reptillian part of the brain in psychopaths is likely more dominant, than other more socially developed parts- <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Psychopath-Makeover/135160/">Here&#39;s an interesting article on psychopaths and an electromagnet which can be used to inhibit emotional sensors associated with the frontal cortex.</a>.</p>

<p>Back to RITUAL.  Rituals have traditionally been used for socially programming (brainwashing) ourselves and others.  Essentially, the focus of the ritual stimulates a certain part of the brain- projecting purpose without thought.  Even a symbol is a form of ritual, meant to tie an idea to an association in our minds.  Think about the types of rituals that the military would use.  What part of the brain would be most applicable to soldiers?   Rituals which focus on the reptillian brain, enforces the behaviors managed by those ancient instincts.</p>

<p>The dragon/snake symbol has been used as a symbol of power and authority for centuries.  Many royal families have incorporated it in their crests.  While brain science was clearly not understood the same way a thousand years ago as it is today, the occult still had a very developed understanding of psychology. </p>

<p>So powerful families who have been very good at maintaining power have likely used ritual to enhance and project sociopathic thinking.  They have also used inbreeding and interbreeding to maintain and create genes which which might benefit their rule.  Intelligence and sociopathy also have genetic components and these bloodlines  have done what they can to proliferate these traits.  And we all know that these bloodlines have kept it in the family for centuries, intermarrying with royal and banking geneologies.

<p>David Icke threw the idea of shapeshifting onto this understanding to distinguish his brand.  Otherwise, he is pushing the same NWO conspiracy theory as everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not going to PM you as that would corral the discussion and i&#39;d like to hear other peoples views too - but from a starting point:</p>

<p>1: Lots of things in life don&#39;t make sense, there are lots of things people believe but have no evidence to really back their notions up with - so why not Lizard People?</p>

<p>2: The phrase itself might not in all cases be taken to mean that there are people walking around who are actually Lizard People, but refer to a name given to a particular type of behaviour.</p>

<p>3: Demonising certain groups for no real good reason is also nothing new. If all the super rich people in the world are labelled &#39;lizard people&#39;, that could just be a construct of the not so rich to demean that group.</p>

<p>4: Lots of groups have been given &#39;funny&#39; names which they use amongst themselves in private and might find it embarrassing to be referred to as a &#39;Lizard Man&#39; or &#39;master&#39; in a wider public audience. They might have associations or received merit for public things that are more relevant.</p>

<p>5: It&#39;s not really anyone&#39;s business who is or isn&#39;t a &#39;Lizard Person&#39; whatever we take that label to mean imho as it has little impact on most peoples general life, and there is little anyone would want or be able to do about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i think #1 is actually a good enough excuse. There are lots of things people believe in that cannot be proven - are you saying there are articles (in the sense of evidence) that could be comparable to the &#39;turin shroud&#39; and things like it that have been used to &#39;prove&#39; the existence of something to a particular audience?</p>

<p>Would a picture or DNA of a &#39;Lizard Person&#39; become a modern day turin shroud in 100 years or so?</p>

<p>2: Yes, that is one definition - if I told my Grandma that i thought our leader was a &#39;Lizard Man&#39; or a &#39;Lizard&#39; then she would presume i was referring to some aspect of their behaviour - the phrase has different connations - maybe that is just by design.</p>

<p>What is so bad if in fact they are actually &#39;Lizard people&#39; brought about in the way you suggest anyway?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done a bit of research into this , seen Icke talk and read a couple if his books and honestly besides some ancient accounts, a few first hand stories and some weird photos, there&#39;s not much scientific proof behind this. </p>

<p>A lot of these theories attempt to account for some evil on this earth I think reptilians is one of those things that unless you&#39;ve seen it first hand, it would be very difficult to prove without the anecdotal evidence he&#39;s looking for. </p>

<p>No one can prove it, you&#39;d have to experience it yourself.  Not saying you can, or that one exists, but if you depend on other people to determine your worldview, you will be blind.  </p>

<p>There are some things science can&#39;t prove because those things are dependant on experience.  For example, if an angel/God/etc visited you last night, you&#39;d never be able to prove it scientifically, since, for starters, it is a non-repeatable phenomena.  Just like no one could prove they had a dream about hobbits two days ago.  And if some dude pulled off his mask and showed you his lizard face in the bathroom, you&#39;d still have no proof for anyone, even though to you it would be undeniably proven.  </p>

<p>PS. I dont believe in &quot;God&quot; or &quot;lizard people&quot;, just rambling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since we&#39;ve evolved from reptiles and have reptilian base in our brains, there is a confusion to identify those who live closer to their reptilian mind as reptilians.  Those humans who have snuffed out empathy psychedelics and other positive mammalian traits in their pursuit of conformity power and wealth are left with a cold, calculating, consumptive logic.  A &#39;reptilian&#39; logic.</p>

<p>So it is a natural for haywired reactives to point to modern elites and label them reptilian.  The analogy holds up, in a strange sort of way, but the lack of ability to recognize it manifests as &quot;OMG LIZARD PPL&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When all is said and done, I&#39;d be less surprised if it were one day revealed as fact that alien reptiles were ruling the world or something equally as crazy, than I would if the bible were actually true. </p>

<p>Maybe the earth is really being run by aliens who thrive in a hot, radioactive and polluted atmosphere - and we&#39;re just being terraformed. If I were writing a science fiction book about alien takeover, thats how I&#39;d do it. I wouldnt bring big ships over and blow the fuck out of the indigenous population, and then terraform. I&#39;d get the indigenous population to terraform the planet for me before I moved in. They would simultaneously do both the hard work of the terraforming and killing themselves off for me.</p>

<p>At least that would make our current geopolitical course make sense. The alternative explanation is that we are a race with zero regard for the future consequences of our actions. Which is a lot more probable than aliens, and a lot fucking scarier too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if people think they&#39;re really reptiles or not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the model of &quot;reality&quot; that a given person believes. That doesn&#39;t make it &quot;reality.&quot;</p>

<p>If you try to think about it in terms of what&#39;s really real you&#39;ll drive yourself nuts.</p>

<p>Just accept that some people believe strange shit. Which is pokay, because you believe strange shit too. So A.) no one&#39;s better than anyone else in that regard and B.) we all get to look at each other&#39;s bullshit and hopefully learn something new about the world.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the reptilian thing works on a symbolic level.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/Hon3AzMO6vs">http://youtu.be/Hon3AzMO6vs</a></p>

<p>Psychopaths have a high functioning reptilian brain and a low functioning prefrontal cortex. If you think about things in these terms then the reptilians are simply psychopaths. Which is a real phenomenon. Not that this is okay - they should be arrested like the common criminals they are. The trick is that we&#39;ve lionized the psychopaths so that now they&#39;re regarded as semi-god-like; which is funny for a mutitude of reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so I know I am late on this one, but here is my thought.  I think you want to believe that reptilians exist and maybe in fact actually do, but are looking for confirmation of your views.  There is nothing wrong with this, people do it all the time, but I think you&#39;re going about it backwards.  Most people that research conspiracies want to believe in them.  You generally aren&#39;t going to waste your time researching something that you know is untrue.  The best way to approach a conspiracy is to assume that the conspiracy is in fact true and then let the data you find disprove it.</p>

<p>So, research it from the viewpoint that it true.  Read the data, watch the videos.  Does the data support it being true?  If not, it&#39;s not real.  If you read the data and still believe it, then you believe in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as far as reptilians go in Ufology, in the abduction phenomenon they are described as the beings that are present in some abductions, however they do not appear very often in abductee testimony where most abductees describe their captors as &quot;greys&quot; or variants thereof, the reptiles are usually also relegated to servants of another race or similar. as far as where they are from, ufology doesnt really have that much of an opinion, it seems to me that the &quot;&quot;Reptile&quot;&quot; aliens are more popular with NWO and new age conspiracy theorists like david icke. the starchild skull has been suggested as reptile but then again it could easily be some other beings skull as it could be a human abnormality.
all in all i have not seen any compulsive evidence to suggest reptilians are anything other then hysteria misunderstandings or some such. at least in the abduction phenomenon the sketches of greys from hypnosis and abductee memory are fairly uniform.</p>
