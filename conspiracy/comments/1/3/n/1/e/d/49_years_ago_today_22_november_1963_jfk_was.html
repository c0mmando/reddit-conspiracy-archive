    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s more. </p>

<p>The British government and the Zionist leaders struck a dirty deal. The Zionists were led by Chaim Weizmann, the man who one day become the first President of the State of Israel. The idea was for the Zionists to use their influence to drag the mighty USA into the war on Britain&#39;s side, so that Germany and it&#39;s Ottoman allies could be crushed. In exchange for helping to bring the USA into the war, the British would reward the Zionists by taking over Palestine from the conquered Ottomans after the war was over. The British had originally wanted to give the Zionists a jewish homeland in an African territory. But the Zionists were fixated on claiming Palestine as their land. Once under British control, the jews of Europe would be allowed to immigrate to Palestine in great numbers. </p>

<p>Zionists powerbrokers such as Bernard Baruch, Louis Brandeis, Paul Warburg (father of the US Federal Reserve), Jacob Schiff (financier of the Bolshevik Revolution), and others immediately went to work to put the screws to President Woodrow Wilson. Overnight the Zionist influenced press transformed the German Kaiser and his people into bloodthirsty âHunsâ, determined to destroy western civilization. In 1916, the US, with the help of the previous yearâs Lusitania âincidentâ, entered the war on Britain&#39;s side under the ridiculous pretext of âmaking the world safe for democracyâ. </p>

<p>âBeat Back the Hun!â declared Fred Strothmanâs famous propaganda poster, - a slogan which became a rallying cry of âpatrioticâ Americans. Woodrow Wilson was caught up in a sinister force beyond his control - a force which he himself described years earlier in his 1913 book âThe New Freedomâ, in which Wilson wrote these intriguing words:</p>

<p>&quot;Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men&#39;s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the U. S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  I didn&#39;t know about the &quot;Beat Back the Hun!&quot; propaganda to make Germany out to be the scourge of civilization.  I found this <a href="http://historygallery.com/worldwar1/BeatBackTheHun.htm">propaganda poster</a> with a quick google search.  That whole era of patriotic bond buying was really something.  Its funny in recent decades the people didn&#39;t need to even be coaxed into buying the bonds since the whole monetary system fell into place and people would rush to buy them upon any sort of instability.  I&#39;m starting to see a little more clearly how it evolved.</p>

<p>In the 1920s and 30s, Baruch expressed his concern that the United States needed to be prepared for the possibility of another world war. He wanted a more powerful version of the War Industries Board, which he saw as the only way to ensure maximum coordination between civilian business and military needs.</p>

<p>Since the Federal Reserve Act was not proposed until 1913, that&#39;s quite a trick. In fact, in April, 1912, it was far from obvious that Woodrow Wilson would be the Democratic candidate. The leading candidate was Champ Clark, who had voted against the investigation of the &quot;Money Trust&quot; and was seen as unlikely to support monetary reform.</p>

<p>So, is there any evidence that anybody aboard the Titanic was a &quot;top opponent&quot; of either bill? Not that I&#39;ve ever seen. As far as I can tell, it is just another hoax.</p>

What is causing what I&#39;m not sure about.  Its obvious to me that the people running shit have a play book with maneuvers that occur on a timeline that exceeds the amount of productive years of the common people.  These elites are bonded together by knowledge, world view and financial agreements.  I have studied astrology to understand the elites who are directing human life and not because I am trying to find out the secrets of the universe - although it is possible that there is something there.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Jews built a giant multi-million dollar ship, filled it with the brave freedom fighters against the Federal Reserve, sailed it precisely 50 years after Lincoln was shot, somehow faked hitting an iceberg, made sure none of the people they wanted killed got on the lifeboats, paid off all the survivors to cover up their crimes and kept it quiet for 100 years.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the Jews built a giant multi-million dollar ship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ship was built by a company that JP Morgan owned.  If that is Jews to you then so be it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>filled it with the brave freedom fighters against the Federal Reserve</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Astor was on board and died.  JP Morgan himself was to be on board but was suddenly too ill.  He died something like 6 months later in Rome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>somehow faked hitting an iceberg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody has ever said that they faked hitting the iceberg.  The impact to the ship was so fatal because it swiped the side of the ship on the same side that the previous permanently hull bending accident occurred.  This accident occurred when the &quot;Titanic&quot; was known as its original name the &quot;Olympic&quot;.  These two sister ships were nearly identical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>made sure none of the people they wanted killed got on the lifeboats</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its difficult to say if the insurance scam of disposing of the Olympic (switched with the Titanic) was the only objective there or if killing Astor was part of the plan as well.  At any rate it worked out very nice for JP Morgan, who among other infamy shut down Tesla and is known as a top level gangster of his day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>paid off all the survivors to cover up their crimes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They only kept it out of the mainstream.  Until the Internet and streaming video this would story was limited to only a handful of nerdy historian types.  Perhaps you miss the old news reels when everything was innocent?</p>

<p>The &quot;Titanic&quot; was swapped with the sister ship the &quot;Olympic,&quot; that had been involved in two serious hull warping accidents .. to collect on insurance and to prevent bankruptcy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a new one .. I have been suspicious the event never receded into history, like other major shipping disasters and natural catastrophes, but kept popping up in even the most unexpected places, witness the claim most of the survivors were Jews.</p>

<p>That one well known New York dowager described fending swimmers away with a boat hook, that Jews pushed and shoved others to get into the life boats, that the Cunard Liner Carpathia was within a short distance of the stricken vessel..</p>

<p>That those aboard got their rocks off watching the drama, the same way <a href="http://m.wsj.net/video/20090106/010509sivanisrael1/010509sivanisrael1_512x288.jpg">Jews set up deck chairs to watch the bombardment of Gaza,</a> and <a href="http://s019.radikal.ru/i624/1209/f3/d5f365a72a09.jpg">Andy Warhol</a> got his off watching the murder of President Kennedy, standing with shooters on the Grassy Knoll!</p>

<p>While the Captain of the Carpathia refused to render assistance, like Jew NYPD helicopter pilots refused to attempt helicopter landings, to save those trapped in the upper levels of the WTC Towers on 911. <a href="http://www.stumbleinn.net/forum/showthread.php?p=311546#post311546">The Most Shameful Act on a Day of Shame!</a></p>
