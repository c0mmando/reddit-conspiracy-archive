They asked me what they should do now. I told them to start waking people up, even if they think they are crazy. I feel proud of myself, because they want to protest and do something to stop all of this, they now want to try and wake other people up. </p>

<p>Convenient how disagreeing with you makes me brainwashed. Not that I&#39;m from the US and therefore not subject to the what the  media or government or whatever  bogeyman you&#39;ve decided does the brainwashing say.</p>

<p>Not in their current form, no. Not that that&#39;s relevant, because the ones you have and do avail of were paid for by income tax.</p>

<p>Firstly, the report is 28 years old and doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect efficiency today. Inefficiency is bad, but it doesn&#39;t justify not contributing to the society from which you benefit.</p>

<p>You can continue to keep feeding the illusion, but i won&#39;t.  I&#39;m done paying &quot;my fair share&quot;, to stop you statist fucking morons from stealing my labor to go murder people and build a fucking police state.  </p>

<p>Further, Timothy Geithner recently said that the government debt was irrelevant.  If that&#39;s the case, why would anyone pay taxes since the Treasury Secretary has taken the position that the government can continue to fund it&#39;s operations indefinitely by printing up money to cover it&#39;s expenses?  Oh, but that will cause hyperinflation and destroy the currency?  You think that&#39;s not inevitable anyway?  </p>

<p>Judging by your post, i&#39;m sure you&#39;ve never overcome your brainwashing. </p>

<p>Convenient how disagreeing with you makes me brainwashed. Not that I&#39;m from the US and therefore not subject to the what the  media or government or whatever  bogeyman you&#39;ve decided does the brainwashing say.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did railroads, hospitals, libraries, electricity, telecommunications infrastructure, and most of all ROOOAAADDDS (in a statist zombie voice) exist prior to the income tax? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not in their current form, no. Not that that&#39;s relevant, because the ones you have and do avail of were paid for by income tax.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BTW...you might want to also look at the Grace Commission report of 1984 which studied what happened with the collected income tax. &quot;</p>

<p>The first 2/3 of the income tax is either wasted or lost. Of the remaining 1/3, every dime of IRS income tax goes to private lenders for interest only on the exponentially escalating national debt.&quot; <a href="http://www.uhuh.com/taxstuff/list-gra.htm">http://www.uhuh.com/taxstuff/list-gra.htm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, the report is 28 years old and doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect efficiency today. Inefficiency is bad, but it doesn&#39;t justify not contributing to the society from which you benefit.</p>
