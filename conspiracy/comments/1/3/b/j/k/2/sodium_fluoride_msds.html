    <div class="md"><p>A majority of toothpastes on the market contain about 0.15% fluoride ion, which comes out to 1500 ppm (parts per million.)</p>

<p>In 1.5 ml of toothpaste (the large stripe pictured above) you would find 2.25 mg of fluoride.</p>

<p>In a pea sized amount of toothpaste, you would only find 0.3 mg of fluoride.</p>

<p>How Much Fluoride is in Fluoridated Water?
Most fluoridated water contains about 1.0 ppm.  That means that in 1 liter of water, you would find about 1 mg of fluoride.</p>

<p>Most people who read this thread will ignore these numbers and ignore the body&#39;s excretory processes.  Thank you, however, for being the voice of reason in this thread.</p>

<p>Their is no safe dosage in terms of medicating drinking water. You&#39;re right. It&#39;s a scam. Some people drink more water than others, most people can&#39;t afford the appropriate filters and the majority of people are too stupid or hard up or both to avoid drinking tap water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are, go find any shredded cheese, store bought in bag, look at ingredients Silicon Dioxide. They use it in many products as a method of preventing caking.</p>

<p>Quick list off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Better Made Chips (Flavored varieties, Sweet BBQ, Salt+Vin, and one more; if i remember correct)</p></li>
<li><p>GFS Brand Cheese, etc</p></li>
<li><p>Some Pills and Supliments</p></li>
<li><p>Food from dollar stores(prone to caking, chips, cheese, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Many Other products that i cannot name or remember</p></li>
<li><p>A&amp;W onion rings</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My sources are myself.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked in the food industry for a long time, in restaurants since I was 15, combined 10 years of restaurant work experience, one and a half of which is Restaurant Management.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked in and around food enough to pick up the habit of inspecting ingredients of products I&#39;m employed to produce meals with. Over the years I&#39;ve seen and learned a lot about food, restaurants and the nature of business, slowly it&#39;s driving me to my true destiny; the specifics of which i&#39;m unsure, but i do know I&#39;ll be growing plants/food, selling the produce, as well as cooking it and feeding people via some sort of Organic healthy themed restaurant.</p>

<p>To sum up, i&#39;ve slowly learned my mission is to make food healthy; I want to relearn and reinvent ways to produce healthy meals, fast food or dine in, that taste just as good as comfort/snack/junk/sugary/processed foods we all know and love. I believe the best way to do that is thru a organic restaurant setup, and then to slowly work on pulling back from just organic to healthy, cost effective, and competitive alternatives to current food production trends and standards.</p>

<p>EDIT:
YEAH, that&#39;s right I know you don&#39;t like it or me but I want people to learn something from reading and asking questions.
I have no reason to lie and nothing to gain, READ THE FINE PRINT ON EVERYTHING!</p>

<p>You will learn things.</p>

<p>Also i&#39;m already gonna downvote myself so you jerks <strong><em>(the individual, and those alike, who originally down-voted me)</em></strong> who roam <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> now <strong><em>, and don&#39;t discus why they down voted your post,</em></strong> are going to anyways.</p>

<p>EDIT EDIT:
I&#39;ve been humbled by the jerkoff below me and learned to provide better context before insulting some fuck(and/or computer/fake account/shill/etc) on the internet; but i&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what the Gentleman-fag below me is, merely the people I explain in the comment i made in reply to the Sir bellow me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, now I may look crazy, but i was downvoted when i first posted it, then i went to repost the comment above this one into rednails post, but it was slightly reworded.</p>

<p>But when i went to do that I noticed that the original post was back to not having other downvotes other than my own since i downvoted it after i noticed it going negative. So then i just quickly edited the original, reupvoted it and deleted the post i made under the rednail.</p>

<p>When i went to sleep i had one upvote, mine, now the downvote is likely yours or someone else who feels like they were called a jerk.</p>

<p>EDIT: I didn&#39;t read your full post, I understand it was only in response to mine(i.e. to say in reaction to mine), which was vastly misunderstood as I explained above. So in reality, maybe you could have refrained from calling me a dickhead, it sorta taints the point that it&#39;s I who needs to learn to be less a jerk.</p>

<p>My only reason in posting was to spread some real-world knowledge that I&#39;ve picked up in my journeys, but alas I rambled about my personal destiny on the internet, got down-voted a bunch, reacted cause I felt I was being downvote brigade-ed and have now made an ass of myself. Wohhh-Hooo!</p>

<p>My friend, I never made any indication that my beliefs are contradictory of yours so all of the topics in your comment seem random an a touch irrelevant. I never said I supported: Municipalities taking checks from mining operations, removing personal choices, and/or anything else.</p>

<p>That said, I have absolutely no idea what point you are trying to convey in your response, you are all over the map and it appears as though you did not even touch upon the subject matter.</p>

<p>yeah yeah i&#39;m whinging, but the way you comment with myself and rednail allude that you like to <del>aruge</del>, I mean, debate on the internet. Rather than throwing your mind in the melting pot that is collective, web, conscious experience.</p>

<p>To say any more complexly would be hurtful, bro you are wound up, far, too tightly like Rednail said. It doesn&#39;t need any thought to it, nor a mastery, nay even a grasp, of rhetoric to understand your vibes my friend. They are a completely separate facet of human experience/life, it&#39;s more about feels and gooy things, the abstract in nature, as apposed to logic and defined pokey things that are angular in nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good link.  There are other common flouride compounds that should be investigated too.  Some of them are by-products from fertilizer production that are commonly added to water and are even more dangerous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hexafluorosilicic acid releases hydrogen fluoride when evaporated, so it has similar risks. It is corrosive and may cause fluoride poisoning; inhalation of the vapors may cause lung edema. Like hydrogen fluoride, it attacks glass and stoneware.[7] LD50 value of hexafluorosilicic acid is 70 mg/kg (example LD50 for caffeine is 127 mg/kg).[8][9]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously guys, this IS a conspiracy but for the wrong reasons. </p>

<p>Tap water has typically less fluoride and bacterial levels than bottled water. <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/h2owaste/bottled_water.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>The government, which all you Americans fear and despise, actually tries really hard to do good, one of which is to regulate bacteria and fluoride levels in water. </p>

<p>Obviously because of you conspiracy nuts, that and corporation lobbyists, bottled water companies do not maintain as rigid a standard than ordinary tap water. In fact, all they do is collect water in some stream, bottle it up and sell it to you. The only reason it is that clean is that the stream water is collected at a high altitude where contaminants have not reached it yet. </p>

<p>The REAL conspiracy is why there is a conspiracy about fluoride water levels in tap water, when most bottled water contain more. In fact, if people refuse to drink tap water, who would benefit? Hmmm. </p>

<p>Corporations have been duping you and you sheeple still refuse to notice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>fluoride again? Fluoride is almost harmless(don&#39;t bury me yet!) as long as you&#39;re getting enough iodine/iodide. Just look at the periodic table:
<a href="http://www.bpc.edu/mathscience/chemistry/images/periodic_table_of_elements.jpg">http://www.bpc.edu/mathscience/chemistry/images/periodic_table_of_elements.jpg</a></p>

<p>Fluorine(9)... reading downwards: Chlorine(17), Bromine(35), <strong>Iodine(53)</strong>.... What does that mean? That means that Iodine is able to displace(remove) all those lighter halogens such as fluoride.
The real conspiracy here is when they started taking out Iodine out of food and replacing it with toxins like Bromine.</p>
