        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Figured this out just a few minutes ago, and by golly it&#39;s a pretty good conspiracy theory so here it is. For the sake of adding some necessary comedic relief I tried to make it fit together with other common themes in order to &quot;paint a picture&quot; and &quot;build suspense&quot;, if you will. It will also bring noobs up to speed.</p>

<p>Firstly, as we all know, in the upper ranks Republican = Democrat. They purposefully argue about inane trivia and pick a side to divide the country while they push the &quot;real&quot; issues forward with support from both sides (foreign policy, monetary policy, authoritarianism, etc). No one notices that Obama is Bush 2.0 because their personalities and how they speak are so different that the uninformed carries their personality over to their character. On a side note, Bush was purposefully so bad that Obama could sweep in and do whatever the fuck he wanted and no one would care. Don&#39;t believe me? Just look around. Desensitization and the classic Hegelian Dialectic with Obama being the solution to Bush&#39;s problem.</p>

<p>Secondly, Reddit has (recently?) shown up on TPTB&#39;s (the powers that be) radar, and they&#39;re using it as an effective tool to control the &quot;informed&quot; masses as they migrate from TV to the internet. The upvote system really makes it special, because if one post has way more upvotes than downvotes you automatically think that hive-mind has found a common &quot;truth&quot; and you are more susceptible to accepting it blindly. And as we all know, &quot;it really is that easy&quot; to make an account.</p>

<p>Thirdly, they have a dark sense of humor. Very dark. They &quot;won&quot; by making people think that the puppet show was really a &quot;presidential race&quot;. The closeness of the race, achieved with phony polls and voting machines (Romney changed votes to obama to lose on purpose. his campaign was so terrible it&#39;s obvious he was making himself look bad, but hey, Obama bombed his first debate to make it close as well) discouraged people from voting third party and show the growth that has been achieved in the past 6 years or so. Also, Benghazi hasn&#39;t blown up yet, so they achieved a huge PR win in that category too.</p>

<p>Now, if they &quot;won&quot; and did everything they wanted to do, and the public folded before them, they want to show off because they are sociopathic megalomaniacs who want control and power. They essentially want to show their power over reddit.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where the new stuff comes in: Papa Johns Pizza.</p>

<p>Yes, you read that correctly, Papa Johns. A &quot;Romney&quot; company through and through. They give out a bunch of free pizzas in that football promotion to get people to buy their product. They are a national chain.</p>

<p>Because Obama is &quot;elected&quot; they throw a hissy fit and whine about how Obamacare is making them pay more and raise their prices (it really is, but that&#39;s not the point), while they have the pizza giveaway fodder to make for easy shooting. They are tanking in PR right now and will probably be Politics&#39; and the other controlled subreddits&#39; pi√±ata for a few more days. But how does this fit into the Hegelian Dialectic you may be asking yourself? We need to go deeper.</p>

<p>Papa Johns will lose a bunch of business, but fat fucking americans love their overpriced bread and cheese to eat while watching their various mind draining activities, so they aren&#39;t going to stop eating pizza, fuck no, they&#39;re going to order it from another place and actually feel good about it because they&#39;re thinking &quot;yeah fuck John, that Romney supporter&quot;. Maybe they will order pizza when they don&#39;t normally order pizza, just in spite of John.</p>

<p>Chances are, they&#39;re going to get Dominos. It&#39;s simple math. They&#39;re going to buy Dominos pizza, which has recently vamped their menu with tasty treats filled with god knows what genetically modified garbage that will make you shoot blanks till you die early. Well, that&#39;s normal, what&#39;s the big deal though?</p>

<p>When these liberals who think they&#39;ve &quot;won&quot; are sitting down to a plate of poison, feeling good about stickin it to Papa John because he was hating on Obamacare, watching their opiate sport of choice and sitting through insurance commercial after big pharma commercial, they shell out money to Dominos, owned by.... Bain Capital.</p>

<p>I told you it was funny.</p>

<p>edit: Just to be clear, it sounds comedic, but I actually think this was on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was actually by accident and I noticed the pun after I finished writing it. I didn&#39;t want to give away the punchline in the title so I though of that because it might take a bit of mental gymnastics to actually get why this might be plausible. This is going away from the realm of straight conspiracy into the ironic conspiracy reality filled with symbolism and innuendo that kind of spits in the face of people who understand the symbolism because it&#39;s so blatant. Like the insurance companies &quot;AllState&quot; and &quot;State Farm&quot; and their true purpose of increasing the power of the state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to be a Liberal you&#39;re just separating yourself. I&#39;m not the one who made up this idea. I really don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re accusing me of. Liberals and Conservatives can&#39;t agree because that&#39;s how they were designed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the people that are controlling both parties that specifically targeted Liberals in this specific social control scheme, not me. Last time I checked it was the liberals who voted for Obama and like obamacare, not conservatives. Obamacare is the wedge issue in this case, so I&#39;m forced to use the left/right paradigm to explain what actually happened.</p>

<p>Most likely people reading this won&#39;t be Liberal or Conservative so I&#39;m not dividing anyone.</p>
