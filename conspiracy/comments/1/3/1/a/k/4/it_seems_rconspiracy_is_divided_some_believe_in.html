       Lets look at this, because according to believers, this asteroid, or whatever it is, is going to collide with earth. So lets atleast look and see if its real.
      </p>
      <p>
       To start off, I do not believe in it. I think its a bunch of crap. But if so many people think its real, then lets find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       To start, lets see how this myth/conspiracy/fact came to life. Who created it? Where was the first discoveries found, etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope we can have an honest DISCUSSION about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Why the downvotes? I don't see any reason to downvote. If you believe in niburu you'd want this to get big so it can be proven. If you dont believe, then you'd want this to get big so it will be found false. If your downvoting, your being a ignorant little bitch, who just downvotes because of 'niburu'. Yet I'm saying it doesn't exist.

       I love NdGT but I also know that he avoids making statements that will offend or worry his otherwise rational base. In other words, he allays fears and anxiety while reassuring the masses that the universe is relatively fine and will remain that way for an inconceivably long time. At his core, he's an educator. The last thing he'd ever want to do is make science seem scary or dangerous.

       Niburu, planet X, the 10th planet, was predicted to exist because of a now dis-proven formula that was thought to predict/determine where the set distances from the sun that planets must orbit at.  A planet was found using this predictive formula (I can't recall which one it was but it was one of the outer 3) and hence, there was much belief that there should be a 10th planet as well at a set distance further out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note:  Now it would really be a 9th planet as pluto is not considered a planet anymore, which it shouldn't be, based on it's puny size and it's irregular orbit.

       I remember that episode, if memory serves me correctly they said that Uranus and Neptune were found this way because Neptune's gravitational pull effects Uranus' orbit (hehe) and also that Neptune has an off orbit that can't be explained especially not by Pluto because as you mention it's tiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing that I would like to know more of about that episode is the missing gold "facts" they mentioned. They said out of all the gold that is mined out of Africa like 75% disappears forever.

       This website says niburu was supposed to come into contact around october 27th, 2012. Thats past. So there is one site, that is wrong. This site also believes in big foot, and aliens... so I dont know how credible it can be.

       No. I want to see all these 2012 nonsense posts stop showing up in bunches as we near the end of this year.

       They rarely see more than 20-25 comments and a few upvotes/downvotes and just fade into the sunset.

       The hype surrounding this year is so massive, expect more movies/books/you name it to come out as this year continues on it's close so people can cash in on this being "the last month and a half you'll live!!!"

       I personally would like to see this thread not even exist, not grow to prove something nearly everyone here doesn't believe or even care about at this point.

       Wow.  Has anybody commenting on this thread actually
       <strong>
        read
       </strong>
       <em>
        The 12th Planet
       </em>
       ?  There are some amazing theories behind what Sitchin describes in his book, and following works.  Even without the whole "ancient alien" part tied into it.  The thoughts of another planet on an elliptical orbit (as shown on the new

       ), are somewhat plausible... considering NASA recently considered the fact that our Sun
       <a href="http://phys.org/news6428.html">
        may be part of a binary star system
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the Sumerians refer to Earth as "The 7th Planet", and tie it so closely to "luck number 7"?  We're the 3rd Planet out.... but the 7th on the way in (still counting Pluto as #1).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think "Rexquando" was referring to the Titus-Bode law, for determining the relative distance of planets, and where they should be in our solar system.  Titus-Bode accounts for our asteroid belt being where it should be (if there
       <em>
        used
       </em>
       to be a planet there, and it was destroyed... see The 12th Planet), and accounts for the approximate positions of Neptune, Eris, and Pluto.... before they were discovered by telescope.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I'm not on the "A PLANET WILL HIT EARTH AND DESTROY US ALL" bandwagon.  I'm just saying that some of the folks want to immediately discredit over 30 years of work from an author... because of a few TV shows that mention him, and a few crackpots that reference his work... WITHOUT EVER READING THE BOOKS.  &lt;facepalm&gt;

       Wow what an asshole. I don't think I've ever seen anyone on this subbreddit explicitly blame jews for these things we discuss. Yes, zionists get a lot of hate because there are people in power doing terrible things and these people also happen to be jewish. The zionist agenda as described by the zionists themselves is pretty terrible so its very possible that they deserve it. However, its usually made quite clear that the problems lie with zionists not jews, at least in the materials that I have read.

       Zionism=/=Judaism. Weird how you don't know that when you are so much better than us with your
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       research of
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       conspiracy subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's safe to say that
       <a href="http://youtu.be/tgbvt14rUIw">
        this
       </a>
       sums up how the majority of anti-zionists see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's funny how closed-minded you are yet you imply that you are a "real conspiracy theorist" and we are not. It's one thing if you don't believe in nibiru (I don't, I think it was a "conspiracy" prior to current understandings of astrophysics, now that the info is available to disprove, it's no longer believed in) or shape shifting lizards (I'm on the fence after watching David Icke's 10 hour Wembley lecture), that rothschild zionists control the world (fairly cetain of it), but to actually say they are
       <em>
        wrong
       </em>
       , and that people are lunatics and horrible people for even entertaining the idea that they may be true is just close minded and just makes you look like an elitist dick fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're so much better than us with your fancy books and "actual research", go read a David Icke book and come back here. Will it convince you of anything? probably not. But hopefully the massive amounts of evidence he provides will help get that fat elitist stick out of your fucking ass.

       What kind of conspiracy theorist accepts that something is false just because it seems crazy without even taking the time to review the evidence?

       ok if u go back through history of indegenous peoples aural and transcribed u will find references to similar ideas...as for nibiru i am uncertain if u refer to the sumerian texts some o=f  which are conveniently safeguarded in the vatican..or the article in the washington post in the 80.s..either way i dont care a bout the voting structure reddit but an open forum discussion..the mind is like an parachute it needs to be open to work ...not fed parydigms to fill the gaps..i suppose in the end we could not really handle the truth..as  for the mayan calender..there were actually two the second one being lost that would explain further...i have read the comments and have found no useful tools to support either pros or cons ..except the some of the ones that commented..the net is fraught with deception when researching and archives or books are better sources at times as for the most part they conform to some structure of truth...not sure if chariots of the gods by erich von daniken..qualifys but certainly opens the field for discussion...or the spaceships of ezekial by josef blumrich..the sirius mystery by robert temple...in the end do your own research ....how can we have different views if we see the same news????.....live long and prosper...mr spock...

       It's hard to say.  All the information about Niburu comes from the previous civilization and anything of real information/importance is probably sealed a vault in the vatican or kept hidden by the governments that found them.  If it is real, it most certainly isn't an asteroid/planet in the common three dimensional sense, as that would be impossible to hide from amateur astronomers at this point.  If it was a 3 dimensional object at one point it probably was someone that came through our solar system a
       <em>
        while
       </em>
       ago a wreaked havoc (and might even be responsible for the asteroid belt), and thus gained the anthropomorphized deification that most all other celestial bodies received.
      </p>
      <p>
       It certainly ties in with the whole 2012 stuff, and as with most things hidden, we shale see.

       WHY don't you believe in Niburu?  Because of one website?  What about that particular website entices you to adopt it's opinion as your own?  Do you believe a giant astroid colliding with Earth is not plausible?  Why not?  I'm not asking for specific links or anything, just your own thoughts and opinions on the matter.

       So, a humungous-ass astroid barreling towards Earth from deep space is totally out of the question?  Because
       <em>
        why

       ??  Because it seems to have something to do with GOD????  Whatever, man, I really can't help you.

       He's merely pointing out that a lot of the basis for the belief in Nibiru is based on it being, or being sent by, some sort of diety and therefore illogical based on his beliefs. I happen to share his disbelief in god but also in my experiences in astronomy and physics, I find it extremely hard to believe that this extra planet/comet could exist without being easily observable.

       Fuck yeah Niburu is real. 
We exist in an infinite universe with and infinite number of stars/planets/suns/solar systems, all spinning around and around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sooner or later, one of them is going to crash into us. Frankly, its only by the grace of his noodly appendage that it hasnt happened already.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as it has happened before, it will fucking happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good news is, that when it happens, the thing will be plainly visible to the naked eye, months if not years before it hits us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between now and then we're more likely to be wiped out by a much smaller asteroid that we never even see coming.

You got all these mega trillion shitfuckton sized rocks floating around in a giant shooting gallery and dont think they crash into each other?

       You seem to have gone a step or two too far. While there most certainly are a "mega trillion shitfuckton sized rocks" flying around in space you also need to remember just how big space really is. These shitfuckton sized rocks may be a metric shitfuckton but they're still only a few hundred kilometers around in comparison to one single astronomical unit they are miniscule.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, we will inevitably will collide with Andromeda however it is most probable our planet will just get flung out in to empty space where we'll freeze to death. Theres even an appreciable chance that our planet and its life forms will be wholly unaffected by the collision.

       In 1993 a massively shitfuckton sized comet was discovered. A few months later Shoemaker-Levy 9 steamrolled into and exploded across thousands of miles of Jupiter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it had hit Earth instead, we'd all be dead already.
      </p>
      <p>
       That happened less than 20 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of these days, someone's going to discover a new comet, and 3 weeks later we'll all be dead. Thats how its going to go down. I dont care what name they give it, but it will always be Nibiru to me.

       lol things don't just fly around at fractions of the speed of light. A vast majority of astronomical events take place extremely slowly. Things of the scale being suggested in this so called conspiracy would be seen most likely years before contact, which at our level of existence would probably be enough time to stop it. Say what you want about the people behind the curtain but I doubt they'd be okay with our whole planet being destroyed.
