<p>To start off, I do not believe in it. I think its a bunch of crap. But if so many people think its real, then lets find out. </p>

<p>To start, lets see how this myth/conspiracy/fact came to life. Who created it? Where was the first discoveries found, etc?</p>

<p>I hope we can have an honest DISCUSSION about it.</p>

<p>EDIT: Why the downvotes? I don&#39;t see any reason to downvote. If you believe in niburu you&#39;d want this to get big so it can be proven. If you dont believe, then you&#39;d want this to get big so it will be found false. If your downvoting, your being a ignorant little bitch, who just downvotes because of &#39;niburu&#39;. Yet I&#39;m saying it doesn&#39;t exist.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Niburu, planet X, the 10th planet, was predicted to exist because of a now dis-proven formula that was thought to predict/determine where the set distances from the sun that planets must orbit at.  A planet was found using this predictive formula (I can&#39;t recall which one it was but it was one of the outer 3) and hence, there was much belief that there should be a 10th planet as well at a set distance further out.</p>

<p>Note:  Now it would really be a 9th planet as pluto is not considered a planet anymore, which it shouldn&#39;t be, based on it&#39;s puny size and it&#39;s irregular orbit.</p>

<p>This website says niburu was supposed to come into contact around october 27th, 2012. Thats past. So there is one site, that is wrong. This site also believes in big foot, and aliens... so I dont know how credible it can be. </p>

<p>What...?</p>

<p>No. I want to see all these 2012 nonsense posts stop showing up in bunches as we near the end of this year.</p>

<p>They rarely see more than 20-25 comments and a few upvotes/downvotes and just fade into the sunset.</p>

<p>The hype surrounding this year is so massive, expect more movies/books/you name it to come out as this year continues on it&#39;s close so people can cash in on this being &quot;the last month and a half you&#39;ll live!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Almost no one here (I can&#39;t say with certainty, because I haven&#39;t seen <em>every</em> poster here) believes in the 2012 nonsense, especially Nibiru.</p>

<p>I personally would like to see this thread not even exist, not grow to prove something nearly everyone here doesn&#39;t believe or even care about at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  Has anybody commenting on this thread actually <strong>read</strong> <em>The 12th Planet</em>?  There are some amazing theories behind what Sitchin describes in his book, and following works.  Even without the whole &quot;ancient alien&quot; part tied into it.  The thoughts of another planet on an elliptical orbit (as shown on the new <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=swiss+notes+nibiru&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS481US481&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=939&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=pkOhUIiIIoem9AS5_oGwAQ&amp;amp;ved=0CD4QsAQ">Swiss notes</a>), are somewhat plausible... considering NASA recently considered the fact that our Sun <a href="http://phys.org/news6428.html">may be part of a binary star system</a>.</p>

<p>Why would the Sumerians refer to Earth as &quot;The 7th Planet&quot;, and tie it so closely to &quot;luck number 7&quot;?  We&#39;re the 3rd Planet out.... but the 7th on the way in (still counting Pluto as #1).</p>

<p>Also, I think &quot;Rexquando&quot; was referring to the Titus-Bode law, for determining the relative distance of planets, and where they should be in our solar system.  Titus-Bode accounts for our asteroid belt being where it should be (if there <em>used</em> to be a planet there, and it was destroyed... see The 12th Planet), and accounts for the approximate positions of Neptune, Eris, and Pluto.... before they were discovered by telescope.</p>

<p>But, I&#39;m not on the &quot;A PLANET WILL HIT EARTH AND DESTROY US ALL&quot; bandwagon.  I&#39;m just saying that some of the folks want to immediately discredit over 30 years of work from an author... because of a few TV shows that mention him, and a few crackpots that reference his work... WITHOUT EVER READING THE BOOKS.  &lt;facepalm&gt;</p>

Yes, zionists get a lot of hate because there are people in power doing terrible things and these people also happen to be jewish.

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism=/=Judaism. Weird how you don&#39;t know that when you are so much better than us with your <em>actual</em> research of <em>real</em> conspiracy subjects. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say that <a href="http://youtu.be/tgbvt14rUIw">this</a> sums up how the majority of anti-zionists see it.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s funny how closed-minded you are yet you imply that you are a &quot;real conspiracy theorist&quot; and we are not. It&#39;s one thing if you don&#39;t believe in nibiru (I don&#39;t, I think it was a &quot;conspiracy&quot; prior to current understandings of astrophysics, now that the info is available to disprove, it&#39;s no longer believed in) or shape shifting lizards (I&#39;m on the fence after watching David Icke&#39;s 10 hour Wembley lecture), that rothschild zionists control the world (fairly cetain of it), but to actually say they are <em>wrong</em>, and that people are lunatics and horrible people for even entertaining the idea that they may be true is just close minded and just makes you look like an elitist dick fuck. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re so much better than us with your fancy books and &quot;actual research&quot;, go read a David Icke book and come back here. Will it convince you of anything? probably not. But hopefully the massive amounts of evidence he provides will help get that fat elitist stick out of your fucking ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok if u go back through history of indegenous peoples aural and transcribed u will find references to similar ideas...as for nibiru i am uncertain if u refer to the sumerian texts some o=f  which are conveniently safeguarded in the vatican..or the article in the washington post in the 80.s..either way i dont care a bout the voting structure reddit but an open forum discussion..the mind is like an parachute it needs to be open to work ...not fed parydigms to fill the gaps..i suppose in the end we could not really handle the truth..as  for the mayan calender..there were actually two the second one being lost that would explain further...i have read the comments and have found no useful tools to support either pros or cons ..except the some of the ones that commented..the net is fraught with deception when researching and archives or books are better sources at times as for the most part they conform to some structure of truth...not sure if chariots of the gods by erich von daniken..qualifys but certainly opens the field for discussion...or the spaceships of ezekial by josef blumrich..the sirius mystery by robert temple...in the end do your own research ....how can we have different views if we see the same news????.....live long and prosper...mr spock...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to say.  All the information about Niburu comes from the previous civilization and anything of real information/importance is probably sealed a vault in the vatican or kept hidden by the governments that found them.  If it is real, it most certainly isn&#39;t an asteroid/planet in the common three dimensional sense, as that would be impossible to hide from amateur astronomers at this point.  If it was a 3 dimensional object at one point it probably was someone that came through our solar system a <em>while</em> ago a wreaked havoc (and might even be responsible for the asteroid belt), and thus gained the anthropomorphized deification that most all other celestial bodies received. </p>

<p>It certainly ties in with the whole 2012 stuff, and as with most things hidden, we shale see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s merely pointing out that a lot of the basis for the belief in Nibiru is based on it being, or being sent by, some sort of diety and therefore illogical based on his beliefs.

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck yeah Niburu is real. 
We exist in an infinite universe with and infinite number of stars/planets/suns/solar systems, all spinning around and around.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, one of them is going to crash into us. Frankly, its only by the grace of his noodly appendage that it hasnt happened already.</p>

<p>But, as it has happened before, it will fucking happen again.</p>

<p>The good news is, that when it happens, the thing will be plainly visible to the naked eye, months if not years before it hits us.</p>

<p>Between now and then we&#39;re more likely to be wiped out by a much smaller asteroid that we never even see coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have gone a step or two too far. While there most certainly are a &quot;mega trillion shitfuckton sized rocks&quot; flying around in space you also need to remember just how big space really is. These shitfuckton sized rocks may be a metric shitfuckton but they&#39;re still only a few hundred kilometers around in comparison to one single astronomical unit they are miniscule. </p>

<p>And yes, we will inevitably will collide with Andromeda however it is most probable our planet will just get flung out in to empty space where we&#39;ll freeze to death. Theres even an appreciable chance that our planet and its life forms will be wholly unaffected by the collision. </p>

<p>That happened less than 20 years ago.</p>
