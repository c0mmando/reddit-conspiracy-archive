      <p>
       Here’s what I currently know; I hope someone out there can help fill in the details:
      </p>
      <p>
       He’s the great-grandson of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Taylor_Fulford">
        George Taylor Fulford
       </a>
       , a Canadian politician and businessman.  At the time of his early death, GTF was the single largest shareholder of General Electric and was considering buying General Motors.
      </p>
      <p>
       From Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some of his descendants believe he was actually murdered. His great-grandson, Benjamin Fulford,[3] former journalist for Forbes magazine in Japan, believes he was murdered in a conspiracy by the Rockefeller family (who made millions with Standard Oil) because he was going to fund Nikola Tesla's research into Free Energy.[4] The driver, it is alleged who caused the fatal collision (but himself survived) had been given one weeks notice at the time of the crash.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Benjamin Fulford himself pursued a career in journalism, and claims to be the former Asia-Pacific bureau chief at Forbes; he also says he resigned because the magazine refused to print articles on a scandal involving some of the magazine’s advertisers.  He then went rogue, apparently maintaining his high-level financial contacts even as he did his own, independent journalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to check Forbes to verify that he did in fact hold that position—that would give him a lot of credibility.  While I did find a few articles he’d written about finance—and while they did pertain typically to Japan/Asia—I’ve never found confirmation through Forbes that he actually DID hold that position.  So part of me wonders, “Is this a guy who happened to write a few articles for Forbes, and then leveraged that association to create built-in credibility by pretending to be a bureau chief?”  It seems plausible, but unlikely.  If he never was the bureau chief and was misleading readers by claiming that he was, wouldn’t Forbes come out and say that he never held that position?  The claim, the articles he wrote, and the lack of denial (so far as I’ve seen) from Forbes tend to make me think this guy really does know what he’s talking about.  Some of the stuff seems a bit nutty, but then A LOT of what he says is going on is stuff that my own research verifies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy is either telling the truth, being delusional, or creating an elaborate alternate-universe fantasy that he updates weekly, drawing largely from what is actually going on in the world.  I just don’t have enough information at this time to be sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone help me verify whether or not he actually held that position at Forbes?  He certainly wrote articles for them, but whether or not he had that position is crucial: it would indicate whether he really does have the high-level contacts he’d need to know what he seems to know.

       I believe Fulford is a prevaricator. His game is to mix some truths with a pack of lies, just enough to make the lies seem credible. What I don't know is whether he's just nuts, or doing this for a purpose to provide false hopes. I haven't trusted his writing since he posted a photo of a reptilian parasite he claimed had been removed surgically from his spine. That was the limit.

       looks like sludge in a cup.  You can speculate all you want, but until it's verified by several other scientists, it's just speculation and should be put in the same category as bigfoot and UFO's

       Truth must be verifiable and not just sensational claims. Also, disinfo artists are all over, and so are fast buck conmen. Fulford's writings match output of people I've know who were con artists. There's something wrong about him.

       He does have some way out scenarios but I do agree with his basic premise that effort spent on lining ones pockets is shortsighted compared to furthering civilizations advancement. It's time to stop killing each other for resources unesssarily.

       He is a good man who's off world on Planet Hope right now. I'm not sure if Idlywild has disposed of all his clones or not, but many of his videos/blog rants posted after the devastation of the Fukushima quake are disinfo the cabal has created using clones of his. The cabal failed to assassinate him a couple of times and he's now under the protection of a small ninja army.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food4Thought is right, don't waste too much time on him unless you filter for anything posted after May, 2011. The clones do sprinkle truth in with nonsense tho, so just use your best judgement.

       I agree with this.  He has obviously suffered some type of stroke.  So, I can see why he genuinely believes someone is trying to murder him.

       He is right about some things that sound nutty at first.  That gives him a certain amount of credibility to me.  The nuttier parts, though, I'm not quite willing to accept.

       Fulford and Drake are continuing a scam that has been being played since the year 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       This early version was called NESARA, the National Economic Security and Reformation Act. A secret law that was to be announced 'any day now'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main spokesperson for NESARA was Shaini Goodwin who called herself the Dove of Oneness
      </p>
      <p>
       She has died
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       She spent years promising arrests of world power players, debt forgiveness, which would produce massive prosperity and the discontinuance of corrupt corporate, banking and governmental practices  She always kept the events she promised just out of reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       She'd say NESARA would be announced in the next few days, next week, we are having technical difficulties but they are just going to last a short time....
      </p>
      <p>
       Rinse and repeat, for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       In her absence Fulford and friends have adapted the same game with a new smell.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't seem to think it matters that Shaini Goodwin The Dove of Oneness, died broke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they can do it better.
      </p>
      <p>
       To show a connection between the NESARA scam and Fulford all I have is this Fulford article which has a prominent ad that mentions The Dove of Oneness and NESARA.
