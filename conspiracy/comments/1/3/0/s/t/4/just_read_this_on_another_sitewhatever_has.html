<p>Hundreds of comments these stuck out...&#39;&#39;You haven&#39;t read the thread. There was an area north of the explosion site in which most or all of the reports of unconscious and/or sick people were reported. It has been stated multiple times that this is not within the area of the explosion. </p>

<p>555 Woodrow Avenue - Unconscious person
222 Wisconsin Street - sick person
250 S. Meridian - Unconscious person
326 North Hamilton - ????
1150 Shelby Street - sick person</p>

<p>This is just the beginning of the list of multiple reports of &quot;unconscious&quot; or &quot;sick&quot; persons at 10-15 or more locations all in the same vacinity of the city, in an area &quot;north&quot; of the explosion. The reports were coming in too fast for me to catch all details about each one, but I did manage to map every one of these ambulance calls and they were all in the Central part of the city near Rt. 70 and Rt. 65, until some started popping up in the Beech Grove area.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t say this is unrelated unless you have done the research. We heard report upon reports of ambulance calls for unconscious people all in &quot;separate&quot; locations in the same vacinity of the city - ongoing at 6AM.</p>

<p>I hope that puts this to rest that those of us reporting these oddities knew this was not in the exact location of the explosion. In fact that was the question.</p>

<p>Map for the first five reports and a sixth near the site:</p>

<p>Please note the location of Beech Grove directly above the explosion site address box. Similar reports continued for the same area north of the explosion and a few for Beech Grove towards the end of the time I listened. Many of the reports are listed on this page:
Thread: EQ? Gas Explosion?? Something Just Shook Houses In Indianapolis! (Page 25)</p>

<p>Listen for yourself.  I have heard over 10 calls of people passed out and can not breathe: <a href="http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?action=wp&amp;feedId=4336">http://www.radioreference.com/apps/audio/?action=wp&amp;feedId=4336</a></p>

<p>&#39;&#39;I was chatting with a childhood friend from Maine last night when half of Maine had a Power Outage.. A Bright Flash Was seen in the sky over the Ocean.. Same time that N. Carolina lost it&#39;s power .. and also reported a Bright Flash in the sky... NOW THIS.. Including the Earthquake in Kentucky.. Hello..

    <div class="md"><p>obviously. people in indianapolis do not get ill very much. I even heard some heart attacks on the emergency radio site which never happens - so thats got to be connected. I also heard people reported seeing helicopters in the sky almost immediately - but Indianapolis is too small and backwater to have helos - so it must mean military was on the scene immediately! Its really strange man, we have to get to the bottom of this....</p>

<p>Edit: Should&#39;ve known based on this youtube comment: </p>

<p>&quot;Sorcha Faal specialises in disinformation designed to discredit anyone seeking the truth and to muddy the truth. If you see﻿ this name that means there may be something they want to obscure here but the actual story is invariably bs. I can only wonder what the truth is.&quot;</p>
