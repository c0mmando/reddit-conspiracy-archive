        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just a thought.  This subreddit is specifically for looking at events in the world and musing about alternate explanations for them.  I propose that any thread that becomes inundated with vehement denials, personal attacks and indignant appeals from users who have accumulated inordinate amounts of karma in short periods of time are the threads you should be thinking long and hard about.  Someone is organizing these gaming campaigns to suppress information and tar and feather anyone who says otherwise.  This is not the act of a few trolls surfing through r/conspiracy.  It is organized, planned and executed 24/7.  This is not a conspiracy.  We all know it is happening.  I am asking all the real warmblooded humans in here to ignore these accounts and continue to post and comment as you would otherwise, especially in threads containing the most obvious blowback.  These are the threads that count.  Case in point: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/SutekhRising">SutekhRising</a> has just convinced there is more to the Indianapolis explosion than I first thought.  Thanks for that, SutekhRising.  Very nice work.</p>

<p>TL;DR: The more they shill a thread, the more it matters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false, it is &quot;generally accepted&quot; (or vice versa). This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes a third option, which is that there is insufficient investigation and therefore insufficient information to prove the proposition satisfactorily to be either true or false. Nor does it allow the admission that the choices may in fact not be two (true or false), but may be as many as four, (1) true, (2) false, (3) unknown between true or false, and (4) being unknowable (among the first three).[1] In debates, appeals to ignorance are sometimes used to shift the burden of proof.</p>

<p>I have no doubt shills exist, it just amuses me how often people are accused of being shills for arguing an opposing point. Do people really think that there aren&#39;t enough Jews and Israelis to defend Israel of their own volition that Israel needs to hire shills, for instance?</p>
