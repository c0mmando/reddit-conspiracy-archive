       Just a thought.  This subreddit is specifically for looking at events in the world and musing about alternate explanations for them.  I propose that any thread that becomes inundated with vehement denials, personal attacks and indignant appeals from users who have accumulated inordinate amounts of karma in short periods of time are the threads you should be thinking long and hard about.  Someone is organizing these gaming campaigns to suppress information and tar and feather anyone who says otherwise.  This is not the act of a few trolls surfing through r/conspiracy.  It is organized, planned and executed 24/7.  This is not a conspiracy.  We all know it is happening.  I am asking all the real warmblooded humans in here to ignore these accounts and continue to post and comment as you would otherwise, especially in threads containing the most obvious blowback.  These are the threads that count.  Case in point:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/SutekhRising">
        SutekhRising
       </a>
       has just convinced there is more to the Indianapolis explosion than I first thought.  Thanks for that, SutekhRising.  Very nice work.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: The more they shill a thread, the more it matters.

       Shills are farts in an elevator.  You can't stop them, and you can't make the elevator smell nice again.  But that's pretty much all a shill is.

      <blockquote>

        It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false, it is "generally accepted" (or vice versa). This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes a third option, which is that there is insufficient investigation and therefore insufficient information to prove the proposition satisfactorily to be either true or false. Nor does it allow the admission that the choices may in fact not be two (true or false), but may be as many as four, (1) true, (2) false, (3) unknown between true or false, and (4) being unknowable (among the first three).[1] In debates, appeals to ignorance are sometimes used to shift the burden of proof.

       That's a dangerous path to go down. You start associating certain arguments with "shills" and pretty soon you reject anyone who ever suggests those arguments because of that association.

       Shills are easy enough to identify. They don't know the topics they're blindly defending. They cite bullshit contrived disinfo debunk sites. And they use all these tricks

       I'm really not even sure why you're copy pasting that, as it doesn't relate at all to my question. You can be an idiot, ignorant, close-minded and brainwashed by the media and also not be a shill.

       Haha, I don't think you're a shill. I understand not wanting your main reddit account to be "tainted" with posts in

        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And the COINTELPRO link was meant to point out that forum communities are indeed being infiltrated, and the idea that "they wouldn't be concerned with silly forum posts, they have better things to do" is false.

       Is there any evidence that that document is actually from COINTELPRO?

      <p>
       I have no doubt shills exist, it just amuses me how often people are accused of being shills for arguing an opposing point. Do people really think that there aren't enough Jews and Israelis to defend Israel of their own volition that Israel needs to hire shills, for instance?

       And as for Zionists having to hire shills outside of the Jewish community, well, why wouldn't they? All a decent shill needs is to be a master debater (heehee), decent grammar, and have a big enough paycheck to stop them from questioning the motives of their superiors.

       "Zionists" don't need to hire shills to defend Israel because there is a huge number of people already doing it and believing what they say. Accusing someone defending Israel of being a shill is like accusing a religious person of being a shill for the Church, or an atheist of being a shill for anti-church groups.

       Yes, it is definitely true that there are lots of Israelis defending Zionism without being hired to do so.
But I'm not about to dismiss the idea that they are hiring people to shill 8 hours a day as a full-time job.

       Trolls and conspiratard posters (though; generally they coincide) make up the majority of what people consider 'shill' posts.

       It's even mentioned when there are threads with hundreds of comments - people actually post that they're just here for entertainment &amp; they get up voted for it.
