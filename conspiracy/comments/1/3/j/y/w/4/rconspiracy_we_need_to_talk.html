This is certainly concrete evidence that the Big Secret Conspiracy That Controls Everything somehow needs to pay people to sit at their computers and post &quot;disinformation&quot; on shitty subreddits, when, if they Control Everything, they could just shut it down, kill everyone who posted, and get away with it.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s big news this week. But if we are looking to broaden horizions and expand peoples&#39; minds on this sub the more important issues are things addressing who is behind/running the illuminati/elite, what their latest tactics are, some speculation on upcoming events perhaps, and general discussion about the ruling power structure. Talking about Israel and Gaza really doesn&#39;t help anything other than divide people along simple talking points and bring up already known facts about the situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the topics are allowed on here, but my point is they are drowned out by the redundant news on Gaza/Israel. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying that discussion of Gaza/Israel is inherently a bad thing, or that after a set amount of time then it becomes irrelevant, but that the infiltrators and shills on this forum inherently promote such topics in order to bring the discussion away from topics such as edgar cayce, cancer cures, the nature of reality, the highest levels and secrets of the illuminati and other such fascinating higher level stuff and bring us down to everday stuff that I literally can hear about by turning on my car radio and listening to NPR. </p>

<p>I am not saying it is not a legitimate conspiracy, just that it is overdiscussed. All of us regulars on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> know that the zionist entity known as Israel is a criminal state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This just proves his point all the more. I wish more people could have seen this sub a year ago, or even half a year ago. Over the past half year to the past 3 months the topics have been watered down from advanced discussions to memes and regurgitated low level shit like the millionth link about 9/11 or the flavor of the week--this week being Israel vs. Palestine. By focusing on the Israel vs. Palestine issue (which I admit is important) this subreddit&#39;s more important discussions are buried under &quot;popular&quot; issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the topics are allowed on here, but my point is they are drowned out by the redundant news on Gaza/Israel. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying that discussion of Gaza/Israel is inherently a bad thing, or that after a set amount of time then it becomes irrelevant, but that the infiltrators and shills on this forum inherently promote such topics in order to bring the discussion away from topics such as edgar cayce, cancer cures, the nature of reality, the highest levels and secrets of the illuminati and other such fascinating higher level stuff and bring us down to everday stuff that I literally can hear about by turning on my car radio and listening to NPR. </p>
