       I've been noticing that this subreddit seems to be turning into
       <a href="/r/Politics">

       Light. Users are losing interest in the deeper meaning behind the stories, and are instead content to engage in "all rich people/Republicans are bad" circlejerks. This community has opened my eyes to the truth, and it saddens me that new users may not get that same experience

       Well, your anonymous quote from the internet has sure changed my mind!  This is certainly concrete evidence that the Big Secret Conspiracy That Controls Everything somehow needs to pay people to sit at their computers and post "disinformation" on shitty subreddits, when, if they Control Everything, they could just shut it down, kill everyone who posted, and get away with it.  We should give the blogger that wrote this unsourced piece of opinion the Medal of Honor, because clearly he has Figured It All Out.

       Point proven. Israel and palestine pale in comparison to the bigger and more important conspiracy related issues. Don't get me wrong, they are important, but it's like discussing talking points in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       rather than looking at whos really running the show behind Romney and Obama.

       It's big news this week. But if we are looking to broaden horizions and expand peoples' minds on this sub the more important issues are things addressing who is behind/running the illuminati/elite, what their latest tactics are, some speculation on upcoming events perhaps, and general discussion about the ruling power structure. Talking about Israel and Gaza really doesn't help anything other than divide people along simple talking points and bring up already known facts about the situation.

       Of course the topics are allowed on here, but my point is they are drowned out by the redundant news on Gaza/Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not saying that discussion of Gaza/Israel is inherently a bad thing, or that after a set amount of time then it becomes irrelevant, but that the infiltrators and shills on this forum inherently promote such topics in order to bring the discussion away from topics such as edgar cayce, cancer cures, the nature of reality, the highest levels and secrets of the illuminati and other such fascinating higher level stuff and bring us down to everday stuff that I literally can hear about by turning on my car radio and listening to NPR.

       Sure it's a legitimate topic, I hate the zionists as much as you do, but I literally can hear this shit on NPR on a day to day basis. By watering this sub down to topics you can hear discussed on mainstream radio I feel the shills have done a fantastic job to narrow the range of topics down.

       I am not saying it is not a legitimate conspiracy, just that it is overdiscussed. All of us regulars on

       In addition to returning Sinai to Egypt, Israel also offered to return the Golan Heights to Syria in 1967, and again in 1973 in exchange for peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also recall that Israel ended its occupation of Gaza in 2005 and pulled all the Israeli settlers out of there.

       Since the James Holmes fiasco, this subreddit went from a small corner of the internet populated with critical thinkers to a gigantic psyop in a few short months.  Frankly, I don't even know why I continue to frequent it, other than to see what tactics they are trying now.  I think they are literally using reddit as a proving ground for their modern psych warfare methods.  And, it appears they are winning once again.

       1 at any time.  I swap it every 6 months or so to avoid having an account with enough personal information to allow someone to figure out my real identity.  Not that they would find anyone interesting after their search but I'm paranoid like that.

       Sure there is a legit discussion about Israel vs Palestine but it shouldn't be the main topic all the time.
We should only discuss conspiracy relevant politics or politics that goes in the right direction for a solution.

       I find that sometimes r/conspiracy gets some republican hate runoff from r/politics. I hate republicans, too.......but it's useless debating for or against either of the two parties, considering how similar they are, minus all the dog and pony distractions.

       This just proves his point all the more. I wish more people could have seen this sub a year ago, or even half a year ago. Over the past half year to the past 3 months the topics have been watered down from advanced discussions to memes and regurgitated low level shit like the millionth link about 9/11 or the flavor of the week--this week being Israel vs. Palestine. By focusing on the Israel vs. Palestine issue (which I admit is important) this subreddit's more important discussions are buried under "popular" issues.

       Man, you need to blow off with this shit. The second Americans stop dying in Israel's wars, and Israel stops murdering Palestinians will be the exact same second we'll start laying off on it.

       This just proves his point all the more. I wish more people could have seen this sub a year ago, or even half a year ago. Over the past half year to the past 3 months the topics have been watered down from advanced discussions to memes and regurgitated low level shit like the millionth link about 9/11 or the flavor of the week--this week being Israel vs. Palestine. By focusing on the Israel vs. Palestine issue (which I admit is important) this subreddit's more important discussions are buried under "popular" issues.

       Of course the topics are allowed on here, but my point is they are drowned out by the redundant news on Gaza/Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not saying that discussion of Gaza/Israel is inherently a bad thing, or that after a set amount of time then it becomes irrelevant, but that the infiltrators and shills on this forum inherently promote such topics in order to bring the discussion away from topics such as edgar cayce, cancer cures, the nature of reality, the highest levels and secrets of the illuminati and other such fascinating higher level stuff and bring us down to everday stuff that I literally can hear about by turning on my car radio and listening to NPR.
