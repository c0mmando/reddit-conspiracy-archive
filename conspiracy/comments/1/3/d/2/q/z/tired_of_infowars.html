I had noticed there had been no coverage of the questions re 9/11, so I emailed Farah directly and told him I would donate if he would do a story on WTC7.  No response.  No story.  Just an ever-growing push for Islamophobia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree he is a pain in the ass. I do believe he has people thinking about things in another light. He wakes up a lot of people who then can do research and draw their own conclusions. For this I am grateful as I was one of those people. For now, he&#39;s the best we have at waking people out of their comas. I like Webster Tarpley world crisis radio but its only 1 day a week and he is the opposite of AJ in that  he puts me right to sleep. If nothing else, AJ puts the bug in people to rethink what&#39;s really going on. He often trips me out too which helps me deal with the repetition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was obvious during the election that he&#39;s being paid by the GOP. The way he was pimping for Romney was absolutely disgusting and sealed it in my mind that he only exists to try to sway the angry right who dont want to vote republican anymore into doing just that by demonizing the democrats.</p>

<p>If he was legit, there would be hardly mention of the left-right bullshit, and he would host a stream of third party guests. He didnt even cover the third party debate. If that doesnt convince people that he is only interested in keeping the left-right bullshit going, then they need to wake the fuck up.</p>

<p>he is talking about  left-right paradigm all the time he did even make a 9 hour  free video stream about the &quot;Puppet Election&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He pays the lip service to the third party that he has to, just like the mainstream media. With the exception of Ron Paul, infowars coverage, or lack thereof was a mirror of the mainstream medias. I listened to his first interview with Gary Johnson over the summer, and was disgusted at how negative it was - it was nothing but dismissive statements and passive aggressive attacks, the kind of &quot;interviews&quot; that fox news gives to democrats.</p>

<p>Like I said though, he didnt even mention the third party debates. That tells you everything. During the election, he just went into overdrive obama-attack mode. All he ever does is talk about the dems and repubs. And as they say in the business, there is no such thing as bad press. Whether he talks good or bad about them, his job is to just keep the masses focused on the dems and repubs. Its completely obvious.</p>

<p>On a side note, your constant obsessive posting links to infowars is really fucking creepy for the same reason. Love him or hate him, your job seems to be to keep Alex Jones the focus of attention, so that he can do his job.</p>

Because when Alex Jones was attacking him, he was attacking him based on the fact that he shares the same libertarian view on abortion that Ron Paul does, the ones he NEVER attacks Ron Paul for... which in itself exposes Alex Jones hypocrisy....

    <div class="md"><p>Well I just don&#39;t think Rogan speaks in absolutes like most alternative sources do.</p>

<p>If he doesn&#39;t know, he kinda just talks about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the one reason why I still struggle to find alternative news, because I just want to <em>know</em> the story, and then decide for myself what I can take from it. Not have their spin and have random pieces taken out or changed to fit a bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you are doing your own investigations and reporting, I don&#39;t see how one can avoid &quot;spin&quot;, but you can mitigate it by vetting said sources.</p>

<p>My first rule, is to never, ever trust anything that comes out of a &quot;celebrity&#39;s&quot; mouth, ever.  My second, never trust anyone that is selling you information.  Third, never trust anyone that has sponsors. Fourth, if it is on television, it is bullshit, no exceptions.  These automatic disqualifiers dramatically reduce the pool of sources one must vet, by eliminating the sewage from the potential cream. </p>

<p>Like I said, Rogan is entertaining, he is a comedian after all. Though, the OP wasn&#39;t looking for entertainment; he was searching for an honest perspective, unlike what is coming from Jonestown&#39;s koolaid brigade (Tangy Tangerine<sup><sup>tm</sup></sup> flavor), that resonates with him.  Not some salesman trying to scare him into buying their sponsors wares.</p>

<p>I am in full agreeance with you on almost everything you&#39;ve stated.  I just believe that once you&#39;ve managed to seperate infotainment from actual journalism and honest reporting (biased or no, as everyone has a bias, though if they are honest about it, it ceases to be an obstacle), it makes the job of discerning the facts and figures less of a struggle.  I think we can both agree on that.</p>

<p>John Stadtmiller&#39;s National Intel Report on Republic Broadcasting is more insightful and less shouty than AJ. Find him at <a href="http://republicbroadcasting.org">http://republicbroadcasting.org</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Jones used to be a pretty good guy, but has really just gone way over the deepend or something, as he&#39;s changed so much.</p>

<p>Invariably, he has helped the truth movement so much, but with the decline his &#39;production&#39; has gone through, I don&#39;t know how much he&#39;s helped overall anymore, just due to the fact that his followers still blindly believe the shit he says.</p>

<p>Sorta reminds me of the Joe Rogan experience, but is more news/politics oriented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with a lot of these libertarian podcasters (I&#39;ve been libertarian since 1980, so don&#39;t blow me off) is for the most part they are fundamental christians and that annoys the shit out of me.  how can you trust the word of an adult who believes in a giant man in the sky?</p>

<p>Alex Jones is the right wings Michael Moore.</p>

<p>They both touch on the truth, but then are too fucking radical to follow through.</p>
