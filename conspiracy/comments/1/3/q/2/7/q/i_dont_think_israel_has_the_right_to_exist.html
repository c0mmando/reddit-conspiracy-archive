       I am a 17 year old Danish girl.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Israel has "the right to exist". Does that make me a Jew-hating neo-nazi?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the only possible solution for peace is a one state solution where Palestinians are allowed to return, live and vote in Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there could be a referendum on changing the name, flag, currency and official language etc. of the state and the Palestinian majority would officially get their land back and the state of Israel would cease to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR: Israel needs to be dismantled with non-violence and democracy implemented through the one-state solution.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This post may sound stupid but it is of utmost importance that people in the West realize that a colonial apartheid state like Israel don't have a "right to exist".
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Jews should of course be allowed to still live in this new state of Palestine and Hebrew should ideally be a secondary official language.

       Right, every nation has been conquered at some point.  North America wasn't founded by Columbus, it was a brudal human culling which resulted in land being stolen.

       I am an American of Danish descent who is a little over 50. You have to understand that the real nexus of Jewish power is in the USA and they will never, ever allow that to happen. AIPAC controls both major parties in the USA and Jewish Zionists are by far the wealthiest and most politically influential group in the USA.

       Netanyahu's speech to the US Congress on May 24th, 2011 should give you an idea of how strong that hold is.

       It was created as a "Safe haven" for the Jews after WWII, by western powers with (this being speculation) no regard to the residences already living there. While the original idea sounds reasonable, the planning and negotiating could have gone a lot smoother.

       Debating the morality of Israel's independence is kind of irrelevant though, since none of us can change history. What
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       more relevant is discussing the possible futures of Israel and Palestine. Personally I can't see the logic or fairness behind OP's proposal. Forcibly terminating the independence of an existing country by any means - military or political - is unjust. IMO the only just solution is a two-state solution. But sadly I suspect it will be a while before the Israelis and the Palestinians stop shooting each other for long enough to transit to two fully independent states.

       Israelis are not inclined to reproduce as fast as Palestine, thus making them a "dieing state".
       <em>
        (non-Jews = 24.56 births/1,000 population.  jews) = 18.97 births/1,000 population.)
       </em>

      <p>
       Israel has poisoned themselves and their ability (in addition to their inclination) to reproduce, thus making them a dieing state.

       The "powers that be" created Israel for the soul purpose of being destroyed.
       <em>
        (See: "Albert pike, 3 world wars.")

       I'm pretty sure being "destroyed" will more or less make them a non-state.

       God mentioned his thoughts on the Ashkenazi, converts to "Jew" in the year 740 AD who we call "European Jews", quite well in the book of revelation 3: 9. (Does not sound good for them.)

       I'm not an "extremist" when it comes to political issues, but I believe that agenda of universal human rights and the supremacy of free democratic government that progressive parties all over the world support - and that right wingers and neo-con parties all over the world reject - is the right way.  So...I agree that all countries have a right to defend themselves with legitimate force, but Israel's genocidal apartheid against peaceful Palestinians is not legitimate force. It's irrational, vengeful, and wrong, and the US should immediately withdraw alll support until the Israeli government agrees to confine its tactics to lawful methods of defense.

       Given that pretty much every country, including Denmark, is
       <em>
        essentially
       </em>
       and arbitrary socio-political construction, I don't see how one can say that Israel doesn't have a "right" to exist anymore or less than another country.

      <p>
       There is no "right" that says a country can or cannot exist.

       anyways, wording it like "israel doesn't have the right to exist" is just giving them carte blanche to say whatever they want in their propaganda campaign. then some softey news organization will say, "oh well this side says this that side says this i guess we'll just have to agree to disagree".

       I think the only possible solution for peace is a one state solution where Native Americans are allowed to regain their land, to rule and live in their ancient customs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there could be a referendum on changing the name, flag, currency and official language etc. of the state and the Native American's who were there since time immemorial would officially get their land back and the state of USA would cease to exist.

      <p>
       TL;DR: USA needs to be dismantled with non-violence and democracy implemented through the one-state solution.

       Then there could be a referendum on changing the name, flag, currency and official language etc. of the state and the Native majority would officially get their land back and the state of Canada would cease to exist.  (at least they

       Edit: Canadians should of course be allowed to still live in this new state of Native North America and English should ideally be a secondary official language.
