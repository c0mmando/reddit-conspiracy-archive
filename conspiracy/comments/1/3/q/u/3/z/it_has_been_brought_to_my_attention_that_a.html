    <div class="md"><p>This is VERY MUCH on the right path but there is one kicker... just one. and it&#39;s a big one. and it&#39;s that EVERYTHING has to follow an ordered path. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This still allows for everything to exist but it also creates a framework for possibility. That means there are only certain forms of infinite. Within our universe, in our time, with our laws, only certain things are possible at certain points in time. It&#39;s a linear progression of evolution. The consolidation of order or the condensation of what the universe desires or what I would call heaven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think? I find it highly improbable that we could base our reality on probabilities if in fact it wasn&#39;t at the core, entirely organized. Is it the fact that it is infinitely organized that creates the illusion of chaos that is confusing? Like the number pi. On the surface of pi it appears it is random when in fact, because it always yields the same results each time, it is perfectly ordered. Fractals to me are the very fabric of reality that I believe we are derived from so I would agree definitely that the universe is precisely that and would love to someday see what it looks like it in written form if that is possible. I believe it probably is. Evolution is cyclical? Why do you say that? Surely someone as bright as you is aware of the awesome story of our evolution starting as far back as a photon being ejected from the big bang that evolved and transformed for billions of years until finally this light crystalized into these human bodies and everything else around us? If the universe collapses in on itself and then spits me back out into the same body doing the same things as I experienced in the previous cycle, then I would agree it&#39;s cyclical, if instead it reorganizes itself and I come back with an entirely different experience then I would think it is not cyclical. I just don&#39;t believe the universe, which I consider to be a perfect being, repeats itself ever because it is illogical. Nothing in known history has repeated itself to date and if the universe is infinite, I think it would be strange for it to be both repeating (cyclical) and infinite. That seems to oppose the very definition of infinite. History never repeats itself despite what you&#39;ve been told lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pi theoretically never ends, so any random string of numbers is contained within it. Dunno how relevant that is.
How is it illogical to believe the Universe repeats itself? Look at the synchronicity of JFK and Lincoln.
I agree that cyclical doesn&#39;t do it justice, that&#39;s why I included &quot;fractal&quot; to the description. </p>

<p>The point is dude... YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN INCREDIBLE STRETCH in order for your fantasies to be true. Sure maaayyybe somewhere in the vast infinite stretches of the universe and time... there could somehow possibly be whatever the fuck it is you are trying to protect. Jesus? I don&#39;t know. But Jesus isn&#39;t here. Jesus isn&#39;t saving you from your sins. In fact, you don&#39;t even have sins. Problem is, we are going way out of our way to defend fantasies, and they aren&#39;t even good fantasies. Where&#39;s the hookers and blackjack? You are fearful of death, as we all are, you are fearful of your place in the afterlife, which is a complete lie, and so you need something to comfort you. I get it. Problem is, it&#39;s man made and it&#39;s leading you astray. It&#39;s leading the world astray and it&#39;s tearing us all apart. Your, precious and enlightened, inability to accept reality as the one and only heaven will be the very thing that destroys the greatest gift ever given.</p>

<p>The very fact that you start with this very sentence here is a testament to the fact that you don&#39;t actually know the first thing about which you speak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Funny thing is, you would actually have to be vein and deeply flawed NOT TO SEE this at our current state of knowledge and technology.</p>

<p>Really?  Do you really feel that?  Is that your &quot;official&quot; retort?  That&#39;s really the best you can come up with?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve obviously never seen such easily-accesible fare as &quot;Who Killed The Electric Car&quot;, and you&#39;ve <em>definitely</em> never heard of Virginia Steen McIntyre.</p>

<p>Literally every sentence you&#39;ve typed thus far digs you deeper and deeper into the hole of ignorance you&#39;ve so comfortably nestled yourself into.</p>

<p>This is actually a wonderful statement on your part.  Do you know what you just did in this statement?  You just attested and gave weight and credence to the very thing that what I said refers to.  Human knowledge is small and fallible, and for you or anyone to think that humanity or that tiny grain of sand called &quot;science&quot; has come up with too much of anything that can be justifiably called &quot;universal truth&quot; scales the very height of lunacy and hubris.</p>

<p>And in all of this, you don&#39;t even see that you just finished agreeing with the very point I was trying to make, do you?  No.  I know you don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t care how transcendental you find these words to be... They are the basic working components of the universe, that is all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh I don&#39;t disagree.  They indeed ARE working components of the universe.  My point is that neither you nor I nor anyone human on this planet yet knows just WHAT those &quot;components of the universe&quot; really are.  And no.  I&#39;m really sorry to tell you this, but much as you would like to otherwise think, science hasn&#39;t figured it out either.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>lol.  Not only is your great level of close-minded ignorance limited and relegated only to this conception of &quot;heaven&quot; as you call it, it&#39;s actually a quite wonderful and hilarious thing that even in the very vacuous statement that you made here (you continue outdoing yourself in them, by the way), you already admit the very existence <em>OF</em> a soul in the first place.  The moment you acknowledge such existence is the very moment that the entirety of your limited, &quot;physical only&quot; argument falls like the deck of flimsy cards it showed itself to be from the very first sentence you typed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN INCREDIBLE STRETCH in order for your fantasies to be true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, you commit an immediate fallacy by calling them &quot;fantasies&quot; when the fact of the matter is that you&#39;ve shown that you have not the least idea which way is up or down, let alone what is or is not a &quot;fantasy&quot;.  Secondly, <em>you</em> might have to &quot;make an incredible stretch&quot; in order to grasp some of these things, but this is only because of the extremely low and shallow level of your intellectual depth.  It is very erroneous for you to project your inadequacy upon others.  Not everyone is swimming in the kiddy pool of understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus? I don&#39;t know. But Jesus isn&#39;t here. Jesus isn&#39;t saving you from your sins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See?  Look at this right here.  This is actually yet ANOTHER perfect &quot;case in point&quot; example of just how actually stupid and ignorant you are.  You make assumptions that have really nothing to do with how things really are.  What does Jesus have to do with anything here? with anything that I have talked about or brought up?  You are, again, really a child delving into grown up games thinking that you have <em>any</em> idea whatsoever what you&#39;re talking about.  You don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, you don&#39;t even have sins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if someone like you even understands the truth behind this statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem is, we are going way out of our way to defend fantasies, and they aren&#39;t even good fantasies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  <em>YOU</em> are.  I&#39;m not.  I haven&#39;t brought anything like this up.  It&#39;s been, in fact, <em>you</em> who have brought this up.  This is all in YOUR head.  Again, you continue projecting your own inadequacies upon others.  Ultimately, this does a great deal more to show your own failings than anything or anyone else&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are fearful of death, as we all are, you are fearful of your place in the afterlife, which is a complete lie, and so you need something to comfort you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that how you feel?  Are you projecting again?  It certainly seems that way.  You&#39;re talking about things that, again, have nothing to do with what I&#39;ve brought up and you&#39;re assuming you know what you&#39;re talking about.  Heck, you&#39;re assuming that you know that <strong>I&#39;m</strong> talking about…and you most <em>definitely</em> don&#39;t.  You&#39;re not even <em>close</em> to where I&#39;m at with regard to my points.  You make an embarrassment of yourself doing this with all your assumptions, and if you only knew how wrong you are in even what you&#39;re <em>assuming</em> I&#39;m saying or talking about, you&#39;d go hide your head in shame for thinking that you ever had any idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  You&#39;re only getting what you THINK you get - what you&#39;ve projected.  You have no idea whatsoever what the truth of my energy is.  Not even close.  You&#39;re getting <em>zero</em> actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem is, it&#39;s man made and it&#39;s leading you astray.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  It&#39;s actually led YOU astray.  And you want to know why it&#39;s led you astray?  It&#39;s led you astray because it&#39;s gotten you to so completely and entirely assume that you know what I and other people are talking about that you&#39;ve committed arrogantly to an entirely incorrect point…and then, in assuming, you create this completely made up lie in your head that you then project upon others…And then when you &quot;shoot down&quot; another&#39;s viewpoint, you think you&#39;re shooting down the individual&#39;s argument when really in fact all you&#39;re doing is shooting down your own entirely mistaken idea of what they mean and what they&#39;re talking about in the first place.  This is a particularly extreme and virulent variant of a personally-imposed straw man argument where an individual actually <em>unwittingly</em> imposes said fallacy upon THEMSELVES to such an extent that it renders their entire argument null and void to a really embarrassing (albeit humorous) extent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s leading the world astray and it&#39;s tearing us all apart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not what I&#39;m talking about isn&#39;t - only what YOU&#39;RE thinking about in your own, small, tiny little pee-hole sized world of make-believe arguments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your, precious and enlightened, inability to accept reality as the one and only heaven will be the very thing that destroys the greatest gift ever given.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a shame that you have neither a proper grasp of what you&#39;re talking about, nor even sentence punctuation (too many commas there, son) to come to grips with the fact that your simply arguing something that&#39;s not even being talked about or referred to here.  You&#39;re so stuck on what you <em>think</em> you know that you have no idea that you&#39;re talking about a subject that was never even addressed in the first place.</p>

<p>This might be one of the biggest facepalms that I&#39;ve given in a <em>long</em> time.  Good job, son.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop with the insults and actually give me some evidence for your claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stop with the insults?  What? did you get butt-hurt at having to taste some of the very medicine you&#39;ve been haughtily attempting to doll out left and right this whole time?  Seriously?</p>

<p>And before I even begin talking about what I actually mean, you would have to first pull your head out of the dark ass-hole of your hubristic views and understand the basis from which I speak.  I&#39;m <em>very</em> not sure that you have the capability of doing that.  You haven&#39;t shown that you do thus far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your responses 90% follow this &quot;You&#39;re wrong and ignorant!&quot; and then provide me with nothing substantial at all.</p>

<p>The vast majority of your responses come from a foundation of mistaken assumption, thinking you know what it is the other is referring to and then simply running headlong with that incorrect assumption without stopping to think for a moment about how incorrect you might actually be in your foundational line of reasoning.  Based upon this modus operandi which you&#39;ve demonstrably illustrated over and over again here, you&#39;re not merely ignorant, you&#39;re <em>hubristic</em>.  This is much, much worse, and, as a result, it would simply take too much work for me to try to help you through the maze of confusion which is your mind in order to help you understand where I&#39;m coming from.  Perhaps someone else here can help you.  It&#39;s certainly not worth my time.</p>

<p>Peace, and good luck on your journeys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on now.  Are you stalking only so you can check for spelling errors while being entirely ignorant of the message itself?  The misspelling came by virtue of mistaking &quot;vain&quot; for &quot;vein&quot;.  In everything I&#39;ve written, you&#39;re going to choose to focus on that one particular mistake? and for what purpose? to what end?  What does it accomplish?  Does it make you feel better about yourself because you can tacitly make fun of someone for their missing the spelling of &quot;vain&quot;?</p>

<p>And what does this particular grammatical correction accomplish when you yourself have committed even more flagrant ones in every message you&#39;ve sent thus far here?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re chiding lightly or trolling.  Either way, I again appreciate the previous correction and it was notated appropriately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>umm... I didn&#39;t say a word about God. I was talking about religion... and sure your relationship with God is yours and yours alone... but that relationship defines everything that you do. If you think that animals don&#39;t have souls... then why does it matter if we kill them? If you think that the earth is only a temporary place of residency, then why not litter and obliterate ecosystems with our &quot;God given rights&quot; to dominate this place. The point is, these personal beliefs are reflected and echoed throughout everything that you do in life soo... No in fact it isn&#39;t personal. People fly fucking planes into buildings because of their &quot;personal&quot; belief in God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was because the philosophy that Jesus was sharing was destroying the boundaries between people and the establishment at the time didn&#39;t think it was sustainable, at least to their liking, so they decided to make it go away until they discovered that they could just distort the image of Jesus into their own liking. That&#39;s what I think. Case and point, Jesus wasn&#39;t white nor did he have blonde hair or blue eyes. This is a blatant distortion of someone that some people believe naively is the one and only God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have been baptised. I have felt the holy spirit move through my body... I used to even hallucinate during a sleep state and see things that didn&#39;t exist without using any drugs at all. I&#39;ve studied under someone who was a preacher with 3 phds divinity psychology and theology... I&#39;ve cast demons out of people USING LOGIC NOT RELIGION. I have saved peoples lives by exposing them to the unfathomable incomparable beauty of the truth of the universe. This watered down bible bullshit bores me. Jesus&#39;s best work was nothing more than a plagiarism of Pythagoras on an off day. &quot;Do not throw pearls before swine&quot;? That was stolen. Jesus was most likely a guy that was just trying to dissolve the borders he could within his lifetime. He removed the barriers between the gentiles and the Jews... The type of radical that he was then is unacceptable to the establishment that has been running the show for far too long. They have milked this cow for as long as they could get away with it. They took someone who was probably honestly really great and using their ability to warp history into whatever they want made him into something that was used to entrap people rather than liberate them.</p>

<p>Why do you feel the need to push your beliefs onto others in such an abrassive manner?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a book creates a scenario where an apocalypse is necessary for the return of a messiah to occur then this is no longer just something that people can ignore. At that point a gun is being put to my head and my childrens head and I won&#39;t stand for it. Are christians more tame than most? Yes absolutely, but that is only because this brand of religion tends to be more cowardly. You people like to pick and choose your passages and only halfway live up to the book that you so pridefully and blindly believe God penned himself. You have no problem indoctrinating your children and scolding them or even deserting them as a family if they do not follow the same path. You create divides between your own family for nothing more than to feel slightly superior to other people and you and the rest of the religious community should be ashamed of yourself. Ashamed that you are so afraid of what happens after you die that you can&#39;t even see the universe around you. You can&#39;t see that you are already in the pinnacle of what any heaven could ever be. You should be ashamed that GOD hands you the key to eternal life, put&#39;s a crown on your head and says &quot;GO AND CREATE THE HEAVENS&quot; and you are too weak, too scared, to blind to fulfill that dream. You choose to live your life in servitude of a God that is powerless, meaningless, and heartless only to receive rewards of which you don&#39;t even know what they are... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It appears that you haven&#39;t come here with an open mind, and your intention was only to ridicule and belittle those who don&#39;t ascribe to your ideology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Religion deserves ridicule... absolutely. That&#39;s the least I could do to respect the countless souls that have been lost due to it&#39;s web of lies. But no, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m here to do. I was legitimately surprised conspiracy theorists are quite religious. It just seems oxymoronic to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you honestly believe that one can provide tangible proof of something which is rooted in faith? Of course you didn&#39;t, you just get off on this, because you are likely a sociopath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t get off on this... I wish I didn&#39;t have to deal with it at all. Religion is destroying the world wide family. We are all divided by the very thing you hold so much hope and faith in... It creates the problems it pretends it&#39;s fixing. It&#39;s time we grew up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your thesis relies upon the assumption that my faith is based on lies, can you prove that? Can you prove that Jesus Christ was not the son of God, without begging the question eg:there is no God, unless you are able to prove that there is in fact no God?

<p>Do you not realize that had you been born in the Arab world you would be just as dedicated and devout to that religion as you are Christianity? Do you really think God chose you to be born in America so you could fight with the &quot;chosen ones&quot;? All these religions wear a mask of peace and forgiveness but... they also preach that they will be victorious in establishing their kingdom on earth. Of course Jesus was the son of God... but so am I. We all are. That&#39;s what it is to be alive. If you believe that the bible is really God&#39;s word, then you have to seriously learn hebrew so you can learn the bible in it&#39;s original form, you have to know the history of the time so you can define the meaning of words in their context, you have to know when the book was put together, by whom it was put together, for what purposes it was put together, what political pressures there were at the time... etc etc etc. You talk as if you have conviction about christianity but your faith is built on quicksand. God doesn&#39;t require faith, he&#39;s not fooling anyone. The truth is constantly blaring in your face as loud as it can and you simply have to look outside into the sky to see that the sky is blue and the grass is green. God isn&#39;t playing games with anyone...This isn&#39;t some celestial game of hide and go seek. God gave you everything. Take it or leave it... </p>

<p>Studying the basic Trivium is a great start, and there are many online resources which detail the various types of logical fallacies.  It would be wise of you to utilize these sources if you ever plan on engaging in a legitimate debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... I do see it honestly but I can back up anything that I&#39;ve stated so far with very basic facts about the universe that build the perspective from which I am speak from. Unfortunately, that takes more time than I am currently willing to invest, which is my excuse for the fallacies and hyperbole. They work as shortcuts to my points. I guess it didn&#39;t work though haha. Anyways, I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t have a preplanned paragraph just like I didn&#39;t steal any of these ideas from other anti-theists.

<p>I respect your desire for honest discourse. This above all else is key to some sort of unity in the world. I&#39;m sorry if you found my end of the discourse to be &quot;petulant&quot;, it has nothing to do with you personally... </p>
