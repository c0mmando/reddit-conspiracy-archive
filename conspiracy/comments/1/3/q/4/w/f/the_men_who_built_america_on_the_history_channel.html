    <div class="md"><p>I actually think it&#39;s a great show. Very well done and very informative.  </p>

<p>The History Channel certainly does not shy away from showing some of the more negative aspects of these moguls lives.</p>

<p>They go into detail about the Drowning of Johnstown and other debacles.  It really not some propaganda show that only paints these men as gods.  It&#39;s informative and I would say non biased portrayal of these mens lives.  </p>

<p>It might not go into some of the darker chapters that some of these men were accused of, but it absolutely is not some circlejerk of praise.  </p>

<p>And it actually does go into great detail about the middle class people who built and made the industrial revolution really possible.  It talks of the union massacre of Homestead steel factory and the fight between Tesla, Edison and Morgan.  </p>

<p>The fact is these men did invent the middle class as we know it though at a great cost.  These men did increase your great grand parents quality of life, even if their goal was to enslave.  </p>

<p>These men did do some great things for this country and that&#39;s just a fact..</p>

<p>I highly recommend watching it.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Informative yes, and especially about Johnstown being the greatest mass tragedy in America behind 9/11.  But the middle class developing is due more to the years of progressives pushing the issue, until FDR finally went to the titans of industry in the mid-30&#39;s and threatened them.  He said give some things back, like social security, or lose it all to a socialist revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, and the real conspiracy is not a single person from the yacht club who owned the dam,  people such as Carnegie and Frick were ever held accountable.  </p>

<p>Not even a monetary settlement was paid out to any victims families.  Every court case got thrown out.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s the crime, and the History channel made it plain that this did happen and in no way tried to hide it to further a capitalist agenda.   </p>

<p>It why I think the show is actually good and does delve into things people would be pissed about.  It does show that sometimes these men did use power and influence to get away with murder.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who fault is that really?  Mainstream America asked for that.  We want cheap electronics, and cheap food.  We want nice cars and cheap gas. </p>

<p>Listen I personally believe that there are some nefarious agendas by powerful people be enacted all over the world.  </p>

<p>But, what you&#39;re talking about is shit most Americans want.  The majority of us just go along with that because it helps us keep stuff under our x-mas tress.  </p>

<p>The poisoning of water, the killing of countries to exploit resources, the manipulating of wealth and currency to give power to a few, all of these I can see the debate for conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Cheap goods and services are just something Americans want and will do anything to get.  Everyone knows that kids make apple products for $1 a 12 hour day and don&#39;t give a shit either way.  They still buy these products by the millions.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t turn the will of most Americans into a conspiracy it just discredits your ideas.  </p>

<p>If most Americans really felt bad about the shit the buy that knowingly came from salve conditions they could just boycott it.  They don&#39;t, why?  Because that what Americans asked for.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that the cost of human lively hood and liberty is indeed sickening.  And you right in that for the most part it has been hidden from public view but only insofar as frequency.  </p>

<p>There have been 100&#39;s of mainstream media stories about poor working conditions in our favorite companies factories over seas.  </p>

<p>It is not a secret in any way.  Most adults know that Air Jordans are made in sweat factories for 5 bucks a shoe and sold for $200.  That iphones are made in terrible conditions and by children with little to no oversight.  </p>

<p>We justify these abhorrent practices by telling ourselves &quot;well it&#39;s better than where they would work otherwise&quot;.  Or &quot;that&#39;s actually a decent wage for their country&quot;.  </p>

<p>Fact is on a issues such as cheap goods, electronics, textiles and building supplies, to find the ones holding the chains we need to look no further than ourselves.  </p>

<p>Not to say we weren&#39;t conditioned to want these things from a very early age through advertisement and propaganda.  In reality though, we know the human and environmental cost for much of consumer lifestyles.  We just don&#39;t care or feel helpless to stop it, which we are.  </p>

<p>The consumer machine cannot be stopped now by any single person, company or act of philanthropy.  Only a act that can seen as one from God could such a thing be combated.    </p>

<p>My point was just try not confuse the things we a consumers are just as responsible for as any bankster or monopoly owner.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s keep the focus on the big fish, because in truth sometimes it&#39;s us who are the conspirators.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing wrong with capitalism, it is just part of the dialectic.  </p>

<p>The Rockefellers and Carnegies used the system to get wealthy but then used their money to control the government and the education system, which makes them extremely bad people.  They still control that shit to this day with their &quot;charitable foundations&quot;.  </p>

<p>Capitalism is good because it allows upward mobility of your quality of life over time.  In Communism you are stuck at the bottom no matter what(unless you&#39;re in &quot;the party&quot;), same with socialism.  I think people bash capitalism because they are not good at it and don&#39;t understand what saving money means.  Even if it is just a little bit at a time it makes a big difference in your quality of life.  I started saving 20 bucks a week. Now I have a nice cushion and am not scrambling to find money to pay bills and I can go do things I wouldn&#39;t normally be able to do without that savings.  In communism or socialism, that kind of shit is not too possible.  </p>

<p>So don&#39;t bash the system, bash the fucking cheaters.  Bash their fucking heads in, I say.</p>

<p>edit:  on a side note, they are teaching in schools/universities nowadays that &quot;capitalism&quot; is intrinsically evil, using these men as examples.  Ironically enough the foundations that those men started are still funding the education system today.  They say it is &quot;evil&quot; because it adds to &quot;social inequities&quot; and &quot;economic disparity&quot;.  Which are terms heavily used in Agenda 21 that can be &quot;solved&quot; by implementing Agenda 21&#39;s goals, namely curtailing property rights and giving more power to the state.  There are a lot of statists on this subreddit who applaud Agenda 21, I&#39;ve noticed, they have been heavily indoctrinated into this system, by the Rockefeller, Carnegie, Ford(and others!) Foundations who fund the college and public school systems to create this mindset so that their families can retain control over the planet.  Those people who support the goals of Agenda 21, are fucking morons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nicely put.  I think it&#39;s easy for us to sometimes bash our system and accuse those at the top of great misdeeds.  </p>

<p>When really being at the top isn&#39;t a bad thing it&#39;s the fucking cheating, lying, murdering bastards that want nothing more then to rule over the middle and lower income classes by manipulating politics and money to change the system that best suits their interests that create the problems.  </p>

<p>I mean this is why we are all here, not because we hate wealth or capitalism, but to expose and be informed about the ones who would change capitalism, policy and even liberty to our detriment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...All of us [Foundation leaders] that have a hand in the making of policies here have had experience, either with the OSS during the war, or the European Economic Administration after the war - we&#39;ve had experience dealing with directives, and these directives emanated from the White House [...] we still operate under these directives. Would you like to know what the substance of these directives is? [...] Mr. Dodd, we operate under directives, the substance of which is that we shall use our grant making power so to alter life in the United States that it can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union.&quot;</p>

Clearly pro-corporate propaganda, and timed in such a way that people will see these big businesses as a part of American history, instead of being the entities destroying it. So glad you posted this thread, makes me feel a little more same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that it was Andrew Carneige that made the steel the built pretty much every city and the railroads the delivered every good across the country right?  </p>

<p>That it was Rockerfeller that made the combustion engine possible for wide scale use.?</p>

<p>That it was JP Morgan and Edison that brought electricity into every home?  </p>

<p>Yes, corporations do some really bad shit and a lot of people who run them should be in jail for the rest of their lives.  But to ignore history and to not see how the American infrastructure was built due to some obscure sense of entitlement is really just doing yourself a disservice.   </p>

<p>Be informed and then you can more readily fight and inform against tyranny.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well yes, of course, it is because they aren&#39;t capitalists, they are monopoly men.   Remember, old man Rockefeller said &quot;Competition is a sin&quot;.

So all of you retards who think that capitalism is the &quot;evil&quot; in this situation are severely misinformed of who the capitalists are and who the monopolists are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who fault is that really?  Mainstream America asked for that.  We want cheap electronics, and cheap food.  We want nice cars and cheap gas. </p>

<p>Listen I personally believe that there are some nefarious agendas by powerful people be enacted all over the world.  </p>

<p>But, what you&#39;re talking about is shit most Americans want.  The majority of us just go along with that because it helps us keep stuff under our x-mas tress.  </p>

<p>The poisoning of water, the killing of countries to exploit resources, the manipulating of wealth and currency to give power to a few, all of these I can see the debate for conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Cheap goods and services are just something Americans want and will do anything to get.  Everyone knows that kids make apple products for $1 a 12 hour day and don&#39;t give a shit either way.  They still buy these products by the millions.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t turn the will of most Americans into a conspiracy it just discredits your ideas.  </p>

<p>If most Americans really felt bad about the shit the buy that knowingly came from salve conditions they could just boycott it.  They don&#39;t, why?  Because that what Americans asked for.   </p>
