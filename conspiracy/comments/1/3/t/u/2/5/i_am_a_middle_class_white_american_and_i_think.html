       I am a white middle class Canadian and I agree with this message, but I want to add something...  I think western society is filled with money hungry, ruthless, evil men who control far too many facets of industry, politics, and law...  That is all.

       Canada isn't exactly the Winter Wonderland everyone thinks it is, apparently.  You pollute by burning fossil fuels in great abundance, you strip the land of resources and you are turning Tea Party more and more every year, ever since GW.  Quebec is your Texas.

       I totally agree.  We're becoming extremely conservative.  And yea us stripping the land thing, we do that but we do have an abundance of land and a relatively stable population.

       There's nothing wrong with having the Israeli state. The problems occur because of the "elite" running Israel. Plus, the founding of Israel was quite sketchy. We can't be so brash and thoughtless in our thought and message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, just to clear things up before they're questioned:
I don't support Israel and its continued one-sided assault of its neighbors. 
I just think that if we're going to actually improve everyone's quality of life, hostility and anger is not the way.

       I didn't mean to deflect, what I'm saying is, we as Americans are as guilty as somebody born in Israel after 1948. Somebody born in Israel in 1991 for example he's as much right to land as an American born the same year. Kids can't be blamed for the actions of their relatives/ancestors

       After having the Israel/Palestine argument with my uber-Christian step brother, this realization hit me.  We are as big of douchebags as Israel, only our fighting with the Indians didn't involve the possibility of nuclear bombs, and Iran wasn't stirring the pot.

       The average Israeli wasn't even born when the state of Israel was established...
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't give a straight answer though. What should happen to the the millions of Israeli born and raised in Israel past 1948? I mean if you seriously think the state should be "erased" then surely you've thought of what would happen to its people right? If you're talking large scale genocide you should say it instead of dodging the question. If you have a different solution I'd be interested to here it.

       Well just like tttt0tttt you didn't actually answer the question. Just went along the lines of "They'll get whats coming". But what does that mean? Most of the population wasn't even alive when Israel was created.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US only gives about 3 billion worth of aid to the Israel which is not that much when you consider Israels GDP is over 240 billion. Russia and China don't care about the situation at all. They just tend lean towards the Palestinian side because there are 56 Muslim countries in the world who they don't want to piss off. Also, I'm not sure why you and others are obsessed with Ashkenazi Jews. Half of the Israeli population is of Mizrahi decesnt (which is Arab). If you're saying that you want or you believe in genocide against the Israeli population why don't you just say so? If not what do you think should happen to the majority of the Israelis if the state is erased?

       The link about those polling towards an apartheid state is inaccurate. It was reported by Haaretz originally but they issued a

       . Most Israelis are against annexing the West Bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original plan was rejected by the Palestinian and Arab states and they decided to attack the newly founded state of Israel costing many Israeli lives. Why on earth would Israel go back to 1948? The majority of the people who were directly affected aren't even alive anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still didn't address what should happen to the majority of Israelis if Israel is "erased"? If you think the state should be erased, than what should happen to the people living there? At this point the Israeli born there are natives and those born outside the state are foreigners.

       First off... I've never once mentioned "erased".  Nobody... Palestinian, Israeli, Bangladeshi, San Franciscan... etc... should ever be "erased" as you put it.  BUT.. if there was a UN resolution that founded the State of Israel, then that's what should've been adhered to, in the first place, regardless of who attacked who
       <em>
        first
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And, you're right... the majority of the people who were directly affected aren't alive anymore... so why should this be such of a shock?  I'm totally agreeing with you that folks born
       <strong>
        anywhere
       </strong>
       are natives of the land that they are born in.  And, there is still a lot of area that could be given back to Palestine.  I think we spend too much time talking about t"why things wouldn't work", instead of coming up with ways and means that would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would that mean that some of the current Israeli's folk have to give up their land (in a sense, give it
       <em>
        back
       </em>
       )?  Probably.  Is that the specific resident's fault... or the fault of their leadership, telling them that they have the rights to land that they, technically, don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of Native Americans (along this thread), the Sioux Nation is going through the same thing with the U.S. Government, right now, over the Black Hills.  I, personally, would love to see them get their land back.  But, the Sioux look at the land as, "It wasn't the Government's land to give away, in the first place."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's kinda what's been happening in to the Palestinian land for the last 70 some-odd years.  Is the responsibility of the average, everyday Israeli citizen?  No.  Did the government take land and
       <em>
        give
       </em>
       it to the citizens?  Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's where my original "karma" comment comes back into play.  No, it's not the fault of the average Israeli citizen, but they may end up a little butt-hurt and displaced because of the actions of the government.  Just the same way Hamas/Fatah/Hezbollah are not a representation of every Palestinian.  But hey... whatever.  The US and Israel stood up Hamas.  So.. technically, Israel is just as bad as the US when it comes to "creating terrorists to fight".

       First, I think it's pretty obvious that no one in this thread is advocating genocide against the Israeli population.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be implying that all Israeli Jews would be killed if the Israeli State ceased to exist as it currently does.  This assumption is pretty weak in my eyes, especially when most of the anger towards Israel in the region stems from Israel's continued refusal to let Palestinians govern themselves in their own State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, extremists will most likely always want all Jews pushed into the Mediterranean, but I'd like to think that moderates in Palestine &amp; surrounding Muslim nations would no longer support groups like Hamas &amp; Hezbollah if they were given their own State based on the condition that rocket attacks &amp; other attempts against Israel's sovereignty must stop altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this were to occur, Muslim moderates would at least have something to lose instead of the status quo that sees more settlements going up by the day...

       Its not obvious at all. If it was people would straight up say what should happen to the Isreali population. Instead the other commenters are being vague and saying Israel should be "erased"  and they'll get whats coming to them or they'll be treated like native Americans. Not one person has said anything about Israel "ceasing to exist as it currently does" either. Even you have not answered my question, you just danced around it. What should happen to the Israeli population if the state was "erased"? Unless you're suggested a two state solution, are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       While it would be nice to have a two state solution, their is no guarantee that Hamas or other groups is going to stop targeting Israel. What makes things especially difficult is you have countries like Iran that completely reject a two state solution and wants ALL of Israel to be Islamic Palestine. Here is the Supreme Leader himself
       <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/10/201110222010936488.html">
        saying it.

       Iran will be there waiting to fund and train groups to attack Israel even if it does go for a two state solution.

      <p>
       In what way did I dance around what you were asking?  I thought it was clear from my comment that I support a two-state solution, preferably one based loosely on the 67' borders with mutually agreed upon land swaps and East Jerusalem as the capitol of Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I see the situation right now, moderate Muslims shouldn't be expected to stand up to the violent tactics that Hamas and other groups are using against Israeli civilians.  First, think of the dangers of questioning leaders during wartime (remember when Bush said Americans were either with or against him).  Muslims in the region have grown up watching Israel relentlessly attack and invade surrounding lands (mix between self-defense and pushes to reclaim territories for a "security buffer"), and given the disproportionate amount of Muslim civilians that Israel has killed over the last few decades, who can honestly blame moderate Muslims for keeping quiet while barbarians in Hamas &amp; other militant groups launch rockets indiscriminately.
      </p>
      <p>
       The logical way forward would be for Israel to provide moderate Muslims with a reason to stand up to extremist groups who are hell bent on Israel's destruction.  With a Palestinian state established, moderates would risk losing their statehood if attacks continued, and Israel would be justified (in my opinion) to reoccupy Palestine in the events that attacks continued after statehood is granted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The status quo features Israel failing to provide any concessions to moderate Muslims as illegal settlements continue to expand.  Part of me thinks that the Likud party is simply hell-bent on reclaiming all of Palestine and "dealing" with the Palestinian "problem" the same way they have been since 1948.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moderate Palestinians need to be given some skin in the game.  They need their own state, as well as clear instructions that they're on a short leash in regards to allowing/failing to thwart rocket attacks on Israeli civilians.

       which wouldn't have happened if certain countries had not tried to defeat the occupiers.. but they didn''t.  a good number of refugees ended up in the captured territory.  some was given back.

       The word antisemetic gets used whenever someone criticizes Israel. I heard the question, "what is the word for anti Palestinian?" it really makes you think about how blindly we just ate the garbage from state sponsored news corporations like msnbc, fox and CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for fun I like to listen to people like wolf blitzer or Chris Matthews describe the situation in Israel, or the new hot topic of Congo and hear all the colorful and delightful ways they describe genocide and resource theft. It would be hilarious if it wasn't the source of actual news for many americans.

       I've seen co-existance of Muslims and Jews, before.  Go to a college in the US, or travel overseas, some.  It's not like it's too "far fetched" of an idea.  But, a lot of the temperament is determined by whoever is stirring the propaganda pot.  The only people who
       <em>
        say

       "Muslims and Jews just can't get along" are the ones who

       Why do you think Israel is stealing their land?
      </p>
      <p>
       1.Jews entered "Israel" in 1312 B.C.E., two thousand years before the rise of Islam.
2.Arab refugees began identifying themselves as part of a Palestinian people in 1967, two decades after the establishment of the modern State of Israel.
3.Since the Jewish conquest in 1272 B.C.E, the Jews had dominion over the land for one thousand years with a continuous presence in the land for the past 3,300 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.The only Arab domination since the conquest in 635 C.E. lasted no more than 22 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.For over 3,300 years, Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       6.King David founded the city of Jerusalem. Mohammed never came to Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Arabs didn't want the land in 1947 that was offered to them under UN resolution 181.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then on the same day the UN handed the Jews their portion of the land, and after Britain packed up leaving nobody claiming what was supposed to be the Arab portion of the land, the Arab states decided it was smarter to send in troops to secure land and Israel's land instead of peacefully accepting their land. Brilliant fucking decision.

So please tell me one lie I said. please.  as far as "murdering children" which has the connotation of purposefulness. No. I'd say its "killing children" accidentally. shit fucking happens in war. always has, and always will. both sides get fucked up the ass.

       The historical references you're using to justify the appropriation of land in the 20th Century comes from ancient Hebrew mythology, not from actual history. King David most likely never existed and was probably a fictional character. Using the Bible to justify anything of the sort is like me walking into my neighbor's house, forcibly kicking him and his family out and using a popular novel to justify why I did so when he eventually calls the police.

       No the things he referenced are historical fact and are proven and recited by countless sources of the time, so not just the "novel".  Hes not talking about angels or god, hes talking about real historical figures.  And no, i am not anti-atheist, but what you are saying is wrong.

       This is the problem though. Israelis use their bible (myth) to justify their human rights violations inflicted on the Palestinians. In effect, Israelis exist in a time bubble while the rest of the world wishes  to have a conversation with them in real-time.

       The Bible is pretty accurate from a basic history perspective. Sure its not a literal recording, but the general information around cities and civilizations has been proven through science. I'm not talking about burning bushes or seas parting.

       Ashkenazi Jews have the same tribal affiliations as all other Jewish communities - Israel, Levi (Kohen), and Judah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your claim that Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of the Khazars, however, has been completely debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "theory" that Ashkenazi Jews descended from the Khazars originated with various anti-semitic/white and Christian supremacy groups/racial theorists/and Arab groups wishing to distance modern Jews from Israel. Although, there is evidence that the existing European Jewish population did absorb some Jewish Khazars, the claim of the Khazars being the origin of European Jewry has never been accepted by credible scholars for various reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       Khazarian history: the accepted theory is that at most, the Royal and and ruling classes converted to Judaism for mainly political reasons. There is no real evidence to support the whole population converted to Judaism. Furthermore, the majority of these converts to Judaism went on to convert to Christianity and Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jewish migration in history: what many people don't know is that a percentage of Jews who consider themselves Ashkenazi were Sephardi and didn't enter Europe until the Spanish expulsion. This can be seen through Jewish family names that are Spanish/Portugese/Italian/Sicilian in origin. (example: Margolis and Shapiro)
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, the nail in the coffin: Genetic research: all current genetic research supports that Ashkenazi Jews are virtually indistinguishable from other Jewish groups (Sephardi/Mizrachi) and in turn, other Middle Eastern groups with little genetic input from Europeans. DNA research amongst Ashkenazi Jews shows a significant female founder ancestry originating in the Middle East, with about 40% of the current Ashkenazi population descending matrilinially from just 4 women dating to the first and second centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to the origin of the name 'Ashkenazi' for European Jews is that Ashkenaz was the ancient Jewish name for Germany just as Sepharad was the ancient Jewish name for Spain hence 'Sephardi' Jews.

       To do DNA testing, there must be material to test against.  You can't test people that are alive and claim they match genetically to people over 2000 years ago if you have nothing to match against.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen any genetic research that shows that Khazarian "jews" are descendents of ancient Israel.  I've read articles that say they've found a link, but I've read many more that say there is no link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless---if no one can produce a deed showing that Palestine is owned by eastern european "jews", then I'm not willing to believe the land belongs to eastern european "jews".

       yes?  what's your point? it says, in support of my original statement:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Ashkenazi Jews, whose genetic profiles indicated between 30% to 60% admixture with Europeans, nevertheless clustered more closely with Middle Eastern and Sephardic Jews, a finding the researchers say is inconsistent with the Khazar hypothesis. "I would hope that these observations would put the idea that Jewishness is just a cultural construct to rest," Ostrer says."

       Problem is, however, that this particular idea on your part - "I don't support Israel and its continued assault on its neighbors. That is the part I do not support. The continued assault." - is absolutely incompatible with your original statement - "There's nothing wrong with having the Israeli state."  This is because there, in fact, IS something VERY much wrong with having an Israeli state if and when the existence of that state was borne out of deceit and is perpetuated through violence, racism, and murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technically, even if Israel wasn't the hateful, cowardly, world-raping, two faced nation that it is, and it was actually a wonderfully just, kind, and benign land, it STILL wouldn't be justified in having the land that it currently has, since that land was stolen for it by England

       Well, sir, thank you at least for openly stating such and admitting that much.

       Dressing up hostility in the wool of civility makes the wolfish gnashing no less predatory.

       That pretense is what allows such acts to persist. Killing someone by economic strangulation leave them no less dead. It is easy to claim your hand did not trigger the trap, but it is your hand that helped construct it.

       It's such a stupid simple analogy, it's amazing the world can't correlate: I hate robbery. the guy who robbed me at gunpoint years back was black. That has nothing to do/no bearing on my feelings towards black people.

       Excellent analogy. Because Jews have been horribly oppressed historically the Jews living in Israel (90% of them) have bullied the world into agreeing to allow THEM to oppress their neighbors even after they robbed them of their land.

       I don't understand what your problem was with my comment about the same poll that you just sent me. I said the same thing. Over 90% of Israelis approved of the slaughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Hamas did send rockets over to the south. The burning question is WHY.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media have cruelly not reported on Israeli PROVOCATION which immediately PRECEDED the rocket response by Hamas. Israel's media is so controlled that its citizens don't even know what IOF is doing to provoke the Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The everyday Israeli is carefully led to believe that Hamas's rocket attacks occur in a vacuum. Such fools.

       Firing rockets to israel is the israeli citizens' doing?   I see now, by sending their provocation, it forced palestinians against their will to acquire rockets, aim and fire them into israel.   it's not their fault.  they were provoked.

       Yes, "massacre" was MY term for this so-called war of the 4th largest military in the world turning all its might against a tiny little nation with NO army, NO navy and NO air force and NOTHING to fight with except large firecrackers. I pray to no god but if I did I would pray that people like you would throw your effing tv's out the window and stop listening to our government's spin on what is going on in the land of the bible. Are you really so ignorant that you can't grasp the concept that the US and Israel are framing this conflict in the media in such a way as to lead us all to the conclusion that "Israel is the victim and the Gazans are spawn of the devil?" Let's try an experiment: let's try framing the conflict in a slightly different light. Humor me, please.

       firstly, I got rid of the tv years ago.  please don't assume I don't read both sides of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation is a tragedy for sure - but I think Israeli people want a peaceful resolution and security at the same time.  I can understand why they would support stopping the rockets raining down, as I can understand the frustration and anger of gazans.   it's a tragedy all round.  I don't think there are many israeli people that would vote to 'massacre' people that weren't firing rockets at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       from a Gazan point of view, if my frustration and anger is so great that I must suicide bomb, or fire rockets into schools, then I have lost as a person.  I have given into the enemy.   Better I forgive them and kill them with kindness.

       I am happy that you can at least look at both sides. Now, would you please read the article I just sent you, paying particular attention to the author's statement saying essentially that any time the world hears of Hamas rockets falling in southern Israel, IT'S ALWAYS IN RESPONSE TO AN ACT OR ACTS OF AGGRESSION BY ISRAEL. For the record, it's only Christians who have a tradition of "turning the other cheek". Jews don't do it because that is a New Testament concept and Muslims sure as hell don't do it either. You must admit it goes against human/animal nature.

       This has been going on for ages.. it must be obvious to those retaliating that they will incur only more wrath from the mighty israeli forces.

       I don't however see clearly what you mean by aggression by the israeli people, at least in the sense of unprovoked or unwarranted actions.  can you give me an example??  Have israelis been blowing themselves up and taking out civilians out in busy restaurants nightclubs, shoppng centers and buses in Gaza for example?

       1- Israeli Military Escalation in the Gaza Strip

       At approximately 08:00, IOF moved nearly 300 meters into the east of al-Qarara village, northeast of Khan Yunis. They leveled areas of Palestinian land amidst indiscriminate shooting. A few hours later, they moved southwards to ‘Abassan village. They opened fire indiscriminately and leveled areas of Palestinian land. An Israeli helicopter gunship also opened fire at the area. At approximately 16:30, as a result of the indiscriminate shooting by IOF military vehicles, 13-year-old Ahmed Younis Khader Abu Daqqa was seriously wounded by a bullet to the abdomen. At the time he was shot, Ahmed had been playing football with his friends in front of his family’s house, located nearly 1,500 meters away from the area where the IOF were present. He was evacuated to the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Yunis, but he was pronounced dead 15 minutes later. IOF remained in the area until 00:30 on the following day. In his testimony to PCHR, Mohammed Tariq Abu Daqqa, 14, stated:
      </p>
      <p>
       “On Thursday evening, 08 November 2012, my friend, Ahmed Abu Daqqa, invited me to play football, which he liked so much. We began to play football in front of his house together with Khaled ‘Ali Abu Daqqa, Shadi Akram Abu Daqqa and Fares Hassan Qudaih. Ahmed was wearing sports clothes and he played as a goalkeeper. We knew that there was an Israeli incursion in the area and we heard sporadic shooting. We thought that we were safe because we were relatively far from the affected area. However, at approximately 16:30, I saw a bullet hitting the door of Ahmed’s house. I soon saw Ahmed falling onto the ground. He then stood up putting his hands on his abdomen and screaming. He moved into his house. The children who were playing with us escaped. I called Ahmed’s brother and told him that Ahmed was wounded. Soon after, Ahmed’s brother carried him out of the house and asked me to call an ambulance. I immediately went to a nearly grocery shop and asked its owner to call an ambulance and he did. Ahmed was then transported by a civilian car to the hospital. I learnt later that he died. Before he was wounded, he had asked me to photograph him wearing the uniform of Real Madrid, of which he was a fan.”
      </p>
      <p>
       There's much more. Women, children... just murdered on these routine incursions.  The straw that broke the camel's back was the setup and subsequent assassination of the Gaza equivalent of Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak - Hamas Commander Ahmed Jabari.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine the fury Israelis would unleash if Hamas had assassinated Ehud Barak? Well, there you have it. Jabari was taken out and Hamas was enraged - to say nothing about their fury at the dozen or so children murdered during this particular week.

       Israelis have been tried and sentenced for some incidents - it's unclear what are war crimes but it doesn't seem to be a campaign against civilians from my perspective. It certainly doesn't justify committing war crimes of your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ahmed Jabari was taken out in a vehicle with no civilian casualties.  In contrast I believe Ehud Barak would have been blown up in a schoolyard full of children without a second thought if the opportunity was there.  Firing rockets isn't helping at all.  Anyway peace.

       Someone in this forum said it a few months ago and it makes sense. 
Look at what happened to the Native Americans - they were labeled as savages (terrorists) and slaughtered. This shit has been going on since before recorded history only there was no interwebs before for everyone to
bitch about it. 
 I'm not sure how to change it or if we even can but we should try.

       The words terror and terrorist is a form of terrorism in itself because it implies that there's a chance they want to kill us because of our lifestyle... So basically everyone is a terrorist either for POSSIBLY wanting us dead or for using the word and installing fear into us all. It's a vicious circle jerk of fear and it needs to stop

       I'm more or less in the same boat as you are.  As a libertarian I don't really feel my tax dollars should aid other countries anyway, that's what private foundations are for.  Regardless they definitely shouldn't contribute to terrorism, and that's exactly what Israel is committing.

       Bad news for you, FuckCorporateTools. Your tax dollars goes to support Israel, voted for by your Congressmen, who get money from lobbyists, who are employed by, you guessed it, corporations. Many of the Corporations are controlled by Jews, the populace get their information from Corporate news which is largely controlled by Jews, they are educated in schools which are largely staffed by Jews, are controlled by a government that, at its highest levels, has a large proportion of Jews. Finally, the Corporations are all controlled by banks which are controlled by the Fed, which is a private Corporation, which is largely controlled by, you guessed it, Jews.

       Yes, but they are forced to support Israel regardless of their beliefs through the mechanism of taxes. If they do not pay their taxes because of their beliefs, they are made into criminals.

       Further, many Jews have Jewish friends and relatives who support Zionism and Israel. Indirectly, in varying degrees these people support people who support Zion.

       They are smart, hard-working, funny, and most importantly they help each other out. One Jew gets a job as a teacher and now he is in a position to write letters of recommendation for students. He knows little David from the Temple that he goes to every week. He does not know little Johnny who goes to Church. He gives the heads up to David's parents that their kid needs to study harder if he wants to get into a good private school, maybe he tutors the kid on the weekends for extra money. When the time comes for college applications, he can easily write a good letter for David because he knows him so well. David does much better on the SATs because he has been tutored for years. Johnny gets a good letter too, but not as good as David's. Johnny does good on the SATs, but not as good as David. David goes to a good competative school where he has to work hard. Johnny ends up at a second rank school where he can kinda float on by while drinking beer. Guess who ends up with the good job paying the big bucks which further allows him to pay for extra help for his own son when the time comes?

       Jeez, there is a lot of stuff on the net about history and politics. I suppose I could retype it here for you, or copypasta it but you can google it if you are interested in knowing something more like the truth. Both History and Politics are large complex topics which are difficult to reduce to a thread post...
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of this stuff is not even intentional, as I tried to show in my stupid little story. Other times, it is. It is the "Is it good for the Jews?" mentality. All imigrannt groups have this problem to an extent in the US. The Italians, the Irish, the Germans, the Greeks all had to try to make it and make things better for themselves. For more recent groups it is the same. But the Jews have their "We are God's chosen people" problem. Their non-Jews = non-human problem. I mean, we can go on and on about the history of the Jews, but just Google and read or buy/borrow some books and read.

       False. Most corporations in the United States are not controlled by Jews. Unless you're thinking exclusively of Hollywood movie studios. I can also assure you that the highest echelons of the US Federal Government does not have "a large proportion of Jews."

       Thank you for your comment 'middle class white American'...Israel IS a terrorist state. In fact, it is the biggest terrorist organization on Earth.  I think more and more people are starting to realize that zionism is not Judaism, but is in fact a maniacal, sociopathic movement that is intent on ethnically cleansing the Palestinians from their native land of Palestine.  Israel's biggest supporter, in every sense of the word, is the US gov't.  While our national debt (as of today) is at $16,319,856,395,387.22, the US continues to give away over $20 billion to Israel ($3 billion in direct aid, up to $17 billion in indirect aid, and God only knows how much is given away in 'hidden aid').  The overall cost to and impact on the US is actually in the trillions! [Source: all around you, just wake up!]

       I called my congressman today about not making any cuts to social safety net programs in this horrible economy. I suggested that we keep most of the $3 billion we give to Israel every year after what they did two weeks ago. I also suggested that Congress take a pay cut.  I was met with a long silence.

       I agree with you. What is funny is, I feel the same way about China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now a person can criticize China like that, and no one bats an eye. But Israel! oh noes! You just committed a racist crime! Just look at the programmed responses you got from a few people here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, China doesnt bother me as much as Israel - even though, objectively they are as bad if not worse than Israel - probably because Im not relentlessly pounded by a media that is obsessed with viciously attacking any criticism at all of Israel while glossing over their atrocities. Hey, I wonder how long into December we'll get before we get the regular mainstream media monthly WWII stories reminding us how bad we should feel for Israel right before they start bombing someone again? You know, some heartwarming tale about some Jews who barely escaped... seriously, start paying attention and counting them, these WWII/Nazi/Jew stories come out like clockwork.
      </p>
      <p>
       China and Israel are both horrible human rights abusing blights on humanity - but at least China doesnt relentlessly keep trying to play the role of victim, and have a massive PR machine assaulting me with endless bullshit propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, ok, maybe they do, but at least its not in English so it doesnt bother me.

       Speaking of reinforcement, did you know that the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors are getting tattooed with their grandparents prison number on their arm? It is like they can not let it go. They are no longer being attacked so they have to attack themselves to prove how put upon they are.

       To understand Native American's better, do you just look into the history books written by those who exterminated them?  Do you look into Catholic texts to understand Protestants?  For any stance, you should look at multiple sides, not just one, to gain a better understanding of the topic.

      <p>
       There is a sizable portion of the world which are against Zionists.  Israel's own actions make you question their motives (Israel condemns Iran for their nuclear energy development efforts, yet Israel is the only state in the middle east with undeclared nuclear weapons).  Israel start's conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and uses weapons which are considered inhumane.  Hell the US has to pay Egypt to just get along with Israel.

       If Israel is a democracy, it is the only democracy which is representative of the Jewish people.  Does Israel represent the Jewish religion?  Should their actions be judged against the followers of Judaism worldwide?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that Israel's actions are not that of the Jewish people, but of Zionists.  While I don't think Israel's actions represent the desires of the followers of the Jewish religion, I do think that they negatively effect people's views of Judaism.

       No that would be an informed decision.  That would also be the same decision that holodomer is trying to reach on his own without being influenced by "education".
If you then ran around telling people NOT to read something because it is bias then your attempts would be to censor knowledge.
Prime example is that Mein Kampf is still in print by the ADL.  If you pick up the book at a store it will have a preface by Abe Foxman.  It explains the books historical significance and bias.

       I agree. It just seems ttt0ttt is trying to say there is no anti-semitism in literature but rather that it is genuine criticism that is labelled anti-semitic because Jews don't like it. I am just trying to make a point that some people conduct research and write books embedded with Anti-semitism form the get go.

       I think the reality is the ones who appear anti jew are actually anti zionists. Atleast those of us that want the insanity to stop. Really religious people who fear and respect god want to follow his tenants. Not be murderous thugs. And those that want to be the murderous thugs should get all that Karma can muster.

       Yes so far.  So far it is talking about how Jews pretty much stick together and dominate any industry they are in.  If their are laws in place, then they find another way to excel.  Jews, it seems, are very very business savvy (pretty much inventing international business, as well as funding the Columbus Expedition).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone owning all of the press can control the public opinion of the people.  Owning the banks, you can determine if that country will be able to go to war, or will be stuck in economy crippling austerity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be some truth to this, since every major city in the US has holocaust monuments.  There are laws which make denying the holocaust illegal.  Yet we don't memorialize any of the other genocides.  If the Jewish Genocide was so horrible, we should think every other genocide is equally horrible.  But the world doesn't work that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust is cherished and forced down our throats, so that the Zionist's in power stay in power.  The first time I saw the Israeli President wear a star of david patch made it so clear to me.  Here he is, wearing something that everyone associates with the holocaust, on his damn suit.  Talk about manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There never were any gas chambers.  The Holocaust is fabricated to convince the world at the time that the Jews deserve their own place.

       Zionism has to be acknowledged as a Fascist-Racist ideology and banned from being displayed in Western Nations. Force the Jewish populations to choose who they want to be: Patriots or Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am Jewish and I am telling everybody straight forward. A national Petition must be started to ban the teaching of the Zionist ideology. It has nothing to do with Judaism so it is not "Anti-Semitic". Judaism is a 5700 year old religion. Zionism a 60 year old Fascist/Racist Ideology.

       Its YOUR government supporting Israeli Zionists. And although I hate them and what they are doing to its neighboring countries in the middle east and basically being America's lap dog; I love the jewish people of Israel.

       You have to realise, as do most, it's not Israel itself but rather the Zionists that currently occupy it. There is a clash between Zionists and the Jewish, who are respectively good people in comparison to the Zionists that has ties with the US.

       Isrealian here! I think what you are saying is more fear becuse you don't know! The meadia is lying if you follow a real source you maybe woud have think again. The people in south Israel is living in bomb shelters and gaza sent over 1500 rockets untill Israel awnsered to kill themat leader, then it "started@" i saw pics of men in Gaza protending being hurt and 2 mins later walk fine. I am not mad for calling Israel a terrorist country ( offended though) but I hope you maybe coud check your facts firts.

       The news media has cruelly not reported on Israeli PROVOCATION which immediately PRECEDED the rocket response by Hamas. Israel's media is so controlled that its citizens don't even know what IOF is doing to the Palestinians. The everyday Israeli is carefully led to believe that Hamas's rocket attacks occur in a vacuum. Such fools.

       AMEN!!!  Can any Christian honestly say they see "Jesus" in the way we (and yes "we" since there would not even be a Israel with out the billions we (America) keep pouring to that country.  billions used to oppress the Palestinian people.  Is it just the odd combo of religion once again screwing with out foreign policy.  the Christian of this nation mostly care about only one thing and that is setting up the perfect conditions for the second coming of Christ.  It should also be noted that their interruption of the events that lay that foundation are well.... let's say open to dispute as is almost everything in the Bible itself.  Example the Jews as a group rejected the teaching of Christ which too many makes them no longer God's chosen people, but rather now the chosen are those that profess a belief in Him.  So the reason your local little (or mega) church down the street thinks that Israel is SO important is that THEY are not going to see HEAVEN until Israel has it's GODLY war.  Then they all "serve their purpose" and bring on the second coming of Christ.  So do we act on the words of Christ and live as He told us too, or are we the selfish ego driven fallen nature sinful riddle monsters we say we are against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really what would Jesus say or do when it come to the decisions we are currently facing.  More &amp; more tax cuts for the rich, cause 14% is just high for the super rich.  make the poor work until they are 70 and eat dog food if they can afford it... that's what Jesus wants?
      </p>
      <p>
       what about this ALL FOREIGN AID from this day forward is given in food and water project only.  A complete and total cut off of ALL military spending in for other nation. give food and water not bullets.
      </p>
      <p>
       yeah I know it will never happen because the people of this country no longer have any say in how our nation treats the rest of the world much less here at home.  we have become a corporate state that serves only the rich.  anything else... not so much.
      </p>

       now for the joke of the day.  "Obama is going to fix that with his hope and change by creating the most open government in the history of this nation

       Tax dollars are not a direct line to each cause the US supports financially.  rather, you pay taxes because you live in this country as an investment into its future.  There is no problem there.  However, you vote people into seats in government who share your views and thus represent you and your opinion.  They in turn help with the distribution and use of the US income, the tax dollars and other.  If you dont like it then you can either run for office, or get a friend of yours to run for office and vote for them and help them campaign, so your views can be better represented in the government.  That is how you make change, but until then you still must pay a tax to recieve the benefits of living in this great land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, believe it or not, the basic ideals of US government and politics is still very revolutionary, its just the people that make up the government that can be questionable.

       What makes you think the Palestinian people are right? As I understand it and according to every historic source I can find, the Israelis came from Canaan or as we now call it Israel... Are you just have to wonder if you have any idea what you're talking about when you post this kind of inflammatory racism on here. How about instead you go do some reading and see that the Israelis tried to be peaceful about all of this and the Palestinians decided that wasn't good enough. I mean you're basically siding with terrorists since we all damn well know that if the Palestinians got the Israelis land like they want, it would just be a shipping lane for Iran to send them more missiles.

       I'm sorry I think I'm done with this subreddit since its been taken over by ill informed racists lately... I'm not happy about sending any foreign aid out of the US, but I'm even more unhappy when stupid people support terror is the name of their poor education.

       I'm an American taxpayer as well. Notice, I didn't mention any other non-essential descriptions of myself. I agree that I don't want other countries, that have not even a fart's quaff about my needs as a human being, having anything to do with the money from my paychecks. But every year our country gives aide to countries around the world that don't share the same values as my own; I'm a woman by the way. Not to mention all the social programs within our own country that I have to fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Israel and Palestine fighting over the same patch of land just doesn't get me all riled up, and I honestly can't understand why other taxpayers are worried so much about backing an ally over an ungoverned region of violent "farmers".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more worried about getting welfare babies off my tax paying tits so that I can fund my own family.

       I intend to teach my children to work hard, focus, and save. Too many people that live off the government aren't doing it for survival; they're doing it because it's easier than working and being financially responsible. I can think of three examples off the top of my head of people like this, that I know personally. I have no issue with funding education, which is known to reduce crime and poverty. I have no issue with directing the funds that do go to welfare or medicaid to more closely monitor those receiving the benefits. I have no issue with my tax money actually going to people just trying to get back on their feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greece is a prime example of when money being doled out by social programs outweighs the money being contributed by working people.

       Here is a list of rocket attacks that were fired on Israel in 2012. Click on the rest of the years on the right hand side for more years. Randomly firing rockets at a country is most certainly an act of  terrorism. trying to get rid of the individuals responsible for those rocket attacks is not terrorism by definition.

       Except the 'collateral' damage of civilian death is unforgivable. Israel is almost done building their Iron dome (which is the only thing the states should be supporting) so now Hamas rocket strikes are pretty much useless. If Israel stops bombing in return Hamas can't retaliate as they have nothing current to retaliate too making and further strikes by Hamas inexcusable as now they don't have a reason to fire back (not counting the years of oppression and slaughter)

       The news media has cruelly not reported on Israeli PROVOCATION which immediately PRECEDED the rocket response by Hamas. Israel's media is so controlled that its citizens don't even know what IOF is doing to the Palestinians. The everyday Israeli is carefully led to believe that Hamas's rocket attacks occur in a vacuum. Such fools.

       The media never mentions, either, how Israel basically "set up" Hamas.  They figured that Hamas would be better than dealing with Yasser Arafat.  Hell, even the USA stepped in and said, "You need democratic elections in Gaza, because
       <em>
        we know best
       </em>
       !".  Who did Gazan's elect?  Hamas.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. the underlying theme, here, is that both the US and Israel helped give "substance" to Hamas... just to later point the guns right back at them.

       Well, i need to attach a disclaimer to your statement that Israel and the US set up Hamas: our GOVERNMENTS did this, not the citizens of either country. See article link in my previous comment - the one regarding the "absolute right to resist".

       Yes, and open every one of of those rocket attack links, and you'll see that 99% of them landed in "rural areas" with "no injuries; no deaths".  Of course, when you strap a bunch of bottle-rockets to a tin can with no explosive warhead... I don't really expect a bunch of casualties.

       Look... I live in the South.  Especially, after this election... I perfectly understand some drunk rednecks pissed off about the overall situation of things and popping a few shots in the air.  Here, it's AR-15's.  There, it's what passes as "rockets".

       Even using your numbers its 10 bucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now figure half the population doesnt work, or contribute in a meaningful way because their taxes are so low.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then figure that the 3 Billion number is bullshit since its only counting direct military aid, not guaranteed federal loans - which historically have never been repaid, only "forgiven" when the bill comes due - or "joint-defense" projects like the US financed "Iron-Dome" defense system, nor does it include the myriad other radar and missile defense systems on Israeli soil that are US owned/operated and maintained by the US DoD....... all of which adds up to a number quite a bit fucking bigger than the 3 Billion they like to pretend is being spent, not even including the opportunity costs of all that money being wasted.

      <p>
       10 cents huh? The true drain of Israel on the US economy is more like 500-1500 dollars per working person per year.

       They get the benefit of our military might. 3 billion is a drop compared to what is actually spent. Think of all the R and D that goes into making any weapon. Then we buy it try it out and let them buy it on our discount.

       The news media has cruelly not reported on Israeli PROVOCATION which immediately PRECEDED the rocket response by Hamas. Israel's media is so controlled that its citizens don't even know what IOF is doing to the Palestinians. The everyday Israeli is carefully led to believe that Hamas's rocket attacks occur in a vacuum. Such fools.

       Evolved, ha, that's a nice dream world you live in.  In the world I wake up to, little girls are getting circumcised, and men of the same nation are spilling each others blood daily in the name of Allah.  I live in a world where genocide is still an option.  I live where millions of children starve daily and evil grows stronger by the minute.  You are an idealist, that is not a bad thing, but reality is a bitch and we as humans are still bitches, just sayin'.

       Last I looked native Americans were American citizens and not forced to live on reservations. But yes, the European early settlers were absolute beasts in their treatment of the native population but this  is 2012 now and Palestinians are stateless and many are kept on the Gaza reservation.

       none of us can help who we are born to. how do we know his grandparents had any hand in it. You don't see us committing genocide on them now. Maybe Libya and that is over money isn't it? Same as Iraq it was over money. But this is different. If you feel that why why don't you petition the gov't to just get it over with and execute all of them dick? I would hope that as we grow up and older we appreciate life and live and let live.

       Really? You guys are still stuck on this? Regardless of the fact that Israel should've ID'd the ship, did you ever ask yourself why Israel would attack one of our ships? At the time, there was no political motive. We were staying neutral in that war and we stayed neutral after the attacks. What would attacking us have accomplished? Nothing. Of course the survivors are going to claim it was intentional. They didn't know what was going on and were defending themselves like crazy. In their heads, they were fending off a major attack, they don't want to believe that Israel did it on accident. Even then this happened 50 years ago while neither country is under the same rule. So, please, instead of sarcastically posting links to Google, why don't you explain to me what the fuck you think you're talking about?

       I'm not sure what a Palestinian is from a historic sense, but I assume you mean someone that has descended from like Jordan or Egypt? If that's who you're talking about, yeah, their lives mean something. I know in your head it is a big injustice that Jews moved in, but it really doesn't mean much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet you think the Jews... I mean "Zionists" pushed them off the land too. The forming of Israel is probably the only (or one of the few) countries that was created in the most peaceful fashion. But again, that requires you to fact check what you believe.

       I also have the sneaking suspicion that you don't get this worked up about say, Taiwan.

       If you're referring to a Qassam rocket (which is one type launched), can I shoot you with one or is it too deadly for you to volunteer? Qassam rockets aren't the kind that land in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you're being purposely ignorant trying to reduce the implications and apologize for those that merely aim for civilian deaths.

       The news media has cruelly not reported on Israeli PROVOCATION which immediately PRECEDED the rocket response by Hamas. Israel's media is so controlled that its citizens don't even know what IOF is doing to the Palestinians. The everyday Israeli is carefully led to believe that Hamas's rocket attacks occur in a vacuum. Such fools.
