    <div class="md"><p>I graduated in May with a music education degree(took me 5 years - average length of the music education program due to being a combination of a BS in Music degree and a BS in Education degree).  Every single thing you could possibly be taught at a university is absolutely <em>free</em> online.  Try mentioning this to most people who have paid up to 100k for an education and they will argue with you until they are blue in the face that there is a difference to the experience.  At state sponsored universities, it is extremely easy to get a degree in most fields.  There&#39;s a huge time investment, but the actual difficulty of the work load is minimal compared to the average intelligence.  Half of the people I went to school with didn&#39;t need to be there.  They had no clue what the content was they were studying, they had no focus, and most of them had no other reason to be there than to obtain a degree.</p>

<p>Looking back, though I&#39;m a much more open minded person and the time away from home changed me significantly, it was a waste of money.  I&#39;m not completely sure why I went to college other than that it was a forced idea by everyone I came into contact with.  I&#39;ve highly lost my passion in music and don&#39;t have much interest in pursuing a teaching career(especially after missing out on several jobs in this state due to the cancellation of fine arts programs due to the terrible economy).  Want to learn something?  Read about it from numerous different sources.  By going to a university, you are wasting your own time while throwing yourself into several years of debt(if you don&#39;t have many scholarships). </p>

<p>Now you have millions of people with specialized degrees in fields they can&#39;t get jobs in who are in an enormous amount of debt.  I would like someone to tell me what they learned at a university that they couldn&#39;t learn elsewhere for free or by experience.  Universities are businesses before they are educational institutes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have to consider there were thousands of students graduating when the housing bubble popped. People had spent small fortunes and/or put themselves into massive debt only to find a job outside of their major before the loans matured after 6 months. </p>

<p>...those with a technical degree don&#39;t learn anything of any real importance, they learn a skill that is equivalent to the skill acquired by a plumber or electrician. They can gain this technical degree and still be essentially uneducated. This is because real education is disregarded and held in disdain in our sick, declining culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great point that I&#39;m sure got buried in that thread. All the people giving anecdotal examples were all essentially talking about the technical-learning of skills to preform a specific task-set. As you correctly mentioned, this is not <em>education</em> in the classical sense. These people weren&#39;t explicitly taught critical thinking skills, the trivium method of learning, the ability to offer suggestions about the entire socio-economic and political paradigm that are truely unique... </p>

<p>To get somewhat meta here, the disciplines that are more &quot;liberal-arts&quot; oriented are not interested coming up with solutions to significant socio-economic, technological, or political problems. The higher-learning institutions can&#39;t educate many students to question and research authentic solutions, because that puts the current socio-economic/energy/ect status-quo paradigm in jeopardy. Students are coerced into regurgitating exactly what is told of them.. If you question too much, depending on the subject and the professor, you&#39;re &quot;gonna have a bad time&quot;.. You will be ridiculed, and could possibly even fail the class. I had to create my own interdisciplinary degree to study what I wanted because I saw that what I was being taught was antiquated, propagandized, or irrelevant.</p>

<p>So for the vast majority of those posters in that thread, it&#39;s very easy to make those kinds of arguments about technical degrees, but the actual <em>education</em> is not there for a great many reasons... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well...judging by the comments, the majority of people took the term &quot;modern education&quot; and then assumed it meant higher education. A common mistake among those educated in the &quot;modern&quot; system. </p>

<p>I think the term used most in the comments, higher education, wasn&#39;t defined (because it wasn&#39;t said by OP) and that left much up for interpretation. I mean sure, everyone agreed that higher education meant college. But I think OP was originally speaking of those kids who just go to college because they think it&#39;s what they should do after high school. Then, once they finish with a BA or BS they&#39;re like, okay. I&#39;m done now with college. I must get a job and find a spouse. </p>

<p>But, if you&#39;re talking about higher education in the sense of graduate school and people pursuing their interests and motivations. Then, that&#39;s completely different. There&#39;s a fine line between those two students in higher education. The one&#39;s who are there because it&#39;s what they are supposed to do and the one&#39;s who want to actually learn. And i don&#39;t mean like a specific skill. I mean those who love knowledge and information and love figuring things out instead of just being fed facts and protocols. Someone who doesn&#39;t go to school because of grades. But goes to school because it&#39;s interesting and they want to know more about information they enjoy.</p>

<p>The only stupid people are the ones who aren&#39;t interested in learning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When a page hits the front page we drag in the kids, for lack of a better term. Not a single person could entertain their education is planned and many topics are left out intentionally.  The reason is simple, it&#39;s their foundation for reality and they will fight to protect it.  This is a very predictable behaviour, since you cannot force a mind open...they will respond with equal and opposite force.</p>

<p>There was a time when it was mostly truth seekers here, now we have entertainment seekers with no real curiosity about anything outside the bubble they have imprisioned themselves in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to start a new thread prompted by other one, but I guess here is as good as any to post this. The &quot;modern education system&quot; is, of course, probably the most influential integration propaganda apparatus in existence today. </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people, upon hearing the term propaganda, think of subversive
pamphlets written by revolutionary groups or information planted in a coun-
try during wartime by agents of an enemy power. In his theoretical treat-
ment of the topic, Jacques Ellul (1973) calls the type of propaganda designed
to incite revolution or to undermineexisting regimesthe &quot;propagandaof agita-
tion.&quot;</p>

<p>Ellul also describes another type which he believes to be much more
important than agitation propaganda for people living in developed nations.
Every modern social system uses what Ellul calls the &quot;propagandaof integra-
tion&quot; to promote acceptance and support among its citizens for that system.</p>

<p>Integration propaganda is important because no modern society can func-
tion for long without at least the implicit support of most of its citizens.
Integration propaganda is promulgated not in pamphlets put out by
small groups of subversives or in broadcasts made by foreign powers, but
in the main channels of communication- newspapers,television, movies, text-
books, political speeches etc.-produced by some of the most influential,
powerful, and respected people in a society. It is therefore difficult to
recognize despite (or perhaps because of) its omnipresence, particularly
because it is based upon ideals and biases that are accepted by most members
of the society. With the rapid growth in communications technology that
has taken place over the last century, integration propaganda has become
a major factor in the workings of modern sociopolitical systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Sociological propaganda is a phenomenon where a society seeks to integrate the maximum number of individuals into itself by unifying its members’ behavior according to a pattern, spreading its style of life abroad, and thus imposing itself on other groups. Essentially sociological propaganda aims to increase conformity with the environment that is of a collective nature by developing compliance with or defense of the established order through long term penetration and progressive adaptation by using all social currents. The propaganda element is the way of life with which the individual is permeated and then the individual begins to express it in film, writing, or art without realizing it. This involuntary behavior creates an expansion of society through advertising, the movies, education, and magazines. &quot;The entire group, consciously or not, expresses itself in this fashion; and to indicate, secondly that its influence aims much more at an entire style of life.&quot;[14] This type of propaganda is not deliberate but springs up spontaneously or unwittingly within a culture or nation. This propaganda reinforces the individual’s way of life and represents this way of life as best. Sociological propaganda creates an indisputable criterion for the individual to make judgments of good and evil according to the order of the individual’s way of life. Sociological propaganda does not result in action, however, it can prepare the ground for direct propaganda. From then on, the individual in the clutches of such sociological propaganda believes that those who live this way are on the side of the angels, and those who don’t are bad.[15]</p>

<p>Vertical vs. Horizontal Propaganda: Vertical propaganda is similar to direct propaganda that aims at the individual in the mass and is renewed constantly. However, in horizontal propaganda there is no top down structure but rather it springs up from within the group. It involves meticulous encirclement that traps an individual involuntarily in dialectic. The individual is led unfailingly to its adherence by talking about the dialectic until the individual discovers the answer that was set up unconsciously for him to find. Schools are a primary mechanism for integrating the individual into the way of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cue the STEM majors who think because they can build an airplane that they&#39;re immune from such sociological conditioning. Our primary schools are essentially gigantic Skinner boxes. &quot;Everything I need to know I learned in kindergarten&quot; indeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I study mechanical engineering, and my biggest frustration with college is realizing that everything I am learning in school I could have taught to myself for free at home.
It really brought into question why the hell I am taking out student loans to finance an arbitrary piece of paper. I feel like if I had simply forgone college and taught myself engineering through online resources I could have made a much more fascinating career out for myself as an inventor as opposed to being forced to jump through the corporate hoops to repay my loans.
I don&#39;t mean to be condescending but there isn&#39;t a single major in college that cannot be learned for $1.50 in late charges from your local library.</p>
