       This could prove a good collective brainstorming. Some of these ideas might be g. people so often say that we have no power, well, a million dollars are powerful. So hypothetically, if you had that power, how would you use it?

       Well, I'm a software developer so I would use that money to hire an army of Eastern European programmers to create some GPL licensed web software for sharing content.  I would perhaps try to integrate the software with TOR.  I would use a lot of cryptographic techniques to create a social media site where your data can only be shared with the people that you want to use it.  The majority of the data would be encrypted on the server so that the admins would not have access to it.  The data from the server would be fed into the Javascript in the web browser and it would be decrypted there.  So there would be the normal https encryption and then another level of encryption inside of that that is only available to the users.  You could still store your "friend" keys on the server after it had been encrypted in the Javascript front end.  I would also add in the ability to share data between different nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would make this software for the $1 million because we will need it to communicate freely.

       I hate to break it to you, but a million dollars isn't that powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'll play along...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the only effective thing you could do outside of the arena that the powerful play in, is to use that money to travel to different parts of the world, organize meetings, and expose the conspiracy in a personal way. Then, offer a solution - not a revolution against the powers, but against their ideas. Create a movement of people who don't care about wealth and personal gain. Create a people who don't rely on consumerism and debt. Create a people who are concerned about the welfare of one another rather than the welfare of themselves. It has to be personal, it has to be active, it has to be perpetual. A million dollars would get it kick-started in a small way, but hopefully significant enough that it could take hold.

       Try $10 bln and that's just to get a foot in the door of media, politics, science, education and then to fund the people who are aware of the cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can change unjust laws by lobbying politicians you funded.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can research scientific breakthroughs that were covered up or are reporting untruths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course these people will be ridiculed but when you own sections of the media you can spin it however you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the truth be known however is that the current paradigm of mainstream is dying and the alternative shared view of the internet is taking hold so the above will not even be necessary in the future - but it wouldn't hurt. the problem is finding a person with integrity to be trustee over it.

       the most effective technique would probably be to make an integrated, hyperlinked archive of known facts implicating members of the conspiracy, available on the internet.  you could even build it on top of a Wiki engine.  allowing all kinds of people, all with their own trails of research, to contribute to something like that, would create an overwhelming body of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       extra points for making it highly mirrored and impossible to shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       estimated cost for that is no more than a few thousand dollars.  i have a gut feeling something like that already exists.

       Only a million dollars?  Hmmm.  I'm not sure that would cause much of a dent.  Ultimately, it seems the MSM and their multi BILLION dollar budgets would crush that measly mil in short order.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I would imagine that some industrious enough minds could put that mil to really good use and really make some noise.

       Websites with very detailed information. You get the most value, with the most impact reaching most people possible on the internet 24/7. It is the magic tool. Think about what hard time activists had when they tried to spread anti-government pamphlets some forty years ago.

       Well that does not sound very creative at first, but image everyone of us would do that at the same time with that ammount of money. Their system would implode by itself and they could not hire enough shills at the time to surpress knowledge. The internet is not censored yet. Ask our children in thirty years from now.

       I have been concerned about voter fraud for a long time, voter fraud, ie, fraud against voters just as consumer fraud isn't fraud by consumers but fraud aimed at consumers.  I think without honest elections only revolution is left. So I'd be pushing "Paper ballots counted by hand with people watching".
      </p>
      <p>
       After that I'd try to spy on and publicize plots by groups of the wealthy.

       Archimedes said "Give me a place to stand and I will move the world". I think with the right ideas spread at the right time and place with a million dollars you could move the world. Certainly Marx didn't have much money, was so poor three of his children died of malnutrition, but he changed the world. As did Jesus. It's not always about the money. It's about the ideas.

       let me know when you figure out why society has been following cult-like religious beliefs and abusive rulers for the last couple thousand years, without resorting to stupid explanations of "it's best for them" or "nice feeling beliefs tend to spread".  let me know how the tightly hierarchical Catholic Church managed to maintain control of the governments of Europe for an entire millennium, and how that doesn't qualify as a shady conspiracy.

       Once again, anytime this "global conspiracy" chicanery comes up nobody is willing to name any names, just that "it exists, mannnn" and links to another silly Youtube video. Sorry, but you can use all the fear-mongering voiceovers, creepy music and Googled photos of Bohemian Grove meetings you want, it's not going to convince anybody with half a brain.

       applying Occam's razor between our two theories leaves my theory - your theory fails to account for how our rulers have consciously bent the machinery of society against society's own interest.  when there is collaboration between our rulers in that respect, you have the definition of an overarching conspiracy, and the evidence tying massive financial interests to those rulers is also overwhelming.

       and yes, we have hundreds of specific names, that i suppose you would like to ignore.  want to go down  the list?

       as few as 500 people directly control the legal machinations of the entire United States, the largest military/financial/corporate empire in world history.  the idea that one group could organize the efforts of such a small number of people, to create and expand a tyranny, is not only incredibly plausible, but it's also completely supported by decades of legislative efforts on their behalf (NDAA, Federal Reserve Act, PATRIOT Act, and countless wars with evaporating rationales, to name a few).   not only is  it not "physically impossible", it is sociological and historical fact.
