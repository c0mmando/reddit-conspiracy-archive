       I dont mean to sound an apocalyptic crazy person. (Yes I know apocalypse means to reveal truth, but i'm using it here to mean nearing the beginning of the end of an era. Meaning, we are transitioning into something new in future)
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I believe this is the beginning of it all. We see the ramp up of violence in the middle east. The violence has always been there, but this is the start of it going out of control. Then, we have massive protests throughout the EU, most notably Spain, Greece, Ireland, and Portugal.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's tons of controversy in the news about the election, still. Even though it's been over for a week. Also, controversy over the petitions being signed (I'm not saying the petitions will do anything to help americans, only that they're controversial). By defintion, an unidentified flying object in Colorado seems almost legit with much controversy there too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And apparently Obama signed a cyber security bill today which allows the government to take control of the internet if they need to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also, a good ramp up in earthquake activity and solar activity (which is at a solar maximum, only getting more active). Not to mention the effects of climate change taking place (I didn't say global warming) and geomagnetic instability becoming more frequent. 
Ooo and the appearance of comet S1 (ison) soon to come in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soo.... yeah. Is this the beginning of it all? (I know there is no end, that's why I said the beginning of it all.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, I'm just trying to get some discussion going. Maybe you can add to the list or subtract some info that isn't correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       But lets discuss all this action culminating at once
      </p>

       edit: Sorry in advance for not putting this on selfconspiracy. The thought came to me after there had been comments on here

       TIL everyone in this subreddit is &lt;20 years old or hasn't paid attention to any news over the last 20 years otherwise you wouldn't be calling WWIII for every military conflict that occurs. Have you all forgot about the 90s, the Gulf War, Bosnia/Herzegovina, The Kosovo War, etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, the last time Israel did a ground invasion of Gaza was in 2009, it's something they do every few years to keep the terrorists in check and knock them down a peg or two.

       how does this help our convo? I mean, sure, you're making it known that conflicts like this have happened in the past. But you're ignoring the imminent global financial collapse. And yes, it is going to happen, any day now. Some things aren't 100% but the financial collapse is unavoidable.

       Once people admit to themselves that the world is currently ill-equipped to face unprecedented challenges, it's difficult to refrain from talk of apocalypse. Personally, I believe apocalypse is a pathetic concession--it's admitting that it's easier to allow things to slide into chaos than it is to fix what's broken. Now I consider myself a fairly reasonable guy, but even I am a bit bothered by the interminable procession of apocalyptic death cults, religious ideologues, and economic sociopaths commanding the world stage.

       I think HailIlluminatus does have a point in that these conflicts have been happening for hundreds of years, but western liberties are being restricted now as well. The middle and lower class westerners are starting to identify more with the oppressed around the world than ever before. Change is coming.

       I hate to say it, but it's all under control. Israel will go into Gaza, hundreds or thousands will die and it will be forgotten about a few weeks later after a botched hearing at the UN with a slap on the wrist. Don't predict stuff because when it doesn't happen you will be mocked. On the other hand, if a nuclear weapon goes off there will be no mockery. :(

       No nuke will be detonated. Talk of nuclear threat is a PR mind game by the weapons vendors to drive sales. Humanity and its leaders are rational enough to not set off nuclear weapons. It benefits no one. It's just hype to sell arms.

       Not so sure, nukes are actually a lot cleaner than people realize. Sure the blast will kill all people and destroy all buildings but the infected zone would only be contaminated for about 3 days. Foreign powers could use nukes to wipe out the east coast and attack the fleeing military and civilians from the west driving them back into the fallout. Meanwhile they fortify the west coast and wait for the zone to clear.

       Fyi, I knew about the solar maximum. It's not where it should be according to predicted models, so it's actually quiet for maximum, which means we might see increased activity. Also, a good amount of planetary harmonics are occurring in the next 4 weeks. I don't think anything crazy will happen but we shouldn't ignore said information.

       Discussion is fine with me, I am just saying what I've seen over the course of a couple decades in conspiracy communities. Honestly, the "Here we go" catchphrase that the shit is finally hitting the fan is exhausting to here constantly. We were supposed to have two straight elections canceled and been tossed into Martial Law, but that never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm 100% for truth-seeking and conspiracy searching, I'm just equally as annoyed and tired of any fear-mongering.

       I agree on a lot of your points,

       I think i'm misunderstood with the amount of information I know. I'm aware there is no end and our consciousness will live on regardless of what happens here on earth. Also, that there probably won't be something epic happening in 2012, but rather in 2013 of 14. So, again. As i've been saying, I'm just trying to get discussion going.

       Like, I don't see the problem if I'm simply asking a question and wanting to get a round of opinions. Yours seems to be that I should get off my discussion completely because it's untruthful or fear mongering. Or because it's circle jerk, which is gross. Regardless you're not here to help spread truth. Because i did no lying, we are just discussing in hypothetical futures based on our given information.

       I completely see your point, but to clarify, my comments aren't to shut it down, more in my opinion what could change. With the sensationalism toned a bit and one comment that I didnt understand why you mentioned, I agree with your whole post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just feel like when people see sensationalism they may become turned off by it because of the nature of it. And when our (yours, mine, others in this sub) goal is to spread awareness, we want to attract new people as well to the discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate, I really had no problems at all with the majority of your post, and just commented on something I think should be cleaned up a bit in order to not turn anyone off from joining the sub/discussion as a new user.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its entirely my opinion though, if you disagree then we simply aren't in agreement about how the message should be spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didnt say you had lied at all, just that I didnt like a couple comments. Im sorry if it seemed otherwise.

       Okay, now this, I completely respect.

      <p>
       You're very correct about the sensationalism and it should be toned down.  And i think you're talking about the comment about ramped up solar activity. Which was vague and missing some information to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you on the way we should be spreading the message and there should be a different tone and it's something i'll be working on. We do want new people to come here and see that this information isn't something that they should fear, but rather something that gives self empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest step though, is having respectful comment sections like these. It's more productive than arguing and keeps a positive vibe. But, it seems even more like circle jerk now, haha.

       It's hard to decipher. They always say "this election is the most important election of the generation", or that "this century is the most important time in the history of mankind" so on and so forth. With this knowledge, I think this is really just another part of the cycle that's been going on for thousands of years, and we are hardly at the worst of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people say that "more people are waking up", but I'm not really sure if I agree with that either. I mean it sure feels like there are a lot of people who are awake to at least some extent, not trusting mainstream media or suspecting something fishy about 9/11 being the most common.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've slowly been getting closer and closer to a totalitarian world government, and the worst part is that the vast majority of citizens consent to it, and even demand it (invading middle east after 9/11, demanding addressing to climate change). I used to think "man, think how peaceful the world would be if it was ruled all under one government" and "the world would be a better place if there were less people", and all this stuff which would make sense if those in power were empathetic, caring people looking out for the best of the people. But, as I think many of us have realized, these problems are engineered by the elite so that we
       <em>
        demand
       </em>
       these solutions, when the fact of the matter is these problems probably wouldn't exist if these elite weren't in power in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the whole climate change thing is just a problem-reaction-solution for Agenda 21.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that I just ranted completely off topic but I feel better now. That is all.

       No man, not off topic at all. You're making an excellent point and it's one that many people have a hard time seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as people waking up, it does appear that some are waking up, but they are still half asleep (if we wanna speak in metaphors). Meaning, they understand they shouldn't trust the corporate entities nor government, but most don't understand the whole control paradigm. For example, they still argue about who they are going to vote for, but they think both candidates aren't very good. (By "they" i mean, the half asleep people.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's almost as if the elites are wanting them to be half asleep. Because half asleep is when you get angry cause you're neither awake nor asleep and that causes confusion. And if those people don't know where to direct their anger, which they mostly likely won't, then their anger will be directed in the wrong direction. Thus, we get this chaotic mess that's developing.

       That's an interesting point. I always saw it as, people waking up to some things was inevitable, but the vast majority are just going to believe everything they hear so it wasn't going to be a problem, but I think what your saying is definitely something that occurs, whether it be deliberate or just a lucky coincidence for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's also the "problem-reaction-solution" situations, such as the unsustainability of oil. A huge population of people is currently pushing for address to climate change (of which, is most likely a fabrication, or at the very least an intentional result of the oil industry), and it seems much of the govt and media purposely ignore it, while others openly state that these other entities should discuss it ,leading people to believe that they are waking up, when actually it's just them being played once again. People will eventually demand a "green" movement and when they get it they will feel accomplished, like they finally stuck it to the man But really that is not the case at all. Along with the "fixes" of sustainable energy, the elite will also be pushing agenda 21, which has been the plan all along. And it's difficult because even you or I at first glance would be like "yeah! go sustainable energy!" Because it's a wonderful thing that we need to continue living on this planet, and it's not until you dig down into it that you realize it's all just a part of this agenda that has been in the work for centuries (if not longer).

       I said protest, don't contort my words. I said nothing more about it. You applied the meaning of "world is going to shit" protest. 
Also, in was in front of the embassy (whoops, the irish embassy in UK)

       Okay, you got me there, I got confused for a moment. But, seriously whats your point? You just wanted to prove that Irish people like to fight?
      </p>
      <p>
       I provided your protest information, which you said you haven't seen. All i'm trying to say is, while being Irish you do know more than me about your country, but still, you don't live in every part of Ireland and shouldn't expect to know all about it. Just like I don't pretend to know everything that's going on in the US

       example:
1)There's no protests in Ireland
2) here's the link
1) oh, well it's a different protest
2) it's a protest
1) how does a protest have anything to do with the world going to shit
2) I only said there was a protest
1) yeah, well I know whats going on
2) Okay, shouldn't you have known about that protest then and this is a pointless argument
1) Pointless argument?
2) Shouldn't this convo have ended after I showed you the protests
1) i don't understand the context
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah. Basically, Im asking you to admit you didn't know about the protest. Cause if you did you wouldn't have made your first comment, or it would've been a different comment.

       Look, I admitted when I got mixed up about the embassy. It's normal to get confused for a moment. But, you said there were no protests, i showed one. I think this conversation is pointless. It's kinda going nowhere. So, you're right, it's small... but a protest is a protest. I did say massive protests throughout the EU. But that's not specifically ireland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, i think it's coo how you can actually converse with me about this instead of getting mad or insulting me. Most people would get angry and start being aggressive. I respect that.

       There's no point about getting mad online, the other person won't every see you know, etc. I should've said it was a protest rather than a sit out or a vigil. There has been one violent protest at the Israeli embassy here, the Garda(Irish police force) used batons to clear the area(there's not much info at the minute) mainly because some of the protesters started getting out of control..

       Nah.  You're just seeing the aftermath of the US elections (and probably a few other factors worldwide).  Second-term presidents get to do what they want, but their opponents do to.  All the economic data got truthier after the election, too.

        Doomsday Clock

       is not anymore applicable to our current socio-political landscape. WW III is at best doubtful for the near future. The major states responsible for all of the major wars in the last 200 years, have all been in virtual (despite small sporadic conflicts) peace and union. The biggest military and economic powers today are co-dependent.

       Just like every boxing match is the "fight of the century", to overly hype events, is simply a cognitive bias of ours, which MSM use for ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the Illuminati finally won, and have full power now, not needing anymore "conflicts" in order to maintain their status quo, the internet their final and ultimate "move" towards total control. I don't know !!

      <p>
       Solar activities: in history the sun was never directly reponsible for any mass extinction event (e.g.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_(film">

       )), so we can count this one out.

       Climate change: human caused or not, it's obvious that it's cyclical in Earth's history, and by such inescapable. Albeit, considering our high "adaptivity" to hostile environments, nothing insurmountable.

       how does this help our convo? I mean, sure, you're making it known that conflicts like this have happened in the past. But you're ignoring the imminent global financial collapse. And yes, it is going to happen, any day now. Some things aren't 100% but the financial collapse is unavoidable.

       I'm willing to take a bet with you for any sum of money (try me, I'm rich) that there will not be an "imminent global financial collapse any day now".

       No nuke will be detonated. Talk of nuclear threat is a PR mind game by the weapons vendors to drive sales. Humanity and its leaders are rational enough to not set off nuclear weapons. It benefits no one. It's just hype to sell arms.

       Honey Boo-Boo will get pregnant is my guess.  No more talk about Israel and Palestine once that happens.

       I said protest, don't contort my words. I said nothing more about it. You applied the meaning of "world is going to shit" protest. 
Also, in was in front of the embassy (whoops, the irish embassy in UK)
