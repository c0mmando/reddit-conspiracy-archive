       Why do the people who manufacture these products use them then?  I don't use products with aspartame and try to limit my high fructose corn syrup, but I mean, chemtrails?  Everyone is affected by contrails/chemtrails, so are you insinuating that a select few have vaccines to protect themselves and are slowly waiting for everyone to die?  I'm fascinated by conspiracy theories but don't really understand these ones.  I just think humans in a capitalist society want to make cheap products and risk human lives doing it (i.e. all those chemicals).

       For one, it has been tested extensively, but I digress that I can't be bothered to find these studies for you at this time, I'm busy. I'll instead stick to a more theoretical argument. Your current view on GMOs represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the science there involved. You seem to think that the minor change of a few genes in the DNA of an organism represents a large change in the organism itself, IE, changing a healthy food source into something dangerous. This is not true. Changing one or two structures in the DNA has very minute effects, sometimes to make it grow better in the cold, sometimes to incorporate a proven safe pesticide in tiny doses into the organism itself, or things to this effect. There is very little that could cause damage in humans, very little at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You people don't seem to have a problem with the fact that genetic modification has been going on for millennia in the form of artificial selection and cross breeding.

       The most dangerous conspiracy is misleading the masses into believing in a world that doesn't exist.  Our lifestyle isn't sustainable.  Bailouts are not long-term solutions.  The world financial system is hanging on for dear life.  Wars are not really fought because we love spreading "democracy". Politics is an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       All conspiracies fall under this desire to mislead and take advantage of our perception of reality.

       Example?  Not saying you're not right or this isn't the case.  Just wondering exactly what you mean since this is a broad statement that it seems can apply to many different types of scenarios, and some of those scenarios in fact
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       be looked upon as freedoms.  For example, the "freedom" to hurt others against their will directly or indirectly (which I'm not assuming you're referring to here at all, of course.  I just don't know specifically what you mean).
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess ultimately what I could just say is that some things that some people look upon as "freedoms"
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed more personal vices than anything else and they
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       in fact be exercised to such a great extent.  After all, with great freedom comes great responsibility, and many of us are
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       irresponsible beings that might actually be better off having certain freedoms withheld from us than to be allowed to just do whatever we want.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So many people interpret a guilty pleasure as a freedom.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This seems to be something similar to what I'm saying.  While I can certainly interpret it as being correct, I'm not entirely sure since what you said can be taken in various ways.

       B.) Using the word 'collective' in here is funny. You should look into that word before you bandy it about in a non-exclusive thread in a reddit sub where people actively research etymology and ideology. I'm not saying you're bad - I'm just saying it's really funny given the context.

       That finally more and more people are becoming aware of their own problems and the wide and far reaching problems of the human race. Now, we have our own interpretations on what we should do or different perspectives. These are all good and well, but I fear that these sentiments will be hijacked and used for more for insidious purposes (look at several of these new cults).
      </p>
      <p>
       Be aware and know what is happening, and know that people will use these sentiments for their own selfish agendas. We could be well on the path to destruction because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But know this, you have the control and the power in your hands to do whatever it is you need to in life. No one can take that away from you...

       i would love to see a browser extension which makes post titles smaller relative to the poster's activity. the more somebody posts, the smaller the post titles become. (with certain limits of course) this would help users identify spammers easier. i suppose any spam filter algorithm uses this concecpt at some point. just an idea..

       The looming war with Iran is the most dangerous conspiracy at the moment, at least in my opinion.

       There's a lot of "general" conspiracy issues, but outside of being vague, I don't think we're in any more trouble than just simply the looming war w/ Iran.

       Well the looming economic (planned) collapse
Also the global coastal event will be beyond imagination.
The real kicker will be the alien wars/space war thing in the years ahead that's something I'm still trying to get my head around.

       For sure, there's a few sources for this information but the best 'map' if you can call it that of what's probably coming at us is clif high's halfpasthuman.com
       <br/>
       While it is useful for forecasting and I've been watching it since 2008 it is dense and I usually have to discuss it (email thread) with a few people before I really can absorb it. I did find back then that the graphs of 'building tension language' and 'release language' matched up with terence mckenna's time wave zero.... I'm still pretty unsure of exactly what the global coastal event will be although HPH reports go into how devastating it will be (they tend to always be on the worse side of what happens anyway) there is a second forecast for the global coastal flooding from Courtney Brown's Farsight Project but still no insight on
       <em>
        why
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Freeman, of freemantv.com also goes into the coming space war which HPH predicts in their 'alien war' subsets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The economic collapse is obvious, max keiser, peter schiff, zeitgeist addendum before they go into venus project crap. I doubt I need to go into that.

       The most dangerous conspiracy by far is and has been religion for a long time. It is sort of the root of all conspiracies because it divides the population into smaller and smaller groups and allows for all the other conspiracies to be played out on top of the division it creates. It is the womb from which all other conspiracies are conceived. lol

       The most dangerous conspiracy right now is the conspiracy to suppress information about Climate Change and go on profiting from fossil fuel use. 6 degrees of Global Warming will mean a totally different climate and a loss of biodiversity, ocean life, and farm productivity. Several Billion people may die as a result of this conspiracy. Is that dangerous enough for you?

       Dude you seriously have it backwards.  Agenda 21 is being pushed under the guise of AGW in order for the big corporations to hoard resources, destroy the middle class, and set up world government.  It's blatant when you
       <em>
        ACTUALLY DO A LITTLE RESEARCH
       </em>
       instead of just going to sites that are funded by the big oil-money foundations(Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, etc) that
       <em>
        push
       </em>
       this shit and give colleges and schools "grants" to push that fucking bullshit and brainwash generation after generation.  This has been proven and called out:

       My point is every American president in the modern era will probably blatantly lie to the public at one point or another.  Obama had no reason to want the ambassador to Libya killed, and reports showed that the ambassador knew about the possibility of an oncoming threat and chose to stay anyway. Watch his videos where he talks to the Libyan people, the guy had so much faith in them. Man loved some Libya.

       You are creating unnecessary boundaries and hate with the racist stuff. We need to move past race. Culture is everything, and I could care less the color of your skin.

       Zionist aren't a race there are group of people.

      <p>
       You don't have to be a jew to be a zionist you understand this please?
      </p>
      <p>
       They Zionist are controlled by the same people that are controlling most of the western secret society's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which are the Rothschilds to a big part.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschild aren't jewish they are satanist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many jews are rejecting zionism.

       Now do you say that in the way that you mean this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites, who are white, are trying to eliminate the whites at the bottom so that they can be the only whites and have their cherished bloodline be the only whites?  Then enslave the rest of the world under their power?  Because if that's the case, I can see that being what's going down.  At least, a part of it.  Agenda 21 could totally tie in with that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should try and word it like that, I understand what you mean, but some of the slower kids around here have been brainwashed to equate what you're saying with blatant racism.  I don't think you hate other races, you just see the whites being forced down by popular culture, and to that, I say: mostly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the other races also have predictive programming being shoved down their throats as well.  Think about gangsta culture and the "diva" mindset.
