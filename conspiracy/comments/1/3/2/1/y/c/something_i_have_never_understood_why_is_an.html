       Did you just not read any of it because the link said "eye of providence" in it??
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramid signifies Strength and Duration: The Eye over it &amp; the Motto allude to the many signal interpositions of providence in favour of the American cause. The date underneath is that of the Declaration of Independence and the words under it signify the beginning of the new American Æra, which commences from that date
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1782 resolution adopting the seal blazons the image on the reverse as "A pyramid unfinished. In the zenith an eye in a triangle, surrounded by a glory, proper." The pyramid is conventionally shown as consisting of 13 layers to refer to the 13 original states. The adopting resolution provides that it is inscribed on its base with the date MDCCLXXVI (1776) in Roman numerals. Where the top of the pyramid should be, the Eye of Providence watches over it. Two mottos appear: Annuit cœptis signifies that Providence has "approved of (our) undertakings." Novus ordo seclorum, freely taken from Virgil, is Latin for "a new order of the ages." The reverse has never been cut (as a seal) but appears, for example, on the back of the one-dollar bill.

       I have no idea why you're being down voted for an honest, uninformed question.
This community can be quite fickle at times and will notably
       <em>
        shit on
       </em>
       those 'not in the know.'
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a
       <em>
        whack
       </em>
       of theories behind this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some assert that the White Brotherhood - an ancient Egyptian sect of 'power brokers,' knowledge holders and advisors to the pharaohs - still manipulate the powers that be today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others will tell you it's Masonic symbolism; derived from Satanic or Pagan worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others still will assert that it's a symbol for knowledge and hierarchy. The missing top of the pyramid representing those whom hold the power (of knowledge and finance) over the lower caste and those whom rule. Taking this a wee bit further, some believe that the missing pyramid's
       <em>
        point
       </em>
       is representative of 'hidden knowledge' and/or the truth of the
       <em>
        game.
       </em>
       Game = modern socio-political and economic underpinnings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is, I don't know for sure why it's there, but I can tell you this: there's evidence for either one of these theories. Some stack up more than others, but confirmation bias aside, there's a decent amount of evidence that stands up to discerning critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The choice of what to believe is, of course, yours to make.

       There's really only one reference that I've been able to find and it's Sir Lawrence Gardner's book, "Lost Secrets of the Sacred Ark."

       Here's a clip of him discussing the brotherhood and their 'secret.' I've heard some podcasts that talk about this as well. Fascinating stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't get into the whole
       <em>
        control scheme
       </em>
       aspect, just the 'lost' knowledge aspect. I have, however, heard it argued that the pre-dynastic sect has passed down their secrets for millennia and it is that particular secret that keeps TPTB at the top of the proverbial food chain.

       I have heard that; I kind of lumped that theory in with the 'withholding of information' and secrets of the

       There is, undoubtedly, more at wok in this cosmos than we give credit. There are always known unknowns, but I feel the

       unknowns far out-weigh our documented and agreed-upon consensus. To be clear, I vehemently believe this.

       But, I do find it adds an air of paranoia to every day life that's equally hard to shake.

       I'd love to find the balance between living a balanced, healthy and well informed life, coupled with actively changing the world around me. I've had an exceedingly hard time maintaining a positive attitude while steeping myself in information of this nature; it has a tendency to make you jaded if you're not careful.

       It's a tough situation, really. I feel like there's a reason for the interest I have in subjects of this nature beyond that of just wanting to be informed. What to do with it though... That's the tricky part.

       Most talk about changing the system from within, but therein lies a large problem: the system eventually changes
       <em>
        you.

       It's been in place for (who can even be sure) how long?

       Being a complete outsider doesn't really give you much clout either when it comes to setting an example, because - let's be honest - who would really notice?

       It symbolically represents the pineal gland or the third eye which is thought to be where DMT is produced in near death experiences, and death itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's thought to be sort of like an antennae for you to pick up certain signals, but it's not understood well. The basic gist is that it helps with intuition and ESP if you're into that kinda stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes it a bit more interesting though, is that it can become blocked if certain materials collect in it. It starts out like an eyeball, soft and pliable, but it can eventually turn into a stone. Buddha and people who were enlightened were said to have pliable third eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pineal gland get a lot of blood flowing to it, so if you have something in your blood stream it might end up depositing there. This includes Fluoride and calcium deposits. This leads people to think that the fluoride and calcium supplement propaganda are secretly trying to destroy a bunch of pineal glands so people are much less aware of the world around them and more easily controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the whole fluoride is bad for you thing makes sense on an even deeper level.

       "The 1782 resolution adopting the seal blazons the image on the reverse as "A pyramid unfinished. In the zenith an eye in a triangle, surrounded by a glory, proper." The pyramid is conventionally shown as consisting of 13 layers to refer to the 13 original states. The adopting resolution provides that it is inscribed on its base with the date MDCCLXXVI (1776) in Roman numerals. Where the top of the pyramid should be, the Eye of Providence watches over it. Two mottos appear: Annuit cœptis signifies that Providence has "approved of (our) undertakings."[3] Novus ordo seclorum, freely taken from Virgil,[4] is Latin for "a new order of the ages."[5] The reverse has never been cut (as a seal) but appears, for example, on the back of the one-dollar bill."

       Carl Jung would probably argue that it is because its an archetype, or rather a combination of archetypes (images that have reoccured in the human consciousness for years and years), these 2 images being the pyramid/triangle and the eye. Both have pretty deep semiotic meanings, my design professor a few years back could explain it better. I cant.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the ouroboros or snake eating its own tail is an archetype. It appears in creation myths and architecture and art in almost every region and religion, often without spreading from one to another. It is just there. The benzene ring came to a scientist in a dream, he was struggling with how benzene was formed until he dreamt of a snake eating its own tail--he woke up and realized benzine was formed in a ring shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now are the triangle and eye, and both of them combined into the Eye of Providence, archetypes? Or are they so deeply embedded in culture because of ancient power-holders? Or is it both? I don't think anyone can say for sure. If you're interested in this kind of stuff, and how images can hold power over you, look into semiotics. Its the study of signs and symbolism, its taught as both art/design and psychology in Uni

       How do we explain this?  With the pyramid/eye, why does the pyramid consistently have 13 steps?  How can we share something so specific over vast periods of time and across so many cultures?  Who or what is orchestrating this, and how?

       Yeah thats the main Gnostic interpretation of it, but thats like saying "the Eye of Providence symbolizes the Illuminaughty" and being done with it. Its much much more.

       I think the first year this image appeared was on the 1923 Federal Reserve Note. We started printing currency in 1863. So if you do a little research, you'll notice that for about 60 years USD's had a variety of designs including the word ONE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Discovered FDR approved the design change in 1935, which is why I have a '34 with the "ONE" design.

       if you did more reading, you would find none of the illuminatti are 'luciferian', they are in fact 'aware that all human religion is a money making / social control scam'. they revel in the symbolism of (false) christian demons to flaunt this knowledge, and keep you from the truth.

       Its supposed to dictate America as an all seeing eye of the world, dictated to by god.
      </p>

       However, this doesn't make sense as the founding fathers were trades people (and not Christians) when they decided on this image (Which leads to the masonic conspiracy, ect).
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads to the idea of the NWO in the late 18th Century.

       Symbolism from Free Masonry.
Here:
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence
       </a>
       From the article:
"Freemasonry
      </p>
      <p>
       An early Masonic version of the Eye of Providence with clouds and a semi-circular glory
Today, the Eye of Providence is usually associated with Freemasonry. The Eye first appeared as part of the standard iconography of the Freemasons in 1797, with the publication of Thomas Smith Webb's Freemasons Monitor.[5] Here, it represents the all-seeing eye of God and is a reminder that a Mason's thoughts and deeds are always observed by God (who is referred to in Masonry as the Great Architect of the Universe). Typically, the Masonic Eye of Providence has a semi-circular glory below the eye. Sometimes the Eye is enclosed by a triangle.
Popular among conspiracy theorists is the claim that the Eye of Providence shown atop an unfinished pyramid on the Great Seal of the United States indicates the influence of Freemasonry in the founding of the United States. This was dramatized in the 2004 Disney film National Treasure. However, common Masonic use of the Eye dates to 14 years after the creation of the Great Seal. Furthermore, among the members of the various design committees for the Great Seal, only Benjamin Franklin was a Mason (and his ideas for the seal were not adopted). Indeed, many Masonic organizations have explicitly denied any connection to the creation of the Seal.[6][7]

       the pyramid is the hierarchy of control over the nwo (wealthy standing on the backs of the poor) the all seeing eye represents god(love) however the nwo pyramid has the eye detached, the symbol on the dollar = the system they want to build, a system without god, a system that dosent care if you lost your job, cant pay your bills we take your house. you are a debt slave.

       dosen't like looking at the big picture its always focusing one bad person, one issue.

      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream Question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't have we have cure for cancer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Real Question: Why is Cancer exploding?
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer: we are searching and probably never find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real Answer: Because they are giving us fucking poison! GMO,Aspartame,fluoride,High fructose Corn Syrup,Vaccines (say goodbye immune system),Chemtrails.....
      </p>

       Different Globalist's are saying openly that it will be a world goverment with world central bank,world army (NATO is a step to that).
Sure America is probably most controlled by them but they also created the Europa Union which inself is another step to a world goverment.

       Shh.  The important part of your first rebuttal is that YOU don't think so.  I made it clear that this was a pet theory of mine.  So don't treat your opinions like gospel.

       How do we explain this?  With the pyramid/eye, why does the pyramid consistently have 13 steps?  How can we share something so specific over vast periods of time and across so many cultures?  Who or what is orchestrating this, and how?

       It symbolically represents the pineal gland or the third eye which is thought to be where DMT is produced in near death experiences, and death itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's thought to be sort of like an antennae for you to pick up certain signals, but it's not understood well. The basic gist is that it helps with intuition and ESP if you're into that kinda stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes it a bit more interesting though, is that it can become blocked if certain materials collect in it. It starts out like an eyeball, soft and pliable, but it can eventually turn into a stone. Buddha and people who were enlightened were said to have pliable third eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pineal gland get a lot of blood flowing to it, so if you have something in your blood stream it might end up depositing there. This includes Fluoride and calcium deposits. This leads people to think that the fluoride and calcium supplement propaganda are secretly trying to destroy a bunch of pineal glands so people are much less aware of the world around them and more easily controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the whole fluoride is bad for you thing makes sense on an even deeper level.
