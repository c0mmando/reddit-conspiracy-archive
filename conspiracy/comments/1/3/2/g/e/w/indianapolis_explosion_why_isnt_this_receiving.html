<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ex-husband suspects faulty furnace led to massive Indianapolis explosion</strong></p>

<p>The ex-husband of the woman whose house is thought to be at the center of Saturday’s deadly explosion on the city’s Far Southside said he suspects a furnace problem led to the massive blast.</p>

<p>John Shirley, whose ex-wife Monserrate Shirley lives at the home with their 12 year-old-daughter, said he got a text from his daughter about a week-and-a-half ago telling him the heat was out and they were spending the night elsewhere.</p>

<p>“I bet you anything that’s why it happened,” he said.</p>

<p>Shirley said his daughter had told him the heat was back on, but he didn’t know whether or when any repair work had occurred.</p>

<p>Indianapolis Public Safety Director Troy Riggs says investigators suspect natural gas played some role in the blast, but added it’s going to be quite some time before they release a cause of the explosion that killed two people and damaged 80 homes.</p>

<p>Edit:  What is this massive news coverage supposed to say?  We don&#39;t know what happened yet, but let&#39;s keep showing you pictures of destroyed houses and speculate on it being a drone strike??  If news of the cause comes out, I&#39;m sure it will get a mention in the news media.</p>

<p>People should really look to see if there is coverage before presuming there&#39;s some large conspiracy to cover it up. Sometimes it takes a while for the news to do their job. But if we all calm down, and take a breath it would make this entire subreddit a little less histrionic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, a gas leak has NOT been &quot;ruled out&quot; by officials. They just have not found it yet but say they have much more investigation to do. The gas is shut off, so its not as simple to find leaks as the paranoids around theses parts believe...</p>

<p>In fact on the ground everyone is saying its &quot;most likely&quot; a gas leak. Also, an arson investigation is going on. People died, so this is a serious investigation. And if it WAS arson, they are not going to announce what they know until they exercise their leads. </p>

In fact they said they believe it is most likely a gas leak they just have to find it.

    <div class="md"><p>lol, you people crack me up.</p>

<p>a house explodes from a gas leak and you retards are saying it&#39;s everything from a drone strike to nuclear testing...</p>

<p>ask anyone who has worked in the nat gas field (like i have) and they will tell you that this is <strong>exactly</strong> what a 2 story mini mansion filled with gas looks like when it finds a spark.</p>

<p>the damage looks worse than it was initially because the explosion caused fires everywhere on what was left of the house and the neighboring houses.</p>

<p>stick built homes wrapped in plastic (vinyl siding) tend to burn very well, by the time the fire department got there the neighboring houses were completely engulfed in flames.</p>

<p>a bit of reality goes a long way here guys.</p>

<p>the &quot;there is no gas leak&quot; statements from the gas company on scene is referring to no other leaks in the area now that the obliterated houses in question have been isolated from the line (shut off from the street).</p>

<p>the only thing this rules out is an underground line break, which would be the gas companies fault. they are saying this was isolated in the home that blew the fuck up... as in a bad furnace or water heater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First: I agree with you that it was a gas leak.</p>

<p>Second: There&#39;s an art to sharing facts. I would never start a paragraph off with &quot;lol, you people crack me up&quot;. I almost stopped reading after that. </p>

<p>Third: Never call people &quot;retards&quot;. It&#39;s quite unprofessional and doesn&#39;t help with getting the facts across. Name calling is meant for youtube or middle schoolers. How is someone suppose to take you seriously? You wouldn&#39;t take someone serious that called you a &quot;retard&quot;. </p>

<p>Fourth: I&#39;d be curious if you could provide more top down images of houses that have exploded in the past. It would help with comparing the blast radius.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m sorry if you were offended at my use of &quot;retard&quot; but when i see someone calling an obvious nat gas explosion a &quot;drone strike&quot; or a nuclear test i just can&#39;t help but laugh.</p>

<p>anyway here&#39;s the situation...</p>

<p>one exploded house isn&#39;t going to look like another because of the nature of gas...</p>

<p>consider this:</p>

<p>if you had two rooms of equal size with a source of gas and a source of ignition</p>

<p>room 1 has the gas and ignition sources close to each other, room 2 has them far apart... this will result in two completely different explosions.</p>

<p>also consider that if the source of ignition is low to the ground, the nat gas will have more time to mix with the air and fill the entire volume before finding the ignition source...</p>

<p>now consider that this was a mini mansion full of multiple rooms and floors that could have filled with gas before finding the ignition source (this is what i think happened based on the reports of the sound and force of the initial explosion)</p>

<p>lets say for the sake of argument that the main floors gas fireplace leaked, and the source of ignition was the pilot light on the water heater or furnace int he basement....</p>

<p>the entire house would have filled with gas before exploding... and that is one hell of an explosion.</p>

<p>natural gas explosions happen all the time a quick google image search of &quot;natural gas house explosion&quot; will yield tons of results. but like i said... the only thing that separates a small explosion and a big explosion is the volume of gas allowed to build up prior to finding the source of ignition.</p>

<p>bottom line is i&#39;ve been in this business for decades, and this is exactly what a gas explosion looks like. in most cases, if the fire department gets there quick enough, you&#39;ll still see most of the roof, because the force of the explosion tends to radiate outward and roll flat over the ground. this is why so many neighboring houses were shifted from their foundations, and why the garage doors on the other block were blown off their tracks.</p>

<p>that pressure wave <strong>raped</strong> that neighborhood, i&#39;m shocked more people weren&#39;t killed, this was a massive explosion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for good feedback.</p>

<p>i want to jump in ahead of time here and counter the two most obvious rebuttals to my explanation...</p>

<p>&quot;safety features on the furnace/fireplace/water tank should prevent that much gas to leak&quot;</p>

<p>a break in the line, or a worker not sealing the line properly before charging the line again, would allow endless amounts of gas to leak into the house.</p>

<p>also older furnaces are often &quot;rigged&quot; by homeowners or shady repair guys to fix something by bypassing clogged or broken safety features.</p>

<p>&quot;someone would have smelled it&quot;</p>

<p>the homeowner has already said that the furnace was being repaired in the last week, and the family had been staying at a hotel until the heat worked. nobody was in the house at the time of the explosion, it was night, so most people were sleeping and wouldn&#39;t have been outside to smell the building gas in the house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah ok buddy, lol.</p>

<p>as i said above, when you design homes to withstand vertical roof load, the weak point is going to be the walls. in most cases, especially with 2 story homes, the result of a house gas explosion is a near perfect roof (minus a few shingles) atop a pile of toothpicks. the reason you don&#39;t see the roof in this explosion was the response time of the fire trucks. by the time the fire trucks showed up the roof was on fire along with both neighboring houses.</p>

<p>this is why the force of the explosion radiates outward in more of a ring than a dome.</p>

<p>go watch some 55 gal oxy-acetylene bag vids on youtube and tell me that won&#39;t blow the windows out of a house, now multiply that by a very large number to equal the volume of a house.</p>

<p>no nat gas isn&#39;t as powerful as oxy-actyl is, but it gives you a good idea of what a fuel/air explosion is capable of.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU4-S1ViZeA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU4-S1ViZeA</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt3AV9uO0_Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt3AV9uO0_Q</a></p>

<p>i have a strong suspicion that you have never witnessed a true confined gas/air explosion. with any sort of back pressure (walls of a house) you convert that fireball into a huge slamming explosion. once you are armed with the personal knowledge of how dangerous that situation is you can&#39;t look at those pics and not see that it was a nat gas explosion.</p>

<p>the difference between a skeptic and a nutjob is the ability to stop clinging onto delusions when presented with sound reason.</p>

<p>in other words, &quot;you gotta know when hold em, and you gotta know when to fold em&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just wrote a whole lot of nothing completely besides the point im making. I&#39;m not denying a gas explosion couldn&#39;t blow the house to pieces, im talking about the exterior damage TO OTHER BUILDINGS being considerably more than your usual &quot;gas explosion in the house&quot; scenario. </p>

<p>Did you even look at the link I posted? </p>

<p>FTA:</p>

<p>&quot;I have received requests to explain the following photo better. When I mention the decompression damage, this is what I am trying to say. If you have a detonation from a military grade explosive, rather than a natural gas explosion, the shock wave that goes out from the blast is supersonic and forms a wall of bunched up compressed air as it moves outward. This creates a vacuum cavity in the heart of the detonation, which can go outward for several hundred feet. Air needs to rush backwards to fill that void after the blast wave has passed, and this creates an enormous suction after the intital blast that can cause significant damage in addition to the initial blast damage. So the arrows are pointing at windows, garage doors, and exterior walls of houses that got sucked off by this negative pressure wave. The fact that the houses I refer to had the external sheathing ripped outward, instead of being blown inward, proves that this was no gas explosion, which is subsonic, it was a detonation of military grade ordinance. Explosions are subsonic, detonations are supersonic, and detonations will cause the reverse pressure wave following the blast. Subsonic explosions will not. This is what I am referring to in the high res photo.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jimstonefreelance.com/bombblast.jpg">http://www.jimstonefreelance.com/bombblast.jpg</a></p>

<p>The garage door in the far upper right side of the photo is pretty damning evidence in particular of a reverse pressure wave.</p>

<p>Also, theres this:</p>

<p>&quot;This was a much bigger blast than is being stated in the press, with eyewitnesses saying that 8 miles away it sounded like lightning hitting their homes, a recording being made at the time six miles away clearly recorded the blast, and it is not an explosion, it sounds like a detonation. Military veterans are saying it sounded exactly like military ordinance, and people two miles away from the blast say it was so loud they thought a bomb went off within their own yards. The blast effects in the high resolution photo indicate that not only was there a strong compression wave, but there was also a very strong subsequent decompression wave, with homes not badly damaged having their windows sucked out and not blown in, even while facing the direction of the blast. This effect is also visible on several garage doors.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR</p>

<p>the point you are missing is that a nat gas explosion can (and often does) produce these exact same results.</p>

<p>this wasn&#39;t &quot;a typical house/gas explosion&quot; because this wasn&#39;t a typical sized house. the bigger the house, the bigger the boom, your theory and your wackadoo source are worthless.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t. The destruction to the house itself and the one(s) immediately next door may be comparable, but a natural gas explosion would not create a reverse pressure wave, as natural gas explosions are subsonic. In other words, if it were a natural gas explosion, the damage to buildings 2 houses away and across the street would be almost nonexistent, instead we have windows being blown OUTWARDS, which is a sign of a reverse pressure supersonic wave, typical of military ordinance.</p>

<p>A bigger house may create a bigger boom, but it still doesn&#39;t up the explosion velocity to supersonic. That&#39;s physics for ya.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no i just stopped reading your ramblings after you started in with the same bullshit from before...</p>

<p>where some guy speculates on how powerful an explosion was that he didn&#39;t witness.</p>

<p>you have no idea what you are talking about. just because some link on some conspiracy website uses words you&#39;ve never heard before (reverse pressure wave, or subsonic) doesn&#39;t make them right.</p>

<p>if you confine any fuel air bomb it will absolutely create this type of destruction. also it&#39;s very clearly not &quot;reverse pressure&quot; when bits of the house and the surrounding houses were blown away from the explosion.</p>

<p>a very large volume of nat gas mixed with oxygen in any sort of confinement (a house) will indeed cause a &quot;supersonic&quot; explosion.</p>

<p>i can create a supersonic explosion with common 70/30 flash powder... you don&#39;t need &quot;military ordinance&quot; to create a shockwave.</p>

<p>this whole theory of yours is not holding water at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>could you provide the link?</p>

<p>E: Also if the sound is similar it may have been what I heard this morning at about 3:00 am. I don&#39;t think that is was a private plane as it was pouring rain and windy at the time. It also seemed to be flying incredible fast and low. I have a modicum of knowledge about aircraft from flight lessons as a kid. As well my bro, uncles and grandfather are all licensed pilots. So I thought it might be a drone as we have an air guard base in town and there are a few other air bases in the state.   </p>

<p>Drone accident? Its no secret they&#39;re now being used by both public and private agencies alike.</p>

<p>E2: there to they&#39;re in last sentence. I was at work...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had to guess, synthesizing drugs. Grey market research chemicals (dem baff salts) only come from 2 places: legitimate chem labs with criminal intentions, or criminals with impressive-but-illegitimate chem labs. Maybe it was meth, too, but I suspect if it was a drug explosion it is research chemicals. Since theyre being developed/prototyped so quickly these days, I can easily see the recipes being popular on the black market. Less competition then meth, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Source? Because you are wrong. Nobody said &quot;ruled out&quot; they said they just cant find it yet and they have more investigation to do. In fact they said they believe it is most likely a gas leak they just have to find it. Its starting to sound like it was a faulty furnace, which would explain why they cant find problems in the gas lines. Why dont any of you handle details? </p>
