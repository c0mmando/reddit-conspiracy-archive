       It's interesting how subs like this begin to go downhill and more regulated with every subscriber gained. When it was at 60,000 subscribers r/conspiracy was relevant. Now at 90,000 you have to know there are at least a few people paid by government agencies to disrupt our open forum. I have even heard of moderators being paid to regulate content. Not here but anything is possible.

       Keep us updated bro. Also, try to compare how well these posts do on weekends compared to weekdays (esp. on Saturday). Personally, I think Israel/Middle-East posts seem to avoid the downvote brigade when posted on weekends.

       Im more upset that the general populous wants to discuss topics that have been proven false. That is all I have been trying to say all day. It just seems that no one seems to care that these topics are false. Thats frustrating. Especially, when you get massively downvoted for trying to point this out

       I know you are gone already, but perhaps you are checking this still.. You are leaving because people insist the world is going to end 12-21-12?  Am I correct on this?

       It seems like there's a significant amount of "crazy conspiracies" on the front page as of late, or stories that are clearly just looking for a conspiracy when there isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now we've got the whistle-blowers who has been missing for 8 hours (he's already been found, alive); the story about FEMA camps being set up outside New York, as if its some conspiracy that a disaster-response agency would respond to a natural disaster; a video about Rumsfeld being a lizard (possibly a joke, Poe's Law is a bitch); a post about a book that's coming out detailing one man's coma-induced visions of a multiverse; an Indianapolis explosion that's received no media coverage, despite actually receiving ridiculous media coverage...
      </p>
      <p>
       There are genuine conspiracies out there, with good evidence behind them. Theories worth discussing. But the reason conspiracy theorists aren't taken seriously is due to a fallacy of generalization. You could present the most well-designed argument for a 9/11 cover-up theory, but people may still ask if you brought your tin-foil hat with you. And suddenly nothing you say matters, and the people behind the cover-up win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a very fine line to tread. On the one hand, associating your community with any of the legitimately
       <em>
        crazy
       </em>
       theories means instant decreditation for the theories which have evidence. But, on the other hand, every theory in any field comes about because someone is asking questions; ignoring the crazies could mean that we'd miss something legitimate that they put forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is relevant to the topic at hand because as the population of this subreddit grows, we gain people at either end of the spectrum. We gain people who are here because they genuinely believe Rumsfeld is a lizard, and they'll make the community look terrible by talking about it. We gain government agents who are just browsing as part of their job; maybe they upvote the crazies to discredit legitimate discussion. We gain all manor of people, and this furthers the fallacy of generalization.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just as these last elections have shown; when communities get larger, the middle-ground is the first segment to disappear. The middle-ground is where all the best discussion happens, because its where people of conflicting opinions can find something similar to talk about and agree upon. The people there learn to walk that fine line, and when they're gone then it leaves a community that isn't worth participating in.

       Agree. Consider that at least 50% of the people posting are being compensated to forward or retard certain ideas.

       I deleted my main and started using accounts that I delete now and then. It is not worth it to pretend at "community" and "identity" here because the majority of posters are shills or conspiratard trolls.

       I don't know why I despise Alex jones so much. But just hearing his voice or seeing his face. I wanna punch it. It seems like he's doing it for the wrong reasons and he's just a bad model. His info is okay, but he is the messenger. And he's one I wanna shoot.

       If you don't like him thats okay there are many other sources for information.

       Overall he did a great job awaking millions of people and he really is trying
to make the "alternative Media" the "Mainstream Media".

       He did take action and did build Infowars from ground up alone for this he gets my respect.

       Do you know of a different subreddit that would be better to visit? Or is there a new subreddit that we should start where you can provide only facts based on conspiracies. Meaning, when we know a conspiracy is Bull, we no longer discuss that one and move onto more important ones

       Any idea on where people can discuss conspiracies without being attacked? I'd be interested in rational discussion of conspiracy theories with people that can handle complex arguments and understand how to support a point with evidence.

       Well there isn't like a major paranormal sub or anything like that. But the problem is that
       <strong>
        every
       </strong>
       sub-reddit is a circlejerk. You don't go there unless you want to be apart of that sub. So if you go against any of the 'status quo' parts of any sub, you'll be down voted as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no forum that allows for free flowing, thought provoking discussion, because the second there's a debate, people just start throwing up votes and down votes around and bury it - so intelligent discussion is impossible.

       Forget the votes. I don't care about those numbers (see my negative karma on the post you responded to).

      <p>
       I'd like a place where people can actually use rhetoric to create arguments that made sense. And when they saw something they disagreed with, they would use rhetoric to create an argument that makes sense.

       I don't mind the people posting links to stuff they haven't yet realized is discounted, as frustrating as it might be. It's really their response when you provide them with information that discounts their theory that bothers me.

       Thats just sad. Fact is fact. The less you circulate it, the less it's known.
