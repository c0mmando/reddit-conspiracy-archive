       Many of us are convinced that some element of "the fringe" which most people scoff at is in fact true.  I am referring to anything you'd find under "Metaphysical" in a bookstore: UFOs, ghosts, ESP, etc.  I'm curious to hear from others who have been convinced about something which mainstream science calls 'fantasy'.  What do you 'know' is real which most others disbelieve, and why do you believe it?

       I agree with the second sentence. People are doubting many things today because science has yet to prove them. Instead of thinking for themselves  and using their own thought process or intuition, they just believe every study they see, merely for the reason that the person who conducted it is of a higher authority.

       Television. Television is the main driver in deadening the sense of the mind. And because so many people only believe in the mind, their power to affect their reality become dependent on their inputs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why television

       was retooled after a study by one
       <a href="http://www.jayhanson.us/page24.htm">
        Herbert Krugman
       </a>
       found that television puts human beings into a suggestive state within a minute of watching, wherein the subconscious absorbs ALL messages being sent to it regardless of sex, race, or creed.

       Does that have anything to do with the fact that if I sleep in silence, I have crazy dreams. Many of which are sleep paralysis or just fucked up. However, I purposefully turn on the TV at night to give noise. A radio isn't enough though because it doesn't give off a "presence" like a TV does. Like that high pitched noise I guess.
Not to get too weird here but my friends say that electronic devices interfere with ghosts, which is where I think my dreams mainly come from. Do you have any more information on this phenomenon?

       Yes. Yes it does. Embrace the dreams. Your subconscious is trying to communicate something to you. It might just be warning you of the mental paralysis that it's experiencing when you inundate it with programming all night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me guess, you always wake up tired? And then you're shocked that it feels like you didn't sleep at all. Guess what? You kind of didn't.

       The problem is the opposite though. Sorry for my bad communication. I only have sleep paralysis in the silence. I do think it tries to tell me things but it scares me. The TV is kinda like my guard at night to keep me from dreaming. I kinda wanted to stop dreaming because I was getting sick of waking up in fear all the time.
It is true though. I normally don't feel like I slept. It was all just a dull roar.

       I can't ask you to face your fears. But television isn't doing you any favors, trust me. That you think it's a GUARD is proof it's programming is effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn it off for a week, see if you don't sleep better. Don't think about what's happened to you in the past, the past is irrelevant. Learn about meditation, do some before you sleep. As you begin to assert your OWN control over your reality, the energies that try to wrest that control from you will lose power over you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I cannot make you do anything. But I can tell you that turning off television and doing some internal exploration is quite a bit more rewarding than the haze you get from overnight programming.

       Any external stimulus is going to interfere (to some degree) with your minds normal nighttime patterns of "re-processing" whatever data it's holding. Even though you're sleeping, your senses are still somewhat "aware" and will instinctively transmit any new stimuli to your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silence produces better dreams because it allows your brain to focus-inward better.. and your dreams feel more vivid.. and your sleep patterns (REM and other frequencies) are allowed to cycle more naturally.

       Its funny you say that.  I hate the electronical devices which, with every new model has a light that gets brighter and brighter. WHY. Do i really need to know that the tv or printer is still on. I mean is there NO other way to let me know other than a green or red light that can light the whole room at 3am. It has a purpose but WHY.  BUt thank fully if those fail I have either the light from a smoke detector 7 ft above my head or the warm glow from a lamp post on the city street. We are lookign for new sources of energy and get wasting so much more. Didnt mean to gripe but come on. Good post though

       But how can you assume this if all the information that you have gathered in your life time has been through your human senses? So I don't see how you can conclude that there is something more without a possible way of even witnessing a hint of that "hidden reality"?

       It would be considered conspiratorial mostly because of the seemingly massive effort by the education system to teach children to believe modern civilization only goes back 12,000 years or so, originating in the introduction of sedentary agriculture.

       You know, I keep seeing private accounts coming on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and datamining who has positions on what conspiracy theories over the past few months. And while I'm sure 5% of them are true seekers, it reinforces the fact that reddit is under surveillance by any number of disinfo groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP, I'm not necessarily talking about you, per se. But I have watched as people making inquiries not unlike your own are exposed as shills, disinfo agents, and psyop aggressors.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's definitely a conspiracy theory that is real. And why is it important? Because it reinforces indirectly the power that people have to crush these cowardly, backwards organizations intent on maintaining Human oppression and retarding progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cannot win, and their participants will be buried with their  outdated organizations.

       Hmmm.  If I'd known that I may have phrased my inquiry differently I guess.  I'm only seeking the truth that those organizations you speak of suppress, in my opinion.  Mostly I read books and articles on this subject (as opposed to having blind faith in every poorly done website with contradictory theories), because I feel it's important to be more skeptical than not, so I don't fall for any old crap such as the disinformation/misinformation I know is everywhere.  But if others are doing the same thing I am, they will have come up with similar theories with hard-to-refute evidence, even if it's just a good book.  That is what I am seeking.  I myself have had to change some of my beliefs, so I'm also seeking to hone my analytic skills, I guess.
Heck, look at my history, even my handle betrays me as an otaku.

       I would say that the first thing that comes to mind is that we are not alone in the Universe. I say that from a personal experience: One day when I was in high school I was gazing outside the window and then suddenly in the sky appeared at least 8 orbs of light that were moving at an incredible speed and in a geometric formation. I was totally speechless and I even thought I was imagining until I look to my left and I see a girl looking at them too, so I asked her are you seeing this and she was like yes! Now this is just one personal example, but if you factor in the millions of other sightings from other people all over the world throughout history, then something tangible must be out there. There is a documentary that will be coming soon called Sirius that will have testimony from verified government insiders about the reality of other intelligent life forms. In my opinion, the government withholds this information because it does not bode well with its agenda to keep us dumbed down and easily controlled.  I would say at least 90 percent of the people here in USA are wage slaves who work at least 8 hours per day in a stressful job, then come back to "relax" and watch TV only to be subliminally programmed on how to think, spend their hard earned cash, etc... No one has the time anymore to contemplate who they are and what is their purpose for being here...

       The problem is such testimonies aren't actual evidence. We can't look at or examine them. They're stories from people. Nothing tangible in that. Too many other possible explanations, we need data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, don't make the mistake of correlating UFO with ALIEN. Those "orbs" you may have seen could've just as easily been us humans testing some currently classified technology. The Stealth bomber was in production for 2 decades before it was revealed to the public. What do you think they are working on now?

       Yes, and none of the sources of infrasound would suggest that ghosts are real, merely that there may be a scientific explanation for why people's senses fool them into thinking ghosts are present.

       exactly!  People perceive them as ghosts.  The perception of
       <em>
        something

       is real, but not what they think they are

       OK. But I wouldn't say that ghosts are real, any more than I'd say that the sensation of "knowing God" under certain hallucinogenic drugs means that God is real. It's just a sensation we can trigger.

       I disagree.  Nobody knows what ghosts are.  They have merely use the term "ghosts" to describe the sensations that they perceive at this level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, many UFO's we see in the sky, especially at night, are merely reflections: lights off cloud formations, mist, swamp gas, etc

       Right, but "ghost" doesn't mean "infrasound hallucination that we falsely believe is the disembodied spirit of a dead person," it means "disembodied spirit of a dead person." Seeing the difference? You can say that people mistakenly believe that these are disembodied spirits, but you can't say "disembodied spirits are real! Except they're just sounds that make our brains do funny things, not actually disembodied spirits."
      </p>
      <p>
       I get where you're trying to go with the semiotic connection, but the word has a meaning independent of the specific sensation.

       Good thing too because you're literally no different than scientists who claim to know something they don't. You literally have no clue what you're talking about - and that's fine, none of us do when it comes to ghosts, but to claim otherwise is retarded. And you've both claimed otherwise AND said that you don't know what a ghost is - making you extremely illogical.

       I think what's trying to happen here is that it's easy to mistake a vibration induced experience as a ghost. But I still think it's different than a-oh-holy-fuck-a-clear-person-is-in-front-of-me.

       We are more than physical beings. We have a spirit with spiritual senses. Just one of MANY examples is when my buddies were at this guys house and unknown to them, he went in the bathroom to smoke meth. They said shortly after, they didn't SMELL it, but the atmosphere felt wrong, like someone had just done something really bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few minutes later he came out and said he had done meth.

       I believe in Aliens, Extra-Dimensional beings, Angels and Demons. I simply refuse to believe that the millions of accounts of such beings are all fabrications. Where there is smoke there's fire and these ideas had to have had some real life inspiration. There are definitely made up stories here and there but I just find it difficult to believe that all of them are.

       While It may not be "fringe", although the massive rise in militant atheism might make it seem so, I do believe there probably is some sort of prime creator of existence. I don't claim it as fact but that is what I personally believe based on my experiences until I see undeniable evidence to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said before, when there's smoke there is fire, so I believe there is at least some truth to most of the big things out there like UFOs, ghosts, ESP, etc.

       Humanity is older than we know, and neither are we the first intelligent civilization on earth. However, I believe this is out of ignorance and a pitifully incomplete fossil record, rather than malice and conspiracy.

       Geoengineering is real, but the people behind it believe they're doing good, like Thalidomide or bloodletting out other practices that begin with the best intentions but have horrible consequences.

       Many Americans (and possibly others, but I can only speak from experience) are living a completely manufactured life. From birth to death, their lives revolve around various manufactured products. Diapers, baby clothes, toys, packaged food, picture books, textbooks, bathroom supplies, lawn care, home improvement, caskets, every single thing they every encounter being preordained by suits in a board room somewhere, programmed by television. While it's completely possible not to, so few people even realize this is going on that it just keeps going. Television is almost entirely used to reinforce this.

       Psychedelic drugs are way more significant than misty people would be willing to admit, and if their use were as widespread as in the past, western religion would not exist. Furthermore, the genocide of the various american peoples was motivated by the fact that direct spiritual gnosis was a part of the culture, instead of having a patriarch dispense the approved rhetoric.

       Spirit guide stuff, and its related material such as higher dimensional "souls" and consciousness. That said, I don't outright live my life by this - yet - but I've had several convincing encounters with evidence, personally. Briefly, one being an interaction in a dream where I had a word in a foreign language of which I have no knowledge revealed to me. It was presented to me in our letter system and I google searched to find the proper transliteration in any random language, and it was precisely a foreign word with a relevant meaning to the question I was asking in my dream. I can't argue against that and some other things. Still investigating but I believe our consciousness, souls, what have you come from higher dimensions that we cant perceive in this state.

       There has to be some sort of life other than humans, so aliens. Also, not paranormal but conspiracy related theory is about 9/11, it just doesn't add up and I don't believe what the people were told about it. I believe that there is something along the lines of esp that exists and that dreams and such things can be ways in which we are given information but we don't take it seriously. I have dreamed of things happening before they have and have spoken to many people who also have had this experience.

       i believe the freemasons are connected to the illuminati. my great grandfather was offered to be a 33rd degree, he declined, lost everything he had, and all of the children in the family died of weird deaths or were born sterile. thats what happens when you put your name in a book, i guess.

       Good. Glad you're getting downvoted for this. It's an honorary degree based on good deeds...There are only 32degrees. The 33rd is nothing more it's just recognition by your lodge of the good deeds you've done that's all. Many people turn it down and lead normal lives. Clearly your great grandfather was not a freemason or someone who told you the story is full of shit.

       I agree with the Ur stuff (China and India and Jomon) but it's not really conspiratorial or supernatural is it?

       OK. But I wouldn't say that ghosts are real, any more than I'd say that the sensation of "knowing God" under certain hallucinogenic drugs means that God is real. It's just a sensation we can trigger.
