    <div class="md"><p>Osama Bin Laden is dead since 2001.</p>

<p>This is a good example how the mainstream can spin things.</p>

<p>Dr. Steve Pieczenik confirmed he was dead since 2001.</p>

<p>I also love how the fake Bin Laden is getting younger then 2001 Bin Laden lol.

<p>The Picture they released are also fake.</p>

<p>They buried him at sea, i mean how obvious must it get? and the seal time is dying next month in a helicopter crash right......</p>

<p>Bin Laden worked for the CIA there is no question about it and helped to create the false Flag 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even think he was personally involved in 9/11 in any shape or form. I think he was an CIA asset and remained so for all his life, but I don&#39;t think he was involved or even knew about 9/11. I think he was as surprised when he got the blame as anyone with decent real understanding was.</p>

<p>I think he was basically used and then protected, even though some agencies of the US government really went after him and through operation Able Danger could have even gotten him if Bush didn&#39;t order the stand down.</p>

<p>I think he probably died in 2003 or 2004, since we had reports that he was at the Dubai Hospital and then in Pakistani hospital after 2001. So I think either 2003 or 2004 is when he died from kidney failure.</p>

<p>if you look at this supposedly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB0ftf53JYs">video</a> from him its clear that this is not Bin Laden.</p>

<p>Also he using the TV remote with the right hand, he was left handed.</p>

<p>I think the CIA gave them a new guy which they killed in the raid with the Navy Seal Team.</p>

<p>They killed probably the Navy Seal&#39;s who did see him because of fear someone would speak out.</p>

<p>A former CIA offical admited that they where creating fake video&#39;s. <a href="http://www.infowars.com/former-cia-officials-admit-to-faking-bin-laden-video/">Source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely possible. On the other hand she was delivering a well rehearsed and extremely important statement that amounted to her insurance file.</p>

<p>This is a women who has been given credible information that a network of powerful groups were out to kill her (which they succeeded in doing a few months after that video).</p>

<p>She knew who the real movers and shakers are in Pakistan who really gives the orders, which are certainly not some illiterate farmer/foot soldier.</p>

<p>It seems possible that this was a grenade chosen to let people know how powerful the information she had was.</p>

<p>Of course she may have been misinformed and therefore her enemies knew she had nothing or maybe they decided no one would believe/care anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To a scientist: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>

<p>Government: &quot;We killed Osama Bin Laden!&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Cool, can you show me some evidence?&quot;</p>

<p>Government: &quot;We dropped it into the ocean in accordance with Muslim burial rites..&quot;</p>

<p>Me: &quot;Muslims don&#39;t do that, they mostly live in the deser-&quot;</p>

<p>Government: &quot;SHUT UP TRAITOR!&quot;</p>

<p>In conclusion, I&#39;m sort of inclined to believe he died shortly after the invasion of Afghanistan. The Bush admin wanted to stay in Afghanistan for the long haul, and having a boogeyman to look for was good for their narrative. If they told everyone he was dead, there would no longer be an excuse to stay. In 2011, the Obama admin conducted a raid in Pakistan killing some bearded guy who looked similar and threw his corpse into the Arabian Sea. Motivation? Instant 10% bump in the polls. </p>

<p>The funny part is that if Bush pulled this same stunt, probably nobody would believe him - especially the people on the left. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so you kill off your special forces every time they are on a mission you aren&#39;t going to have special forces for very long are you?  And who is going to do the hit, surely if you had someone assassinate a whole special forces group you would then have to assassinate them to keep it quiet right?</p>

<p>There is no logic to killing someone to keep them silent when there whole job is keeping silent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. Let me rephrase it.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say the US didn&#39;t kill bin Laden. Let&#39;s say it was all just a PR stunt. Al Qaeda are going to know if their leader is alive or not. That means they have spent the past year and a half existing with the world&#39;s opinion that the Americans managed to kill their leader, when in reality they know that this is not true. Bear in mind the importance of publicity for al Qaeda - if they knew the Americans had not managed to kill OBL, they would gain a seriously massive coup of publicity by showing the world that OBL was still alive and the Americans had been bullshitting us. It would be the spark of a recruitment drive that al Qaeda leaders could only dream about. But obviously that has not happened, so I think it&#39;s fair to conclude that somehow - by whatever means, which may or may not follow the official story - the Americans managed to kill Osama bin Laden.</p>

<p>Now we have the Americans in possession of the body of bin Laden. They have to bury the body fast - it has to be a &quot;clean&quot; kill - to avoid incurring the wrath of yet more al Qaeda operatives and potential operatives. Think about it - if it were taken back to the US, or Muslim burial rites were not properly observed, there would be cries all across the Islamic world of how the Americans had desecrated the body of a Muslim and so on. </p>

<p>So they can bury him at land, where they run the risk of his body and grave being found by his supporters. If that happened, they could turn the grave into a shrine to OBL, which would also serve al Qaeda&#39;s cause as a great PR stunt. The US doesn&#39;t want to run that risk, so they decide to bury him at sea, where they can be sure that his grave won&#39;t be found. This way it disposes of the body cleanly - with no chance of the location being found - and properly, so it cannot be said that they did not disrespect Muslim burial traditions.</p>

<p>The photos. If a picture of OBL&#39;s body were released, al Qaeda could again use it as a recruitment drive. There&#39;s no need to release pictures of a dead body, yet those pictures in the hands of al Qaeda could prove extremely dangerous. It would drum up support for their cause and would help elevate OBL to the status of a martyr for their <em>jihad</em>, both of which for obvious reasons the Americans want to avoid. </p>

<p>Nonsense. Asymmetrical damage results in asymmetrical failure, that&#39;s basic physics. For example sake, see <a href="http://youtu.be/ZORb0zdEb7Y">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you expect it to tip over like a tree?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, WTC7 could&#39;ve taken a lot more impact damage and far more intense fires without cumming down, had it not been rigged to come down. The same goes for the towers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re not built to withstand lateral forces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They most certainly are, otherwise hurricanes would flatten them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except al-Qaeda have confirmed that he was killed. Why would they do that if he was still alive? It would be a massive coup for them if after the Americans were celebrating how great they were for killing OBL, he came out and showed the world he was still alive. </p>

<p>And as for the burial at sea thing, it makes perfect sense. Releasing images or film, or burying him on land in a grave that could be found by his supporters, would only help elevate him to martyrdom status which could prove damaging to the Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll jump in here. I don&#39;t believe that the US necessarily killed him, but I believe he&#39;s dead.</p>

<p>The US govt would be loathe to get caught lying about something like this, especially if, say, another attack happened and a new Osama video came out taking credit. Heads would roll in the administration if that went down. So it makes sense that they would, in the interest of preservation of their jobs/careers, not announce he was dead if he wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>What they <em>would</em> d would be to tell the media that they killed him with a SpecOps mission after confirming that he was dead through intelligence.</p>
