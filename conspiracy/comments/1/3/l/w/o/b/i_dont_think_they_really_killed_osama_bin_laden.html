       I just don't get how they can claim a burial at sea. There are no images or film? The witnesses, technically, aren't allowed to even share what they went through. There just wasn't enough proof, I guess, that it was him...or that it even really happened! If you think you can change my mind, please, make me believe. What am I missing? Does anyone else feel like everything we've been told about how shit went down was just one giant lie? (BTW - I'm a registered independent and I voted for Obama in both elections. This isn't an issue with the president, or the election, or Republicans vs. Democrats. This is just a serious question of how the hell can that be it?)

       Osama Bin Laden is dead since 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a good example how the mainstream can spin things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Steve Pieczenik confirmed he was dead since 2001.

       I also love how the fake Bin Laden is getting younger then 2001 Bin Laden lol.

       They buried him at sea, i mean how obvious must it get? and the seal time is dying next month in a helicopter crash right......

       Bin Laden worked for the CIA there is no question about it and helped to create the false Flag 9/11.

       The Pakistan Media released it.

       The US Goverment released no photos because it could cause violence.

       I don't even think he was personally involved in 9/11 in any shape or form. I think he was an CIA asset and remained so for all his life, but I don't think he was involved or even knew about 9/11. I think he was as surprised when he got the blame as anyone with decent real understanding was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he was basically used and then protected, even though some agencies of the US government really went after him and through operation Able Danger could have even gotten him if Bush didn't order the stand down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he probably died in 2003 or 2004, since we had reports that he was at the Dubai Hospital and then in Pakistani hospital after 2001. So I think either 2003 or 2004 is when he died from kidney failure.

       if you look at this supposedly
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB0ftf53JYs">
        video
       </a>
       from him its clear that this is not Bin Laden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also he using the TV remote with the right hand, he was left handed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the CIA gave them a new guy which they killed in the raid with the Navy Seal Team.
      </p>
      <p>
       They killed probably the Navy Seal's who did see him because of fear someone would speak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A former CIA offical admited that they where creating fake video's.

       Definitely possible. On the other hand she was delivering a well rehearsed and extremely important statement that amounted to her insurance file.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a women who has been given credible information that a network of powerful groups were out to kill her (which they succeeded in doing a few months after that video).
      </p>
      <p>
       She knew who the real movers and shakers are in Pakistan who really gives the orders, which are certainly not some illiterate farmer/foot soldier.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems possible that this was a grenade chosen to let people know how powerful the information she had was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course she may have been misinformed and therefore her enemies knew she had nothing or maybe they decided no one would believe/care anyway.

       It's hard to judge. Either she meant to say Bin Laden, in which case her revelation is highly significant, or she meant to say

       It makes me laugh how his death was too "gruesome" for the American public, yet it doesn't bother the American propaganda machine to post every other gruesome image they could find.

       The real issue for me is that they didn't feel that they needed to get this verified. Even without releasing photos to the public they could allow journalists and academics free reign over the material. I think this means there is either a genuine cover up or it suits their interests to fuel conspiracy theories (just as possible imo).

       I remember the news when gaddafi was killed, no US media outlet censored that. They dragged his ass around the city like a rag doll. Gruesome death my ass if they had true images they would of shown them.

       In conclusion, I'm sort of inclined to believe he died shortly after the invasion of Afghanistan. The Bush admin wanted to stay in Afghanistan for the long haul, and having a boogeyman to look for was good for their narrative. If they told everyone he was dead, there would no longer be an excuse to stay. In 2011, the Obama admin conducted a raid in Pakistan killing some bearded guy who looked similar and threw his corpse into the Arabian Sea. Motivation? Instant 10% bump in the polls.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny part is that if Bush pulled this same stunt, probably nobody would believe him - especially the people on the left.

       Yes but you don't need to kill everyone to send a clear message. If these guys were involved in a cover up I wouldn't want to be one of the guys who were actually in the helicopter that 'dropped' Bin Laden into the sea.

       Ok so you kill off your special forces every time they are on a mission you aren't going to have special forces for very long are you?  And who is going to do the hit, surely if you had someone assassinate a whole special forces group you would then have to assassinate them to keep it quiet right?

       Read my new post I've just submitted. No sailor on the ship saw the body, the admiral was fired, the Pentagon has no death certificate, no DNA, no proof and the burial is not in accordance with Islamic law, especially Wahhabism which Bin Laden was supposedly a follower of.

       Do you really believe that on the one hand they can pull off 9/11 and
       <em>

       , and at the same time, they can not make a believable Osama bin Laden death story?

       I believe they want us to know these things. They need us in the future. They need people like us, so they can point their fucking finger and say, "That's the bad guy".

       Yes, I think they pulled off both stunts rather well. The majority of the people believe both there lies. You say, if  like maybe 19 Muslim high jackers really pulled off that amazing stunt. It's not that they need people like us as much as there are people like us who are not falling for the lies so they will have to demonize us for sure.

       OK. Let me rephrase it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say the US didn't kill bin Laden. Let's say it was all just a PR stunt. Al Qaeda are going to know if their leader is alive or not. That means they have spent the past year and a half existing with the world's opinion that the Americans managed to kill their leader, when in reality they know that this is not true. Bear in mind the importance of publicity for al Qaeda - if they knew the Americans had not managed to kill OBL, they would gain a seriously massive coup of publicity by showing the world that OBL was still alive and the Americans had been bullshitting us. It would be the spark of a recruitment drive that al Qaeda leaders could only dream about. But obviously that has not happened, so I think it's fair to conclude that somehow - by whatever means, which may or may not follow the official story - the Americans managed to kill Osama bin Laden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have the Americans in possession of the body of bin Laden. They have to bury the body fast - it has to be a "clean" kill - to avoid incurring the wrath of yet more al Qaeda operatives and potential operatives. Think about it - if it were taken back to the US, or Muslim burial rites were not properly observed, there would be cries all across the Islamic world of how the Americans had desecrated the body of a Muslim and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they can bury him at land, where they run the risk of his body and grave being found by his supporters. If that happened, they could turn the grave into a shrine to OBL, which would also serve al Qaeda's cause as a great PR stunt. The US doesn't want to run that risk, so they decide to bury him at sea, where they can be sure that his grave won't be found. This way it disposes of the body cleanly - with no chance of the location being found - and properly, so it cannot be said that they did not disrespect Muslim burial traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The photos. If a picture of OBL's body were released, al Qaeda could again use it as a recruitment drive. There's no need to release pictures of a dead body, yet those pictures in the hands of al Qaeda could prove extremely dangerous. It would drum up support for their cause and would help elevate OBL to the status of a martyr for their
       <em>
        jihad
       </em>
       , both of which for obvious reasons the Americans want to avoid.

       I actually think OBL has been dead for years, well before the Marines "got him". The man had kidney disease; however, keeping him (and the myth) alive was a big part of the war on terror story line.

       No, that had the simple solution of watermelon. Watermelon hydrates well enough that it has been used to treat kidney disease for centuries as a kind of poor-man's dialysis, and a few sources confirmed that Bin Laden was using "watermelon" therapy in lieu of dialysis.

       You're right.  He had a kidney disease that would not have permitted him to live for more than a couple of years after 9/11.  He was on dialysis.  We know this because he was treated at a US hospital in Dubai in 2001.

       OK, granted but he has to be dead, right? Too much to risk by saying he's dead if he's really still alive, even if he's a prisoner. Right? The burial at sea seems like patent nonsense, but I assume that he was more useful "alive" in the previous 10 years and when Obama learned he was really dead, he decided to cash that in for political points and cloture on the war we are "withdrawing" from in Iraq.

       It's nice that you put out your voting info.  Now shut up, and never do that again.  I don't believe the official story.  I doubt they'd killed him, he is an ally after all.  Let me leave you with a thought, after JFK assassination, they would not let anyone see the body, this is the official story, case closed people; any time you hear that, come back here, maybe we'll know something.

       It's disturbing that there are actually people downvoting you for merely asking. These people have no reason to believe what the media tells them. They just know no different. It is so far out of the realm of possibility to them that the media would ever tell them something that didn't actually happen, or tell them a version of events that isn't 100% fact. These same people are fine when the "official" story changes, never questioning the reasoning and basically forgetting the original version. Fucking idiots.

       The entire saga of the War on Terror™ is really bad theatre. This piece of it, this 'we killed the bad guy' is indicative of really bad storytelling, and the "evidence" we were shown served only to elicit guffaws and eyerolls by anyone with an IQ above lint. The old man watching TV in some hovel was pathetic, and the dramatic reaction photo by all of the politicians was plain silly. Then they follow it up with the porn stash. But as preposterous as it all is, they wouldn't put it out there unless they thought we'd eat it up, and

       . Now they can pretty much tell us anything and it is widely accepted as truth.

       Okay, good to know I'm not the only one that feels all that they claim happened seems a little...I dunno, too convenient to be true? It's all so "pay no attention to the man behind the curtain". I can't say a photo of a dead Bid Laden would have really proved much either (anyone can fake that!) but I guess I just need something visual.

       I suspect that he died many years ago, and that the videos that the MSM published of him, were faked.  If they actually had him, you can bet that they would have taken pictures, but since they didn't, it's safe to say that they are lying.

       A big huge flaming chunk of building 1 hit in in a critical area. There are videos of it. Building 7 is not a mystery except to those who desperately want to believe that it is a mystery.

       You forgot the part about how it was on fire for all those hours. And "into its own footrpint" is more or less how tall structures collapse; that's engineering 101. If you understood how these things are built you'd understand that there's really no other way for them to fall. Did you expect it to tip over like a tree? They're not built to withstand lateral forces.

       No, WTC7 could've taken a lot more impact damage and far more intense fires without cumming down, had it not been rigged to come down. The same goes for the towers.

       Except al-Qaeda have confirmed that he was killed. Why would they do that if he was still alive? It would be a massive coup for them if after the Americans were celebrating how great they were for killing OBL, he came out and showed the world he was still alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the burial at sea thing, it makes perfect sense. Releasing images or film, or burying him on land in a grave that could be found by his supporters, would only help elevate him to martyrdom status which could prove damaging to the Americans.

       Because the mainstream media said so. Plus, they made two movies about it. You can't get more official than that.

       I'll jump in here. I don't believe that the US necessarily killed him, but I believe he's dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US govt would be loathe to get caught lying about something like this, especially if, say, another attack happened and a new Osama video came out taking credit. Heads would roll in the administration if that went down. So it makes sense that they would, in the interest of preservation of their jobs/careers, not announce he was dead if he wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       d would be to tell the media that they killed him with a SpecOps mission after confirming that he was dead through intelligence.

       Okay, good to know I'm not the only one that feels all that they claim happened seems a little...I dunno, too convenient to be true? It's all so "pay no attention to the man behind the curtain". I can't say a photo of a dead Bid Laden would have really proved much either (anyone can fake that!) but I guess I just need something visual.

       No. Since he was a Wahhabist's no marking or headstones are allowed at the burial site and it is completely anonymous. Where did Al Qaeda confirm Bin Laden's death?
      </p>
      <p>
       On an Internet forum which could be fucking anyone.

       Except al-Qaeda is a front of CIA's why would they release contradicting reports if they are both working for the same goal?
