<p>Also, this same thing was posted about people camping out at theaters for breaking dawn part 1.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re camping out with the intention of spending money, you get the green light. If you&#39;re camping out to change the status quo, you get arrested.</p>

<p>If you consider the raids to be a violation of protesters&#39; 1st amendment rights, they could have commited a &quot;Conspiracy against rights&quot; as defined by United States Code Title 18:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>§ 241. Conspiracy against rights</strong></p>

<p>If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any inhabitant of any State, Territory, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same; or</p>

<p>If two or more persons go in disguise on the highway, or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured -</p>

<p>They shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results, they shall be subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life.</p>

<p><strong>§ 242. Deprivation of rights under color of law</strong></p>

<p>Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any inhabitant of any State, Territory, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or to different punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such inhabitant being an alien, or by reason of his color, or race, than are prescribed for the punishment of citizens, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if bodily injury results shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results shall be subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life.</p>

I didn&#39;t watch the segment, it was just a quick blurb advertising the segment for Fox 11 News Los Angeles, and it came up as I was scrolling through my DVR to pick something to watch.</p>

<p>A better guess as to when they ran the story would be Tuesday November 13, or Wednesday 14. At any rate I&#39;m giving up looking because the whole concept of Black Friday disgusts me. </p>

Yes, the police over-reacted in some instances, but it was entirely legal for them to remove the protesters from the grounds. Conversely, camping out in front of stores in preparation for their opening, while it is stupid, is legal so long as the store is fine with it. This is a question of permission, not conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but the idea that the stores are giving permission to camp under these circumstances is implied.. Also, I&#39;m not sure if this is still the case, but wal-mart used to allow people in rv&#39;s and campers to camp in their parking lots any time. They would even bring you coffee and donuts in the morning. Not the same as ows style camping, but kinda explains the situation some..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be real here, most of the OWS participants were people who followed the crowd and camped out on PRIVATE property interfering with the lives of others taking over central squares of the major cities in this country. I agreed with their message, I think everyone in the country did, but could they not find a better way to protest the influence of the corporations. I&#39;m going to get downvoted to hell because of this but I&#39;m tired of this shit. People act like they were innocent people sitting there doing nothing, WRONG. There was graffiti, public urination, and vandalism everywhere with the protest. I&#39;m tire of people acting like the protesters were angels who did nothing wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly if they had improved the parks as opposed to destroying them I think you&#39;d have seen public opinion support them much more strongly. The lack of a single, cohesive message also doomed them. Unfortunately The occupy protests just became a catch all for a myriad of issues, some incomparable even with each other. The decentralized nature just made the occupy protests look like a group of people destroying parks and being against &quot;everything&quot;. </p>
