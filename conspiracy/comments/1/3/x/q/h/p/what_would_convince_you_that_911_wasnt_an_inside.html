       Worked with demo crews at my previous employer. They all belive it to have been controlled demo done. As said previously basic physics and an understanding of fuel burning temperatures vs the structural steel that was in place. Btw my previous employer is probably one of the largest structural steel companies in north America.

         If they would have had an open investigation, or even had one now, where people like Bush, Cheney, Silverstein, and Osama (whoops I guess we threw him in the ocean!) had to testify. Also, if NIST had been able to demonstrate a working theory, unlike the pancake theory.

         If they explained why the day it was happening there was so much talk about bombs in white vans and planted in the  building, but then they never mentioned it again.

       well, at least you are truthful... no matter if GW himself came out and said, blatantly, that he and his administration orchestrated the whole thing, you would still not believe it... Oh well. go figure... the denial of facts does not make the facts untrue, just makes you look like a closed minded ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: 9 of the terrorists on the planes who were supposedly dead have been seen and identified years after the 9/11 event
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: The pentagon had been mock practicing how to do this very thing themselves for decades
      </p>
      <p>
       fact: NO steel framed structure EVER collapsed due to fire.. EVER
      </p>
      <p>
       fact: thousands of engineers and architects have come forward disputing the official story on how the collapse happened
      </p>
      <p>
       fact: the bbc reported one of the buildings falling 15 minutes before it fell, with the on scene reporter standing there with the building still standing behind her
      </p>
      <p>
       Other interesting things to note.. when an airplane crashes it takes months of collecting all the pieces of the plane and recreating what happened... in the case of 9/11 ALL evidence was quickly disposed of, no gathering, no fact finding... just the "story" the US was handed

       I don't consider a few traitors as the whole government. This is the problem with the inside job phrase. Everything is blamed on the government, it's easier that way for them. 9/11 was not an inside job but the official story is a crock of shit. The media is not part of the government and they were in on the crime.

       The media isn't owned by the government. It may be controlled but it's not owned by them. 9/11 was an outside job. Are you referring to the secret government? I could name you a 1000 government officials that new nothing about 9/11. To say inside job keeps people from looking at other sources like the Mossad.

       A lot of people read reddit.  You may have never visited a post that was more than a day old but many others come here via google search or stumble on this /r/ then look back through past comments.  Think what you will though, there might not be any evidence able convince you I don't have 500 bot accounts upvoting my posts.

       I'm answering your question every single time.. despite you asking every three days over the course of multiple weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even giving you a half answer, I'm very directly answering your question...
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you might not respond for four centuries:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Here is your question:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Is there any evidence that you can imagine that would convince you that it's not a false flag?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Here is my answer:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There could possibly be evidence that it wasn't a false flag, but at best, it would still be really far from the official narrative.
       </p>

       Please, either stop trolling so you can up vote yourself on a second account days later, or just get to your point. I'm answering your questions every time.

       I'm just trying to get you to answer a fairly easy question and you keep wanting to dance around the question.  It's like asking someone what their  favorite color is and having them say "I might have one but it isn't a color that exists."  Which isn't all that interesting.  I'm fine with you not answering the question but from this discussion I'm getting that nothing can convince you.

       Do you like only come on Reddit when you're high on acid or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       That analogy falls stupidly flat, and I've answered your questions
       <strong>
        numerous
       </strong>
       times.
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Is there any evidence that you can imagine that would convince you that it's not a false flag?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I've answered
       <strong>
        so many times
       </strong>
       including with this answer (before, and quoted in my previous post)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There could possibly be evidence that it wasn't a false flag, but at best, it would still be really far from the official narrative.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm answering your question, I think you just don't realize what you're actually asking. You are asking if there is any evidence that
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       convince me it's a false flag. Are you putting some sort of inference on your post you're meaning to put? Because I said "Not from what I've seen" and then you continued to ask if something would.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not asking me to provide you with said evidence, because I've already stated numerous times that from what I've seen, nothing has convinced me. If you want to provide some random information you think I haven't seen, to find if that information would potentially lead me down a path where I would believe it wasn't a false flag, go for it. But from what you're asking, I've already answered your question amicably and several times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like seriously; read your initial question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Is there no evidence that would convince you that 9/11 wasn't a false flag?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I said from what I've seen, no. If not, provide me with said evidence that proves it isn't a false flag. Or you're asking me some retardedly open question that is impossible for me to answer any other way. How would I know if that evidence exists, unless presented? From what evidence I've seen, no. If you have some other view point or evidence, by all means.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be emphatically clear, redundant, and to reiterate for what seems like the thousandth time - I've answered your very basic question. You just aren't asking me anything else. You asked me if there is evidence that would convince me otherwise; I said not that I've seen. I can not just
       <em>
        conjure
       </em>
       something, if you want to provide me with some claims/evidence that you think may convince me that it wasn't a false flag, please be my guest. But outside of that, you're not asking me anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either stop being an internet troll, or get a point. One of the two.

       There is nothing real or imagined that could convince you that 9/11 wasn't an inside job?  All you have to do is say "no".  But you don't do that, you keep couching your answer.  Seriously just say "no" when I ask:

       Look, please. Understand what I'm typing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing that I've seen that could convince me that 9/11 wasn't a false flag (note; I still haven't said inside job, but yet, you continue asking me
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       question)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think 9/11 was an inside job, I've said that from the beginning. I think it was a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       How in the actual fuck can I answer if there is anything
       <em>
        "imagined"
       </em>
       that would convince me it's not a false flag? Are you asking if I could concoct any evidence that would lead me to believe otherwise?

       How is that pertinent to anything at all?

       You can keep saying you're re-writing the question, that's fine, but don't insult me by saying I'm not answering you. I've answered you very specifically in every single post. You just aren't happy with the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry Fountainhead; but from everything I've seen, I believe 9/11 was a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to say no, because I'm not going to deal with that distinct absolute. That's why I preface everything I say with "From what I've seen" -- could evidence exist that would prove to me otherwise? Sure could. But from what I've seen, that has yet to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to say that evidence
       <strong>
        can't possibly exist
       </strong>
       because I'm not going to make that ridiculous of an assertion. You can want me to, that's fine, but that doesn't mean your question is going unanswered, it means you're talking to someone who isn't going to make a claim like "no evidence out there exists" - I'll gladly say that something might. Again, do I know what that evidence is? Not at all, I've been researching post-9/11 work for quite a while, and I still haven't seen that evidence that points to 9/11
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       But do I think it was an
       <strong>
        inside job?
       </strong>
       No. I do think it was a false flag though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope you can understand my answers, or, hope you keep replying so you can stealth upvote yourself (remember, it's a two month old thread, the chances of you being upvoted

       after you post in it is quite low)

       Sorry random guy, but I'm about as polar opposite of the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       stereotype as you can possibly imagine. The fact that I'm still answering your questions after all of this (and having to repeat myself every single time)
      </p>
      <p>
       You might think you're above this community; but your reading comprehension, coupled with your posting tactics, along with playing the victim and your posting content - you fit in perfectly.

       go read from the beginning. Attacking your character the whole time? Don't play the victim so easily, it's a disgusting trait. Go back and read from my first post to right now, the only thing I've said to you is that you're an internet troll, and I'm
       <strong>

       Since even Osama denied responsibility it would be quite hard to prove. Though all this proves is that it wasn't Al-Qaida nor bin Laden that was responsible, it doesn't prove that it was an inside job.. but what are the other choices?

       Why would you deny doing something that if you had do.e would morally boost your men? He denied it because he didnt do it. Many terrorist organizations take the credit of things they have not even do simply to gain fear in the public, becoming a known name, and raising moral. Think about it...

       If he said he was responsible he would have been elevated to Master of the Universe status among his men and his thousands of new recruits. Apparently, he didn't do this because he doesn't lie as it's against the tenets of Islam, same as not killing innocent women and children.
      </p>

       So yea. I agree. He didn't do it, if he did it would have been the biggest boost for him.

       So what about the people who do understand science? Besides look at the events and full blown contradicting lies told in numerous press conferences regarding 9/11..they can't even provide a straight answer..fear of causing public to go panic? I think watching 2 massive buildings crumble like dust was enough to do that..

       There it is.  Thinking that two buildings can't collapse after being hit by planes and burning uninterrupted.

       This Moron (me) worked on site during the erection of several high rise buildings. The same principals applies. I've also worked 2 years for the same company dealing with architectural drawings, blue prints, etc while also dealing with structural engineers. Funny how a dumptruck hitting a concrete wall going the same speed stops dead and the wall is not even affected...yet same truck drives right through a commercial airliner.

       Umm..does that not show the strength of concrete vs a flimsy airliner? Go get informed. You call us truthers..what's that make you..a liar? You cannot shut down someone because you don't want to believe what is proven by science, engineers, architects, etc. Grow up just a bit already.

       No it doesn't, but thank you for proving my point about truthers and science.  The speed of dump truck is not even comparable to an airliner.  Also, the walls of skyscrapers are not concrete walls, or at least not enough concrete to stop a truck.

       Well that's a lie, 911 conspiracy theories are not even close to being proven.  Even the strongest proponents are just calling for more investigation and aren't brave enough to call their theorist proof.  There is a small group of engineers that are truthers but there are also small groups of scientists that believe in teleportation, reptilians, and holistic medicine.

       So does that make them all wrong just because you dont have proof it true or exists? Ok but where is the proof what the US gov't has claimed to be the truth then? What you seem to be saying goes both ways. But I guess you're right. 19 unidentifiable terrorists(can't tell me you can identify anything if this fire melted reinforced structural steel to all hell), took over a bunch of planes with box cutters...lulz...and proceed to orchestrate this plan for bin laden..and pull it off with great success..ok anyhow I can no longer debate this with someone who is not even of a reasonable mind or even being rational.

       Millions of eye witnesses.  We watched the fucking planes hit the building, the building burn, then fall down.  You're the one making the extraordinary claims, but I have yet to see any extraordinary evidence.

       First of all, I find it very ironic that you tell me to grow up, then use "lulz".  Second, every other hijacking up until that point led to the plane going somewhere and the hostages going free.  Why would they try and fight to they death against someone with a blade if they assumed they wouldn't be harmed?

       All I've heard is that steel can't melt due to engine fuel.  When in reality a huge amount of energy is given off by two 110 story buildings collapsing to the group.

       Ok and? Tell me how is it that the energy you claim caused by the collapse is what.caused the collapse? I'm curious because that sounds like you just put the cart infront of the horse. And again..the bottom of the buildings gave way before the tops..and building 7 was brought down in a matter of hours is what your government claims. They claimed it to be controlled. Takes days to set up a demo. Anyways you cannot dispute the fact that the buildings were brought down in a controlled fashion without understanding how demolitions are executed and so on.

      <p>
       I didn't claim that at all.  I claimed that steel can be weakend enough to cause the collapse.  This "molten steel" that truthers are always touting was found after the collapse, if at all.

       Oh, I must have missed that part.  All I heard was the a claim that some steel was melted after the collapse.

       Right because the science behind the temperature at what the fuel burns at vs the temperature of the reinforced steel burns at is not backed by fact at all right? Interestingly enough the building.crumbles from the ground up? After the explosions were heard? Ok. Perhaps you would like to enlighten everyone where this information became disinformation? Interestingly enough your government has yet to acknowledge these requests for information/investigation..no WMD in iraq..no proof of Osama bin laden body. All classified..for what?

       Steel doesn't burn.  It either melts, or in this case, it heats up enough to weaken significantly.

       What?  That's not what happened.  The top collapsed, which caused the rest to collapse under the extra weight.

       Right melted not burning wrong word but my point is not invalid. You show me a video of the top of the building collapsing and bringing the rest to the ground please..last video I saw looking like it started from...wait for it...the ground..in a controlled fashion..as for silence..no absolutely not..but timed explosions right before the building drops? Really interesting conspiraccy theory the government has provided that you back no proof otherwise. Your own government wont even back up what they say. They remain back pedalling to this day. Also if they are willing to reveal they killed him and exactly how it went down including the events leading to his apparent death but not show any real proof..this made my day..the ignorance of people like you is the reason the government continues to manipulate its people.

       You're the one making the claims, so you need to provide the evidence.  Apparently you need your eyes checked, because it's clear that it's falling down from the point of impact.  I swear that I hear a new "theory" about the collapse every week here.

       If I wasn't using my phone I'd take the time to show you any video you wish but I don't have anything at this very moment. How hasn't your government not provided any factual proof of 9/11 or Laden's death? Why such a rush to dispose the body? Big media coverage over all these events. They had no problem disclosing information regarding Saddam though. Hiding in a hole. Why is bin laden so different? Why would bin laden deny doing it? What did he have to gain compared to what the the US government had to gain.

       A lot of people read reddit.  You may have never visited a post that was more than a day old but many others come here via google search or stumble on this /r/ then look back through past comments.  Think what you will though, there might not be any evidence able convince you I don't have 500 bot accounts upvoting my posts.

      <p>
       I'm answering your question, I think you just don't realize what you're actually asking. You are asking if there is any evidence that
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       convince me it's a false flag. Are you putting some sort of inference on your post you're meaning to put? Because I said "Not from what I've seen" and then you continued to ask if something would.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not asking me to provide you with said evidence, because I've already stated numerous times that from what I've seen, nothing has convinced me. If you want to provide some random information you think I haven't seen, to find if that information would potentially lead me down a path where I would believe it wasn't a false flag, go for it. But from what you're asking, I've already answered your question amicably and several times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like seriously; read your initial question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Is there no evidence that would convince you that 9/11 wasn't a false flag?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I said from what I've seen, no. If not, provide me with said evidence that proves it isn't a false flag. Or you're asking me some retardedly open question that is impossible for me to answer any other way. How would I know if that evidence exists, unless presented? From what evidence I've seen, no. If you have some other view point or evidence, by all means.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be emphatically clear, redundant, and to reiterate for what seems like the thousandth time - I've answered your very basic question. You just aren't asking me anything else. You asked me if there is evidence that would convince me otherwise; I said not that I've seen. I can not just
       <em>
        conjure
       </em>
       something, if you want to provide me with some claims/evidence that you think may convince me that it wasn't a false flag, please be my guest. But outside of that, you're not asking me anything else.
