    <div class="md"><p>well, at least you are truthful... no matter if GW himself came out and said, blatantly, that he and his administration orchestrated the whole thing, you would still not believe it... Oh well. go figure... the denial of facts does not make the facts untrue, just makes you look like a closed minded ass. </p>

<p>Fact: 9 of the terrorists on the planes who were supposedly dead have been seen and identified years after the 9/11 event</p>

<p>Fact: The pentagon had been mock practicing how to do this very thing themselves for decades</p>

<p>fact: NO steel framed structure EVER collapsed due to fire.. EVER</p>

<p>fact: thousands of engineers and architects have come forward disputing the official story on how the collapse happened</p>

<p>fact: the bbc reported one of the buildings falling 15 minutes before it fell, with the on scene reporter standing there with the building still standing behind her</p>

<p>Other interesting things to note.. when an airplane crashes it takes months of collecting all the pieces of the plane and recreating what happened... in the case of 9/11 ALL evidence was quickly disposed of, no gathering, no fact finding... just the &quot;story&quot; the US was handed</p>

<p>A lot of people read reddit.  You may have never visited a post that was more than a day old but many others come here via google search or stumble on this /r/ then look back through past comments.  Think what you will though, there might not be any evidence able convince you I don&#39;t have 500 bot accounts upvoting my posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you like only come on Reddit when you&#39;re high on acid or something? </p>

<p>That analogy falls stupidly flat, and I&#39;ve answered your questions <strong>numerous</strong> times.</p>

<p>You asked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there any evidence that you can imagine that would convince you that it&#39;s not a false flag?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve answered <strong>so many times</strong> including with this answer (before, and quoted in my previous post)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There could possibly be evidence that it wasn&#39;t a false flag, but at best, it would still be really far from the official narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m answering your question, I think you just don&#39;t realize what you&#39;re actually asking. You are asking if there is any evidence that <em>might</em> convince me it&#39;s a false flag. Are you putting some sort of inference on your post you&#39;re meaning to put? Because I said &quot;Not from what I&#39;ve seen&quot; and then you continued to ask if something would.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not asking me to provide you with said evidence, because I&#39;ve already stated numerous times that from what I&#39;ve seen, nothing has convinced me. If you want to provide some random information you think I haven&#39;t seen, to find if that information would potentially lead me down a path where I would believe it wasn&#39;t a false flag, go for it. But from what you&#39;re asking, I&#39;ve already answered your question amicably and several times.</p>

<p>Like seriously; read your initial question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there no evidence that would convince you that 9/11 wasn&#39;t a false flag?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said from what I&#39;ve seen, no. If not, provide me with said evidence that proves it isn&#39;t a false flag. Or you&#39;re asking me some retardedly open question that is impossible for me to answer any other way. How would I know if that evidence exists, unless presented? From what evidence I&#39;ve seen, no. If you have some other view point or evidence, by all means.</p>

<p>To be emphatically clear, redundant, and to reiterate for what seems like the thousandth time - I&#39;ve answered your very basic question. You just aren&#39;t asking me anything else. You asked me if there is evidence that would convince me otherwise; I said not that I&#39;ve seen. I can not just <em>conjure</em> something, if you want to provide me with some claims/evidence that you think may convince me that it wasn&#39;t a false flag, please be my guest. But outside of that, you&#39;re not asking me anything else.</p>

<p>Either stop being an internet troll, or get a point. One of the two.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t actually answer that question, no matter how many times you ask, no matter how many times I try to beat it into your skull.</p>

<p>Look, please. Understand what I&#39;m typing.</p>

<p>There is nothing that I&#39;ve seen that could convince me that 9/11 wasn&#39;t a false flag (note; I still haven&#39;t said inside job, but yet, you continue asking me <em>that</em> question)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think 9/11 was an inside job, I&#39;ve said that from the beginning. I think it was a false flag.</p>

<p>How in the actual fuck can I answer if there is anything <em>&quot;imagined&quot;</em> that would convince me it&#39;s not a false flag? Are you asking if I could concoct any evidence that would lead me to believe otherwise?</p>

<p>How is that pertinent to anything at all? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly why I don&#39;t like dealing with this community.</p>

<p>You can keep saying you&#39;re re-writing the question, that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t insult me by saying I&#39;m not answering you. I&#39;ve answered you very specifically in every single post. You just aren&#39;t happy with the answer.</p>

<p>Sorry Fountainhead; but from everything I&#39;ve seen, I believe 9/11 was a false flag. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say no, because I&#39;m not going to deal with that distinct absolute. That&#39;s why I preface everything I say with &quot;From what I&#39;ve seen&quot; -- could evidence exist that would prove to me otherwise? Sure could. But from what I&#39;ve seen, that has yet to happen.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say that evidence <strong>can&#39;t possibly exist</strong> because I&#39;m not going to make that ridiculous of an assertion. You can want me to, that&#39;s fine, but that doesn&#39;t mean your question is going unanswered, it means you&#39;re talking to someone who isn&#39;t going to make a claim like &quot;no evidence out there exists&quot; - I&#39;ll gladly say that something might. Again, do I know what that evidence is? Not at all, I&#39;ve been researching post-9/11 work for quite a while, and I still haven&#39;t seen that evidence that points to 9/11 <em>not</em> being a false flag.</p>

<p>But do I think it was an <strong>inside job?</strong> No. I do think it was a false flag though.</p>

<p>Hope you can understand my answers, or, hope you keep replying so you can stealth upvote yourself (remember, it&#39;s a two month old thread, the chances of you being upvoted <em>immediately</em> after you post in it is quite low)</p>

<p>Sorry random guy, but I&#39;m about as polar opposite of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> stereotype as you can possibly imagine. The fact that I&#39;m still answering your questions after all of this (and having to repeat myself every single time) </p>

<p>You might think you&#39;re above this community; but your reading comprehension, coupled with your posting tactics, along with playing the victim and your posting content - you fit in perfectly.</p>

<p>edit;</p>

<p>And please, <strong>please</strong> go read from the beginning. Attacking your character the whole time? Don&#39;t play the victim so easily, it&#39;s a disgusting trait. Go back and read from my first post to right now, the only thing I&#39;ve said to you is that you&#39;re an internet troll, and I&#39;m <strong>genuinely</strong> curious if you only come to Reddit when you&#39;re in a different state of mind.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t, but thank you for proving my point about truthers and science.  The speed of dump truck is not even comparable to an airliner.  Also, the walls of skyscrapers are not concrete walls, or at least not enough concrete to stop a truck.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well that&#39;s a lie, 911 conspiracy theories are not even close to being proven.  Even the strongest proponents are just calling for more investigation and aren&#39;t brave enough to call their theorist proof.  There is a small group of engineers that are truthers but there are also small groups of scientists that believe in teleportation, reptilians, and holistic medicine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So does that make them all wrong just because you dont have proof it true or exists? Ok but where is the proof what the US gov&#39;t has claimed to be the truth then? What you seem to be saying goes both ways.

<p>Millions of eye witnesses.  We watched the fucking planes hit the building, the building burn, then fall down.  You&#39;re the one making the extraordinary claims, but I have yet to see any extraordinary evidence.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I find it very ironic that you tell me to grow up, then use &quot;lulz&quot;.  Second, every other hijacking up until that point led to the plane going somewhere and the hostages going free.  Why would they try and fight to they death against someone with a blade if they assumed they wouldn&#39;t be harmed? </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t claim that at all.  I claimed that steel can be weakend enough to cause the collapse.  This &quot;molten steel&quot; that truthers are always touting was found after the collapse, if at all.</p>

<p>Again, no it didn&#39;t.  Just because you repeat it over and over doesn&#39;t make it true.  Watch the damn video, it&#39;s pretty obvious.</p>

<p>Steel doesn&#39;t burn.  It either melts, or in this case, it heats up enough to weaken significantly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What?  That&#39;s not what happened.  The top collapsed, which caused the rest to collapse under the extra weight.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one making the claims, so you need to provide the evidence.  Apparently you need your eyes checked, because it&#39;s clear that it&#39;s falling down from the point of impact.  I swear that I hear a new &quot;theory&quot; about the collapse every week here.</p>

<p>That analogy falls stupidly flat, and I&#39;ve answered your questions <strong>numerous</strong> times.</p>

<p>You asked:</p>

<p>Is there any evidence that you can imagine that would convince you that it&#39;s not a false flag?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve answered <strong>so many times</strong> including with this answer (before, and quoted in my previous post)</p>

<p>There could possibly be evidence that it wasn&#39;t a false flag, but at best, it would still be really far from the official narrative.</p>

<p>I&#39;m answering your question, I think you just don&#39;t realize what you&#39;re actually asking. You are asking if there is any evidence that <em>might</em> convince me it&#39;s a false flag. Are you putting some sort of inference on your post you&#39;re meaning to put? Because I said &quot;Not from what I&#39;ve seen&quot; and then you continued to ask if something would.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not asking me to provide you with said evidence, because I&#39;ve already stated numerous times that from what I&#39;ve seen, nothing has convinced me. If you want to provide some random information you think I haven&#39;t seen, to find if that information would potentially lead me down a path where I would believe it wasn&#39;t a false flag, go for it. But from what you&#39;re asking, I&#39;ve already answered your question amicably and several times.</p>

<p>Like seriously; read your initial question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there no evidence that would convince you that 9/11 wasn&#39;t a false flag?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said from what I&#39;ve seen, no. If not, provide me with said evidence that proves it isn&#39;t a false flag. Or you&#39;re asking me some retardedly open question that is impossible for me to answer any other way. How would I know if that evidence exists, unless presented? From what evidence I&#39;ve seen, no. If you have some other view point or evidence, by all means.</p>

<p>To be emphatically clear, redundant, and to reiterate for what seems like the thousandth time - I&#39;ve answered your very basic question. You just aren&#39;t asking me anything else. You asked me if there is evidence that would convince me otherwise; I said not that I&#39;ve seen. I can not just <em>conjure</em> something, if you want to provide me with some claims/evidence that you think may convince me that it wasn&#39;t a false flag, please be my guest. But outside of that, you&#39;re not asking me anything else.</p>

<p>Either stop being an internet troll, or get a point. One of the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right because the science behind the temperature at what the fuel burns at vs the temperature of the reinforced steel burns at is not backed by fact at all right? Interestingly enough the building.crumbles from the ground up? After the explosions were heard? Ok. Perhaps you would like to enlighten everyone where this information became disinformation? Interestingly enough your government has yet to acknowledge these requests for information/investigation..no WMD in iraq..no proof of Osama bin laden body. All classified..for what? </p>
