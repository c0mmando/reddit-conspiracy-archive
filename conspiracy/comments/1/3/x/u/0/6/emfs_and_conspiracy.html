I was looking up EMFs (we have a few powerlines 150 yards from our house transmitting 245 kV from the metal transformers and 69 kV from wooden ones) and i was getting slightly worried that maybe they will cause some health issues, but when i look for ways to counteract the EMFs i really start going to the weird side of the internet with foil hats and everything.  Is this a thing?  Does anyone have any real advice?  Is this just a ploy to sell people like my uncle EMF-blocking boxers?</p>

<p>&quot;The scientific evidence suggesting that ELF-EMF exposures pose any health risk is weak&quot; but goes on to state, &quot;The NIEHS concludes that ELF-EMF exposures cannot be recognized as entirely safe because of weak scientific evidence that exposure may pose a leukemia hazard.&quot; </p>

<p>IMO electromagnetic fields probably do have subtle interactions with biological systems. Will they give you a stroke? Probably not, but they may have some minor effect on organ function with chronic exposure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that.  It&#39;s hard to find real &quot;evidence&quot; out there.  I read somewhere that long-term exposure is around 7-10 years, at least, or more.  We really don&#39;t plan on being here that long and i was going to plant some nice big trees in the path to maybe help out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, we were kind of in a pickle with my husband not being able to be on the mortgage.  We were in kind of a crummy location for anything in our price range and ended up looking at 42 homes in person. This house was by far the best when it came to location, age, state, and amount of money we&#39;d have to put into it (virtually none).  Then we realized the power lines afterwards.  It&#39;s a fantastic house for sure, but, yeah....that part sucks.  Most all the houses had the lines, too, even if we were way out (not many underground lines here).  Or we couldn&#39;t afford a place in areas that were far enough out.  It&#39;s still smaller than we would have liked but it is just enough space (we have a lot of stuff including a home gym i would refuse to get rid of).  So, our own fault, but i feel like we were pretty much cornered into getting the house in the sense that there were no other places that were more suitable.  But we&#39;re not going to live here forever, so that&#39;s the comfort and then we&#39;ll both be able to participate with the morgage and we&#39;ll be FAR away from those kinds of things. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t stand in its path for a long time it shouldn&#39;t affect you.</p>

<p>(From Wikipedia)</p>

<p>Although individuals who report electromagnetic hypersensitivity believe that electromagnetic fields from common electrical devices trigger or exacerbate their symptoms, it has not been established that these fields play any role in the cause of these symptoms. Exposures are to intensity levels below those generally accepted to cause physiological effects, and the diverse physiological effects reported are not what would be expected from high intensity electromagnetic fields. Sufferers and their support groups are convinced of a causal relationship with electromagnetic fields, but presently the scientific literature does not support such a link.</p>

<p>Some professionals consider electromagnetic hypersensitivity to be a physical condition with an unclear cause, while others suggest that some aspects may be psychological. Reviews have suggested that psychological mechanisms may play a role in causing or exacerbating EHS symptoms. Research has also shown neurophysiological differences between sensitive individuals and controls. This may reflect either a psychophysiological stress response to participating in the study or a more general imbalance in autonomic nervous system regulation.</p>

<p>Are there any experiments / studies you can point to that have established a strong causal link of the sort you claim?</p>
