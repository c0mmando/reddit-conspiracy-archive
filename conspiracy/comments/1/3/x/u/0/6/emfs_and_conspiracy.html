       I hope i'm putting this in the right subreddit!  I was looking up EMFs (we have a few powerlines 150 yards from our house transmitting 245 kV from the metal transformers and 69 kV from wooden ones) and i was getting slightly worried that maybe they will cause some health issues, but when i look for ways to counteract the EMFs i really start going to the weird side of the internet with foil hats and everything.  Is this a thing?  Does anyone have any real advice?  Is this just a ploy to sell people like my uncle EMF-blocking boxers?

       IMO electromagnetic fields probably do have subtle interactions with biological systems. Will they give you a stroke? Probably not, but they may have some minor effect on organ function with chronic exposure.

       Thanks for that.  It's hard to find real "evidence" out there.  I read somewhere that long-term exposure is around 7-10 years, at least, or more.  We really don't plan on being here that long and i was going to plant some nice big trees in the path to maybe help out.

       Keep in mind the latter statement is just my own opinion, I could be way off in either direction. I don't think trees will help much.

       Unfortunately, we were kind of in a pickle with my husband not being able to be on the mortgage.  We were in kind of a crummy location for anything in our price range and ended up looking at 42 homes in person. This house was by far the best when it came to location, age, state, and amount of money we'd have to put into it (virtually none).  Then we realized the power lines afterwards.  It's a fantastic house for sure, but, yeah....that part sucks.  Most all the houses had the lines, too, even if we were way out (not many underground lines here).  Or we couldn't afford a place in areas that were far enough out.  It's still smaller than we would have liked but it is just enough space (we have a lot of stuff including a home gym i would refuse to get rid of).  So, our own fault, but i feel like we were pretty much cornered into getting the house in the sense that there were no other places that were more suitable.  But we're not going to live here forever, so that's the comfort and then we'll both be able to participate with the morgage and we'll be FAR away from those kinds of things.

       You could technically shield all your house,but that would be very expensive and not very aesthetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said you could give it a shot at getting the approval to put the shielding for the transformers.

       Haha, my entire house. Brilliant.  I could call and ask, i guess it wouldn't hurt.  They aren't completely unreasonable, they even calle dme back with the output of all their products (including street lamps!), but we'll see.

       Alternatively you could get an EMF detector and check your house for the lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't stand in its path for a long time it shouldn't affect you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So check your bed, desk, lounge and other common areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find any just avoid them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note that science is sketchy at best and whatever effect it would have would be over a long period, if at all.

       This sounds like a pretty good idea, thank you for that.  I considered just getting some blocking window stuff for that side of the house that faces the lines (just two french doors), so that's still an option that won't require major commitment.

       Just bought the house.  Do not plan on staying here more than 6-7 years.  Unfortunately this is the best situation we have. The house is great, though!  Hahaha.  Aww.

       Luckily there are very few windows in the house.  Like seriously. And they're all small.  It's an energy-efficient home they built and part of it is in the ground, but not a basement.  So i figure i just need to worry about the french doors facing the electric poles the most.

       Luckily, the rooms facing the powerlines the most are our workout rooms and the dining room which we rarely use.  But it'd be nice if there were no powerlines; unfortunately that's how a lot of people get power.

       Actually, we slashed tehm on the price, also.  I am sure it has not much to do with the powerlines as people here really don't think that far ahead.  They really wanted out because they built a new house.  Either way, great starter home for everything else and i don't forsee a problem selling in the future -- but i know i want to get the crap out of here when i am able to avoid the issues.

        (From Wikipedia)
       </p>
       <p>
        Although individuals who report electromagnetic hypersensitivity believe that electromagnetic fields from common electrical devices trigger or exacerbate their symptoms, it has not been established that these fields play any role in the cause of these symptoms. Exposures are to intensity levels below those generally accepted to cause physiological effects, and the diverse physiological effects reported are not what would be expected from high intensity electromagnetic fields. Sufferers and their support groups are convinced of a causal relationship with electromagnetic fields, but presently the scientific literature does not support such a link.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some professionals consider electromagnetic hypersensitivity to be a physical condition with an unclear cause, while others suggest that some aspects may be psychological. Reviews have suggested that psychological mechanisms may play a role in causing or exacerbating EHS symptoms. Research has also shown neurophysiological differences between sensitive individuals and controls. This may reflect either a psychophysiological stress response to participating in the study or a more general imbalance in autonomic nervous system regulation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Are there any experiments / studies you can point to that have established a strong causal link of the sort you claim?

       Keep in mind the latter statement is just my own opinion, I could be way off in either direction. I don't think trees will help much.
