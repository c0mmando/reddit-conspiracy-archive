binyamin netanyahu is saying on the news &quot;we are glad for the support the citicens are giving us&quot;. 
there is no support!
i live in sderot (one of the cities that is getting bombed by gaza) and i felt this war coming from sunday. i left my home today and i am now in my parants house. 
binyamin is just doing it becouse of the next elections. the hamas leader is his bin-laden.</p>

<p>Removing the peoples&#39; responsiblity for the actions of those whom represent them, has devasting consequnces.

    <div class="md"><p>yes thats right. and it pains me to say that the second group is a group that is being created by the government becouse they are easy to controll with the media. its all the mizrahis (i dont know how they are called in english easterns maybe?). they are not spacially aggresive or old fasioned, they just dont know any other thing then what they see in the television, that is made for them (only their music in the israeli music channel, which is controled by the news channel) </p>

<p>the reason i knew about this since sunday (and i warned everyone i know) is becouse i am not waiting for things to happen and then read about it. i can see them as the most logical next political act a scared polititian would do. this is netanyahus war and no one elses! he wants to show everyone that hes got the largest d**k!</p>

<p>now my friends call me prophet and shit. i&#39;m not prophet. try thinking for yourselves idiots. you dont need a big brain to be a polititian</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I don&#39;t care if you tag me as a paedophile, it doesn&#39;t make it any more true.  So, if tagging me as an &quot;anti-semite&quot; (which is doublespeak) makes you feel better, than by all means do so.</p>

<p>If I offended you by labeling the IDF as a &quot;Jewish Army&quot;, then that is your fault for not recognizing it for what it is.  (This was in a seperate thread, though since I made no remarks that could resemble so-called &quot;anti-semitism&quot; in this thread, I can only assume you are referencing that.)I didn&#39;t expect an actual, logical counter argument anyway.</p>

<p>here is the event for the protest in tel-aviv aginst this oparation. its today in one hour and a half from now. </p>

<p>The time now is 10 am. the idf will move its forces to the north at 11am, and i believe this will give the hamas in gaza an opertunity to use their long range missles and hit tel-aviv. i guess thats what will happen... its the most logical thing binyamin netanyahu can do for his favor. damn basterd.</p>

<p>every time we protest, either aginst wars or for the benefit of the people, the bombing from gaza begins again. the government is ok with this, since its an excuse to say &quot;we need more money for the army and defence&quot;, and so they take more money from us by taxes....</p>

<p>they are planning these scenerios by killing targets execly before a protest begins, and making the hamas angry. binyamin is technecly killing his own people... and thats why i hate him.
to bad most people dont realize this logic... they are not bad for ellecting him, just blinded by the media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the IDF will fight anyway. The Kahanists in Hebron etc, with all their kids in kravi (combat), will not refuse any orders to fight. People in Givatayim, the Kibbutzim and folks like you, will refuse to fight. But none of the chayalim bodedim and Machal (Lone immigrant soldiers), who made Aliyah especially to fight, will not turn down the chance. All these kids are itching to Tzav 8 (emergency call to arms) and will run for the chance to murder.  </p>
