       Notice how the burned-out area takes the shape of a near perfect sphere.. ?  Those two houses were just vaporized by a highly focused incendiary.

       Either way; I don't see how you can jump from the conclusion that since it's not a gas leak, it
       <strong>
        must
       </strong>
       be a missile explosion.

       The way you can tell it wasn't a gas leak is because it was way to powerful and focused to be a gas leak. but don't take my word for it...

       I didn't mean to suggest "not gas therefor missile".

       I should have been more clear: "not gas because the damage was way to severe -- only a missile can cause that time of focused vaporization of structure".

       There was a thread on here this morning saying something about a furnace explosion in one of the houses, possibly an insurance fraud.

       I wonder if you have any basis on which to claim "it was

       a missile".

       i say it was clearly a missile because nothing else would cause so much damage.  we basically have two houses that were utterly vaporized.

       but seriously...  a furnace ??  there was no basement.  this is a modern, upscale neighborhood, not some old warehouse on the south side of the railroad tracks with a 50 year old furnace.  a modern, upscale home furnace would not vaporize two homes, knocked out windows of homes a block away, damaged 80 homes and forced 200 people to evacuate?!  a furnace ?!  sorry, but  that's just asinine.
      </p>
      <p>
       note.  the article mentions the owners of one of the vaporized homes... but not the other.

       of another, they show gas explosions.

       Where did you get the opinion we all agree it was not a gas leak and clearly is a missile?

       If by similarities you mean, that it was a house and so was the ones in indiana. Other than that not even close, for example i can see tables/chairs/actual items and chunks of walls in your picture, where as everything in indiana is black charred, obliterated, the only solid piece in indiana are a few studs. the pictures are the difference between a firecracker ON the palm of your hand or a firecracker IN the palm of your hand.

       The picture and video of the scene you posted look like a gas explosion. The picture of what happened in Indianapolis looks like a bomb went off. Look at how different the damage is. I'm not saying it is a missle, but it seems more than a little fishy.

       The authorities have stated that it wasn't a gas leak or a meth lab. Although the pic you link to certainly looks very similar to this Indiana incident (note that the Gloucestershire explosion occurred in a brick-built house rather than the wooden American houses).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, FYI OP, there clearly
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a basement shown in many of the pictures you linked to at the top of this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you really think it's "asinine" to suggest a furnace explosion as the cause, but not to categorically state that it was "clearly" a missile, despite no source or expert knowledge to back up your claim? You're wildly speculating and stating it as a fact.

       There have been many comments in these recent threads from people who live 10 miles or more away from the site. All saying they heard a small boom and then a large devastating explosion. How can a furnace explosion be heard that far away? I live 6 miles from a cliff blasting site and I can't hear the explosions of dynamite. It IS asinine to think this could be a furnace explosion.

       It's a more plausible explanation than the US government using a missile to assassinate someone they didn't like.

       Where did I ever say I believed a missile struck there? FFS a missile wouldn't be able destroy only 2 houses and leave the yard and roadway intact or relatively intact. Not to mention people would have heard the sound of a missile ripping through the air at high speeds
