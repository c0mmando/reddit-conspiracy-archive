<p>Notice how the burned-out area takes the shape of a near perfect sphere.. ?  Those two houses were just vaporized by a highly focused incendiary.</p>

<p>The way you can tell it wasn&#39;t a gas leak is because it was way to powerful and focused to be a gas leak. but don&#39;t take my word for it...</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to suggest &quot;not gas therefor missile&quot;.  </p>

<p>I should have been more clear: &quot;not gas because the damage was way to severe -- only a missile can cause that time of focused vaporization of structure&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i say it was clearly a missile because nothing else would cause so much damage.  we basically have two houses that were utterly vaporized.</p>

<p>yea, i saw that too:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/11/12/officials-seek-cause-indianapolis-explosion-that-leveled-neighborhood-and/">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/11/12/officials-seek-cause-indianapolis-explosion-that-leveled-neighborhood-and/</a></p>

<p>but seriously...  a furnace ??  there was no basement.  this is a modern, upscale neighborhood, not some old warehouse on the south side of the railroad tracks with a 50 year old furnace.  a modern, upscale home furnace would not vaporize two homes, knocked out windows of homes a block away, damaged 80 homes and forced 200 people to evacuate?!  a furnace ?!  sorry, but  that&#39;s just asinine.</p>

<p>note.  the article mentions the owners of one of the vaporized homes... but not the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The authorities have stated that it wasn&#39;t a gas leak or a meth lab. Although the pic you link to certainly looks very similar to this Indiana incident (note that the Gloucestershire explosion occurred in a brick-built house rather than the wooden American houses). </p>

<p>Also, FYI OP, there clearly <strong>is</strong> a basement shown in many of the pictures you linked to at the top of this thread. </p>

<p>And do you really think it&#39;s &quot;asinine&quot; to suggest a furnace explosion as the cause, but not to categorically state that it was &quot;clearly&quot; a missile, despite no source or expert knowledge to back up your claim? You&#39;re wildly speculating and stating it as a fact. </p>
