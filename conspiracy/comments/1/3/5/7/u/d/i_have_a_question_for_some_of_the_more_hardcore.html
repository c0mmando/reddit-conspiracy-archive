       This post and question is born out of reading blatantly false claims that pretend to be scientific. Fluoride, GMO, Aspartame are just a few examples.

       welcome to the wonderful world of conspiracy polemic. additionally, not all theorists are equally satisfied with either the integrity of their information or their own synthesis of it. not all who pose as theorists possess integrity, and indeed, not all who post here are even theorists, or are even working for our betterment. these are just simple truths of the field.

       ultimately, one thing that is crucially important is that crucially important evidence that could allow for open scientific inquiry has been done away with unethically, and against proven and accepted standards and practices.

       have a cookie. not everyone believes what they read. and those that do will probably defend it, regardless of its veracity and implications. just ask the questions that are needed. sometimes that's all people need. and that's certainly all you can do.

      <p>
       much of what is done in the conspiracy realm is an application of ethical, political and financial transparency inquiry. many times, it is these angles that yield the best arguments for the existence of conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       but many times, as well, these arguments become drowned out among a myriad of sensational rephrasing of the relevant material, or are reframed in such a way as to be "scientifically debunked." in mind obviously I have the very GMO companies you mentioned. It's not an argument over whether or not GMOs are scientifically proven to harm living things, it's an inquiry into the behaviors of GMO producers that should raise enough alarms to warrant serious investigation, first and foremost.

       Your premise is based on a misapprehension that "we" are somehow "unscientific". People here are looking for explanations of events when the official line (often purporting to be "scientific") is incomplete and/or contradictory, selective, self-serving and politically, commercially or even religiously motivated. What's your motive?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that a great deal of research which is conducted and published as "science" is nothing of the sort. Bogus science is promoted by individuals for personal gain and status, by Governments, big pharma, agri-business, food manufacturers - the list is endless.

       Scientists don't simply work for governments.

       I'm not sure about the sourcing but what I can tell you is certian sources that are often cited here are simply horrible and proven to post blatantly false information - my examples of natural news and info wars come to mind. I'm not asking people to post CNN links, thats just as bad.

       Assuming you're not being facetious; sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy Theorists are supposed to be truth seekers, people who just want to know the truth behind what goes on in our world. But the problem is, people get so sucked into the idea that there has to be a conspiracy behind everything that even when they know the truth, they reject it because it doesn't fit their beliefs.

       Good analogy.

       Its the classic truth seeker who doesn't really seek the truth unless its the truth he believes in.

       You would think right?  And yet science
       <em>
        as

       religion is exactly how many unwittingly deal with it.  Problem is, most have little idea that this is exactly what they're doing - which actually makes it worse than religious zealotry because there's even more hubris involved than would otherwise be the case.

       Science is the process of human understanding. Its about figuring out how things work with hypothesis, testing, experimentation and resulting evidence. A good scientist is happy whether his theories are proven to be true or false, because either/or forwards human understanding as a whole.

       Not only is it not the only discipline that does this, but the honest truth is that science - again, as it is practiced on this planet - would indeed be
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       if it unanimously was about the things that you just finished stating you think it's about.  Unfortunately, however, it has often time proven that it is more about corporate interest, manipulation, and power than it is about truth - so much so and so often as a matter of fact, that one would be extremely remiss at committing oneself to the mistaken idea that true and
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       science is practiced here to anywhere near the extent that it should be.  It isn't.

       This is agreed and correct.  Unfortunately, you would be surprised, I must at this point say, with the abysmal and negligible number of, as you call them "good" scientists that really exist on this plane.

       I tried to explain how proper scientific process works to you. It is nothing like "religion". Perhaps if you gave science a chance you would see that. I suppose you've had some bad experiences with a few bad people who happen to hold credentials. These views are central to science and essential and foundational in its teachings and execution. It may not be perfect but its something based on as I said, evidence theory testing experiments and all of that stuff.

       Such might seem the case in theory, but - in spite of what many wish to think or believe - much of the practice of this theory ends up looking quite a bit like the very thing that many often go so far out of their way to separate themselves from.

       I wouldn't go that far.  Most of the bad experiences I've had are with the many here on Reddit that dogmatically genuflect before the blood alter of sacred science like blind followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't misunderstand here:  Science is absolutely beautiful.  It's just that most people have no idea what it actually is or how it's actually practiced.  I'm not going to try and say that
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       in particular am "one of the few that
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       know".  There's certainly far more that I don't know than there is that I do.  However - and again - I've simply seen enough to understand that the close-minded belief that I've witnessed many place upon science and what it "can and cannot" do is no less frightening than the worst kind of religious zealotry.

       I don't necessarily disagree with this.  And yet there are glaring elephant-in-the-room discrepancies existing whereby much of what the human race is taught is "scientific truth" has actually shown itself to have been undermined over and over again.

       Although I do feel that religion in general leaves a
       <em>
        LOT

       to be desired, it is also most definitely the case that some religions are absolutely based upon "evidence theory testing experiments and all of that stuff."
      </p>
      <p>
       Science, religion, etc - when practiced properly - are awesome, very effective, and all quite significant and valuable pieces to The Great Puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way that they (science, religion, etc) are practiced on this planet, however, leaves a great deal to be desired, and often makes a mockery of the truth that each discipline in its own right could achieve if allowed to proliferate in an ideal manner.

       Religion had its chance for thousands of years. It brought us the crusades and the dark ages.

       One is based on blind faith with no hard evidence. This same one also ignores forms of hard evidence that may go against its dogmatic teachings. This same one also adheres to a dogmatic book (depending on which one) that lays out the rules and leaves no room for fundamental change based on evidence and established fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other is based heavily on evidence. This same one does not adhere to any specific dogmatic book, or any worship or any single specific teaching. This one has a due process that leads to positive or negative results. This one is entirely open and ready for any change that may come its way as a result of experimentation, testing and examination of new evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is which?
      </p>
      <p>
       The state of the world today sucks. Sure, I'll give you that. But that doesn't mean science and all scientists suck. The reality is the majority of scientists in general are good people with open minds to all sorts of possibilities.

       You are limited by a blind adherence to western dogmatism.  As such and taken from this perspective, you are correct.  Fortunately, however, this perspective is quite shallow in its breadth, and applies not one whit to most perspectives in the East.

       You make the statement which I initially quoted above in this response here, and then you betray its stated intention with a comment such as this one that is ignorant of the greater scope within which those oldest religions are based of which it seems you have little understanding.  There is nothing wrong with ignorance - we all have much of it and I certainly am far ahead of the pack in many respects - but when you do not see the ignorance which you hold is such and mistakenly assume that it is actually knowledge you are looking at, then your mindset plummets into a state of dark hubris from which enlightenment is considerably more difficult.

       It is unfortunate that it seems you continue exclusively equating the whole of religion in general with one young, particularly limited, exclusivist form of it.  This is typically Western, but, unfortunately, not critical or very aware of the reality of things.  I mean no foul upon you, but we cannot go very far in this conversation if you insist upon allowing your mind to remain limited by the mistaken notion that the type of religion you continue referring to here is the only (or most important) type of religion there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind you I am not disagreeing with much of what you say with regard to the one variant of the religion that you are referring to.  However, and again, you make the grave mistake of confusing one, tiny, very soluble drop of rain with the entire ocean.

       And yet here again one will find a discrepancy between this particular statement and the observable facts if one but look deeply and closely enough into the inner workings of this society and in the manner that - as already stated more than once - scientific truth regularly suffers at the hands of corporate (read dogmatic) power (read worship).

       It is unfortunate that I feel I have to continue to preface some of my statements with "please don't take this as any afront against you..." but it seems that you have a lot of work to do in the area of broadening your selective awareness and focus.  Do you not recall the examples I've already given directly contradicting this very statement?  We really cannot move forward much if at all until and unless statements like this one are directly addressed and the various examples (of the many that exist) going very much against what you're stating here are settled.  I say this because, if they are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       settled, then you will simply continue stating "blue" and I will continue stating "green" and the impasse will likely prove insurmountable.
