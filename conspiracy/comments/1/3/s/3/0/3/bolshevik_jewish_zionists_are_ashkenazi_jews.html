<ul>
<li>Zionists are the enemy</li>
<li>The vast majority of Zionists are self-proclaimed Jews</li>
<li>Most Jews are &quot;fake&quot; Jews and they knowingly lie about their genetic background</li>
<li>Ashkenazi Jews can also be legitimately called Bolshevik Jews</li>
<li>Bolshevik Jews, or Ashkenazi Jews are deliberately carrying out a plan for world domination </li>
<li>Judaism is one tool that Ashkenazi Jews knowingly use for their goals</li>
<li>Ashkenazi Jews carry moral responsibility for the Russian revolution</li>
<li>Ashkenazi Jews carry moral responsibility for their control of the media, banking and clever manipulation of world politics</li>
<li>Ashkenazi Jews have no clear relationship to the Mediterranian or the Levant, but are merely Turkic converts called Khazars</li>
<li>The Jews suppress all world-wide knowledge of their true heritage in order to manipulate the world for purposes of domination</li>
<li>No form of resistance to Zionism can be steeped in antisemitism or anti-Jewish bigotry because the group we call Ashkenazi Jews, who are Bolsheviks and Zionists, are Khazars</li>

<p>My note on equating Bolshevik with Ashkenazi, is that it was mostly the Ashkenazi (Khazar) Jews that were behind the Bolshevik Russian revolution.

<p>How can you say who is a true Jew if you aren&#39;t a Jew yourself. If the Sephardic Jews are true Jews and they believe that Ashkenazi and Arab Jews are true Jews, then aren&#39;t they true Jews? </p>

<p>Also, are we talking genetic Jew or religious Jew? Because religiously Jewish Ashkenazis are truly religious Jews whether or not you think they are directly related to the Jews of ancient Israel. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Almost all (99.9%) of Jews use the Talmud. It is not a de facto holy book, such that it isn&#39;t believed to be divinely inspired. But it carries the weight of the credibility of many great Jewish scholars/rabbis. It is like an encyclopedia of Jewish thought and tradition from almost two thousand years ago. The holy books of Judaism are those contained in the Old Testament and the Talmud is thought to be a guide to their interpretation...</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry for editing my post but...</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It is just as wrong as calling Slavic people the Bolshevik Europeans. Having a pair of ancestors does not determine your political philosophy or inclinations. It&#39;s offensive because 99.9% of Ashkenazi Jews had nothing to do with any Bolshevist movement. Many Ashkenazi Jews are not a fan of communism... Or at least they can be, which is enough to show that calling them Bolshevik Jews is deeply offensive! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do not understand the difference between gens and beliefsets.</p>

<p>You&#39;re confusing the two. Aristotle&#39;s sub/ob split might be juvanile, but it&#39;s convenient. Particularly when discussing a subject like this. I think you think that a beliefset can be conferred through birth. Which would place Jewishness on the physical level. Which is patently ridiculous. That&#39;d be like saying that a newborn baby is capable of understanding deep abstractions and theology. No offense, but that&#39;s retarded.</p>

<p>Beliefsets [religion] is non-physical.</p>

<p>Genetic codes [organizations of substance] are physical.</p>

<p>It is well-known that certain Jewish populations, such as European Jews or Yemenite Jews, are genetically isolated from their surrounding populations and have rare but identifying alleles. When I said genetic Jew, I am referring to someone who is a descendant of these populations. I could have said ethnic Jew, but in the context I felt that genetic Jew was a lot more particular. Genetic Jew in the sense of genetic Icelander or Finn, not in the sense of Genetic Christian or Genetic Mormon. </p>

<p>Not all Ashkenazi go to temple and believe in God. Those that do not are not Jewish. They&#39;re simply some Caucasian genetic line and that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re still assuming that there is a link between religion and genes. That&#39;s ridiculous no matter how you cut it up. Didn&#39;t you just bring up Mormons?

<p>And, technically, yes, you can be a Jew and a Buddhist at the same time, but these are beliefsets you&#39;re discussing. Obviously a person of any given genetic line can be a Buddhist and a Jew. That has zero to do with genetics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re just being obtuse. You aren&#39;t reading what I&#39;m saying. You&#39;re probably skimming it.</p>

<p>I said that there are several ethnicities labeled &quot;Jewish.&quot; It has nothing to do with believing in or practicing the religion also called Jewish. They have the same name for historical and cultural religions. But in reality, the ethnicities have <em>other</em> proper names: Ashkenazi, Sephardic, etc... Jew is short-hand. Ashkenazi Jew isn&#39;t a religion, but an ethnic group. These ethnicities are as real as Icelandic or Pashtun. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews#Genetics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews#Genetics</a> . Denying this is either willful ignorance or racism in itself. Many people have expressed antisemitism by denying the Jews legitimacy by saying that they&#39;re fake. These communities have been isolated for thousands of years and so are rightly classified ethnic groups distinct from those around them. Further, their founder populations are from a region distinct form where most of the group lives now. It&#39;s genetically proven. Everything I say is entirely mainstream and accepted by everyone. </p>

<p>Being an ethnic Jew is not a statement on world-view unless you are misled by the fact that a follower of the religion and a genetic member of a Jewish ethnicity have the same name. It is merely an unfortunate naming convention. I feel like this is what you keep skimming over.. Without an understanding of this the rest of the post may not even make sense.</p>

<p>Being an &quot;ethnic Jew&quot; says nothing about what religion you follow or your parents follow, it is a simply a statement of ancestry. It is extremely relevant to those interested in their own history, but also especially in medicine. When I said that one can be an ethnic Jew and a Buddhist, I am saying that one can have absolutely no Jewish beliefs at all yet still be an ethnic Jew. It carries no obligations and it has no reflection on your beliefs any more than being Italian makes you a Catholic. You cannot convert to a Jewish ethnicity, but you can convert to Judaism. As a converted Jew, you may worship with ethnic Jews but you are still a member of your original ethnicity. The point was to further illustrate this not-so-subtle distinction you seem to fail to make. </p>

<p>If at this point the distinction is not clear then it is hopeless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is where I disagree with you..</p>

<p>I won&#39;t call a person Jewish out of some presumed convenience. It is that very intellectual laziness that gets us into the whole trouble in the first place. If a person does not believe in God, read tha Tanakh and go to Temple then we&#39;re not talking about a Jew; we&#39;re talking about some human being and that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>I disagree completely that you may generalize genetic groups based on what a couple of them think.</p>

<p>Like I say - you&#39;re a single step away from racism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain this then: <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Health/genetics.html">www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Health/genetics.html</a></p>

<p>Okay, I am an Ashkenazi. Let&#39;s take &quot;Jew&quot; out of the title because it seems to be confusing you. My family has been in genetic isolation from other European communities for over a thousand years -- likely much, much longer. We have our own language and history. Our population was founded by a small group that immigrated to Europe somewhere between 1500 and 2500 years ago. If ethnic groups exist, we are one. You can&#39;t find a definition that we do not fit. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that I am an Ashkenazi, referred to as an &quot;Ashkenazi Jew&quot; in scientific and historical literature, I do not hold all of the same cultural values and beliefs that my ancestors did. For example, I do not believe in the divinity of the Torah or the bible. In the same way, an Italian may not hold the same cultural values and beliefs that their ancestors hold, such as rejecting Catholicism as a true religion, yet this does not change the fact that they are Italian? Why? Because Italian refers to their heritage. In the same way, being an Ashkenazi refers to my heritage.</p>

<p>I am distinct from a Sephardic, but I am more related to a Sephardic than a Frenchman or a Pole -- despite the fact that my ancestors may have immigrated there 300 years ago. We -- Sephardics and Ashkenazis - fall under the same cultural umbrella and genetic evidence points to a historical relation.</p>

<p>As the link above shows, there is important medical implications that make it necessary to identify and label my ancestry. We have exactly the same right to do so as any Korean or Finnish person. Historically, Sweden identified as a Christian nation but to be a genetic Swede says nothing about your personal beliefs. The history of my people is relevant to me and explains my origins. To be told that you don&#39;t have the right to identify as a group is a double-standard and is the height of racism. Denial of existence is akin to genocide, being one of the first steps that leads to the elimination of a people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In scientific and historical literature.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you mean to say that <em>all</em> histrical  and scientific literature agrees with one another? Do you read much? Are you aware of the huge splits in literally every discipline?</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;ve been down all of these roads. I&#39;ve read the scientific orthodox and the historical canons and the religious tomes and blah, blah, blah. I&#39;m well aware of the wild claims that God picked people that he thought were totally totally cool and so on. I get it. I think it&#39;s a bunch of bull. Let&#39;s assume an anthropomorphic - &#39;sitting&#39; - God. That God would have made all of the universe. All of Man. He would not be playing favorites. To say that He would cast judgement based on a genetic variation over which a person has no choice is to make God a complete asshole. </p>

<p>If you want to believe in such a God that&#39;s fine. I do not.</p>

<p>This would be a great example of one of the many splits I talked about in the first paragraph.</p>

<p>You&#39;re taking the words of others far too seriously. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve sat down for a month straight and thought about this without the interruption of others. Get away from your friends and family. Get away from television. Get away from Neo-Nazis. Get away from coffee shop gurus. Get away from everyone and everything and think for yourself. Ask yourself if you get to define who and what you are or if someone else gets to define who and what you are. I think you will only find these answers with deep thought; which I do not see in you. Not that this can&#39;t change. You always have the option of thinking for yourself.</p>

<p>You are blinded by ideology. I think you think and that being Jewish is somehow important. This is a normal human search for identity issue. In the 70&#39;s Black Americans did the same thing when they started moving toward Islam (it was fashionable back then - you might get a kick out of the 5%). My own family did this when they went all ape shit about being from Scotland. I was told innumerable times that I&#39;m a Scot. Which I&#39;m not. I&#39;m an American culturally and on a genetic level I have links, but that&#39;s about it. Where did those genes come from before Scotland? Basque. Where before Basque? Africa. Where before Africa? Who fucking knows. We can&#39;t go any farther back.</p>

<p>And you know what? The difference - genetically - between you and me is less than a hair&#39;s breadth. You and I are essentially the same person apart from minor variations. If you think these minor things are of the utmost import then I leave you to to it. I&#39;m not impressed and would rather spend the time looking at trees and petting my kitty cat. You, on the other hand, are consumed with some quest involving a link between beliefsets and genetic codes.</p>

<p>You are the same as any Arab, African or Asian. The difference is less than 1%.</p>

<p>Consider that God made you with Love. God made you in His image. Go forth and Love. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is self-congratulatory mental masturbation. I am sorry that your mind hasn&#39;t developed to a point where you can fathom concepts without believing in them. </p>

<p>In this world, ethnicity exists and it has value. You can define things all you want personally, but you can&#39;t act like your personal definitions are universal. You are violating the good-faith requirement for debate. You should have stated from the beginning that your beliefs were unconventional and that you do not believe in ethnic groups at all. Or are you just making it up as you go along? The fact is, I have displayed enormous patience in trying to communicate what is actually a fairly simple and uncontroversial concept with you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious? I hope you realize that you disagree with those opinions because they&#39;re utterly ridiculous and you have a lick of common sense. I make it very easy to determine my credibility by making simple, coherent points to communicate my argument. I have a purpose, not an agenda. And that purpose is to spread common sense.

<p>I find it necessary to speak up against any unchallenged propaganda just because I can. The thing you don&#39;t realize is the consequences of an unchecked echo chamber. It results in real social consequences as more and more ignorant and usually young people are sucked into fringe, extremist ideologies. If you&#39;re going to talk about how all Jews are responsible for Communism, you better bet I&#39;m going to be there doing the best I can to point out the flaws to everyone else. </p>

<p>I often avoid this place for its overt antisemitism and prejudice.

<p>But its very possible to be against Zionists and be anti-semitic at the same time. Keep in mind that every single person who is anti-semitic is going to be by default anti-zionist.

<p>I think there are Jews which are not Zionists, as well as Arabs that are not Zionist or Jewish.  Being against Jewish Zionist&#39;s doesn&#39;t make you anti-semitic either, since you&#39;ve only indicated that you are against a subset of the Zionist&#39;s out there.  If they said that they were also against Jewish non-zionists and Arabs, then they could be said to be anti-semitic.</p>

<p>To be anti-semitic, does one need to be against one particular subset of the Semites, or do they need to be against them all?   Is Israel an anti-semitic state, since it clearly hates all arabs?</p>

<p>My original point is that every single antisemitic(or anti-Jewish to make it easier for you to understand), is going to be anti-&quot;zionist&quot; by default. Every white nationalist neo-nazi is gonna say he&#39;s anti-zionist. Every Muslim fundamentalist who believes that Jews are evil based on his religion is gonna be anti-zionist. While true, they are anti-Zionist, they are also very much anti-semitic.

    <div class="md"><p>Since the Talmud is critical to your understanding of the world, I suggest you become extremely educated in its inner workings. It appears to be one of the cruxes of your world view in that you rest your opinions on many things based on your presumptions of it. You should become an expert in it. Think about it -- you would be able to do a lot of good and dismantle what you think is an important secret. Or you might learn that you are mistaken and that your previous opinion is untenable. Either way, you stand a lot to gain from doing primary research about this subject (from the original sources and Jewish commentaries).</p>

<p>I think you might benefit from reading the Jewish point of view on those portions of the Talmud. Many are mistranslated, taken out of context or are just made up. Further, the nature of the Talmud is different than the Quran, the Torah or the New Testament. Some passages are written accounts of an &quot;oral law&quot; allegedly passed down to Moses in addition to the Torah, that is true. But the Talmud is more than that. It was not created to be a dogma, but a central source to organize Jewish knowledge at the time many, many centures ago. Many portions of the Talmud are written accounts of legal debates in which the merits of certain positions are written -- often contrary to each other. You may have a rabbi argue an opinion that is anti-gentile, and then you read about another rabbi giving his opinion about the opposite. That is just one format of the Talmud.</p>

<p>I think if I can go to those anti-gentile sections, and understand what it is trying to say, then I would certainly be in a better position to offer an opinion on it.</p>
