      <p>
       For the past few days this subreddit has been derailed with one-sided posts siding with palestine and criticizing everything Israel with very little-to-no conspiracies to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the two countries are big in the news right now and this is normal, but we really shouldn't let it detract the meaning of this subreddit into a normal anti-Israel subreddit. That won't do anything but chase potential members away, both believers/non-believers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how about it,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Could we please start going back on track with actual conspiracies like Icke/bilderburgs/chemtrails and less anti-Israel/pro-Palestine posts? I miss reading the discussions.

       The conspiracy at hand is that Israel is not the US's friend, as there's no proven strategic boon that warrants that the United States has to fight their wars for them, as well as bully the UN into overlooking their atrocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti-Israel posts usually coincide with this conspiracy, so there is no "being anti-Israel for the sake of being anti-Israel." which I know is what you want to claim. It's a legitimate conspiracy that every single American has to ponder, especially now that Israel is butchering Gaza (Again), on tax-payer dollars.

       I would like to agree with you but .. again, I can't. I really have no love for the state of Israel but I don't think half the posts on the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       even belongs since they're all common battle reports or quotes of other nation leaders on the current conflict and all with an anti-israel or pro-palestine slant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there's also the fact that
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       is deleting said posts but I still do not think that's an excuse to post them here. But then again, I'm not a moderator and all I spoke above is just a suggestion.

       If
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       wants to go on it's path of reporting news from the conflict, then by all means go ahead. It's just going to derail the subreddit further.

       Your endeavor is doomed to fail; throughout history Israel and the Jews have both been the schizo's favorite topic of discussion and blame (and they are considered one and the same).  The root cause is of course hatred for Jews, but they can't express this sentiment outright so they must hide it behind being anti-Israel to a point that passes all logic.  In other words, your post contains a nice sentiment, but one that will never succeed among this crowd.

       As an individual who went to Hillel school, has many Jewish friends, and finds the State of Israel to be a terrorist state that should answer for its actions in the Hague, I disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do see your point. A nuanced view of international conflict and law is difficult to do with hatred (anti-semitism in this case) clouding one's judgement. And a good amount of those espousing anti-Israeli viewpoints just hate Jewish people. Hatred is not a valid premise for an argument.

       Hey here's someone now who "doesn't dislike the Jews", he only "dislikes Israel's style of governing" (whatever that means).  Yet somehow green-light, just like the many other 'innocent' 'anti-Zionists', also keeps company with others who do vehemently express their hatred for Jews and/or outright deny that the Holocaust took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and by the way, yes I do believe that terrorists, including Palestinian ones (and Jewish ones for that matter, but they're more common than Israeli terrorists and are frequently not even practicing Jews) are cockroaches.  Every terrorist is a cockroach.  You caught me red handed green-light, this is going to make for a fabulous submission to your meh subreddit :D

       I agree with OP.  It's not the number of Gaza stories that's troubling, it's the content.  About 50% are just random opinion pieces by obscure blogs or foreign journalists with no real inside knowledge on the topic that we don't all have access to.

       Plus, this subreddit is following the annoying pattern of mainstream media: harp on a single topic to the exclusion of all others from a one-sided viewpoint until people are literally numb to said topic.

       Notice how I never said to stop speaking of the conspiracies surrounding Zionism, though. All I'm asking is to get back on topic with the conspiracies and I admit I chose poor examples.

      <p>
       <strong>
        Saying Israel is bad for shooting missles funded on American taxpayer money at defenseless people isn't a conspiracy, it's just an opinion based on fact and with my opinion, yes that is bad.

       <strong>
        Saying Zionist Israel controls the media of all the western countries and that they're building an NWO is a conspiracy.

      <p>
       ^ That is what I'm for and not against for this subreddit because it's not derailing the subreddit.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In March 2010, when Petraeus was still head of the US Central Command, he gave testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee which included this observation about one of the “challenges to security and stability” faced by the United States:
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         "The enduring hostilities between Israel and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests in the AOR [Area of Operations]. Israeli-Palestinian tensions often flare into violence and large-scale armed confrontations. The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in the Arab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas."

       I am certain that the majority of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Military Leadership, and Civilian Government Officials would LOVE to see Israel finally take care of it's own problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA rates Israeli intelligence community as one of the most hostile threats it faces.  Obama was recorded venting his frustration with Netanyahu, in an public conversation that greasy little french weasel that was recently voted out of office.   And no U.S. General is willing to start WWIII by caving into warmongering Zionist-Jews endlessly whining about bombing Iran's ficticious nuclear weapons program.

       Less than 2 weeks after Petraeus is removed from the equation Israel begins yet another MASSIVE assault on Gaza which will certainly cause even more problems for U.S. Military operations in multiple Islamic states/regions.

       There is no problem with "perception" either.  The truth is easy to verify. How many times have you heard multiple...multiple U.S. Government Officials and Presidents utter "U.S. Support for Israel is Unconditional, Unshakable, Unquestionable, or even Rock Solid."

       He never provided a source of the quote. Generally when you quote someone, there's usually a source where that quote is from. Otherwise you can just make up stuff.

       You are judging others when you think people could use better judgement. No one forces any one of us to be here, or read any of the threads here. Do I like all the political shit here. No, I love the really, really far out shit man. However I don't complain about the lack of such topics. Just follow your interest and let other do the same. That is unless you intend to coral peoples thoughts. As I think many here suspect.

       That's an interesting theory and perhaps personally true as I'm just as tired as seeing all the political stuff. But it's not my intention, I just don't wish to see this subreddit turn into something it's not and with most of the same topic for nearly the last week, it's just irksome.

       But there's an interesting notion to that. Wouldn't you say that they're all being herded already, and that they currently have a herd mentality of keeping on that track of posting the same thing over and over and speaking of the same thing over and over?

       It's just a thought and I could be wrong, though.

       But according to your logic, because I want to see more conspiracy posts and less criticism against the country of Israel, does that mean anyone whom posts anything other then Anti-Israel or Israel-related conspiracies are paid by the JIDF as well?

       I just gave examples and, by far, they are actual conspiracies by definition. Maybe they were bad examples. But what the top posts are for front page
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       have been about discussing the current war with Gaza and how it's funded by tax-payer money.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how it's been for the past few days. Just Israel shooting missles into Gaza funded by American taxpayer money and the U.N. Everyone knows this, it's a general fact, and there's nothing "conspiracy" about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it speaking of any other conspiracy any different with all the conspiracies surrounding Zionists controlling/killing everything in the world? Isn't that just as "bullshit" as what you said about the others?
      </p>
      <p>
       I never actually said to stop with the Zionist/NWO stuff, mind you. I don't care if that goes on. I just dislike seeing all these general conflict reports or calling a reporter a bitch for doing her job.

       I don't really care, you're not fooling anyone Cowz. You're a liar and everyone knows it. You lied to get him banned, plain and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand you did dox Voodoomurphy, but because he's not a liar, you're still around and he's not.

       I've been on this site for 5 years and until you miserable right-wing trolls showed up a year a go it was a pretty good site. Good job on ruining it for everyone.

       I love how you make up shit and try to be nice at the end. rofl
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I was on this site for 4-5 years lurking and 3 of those years was when I made my first account. I lost that account and life went on. Voodoomurphy will get over it since he didn't have his for long. I suggest you follow reddit rules and not try to break them like your friend did. So, with that being said Happy Hanukkah grandpa!

       No. I've been here for 5 years, you've been here for one. The entire time you've been here, you've been a miserable troll that seeks to harass and smear people that don't accept your libertarian propganda. That is actually a fact.

       Is this why you found it OK to dox Voodoomurphy? When you doxed him, did you find the evidence you needed to prove he was a government shill? Or did he just turn out to be a regular guy with a different opinion than yours?

       Debatable that's a lie, but whatever. So that's the crux of it huh troll? Someone hurt you Internet feelings so now you're going to take it to IRL. As you have time and time again.

       has nothing to do with watching "shills" or "propagandists" but a gathering place for certain extremists to get together and harass people they don't like. That's all it proves.

       It's pretty obvious that the bulk of your replies are merely filler for the childish insults that fill your mind. You're just butthurt that r/skeptic debunked your silly claim yesterday that "there is no such thing as the official story" on 9/11.

       That's an interesting theory and perhaps personally true as I'm just as tired as seeing all the political stuff. But it's not my intention, I just don't wish to see this subreddit turn into something it's not and with most of the same topic for nearly the last week, it's just irksome.

       I understand. To each his own. I enjoy advocating for the devil now and then myself for entertainment purposes only of course..:) Folks just really get bent way out of shape about topics like your OP for my taste.

       I am certain that the majority of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Military Leadership, and Civilian Government Officials would LOVE to see Israel finally take care of it's own problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA rates Israeli intelligence community as one of the most hostile threats it faces.  Obama was recorded venting his frustration with Netanyahu, in an public conversation that greasy little french weasel that was recently voted out of office.   And no U.S. General is willing to start WWIII by caving into warmongering Zionist-Jews endlessly whining about bombing Iran's ficticious nuclear weapons program.
