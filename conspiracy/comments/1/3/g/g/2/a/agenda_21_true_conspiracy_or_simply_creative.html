       Let's be honest here, our way of life is far from sustainable.  And some of the things they mentioned don't seem that bad to me, like aside large plots of land for natural areas.

       'Sustainable' is an A21 word. Funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the purported goals of Agenda 21 sound very good and I also agree with them; however, the top-down power structure by non-elected officials means that a dictatorship would not only be theoretically possible - it seems like a certainty. In which case they can claim anything they want and not adhere to their claims or stated goals [Nazi Germany anyone?].
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for being good to the planet. I just don't trust these guys. They manipulate and lie. Anyone that uses such techniques as deception and manipulation is automatically suspect in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: lok into the forms you'd have to fill out if you wanted to do your own farming. Grow your own food. They may or may not allow you to grow your own food or make your own green-house. Which is counter to their claims of "Going Green."
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into it.

      <p>
       "Going green" is not black and white.  If you actually read the agenda you would see that it talks about making high density cities where most of the population would live, this would leave a lot of land open to become natural areas once again.  Obviously if people live in these mega cities they wouldn't be entitled to the dozens/hundreds of acres of land that is required for farming.  Also, I'm pretty sure you have to fill out forms if you want to become a farmer even today.

       The word 'sustainable' has been extant for a long time, yes, however the widespread use within the context of economic / ecological / whatever is very recent. I speak as a 34 year old who has been following the rhetoric for a while and even does a little hobbyist investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 90's is when the word 'sustainable' started popping up. By an amazing coincidence this book called 'Our Common Future' happens to have been published just a few years earlier [it takes time for language to permeate a culture]:

       Language is a funny thing to me. I cannot help but find myself in haughty bemusement when such terms are thrown around without knowledge of what they mean or from whence they come. I'm afraid that you'll have to be the bigger man and pardon my behavior in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're a Kool-Aid drinker. As such I'm disinclined to carry on for too much longer as I think you'll end up making fun of me or saying something designed to hurt me emotionally. I don't particularly care for that kind of an experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you about making the world better and being better to the environment. However, I do not believe the Agenda 21 people. They use deceit and manipulation as tools. I do not trust people who lie and deceive the people they're claiming to wish to help. If you think that lies, deceit and manipulation are acceptable in the context of a greater good then you're either A.) a more trustowrthy person than I am or B.) a more naive person than I am. In either case I wish you the best and I hope that it all works out.

       I, for one, would like to [God willing] save up for my own farm and simply live off the land.

       This is exactly the kind of thing that can't go on forever.  There are 300 million people in America, which is only 7.64 acres per person.  That number would be much lower if it only included arable farm land, and it's only going to shrink as the population explodes.  Basically, why do you think that you deserve more than your share of land just because you refuse to change with the times?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a form of entitlement that is rampant in this subreddit.  If the government didn't have an endangered species list (which was probably thought of as a conspiracy at some point) people would hunt certain animals to extinction because they are selfish and don't think about future generations.  If they didn't make pollution laws people would just dump hazardous waste in the woods.  Sure, stuff like that is a form of government control, but as people are living longer and the population grows, what other choice do we have?

       I'm not saying that I think that
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       should go to a farm and live off the land.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people would want to do such a thing? You? Hollywood celebrities? D.C. politicians? Chicago intellegentsia? No, not everyone wants to live on a farm and I am not sugggesting that everyone do such a thing. You're putting words in my mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would like to live in the city then you may do so. If another would like to live on a farm then he may do so. This is what 'America' is supposed to be about. Life, liberty and property [Locke - as opposed to The Declaration]. Allowing the government to dictate your actions is what we generally refer to as 'Communism' or 'fascism.' If you wish to live in such a state that is fine. I do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the momet I'll assume that you're pulling the Agenda 21 line.
      </p>
      <p>
       In which case I wish you much luck. Communism and fascism isn't that bad, I guess. It worked in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Soviet Russia, North Korea and Cuba. Surey it'll work here. You're probably right; the government knows best and we should all really just let them make the big decisions about what kinds of lives we should lead.

       Everyone would like to own land whether or not they want to farm it.  The point is, there isn't enough for everyone to do so.  So why do you think you deserve it and the rest of us don't?

       We already do, they're call "laws".  Just because the government outlaws something you want to do doesn't necessarily make it "fascist" or "communist".

       1.) I never said that I think I deserve it while the rest do not.

       You aren't able to understand what I'm saying. I don't know why.

       Do what you like. Don't do what you don't like.

      <p>
       2.) You're correct in that we do technically live in a fascist country. Mussolini's fascism [the man who coined the phrase - as you well know] is what he would call 'corporatism.' Our Federal Government is giving no-bid contracts to private corporations, subsidies to other private corporations, tax-breaks to still other corporations and there's an overlap between the Federal Government and those private corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is terrible and do not wish to live under the rule of such people. You don't seem to mind this situation. If you do not mind it then that's fine. It's only a difference of opinion. I do not like fascism and you're okay with it. It's not like these Agenda 21 rules would be enforced, though:

      <p>
       But let's go to the text for a moment. You've read the text and so this is only for the uninitiated (I'm sure you're more well-read about this than I am):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm">

       "Principle 1
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature."
      </p>
      <p>
       My point of focus is on the word 'entitled.'
      </p>
      <p>
       A.) The root is 'titulus' which means to inscribe - or 'write' or 'carve.' There is a person doing the carving. As opposed to a word in which there is no implicit secondary party doing an action to or with the primary object of definition (rock implies no secondary party unless we go into deep metaphysics - but we're trying to ground this in normal-speak so I won't bother you). So, from an etymological standpoint there's another party involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we see this from a modern perspective?
      </p>
      <p>
       B.) 'Entitle' according to three different definitions on a basic search [which I know you've already performed] involves the words 'furnish', 'confer', 'grant' and 'give.' In all cases those words not only imply, but state the it is given - by what? Well, in order to give something you must have a giver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah, now we're getting somewhere!
      </p>
      <p>
       The very first principle outlined in the Environment / Development thinger from The United Nations - which is all about Agenda 21 [note the rhetoric] - already has allusions to a statehood that grants rights [privileges?] to people / individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       In otherwords:
      </p>
      <p>
       You may only do things that the state allows. The state grants you permission to do a given thing and anything that the state does not recognize is not allowed. This is but a single step from Positive Law [I know you already know about this, but for the uninitiated: look that up some time].
      </p>
      <p>
       If the state does not allow pot then you may not smoke pot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the state does not allow donut shops then you may not own a donut shop.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Remembering that you are entitled to these things if and only if the state allows]
      </p>
      <p>
       If the state does not allow hemp then you may not grow hemp.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the state does not allow the internet then you do not get access to the internet (China, anyone?).

       I'm sure you've thought it out to this extent and do not see this as, in any way, reflecting a very real possibility. You've played this mental chess game namy times and know all the openings by heart as where I am a poor rube who has only just begun. I'll freely admit that this is an outlying suburb of the conversation as it started. However, this is the dark alley that this civilization could end up in should the un-elected policy-makers go the wrong way [yes, the U.N. is an un-elected body: you have zero representation].
      </p>

       If you like the above then that's fine. I do not wish to live in such a society; for I do not understand it nearly as well or as in-depth as you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm sure they only mean the best and that all will end up just peachy.

       You said that you want to own a farm and not being allowed to would amount to fascism.  So if there isn't enough land for everyone, and you feel that not getting some yourself is an injustice, then how is that not saying that you deserve it over someone else?

        You're correct in that we do technically live in a fascist country.

       Now I just don't think you know what that word means.  Giving no-bid contracts can be described as corruption, but saying that it makes us a fascist country is beyond sensational.

       Given by society, and the people which govern our society.  The state gives us legal rights, you know, like with the constitution.  You may believe that the right to own a gun and speak freely is a "god given" right, but you're wrong, it's given to us by the society we live in.

       Technically so is the President, we don't elect him, the electoral college does.  But the electoral college votes the way the people vote and the UN ambassador is appointed by the people we elect.

       Basically, your whole beef with this is based on semantics of one word, which you've somehow twisted to mean that we will lose our rights?

       The constitution is a document issued by our government, without the US government the constitution wouldn't be anything more than a piece of paper.  Therefore, the rights are granted by someone.  Not only have you continuously avoided responding to my arguments, you also had to throw in that little pretentious quip at the end.  Nice one.

       Yes, communitarian law is a great idea.  All the things they advocate for that are "good" already exist.  Now they are going to take those good things and turn them into bad things.  Open spaces and "natural areas" are EVERYWHERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to make areas where humans cannot enter.  restricted zones.  They want to restrict humans to compact cities, where there are NO cars, you cannot leave, everyone is just getting by because they cannot have anyone having more than anyone else that would add to "inequities".  No one will be eating meat.  No families, no children, people eventually will be grown in labs(think Brave New World), everyone will be raised by the state who will indoctrinate them into the system.

       I really doubt this is part of it, considering it's taking straight from Brave New World.  It just seems like fear mongering, which is rampant whenever big changes have to be made.

       "Charitable" Foundations, taking orders from the UN, create and fund NGOs and non-profits to go into your national, state and local governments and "advocate" for policies that align with Agenda 21.  They make it seem like it is "grassroots" movements doing all the hooting and hollering about these issues that no one really cares about(like watershed management). They dangle grants in front of hard-up city councils to start projects that cities cannot afford long term in order to drive up property taxes and drive the populations into forced poverty while building the infrastructure for forced poverty(walking/biking paths, compact living quarters).  It's blatant if you look for it.  Also any "health" initiatives that local governments are participating in are probably Agenda 21 oriented.  Any "women's empowerment" initiatives are Agenda 21 aligned.  Any kind of wetlands or biodiversity planning that is done is DEFINITELY Agenda 21.  It is so comprehensive that it is mind boggling.  BUT THAT IS THE POINT.  It's so out in the open that if you tell someone, "This is part of a vast conspiracy by the UN to turn the world into a global communist government" they fucking laugh at you, even though its out in the open and they have plainly stated their goals.  Everything is "doublespeak" too, it's constant.  This is what we've all been training our minds to comprehend with books like Brave New World and 1984.  I believe this is the test for the people who consider themselves "awake".  If you cannot see it and deny it's existence, you are
