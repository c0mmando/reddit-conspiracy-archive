       Yeah.. I know most of you believe this.. Or maybe you will, Idk? But anyway, it's true. Benevolent civilizations (or alteast ones that apparently are benevolent), are here on this planet, to chill with us I guess? But we are too hostile/weird for them(atleast most of us are), and they will not land.

       Tell those aliens to stop fucking around with their thumbs up their asses and make contact with us already. I don't give a fuck what event, timing, or opportunity they're waiting for, the world is going to shit and we need a miracle NOW. Are they waiting for the New World Order to take full effect before making their presence known? If they were truly benevolent, they'd save us from ourselves right now.

       Well actually, apparently it's some sort of
       <em>
        spiritual evolution
       </em>
       that we don't actually understand at this point.. Kind of mumbo-jumbo, but hey, what do I know? Or any of us know?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I like to point to Joe Rogan for this one, who says about that not much of reality we can actually perceive, and that there could be whole universes, realities, and worlds awaiting us? I like to think of DMT trips, when I see the idea that people just *fly* off to whole other worlds, or
       <em>
        zoom-out
       </em>
       so to speak, and contact these aliens races also?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that, the telepathic contact I share is one of a perceived way-of-being that I have obtained. But I think that because of that, I am attracted to situations that allow me to find truth? So to speak? So I think that what I am saying is true. It requires like, a loving demeanor. And lack of fearful or angry emotions. I know that sounds liek batshit, but to my experience, it's true, and there's much more to your emotions than just neurons and synapses.

       The point is for us to save ourselves. We're more than capable, but we march on towards self-destruction. If 'they' save us, then 'they' will be come responsible for mediating every dispute we have as a species and our maturity will be further stunted.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why should they save us? Are you willing to admit you are too disgusting and low to save yourself? I'm not.

       I'm not the one threatening the world with nuclear weapons, but the ones who are certainly won't give up their power just because they've seen the error of their ways. The average person on the street see's war as a grotesque act of cowardice, and a testament to how primitive we are as a species. If we had a shining example of how we could be (say, from a superior and benevolent race from the stars) then that would be the kick humans need to get their shit together and say, "We could be just like them." Until then, the powers that be will never let go of their stranglehold to maintain their tyrannical rule.

       It is up to us to prove we are willing and capable of overthrowing exactly that kind of tyranny all on our own to demonstrate unprompted that we

       a while ago, but got kind of shit on. Those people are not very open :P
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like if I get some proof in the form of a night vision video of the craft, they will believe, but they still won't be open enough to accept the spiritual aspect of it(and maybe some of you won't either..-_-) It's sad really. But hey, what can you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's mainly because

       Well.. to do that, I'd have to go get a night vision camera. Which I
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       do, but I'm 18 and live at home, with no job atm. soo.. Maybe with enough convincing my dad would give me enough money to let me get one?
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, I could tell you all you need to do it yourselves. And that you

       do it yourselves?

      <p>
       Or, if any of you live near Richmond, Virginia, I could say come out here and I'll show one of you a flyover?

      <p>
       ..Pick one.

       Well, I practiced meditating alot. And then I got into spirituality(which is like, religion -onmipotent god +self-development? I guess?..)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I got into UFOs, and the ufos.. wait no. The UFOs got me originally into spirituality, because I started reading channelings and whatnot, and I uhh.. started to get into all sorts of stuff,demonic,possession,evil aliens.. But eventually worked it out to where I only studied positive alien material and works. I realized that I was very passionate about this stuff, and alot of channelings talked about ET possession into this world, and ascension into a higher level of consciousness. So I wanted to do that. And I still haven't gotten into psychoctive drugs just yet, but those might be fun, and productive towards this. I mean
       <em>
        have you seen
       </em>
       what people report on DMT trips? I, for one, don't think they're crazy. I think it's actually possible for humans to ascend into higher dimensions. I mean, there's so much talk about it. Why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, anyway, I'm getting off topic. The point is, that it involves putting yourself into a positive state of mind, and transferring your consciousness energy into what you think to be another being. Like, just imagine it. Basically, I go into a meditative state, and send my consciousness out to the heavens. I'd say it requires a specific kind of person. Most people in the world probably wouldn't have a clue what I am even talking about and just call it mumbo jumbo, or whatever.

       Belief is dangerous, but you sound more like an explorer than a believer. I suppose I believe very little... I believe I'm experiencing something. That's about it :).

       Yeah that's it. It's not a belief. It's an experience. We all experience something to learn more. You don't find "God" through belief, but experience of the higher realms in which "God" - the sum total of all things in the universe in pure form, exists.

       I think they are, and also some are good. But it doesn't matter.

       No, there's much more than that out there. It's infinite. Like, literally, infinite possibilities.

       There's no need to think that "one way" is better than the other way, or what not. Imo what matters is how you follow your specific path, and find a higher purpose and meaning to reality.

       Thanks. Both good points. Nothing is true and everything is permissible. I'm just enjoying the chance to discuss the ways of getting "there". I can also attest to the joys of psychedelics for engaging my hyperspace,  and they work similarly to what you've described. If you choose to engage with them positively you'll have positive experiences, and one can apply that philosophy to all of life.

       I don't even know... See even I'm skeptical about this, because I can't tell who I'm communicating with. I mean sure, it
       <em>
        feels
       </em>
       good, but what the hell does that mean? Ya know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, It's more of a
       <em>
        feeling
       </em>
       approach than actual speech, and I usually only do it to get them to fly around for me when I'm bored. But they teach me things too? Again, it's through feeling. So I can't describe it too well..

       Again, it's not words. And I don't think they're really here to teach me/us, anything..I just think we learn ourselves. Like, they're watching over us, like parents, while we play in our playpen xD Sorry, that's the best analogy I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just know that the nature of reality is a positive one, and the nature of "God" is to serve, like a big, fun, world of play. But right now, we're in a dark world, of our own creation, to see what it's like. And that's what were learning at this time in human history.

       Also, to get out..

       But they don't teach me anything. They just fly around. :) It's quite fun xD

       Oh. Well I think they are the Galactic Federation of Light. I'd like to say that's who they are, based on what I feel. Like how you can *feel* that somebody is nice or not, through a photo? It's kinda like that. I feel that, except that they are a positive alliance of benevolent beings here to watch over us and fuck ourselves up, and

       Are you sure about that? Djinn is muslim spiritual deities. I believe that I am speaking with more benevolent creatures, and ones that wish us no harm. I don't think that muslim interpretations of spiritual concepts and ideas and necessarily accurate. Sorry.

       Hmm that's true.. I was actually thinking some pretty dark thoughts earlier. I should watch out...thanks for informing me!Really. Thanks. Although I am sure that in the end, all is positive. It is just negative to go through the experiences of being a negative being.

       Well.. to do that, I'd have to go get a night vision camera. Which I
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       do, but I'm 18 and live at home, with no job atm. soo.. Maybe with enough convincing my dad would give me enough money to let me get one?

      <p>
       Other than that, I could tell you all you need to do it yourselves. And that you

       do it yourselves?

       I'm not the one threatening the world with nuclear weapons, but the ones who are certainly won't give up their power just because they've seen the error of their ways. The average person on the street see's war as a grotesque act of cowardice, and a testament to how primitive we are as a species. If we had a shining example of how we could be (say, from a superior and benevolent race from the stars) then that would be the kick humans need to get their shit together and say, "We could be just like them." Until then, the powers that be will never let go of their stranglehold to maintain their tyrannical rule.

       No, there's much more than that out there. It's infinite. Like, literally, infinite possibilities.

      <p>
       There's no need to think that "one way" is better than the other way, or what not. Imo what matters is how you follow your specific path, and find a higher purpose and meaning to reality.
