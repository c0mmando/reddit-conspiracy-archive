    <div class="md"><p>Well actually, apparently it&#39;s some sort of <em>spiritual evolution</em> that we don&#39;t actually understand at this point.. Kind of mumbo-jumbo, but hey, what do I know? Or any of us know?</p>

<p>I mean, I like to point to Joe Rogan for this one, who says about that not much of reality we can actually perceive, and that there could be whole universes, realities, and worlds awaiting us? I like to think of DMT trips, when I see the idea that people just *fly* off to whole other worlds, or <em>zoom-out</em> so to speak, and contact these aliens races also?</p>

<p>I would say that, the telepathic contact I share is one of a perceived way-of-being that I have obtained. But I think that because of that, I am attracted to situations that allow me to find truth? So to speak? So I think that what I am saying is true. It requires like, a loving demeanor. And lack of fearful or angry emotions. I know that sounds liek batshit, but to my experience, it&#39;s true, and there&#39;s much more to your emotions than just neurons and synapses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one threatening the world with nuclear weapons, but the ones who are certainly won&#39;t give up their power just because they&#39;ve seen the error of their ways. The average person on the street see&#39;s war as a grotesque act of cowardice, and a testament to how primitive we are as a species. If we had a shining example of how we could be (say, from a superior and benevolent race from the stars) then that would be the kick humans need to get their shit together and say, &quot;We could be just like them.&quot; Until then, the powers that be will never let go of their stranglehold to maintain their tyrannical rule.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/11xqmb/aliens_already_exist_on_earth_bulgarian/c6qinzl">did</a> a while ago, but got kind of shit on. Those people are not very open :P</p>

<p>I feel like if I get some proof in the form of a night vision video of the craft, they will believe, but they still won&#39;t be open enough to accept the spiritual aspect of it(and maybe some of you won&#39;t either..-_-) It&#39;s sad really. But hey, what can you do?</p>

<p>It&#39;s mainly because <a href="/r/ufos">/r/ufos</a> is just for people who want to study ufos. Not for those who are ET enthusiasts/people who are searching for more in life. But that&#39;s just my rant/etc...</p>

<p>I answered alot of questions there, actually, so some of you might want to go check it out, but I can still answer here too. -_-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.. to do that, I&#39;d have to go get a night vision camera. Which I <em>could</em> do, but I&#39;m 18 and live at home, with no job atm. soo.. Maybe with enough convincing my dad would give me enough money to let me get one?</p>

<p>Other than that, I could tell you all you need to do it yourselves. And that you <em>could</em> do it yourselves?</p>

<p>Or, if any of you live near Richmond, Virginia, I could say come out here and I&#39;ll show one of you a flyover?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I practiced meditating alot. And then I got into spirituality(which is like, religion -onmipotent god +self-development? I guess?..)</p>

<p>Then I got into UFOs, and the ufos.. wait no. The UFOs got me originally into spirituality, because I started reading channelings and whatnot, and I uhh.. started to get into all sorts of stuff,demonic,possession,evil aliens.. But eventually worked it out to where I only studied positive alien material and works. I realized that I was very passionate about this stuff, and alot of channelings talked about ET possession into this world, and ascension into a higher level of consciousness. So I wanted to do that. And I still haven&#39;t gotten into psychoctive drugs just yet, but those might be fun, and productive towards this. I mean <em>have you seen</em> what people report on DMT trips? I, for one, don&#39;t think they&#39;re crazy. I think it&#39;s actually possible for humans to ascend into higher dimensions. I mean, there&#39;s so much talk about it. Why not?</p>

<p>Sorry, anyway, I&#39;m getting off topic. The point is, that it involves putting yourself into a positive state of mind, and transferring your consciousness energy into what you think to be another being. Like, just imagine it. Basically, I go into a meditative state, and send my consciousness out to the heavens. I&#39;d say it requires a specific kind of person. Most people in the world probably wouldn&#39;t have a clue what I am even talking about and just call it mumbo jumbo, or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it&#39;s not words. And I don&#39;t think they&#39;re really here to teach me/us, anything..I just think we learn ourselves. Like, they&#39;re watching over us, like parents, while we play in our playpen xD Sorry, that&#39;s the best analogy I have.</p>

<p>I just know that the nature of reality is a positive one, and the nature of &quot;God&quot; is to serve, like a big, fun, world of play. But right now, we&#39;re in a dark world, of our own creation, to see what it&#39;s like. And that&#39;s what were learning at this time in human history.</p>

<p>Also, to get out..</p>

<p>But they don&#39;t teach me anything. They just fly around. :) It&#39;s quite fun xD</p>
