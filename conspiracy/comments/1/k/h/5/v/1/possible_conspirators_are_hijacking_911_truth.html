        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From <a href="http://rigint.blogspot.com/2007/02/no-guru-no-method-no-teacher.html">rigorous intuition</a>:</p>

<p>You can squeeze the life out of a thing if you embrace it hard enough.</p>

<p>I remember the giddy buzz a couple of years ago when Morgan Reynolds became the first figure who could be called a &quot;<a href="http://911review.org/Media/Reynolds_9_11_truth_Video.html">Bush insider</a>&quot; stepped up as a &quot;9/11 Truth&quot; advocate, and not the most humble one at that. His splashy website and his speaking engagements quickly carried him to the forefront of the &quot;movement&#39;s&quot; second wave of leadership - which, unlike the first, is largely consumed by speculative issues of controlled demolition (Reynolds <a href="http://nomoregames.net/index.php?page=911&amp;subpage1=we_have_holes">wrote</a> that &quot;WTC demolition is truth inviolate&quot;). It was then that his theories became increasingly bizarre and his conduct particularly divisive and fractious. Now, the planes themselves were hoaxes, and the buildings demolished by &quot;directed energy&quot; beam weapons. Among those signing on to Reynolds&#39; theories was David Shayler, &quot;<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/article634203.ece">former MI5 agent turned whistleblower</a>&quot;, who alleged last September that &quot;The only explanation is that they were missiles surrounded by holograms made to look like planes.&quot; (The Sunday Times smartly remarked, &quot;are we sure this isn’t an MI5 agent posing as Shayler in an attempt to discredit him?&quot;)</p>

<p>Bill Christison, a 29-year CIA Veteran and former director of the agency&#39;s Office of Regional and Political Analysis, <a href="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/Aug06/Christison14.htm">has written</a> that &quot;An airliner almost certainly did not hit The Pentagon. Hard physical evidence supports this conclusion.... The North and South Towers of the World Trade Center almost certainly did not collapse and fall to earth because hijacked aircraft hit them.... These first two points provide the strongest evidence available that the &#39;official story&#39; of 9/11 is not true.&quot; Retired Major General Albert Stubblebine, former director of the US Army Intelligence and Security Command and military <a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2005/12/i-wish-that-hadnt-happened_09.html">patron</a> of remote viewing, now says &quot;I look at the hole in the Pentagon and I look at the size of an airplane that was supposed to have hit the Pentagon. And I said, &#39;The plane does not fit in that hole.&#39; So what did hit the Pentagon? What hit it? Where is it? What&#39;s going on?&quot; And Paul Craig Roberts, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration and former Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal, <a href="http://lookingglassnews.org/viewstory.php?storyid=6923">writes</a> &quot;I will begin by stating what we know to be a solid incontrovertible scientific fact. We know that it is strictly impossible for any building, much less steel columned buildings, to &#39;pancake&#39; at free fall speed. Therefore, it is a non-controversial fact that the official explanation of the collapse of the WTC buildings is false.&quot;</p>

<p>What credibility is lent Roberts for having served under Reagan, or for having been in The National Review&#39;s radical right stable? (&quot;In their hatred of &#39;the rich,&#39;&quot; Roberts has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Craig_Roberts">also written</a>, &quot;the left-wing overlooks that in the 20th century the rich were the class most persecuted by government. The class genocide [in communist societies] of the 20th century is the greatest genocide in history.&quot;) Before &quot;9/11 Truth,&quot; Reynolds <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Reynolds">was calling</a> for the rolling back of US labor regulation, claiming that a minimum wage contributes to unemployment. To those who argue Left and Right are false dichotomies perhaps it doesn&#39;t matter, and such characters merely represent the Truth Movement&#39;s &quot;Big Tent.&quot; But to those who see in 9/11&#39;s outline a brutish war of the wealthy few upon the world&#39;s many poor, perhaps it should matter a great deal.</p>

<p>Is it a sign of health that such figures have elbowed their way to the front? If he were still alive, we could ask Donald Keyhoe. What should we make of their laser-like focus upon Pentagon missile theory and demolition? Is it confirmation that the movement is on the right track, or that it&#39;s gone off the rails and is being led further afield? Why are none of them apparently interested in talking about, say, <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/july2005/270705testimonycensored.htm">Norman Mineta&#39;s testimony</a> before the 9/11 Commission (&quot;Do the orders still stand?&quot;), and its excision from the commission&#39;s video archive and published record? Why are insiders not to be trusted, and their authority rejected, until they begin telling us what some of us want to hear? Then, suddenly, they become guileless figures in the know who do again what they did before: lead us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you make some good points, here. another good place to point out 9/11 &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; detracting from the actual point is the documentary Zeitgeist. it fails to mention larry silverstein&#39;s insurance investment in the towers, made WEEKS before they went down, from which he reaped BILLIONS.

    <div class="md"><p>Knowing that the Port Authority had already been given a few passes (extended time) to remove harmful and costly asbestos in the towers by the health officials made leasing the out-dated towersfor99 years seem a little speculative at most.</p>

<p>Who would lease a building that needed millions in costly asbestos removal prior to any other improvements and who would lease TWO that needed it? The Port Authority had been trying unsuccessfully for years to sell the towers.... thank goodness Larry came along and decided to take such a huge financial risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can all agree that there&#39;s <strong>only one</strong> actual explanation of the events of 9/11, even if we don&#39;t agree on what it is. Only one set of events took place that day, regardless of that which is known and that which is unknown (and subsequently speculated on).</p>

<p>However, conspiracy theorists have tended to diverge, rather than converge on explanations of an event, indicating that their theories generally lack rigour in many cases.</p>

<p>After all this time you should all pretty much agree on almost every aspect of that day, but you still get the inevitable splinter groups forming with their own explanations that they cling to vigorously.</p>

<p>The average people will claim explosives, the fans of &quot;alternative&quot; sciences will claim directed energy weapons, the clueless will think it was a nuclear bomb in the basement, people who hate the Jews will find the Jews behind it, and the mentally ill will claim there weren&#39;t even any planes at all!</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need agent provocateurs, or &quot;paid shills&quot; to be created to undermine you. You do that perfectly adequately by yourselves. The people with other alternative explanations of that day are not there to secretly undermine you. They are members of the conspiracy theorist &quot;community&quot; (for lack of a better word), excepting that they are ones who have differing personal agendas to yourselves.</p>

<p>For myself, I&#39;m here because it fascinates me <em>why</em> you believe the things you do when to me different explanations are more compelling, and not because I live in a concrete bunker somewhere receiving a government cheque to argue with you.</p>

<p>(I didn&#39;t really intend to write so much, but there you have it.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you&#39;re absolutely right about this. After posting this I stumbled across something about how splinter tactics are used to divide rather than unite the inside job crowd and I realized that this post may play into that to a degree.</p>

<p>However unless we can rule out the presence of disinformation agents within the inside job crowd (which I don&#39;t think we can), these divisions and attempts to splinter 9/11 truth will be inevitable. </p>

<p>I think the most important thing is that we press forward with an investigation to determine what actually happened, and that we don&#39;t let things like this become anything more than agonistic disagreements among allies in search for the truth.</p>

<p>At the same time, I think it&#39;s important that we take account of where certain explanations come from, their relative strengths, and what role disinformation agents are playing in subverting 9/11 truth. Part of that is certainly factionalization, but another part is getting people to believe things that aren&#39;t true which makes it harder for them to persuade those that believe the official story that it was an inside job.</p>

<p>i&#39;m not really sure if edmonds is LIHOP or not. after reading <a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2005/01/do-you-know-this-woman.html">this</a> I kind of think she&#39;s angling more towards deep politics (drug cartels/money laundering) which seems to be one of the least discussed but most important elements of 9/11</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets get real deep and dark people</p>

<p>This is a link to a video  <a href="http://youtu.be/rYDxCazAQTU">http://youtu.be/rYDxCazAQTU</a> that I found on a old Reddit post that shows someone in so much fear to answer a question. Like she knew one wrong word would get her brains splattered. Listen very carefully with the questions asked and the answers given. </p>

<p>Here is her evidence. 
<a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam1.html">http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam1.html</a></p>

<p>Then read this speech from September 10,2001 by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld<br/>
<a href="http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430">http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430</a></p>

<p>My opinion about the speech is he was letting us know on what was going to happen for us doing something what he and his associates think was wrong for our own good. Like a parent giving a lecture before a spanking for the kids own good on something the kid had no control over,or something the kid didn&#39;t even do to begin with. </p>

<p>The Pentagon Bureaucracy orchestrated the 9/11 attacks using all their resources to get us to continue to finance and go along with their plan. Look where we are today since then as a Nation.  </p>

<p>That was the chime video. The one he just  made public can be heard way better. </p>

<p>It seems like some of the things you are saying seems like parables. </p>

<p>Reasons why I believe Dr. Judy Woods. 
1. The building started and stopped the unstoppable pancaking effect proving her anti gravity characteristics. Planes hit, weapon on weapon off. Next building same thing. Last building for the truth to be found that it wasn&#39;t the planes and fire that disintegrated the buildings into dust. 
2. They had to stop it to leave some rubble behind to not look so obvious. 
3. Her emotions in the interview proved to me she&#39;s truthful. </p>

The Fallen Angels are here and they play by Gods rules and enforce his wants through the CIA with technology and money. Bit by Bit.

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect this fellow means it literally. He seems to believe that actual corrupted angels from the Christian mythology liaise with modern US spy departments using a holy weapon that they somehow got hold of, and that the supposedly omnipotent God continues to let them have.</p>

<p>In fact from the &quot;they play by Gods rules and enforce his wants&quot; part this makes me think that he believes that demons work directly for God and blew up a few buildings because of &quot;reasons&quot;.</p>

<p>Perhaps that&#39;s covered under the &quot;working in mysterious ways&quot; disclaimer, eh?</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong DC713, please just come out and say it. Tell us what you actually believe.</p>
