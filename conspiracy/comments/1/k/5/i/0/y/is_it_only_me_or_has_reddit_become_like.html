       Hello folks,
      </p>
      <p>
       I just made an interesting observation. Whenever I browse the Frontpage of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       I constantly notice threads from all kind of subreddits like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       ... even
       <a href="/r/funny">
        /r/funny
       </a>
       has become full with top comments of people realising the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often wonder if the post I am currently reading is in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and am consistenly suprised, that it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it only my perception or is a big bunch of the community acknowledging, what
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is claiming for years.

       you'd be surprised how many redditors are quick to dismiss us as conspiritards no matter how many conspiracies actually prove true. When multiple sources CONSPIRE to LIE about the official story that creates a CONSPIRACY. The word theory is there to be dismissive. Conspiracy theorists predicted the existence of a massive NSA domestic spying program, the fact Saddam never had any WMDs, the Benghazi embassy attack cover up (supposedly an impromptu protest against an "anti-Islam" youtube video was a highly coordinated attack, not to mention CIA agents were on the ground *according to CNN)

       I don't think there's a need to fight. Truth doesn't just go away, no matter how hard they try to repress it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are fighting against the truth coming out but truth doesn't have to fight back, it's indestructible. Their desperation is palpable. You can see it all over reddit and everywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       While they're acting all desperate we simply just point out the obvious truths as they reveal them.

       It is the nature of the beast. It simply cannot be contained. It wants to be free, it needs to be free, and it will find a way. That's very true. I just wish it'd hurry the fuck up. I've been waiting for everyone else to wake up my entire life. The slow drizzle isn't satisfying me. I'm starting to lose my patience.

       I think he means 'fight' in the sense to struggle against repression and see the truth through to the end. 
  The end goal is the truth, but the journey is the fight. The cognitive dissonance one experiences every day on their daily grind through their evidently benal bullshit existence, their self awareness of the surrounding paradigm being the only driving force towards the end goal and the removal of the status quo as the ubiquitous inevitability from peoples cortex's and the resultant influx equilibrium and truth.   As we continue our fight, with more people adjusting their worldview to be less reliant on outside forces (propaganda) which act as the desert of thought filled with an oasis of easy apathy and contantedness and more in  their own humanness, we can only hope that we will see the masks fall from these institutions built around us. There is a fight. 
The truth needs a bodyguard.

       The word "fight" implies a struggle. This whole issue is one of consciousness. That's why I choose my words with positive intention. We can achieve true liberation by our endeavours without framing them in pessimistic terms. Let the desperate be pessimistic.

       "fight implies a struggle". This is a struggle. A struggle to enter a new paradigm of consciousness and shed the old. Positive realism.

       Yeah. But these conspiracies exists long time before we found something about them in conspiracy theories. Therefore we must not feel weak. We must realize that actualy beleiving in authorities would not help us with this. We have the power when we beleive in ourselves. That is a way to live against them. What the media say is manipulation, We do not need all the crap they say about in adds. We are great people at this single moment and manipulation is rigged.

       Yes and no, yes because everything that's been reported on by the media is accepted but that's the problem everybody is like "the media is bad!!" but then as soon as they report something they are all ears while over here are mostly legitiment stories. But they won't believe it because it's not on the news. So yes because people are slightly more opened to different thinking but no because they still only accept what is on the TV.

       It's to the point that the mainstream media is so willing to speak about NSA and Snowden that I'm beginning to think that the whole debacle is there to hide something else, something way dirtier. But I don't know what... it's just my lunatic instinct kicking in: when to media point the finger one way, look the opposite way.

       Well with the recent revelations about government spying, the typical conspiracy theories are looking less crazy. Add to that there have been people here who occasionally find great stories, it shakes up the average person's image of a conspiracy theorist. I wouldn't be surprised if the readers of this sub have went up a lot as well.

       that I found on a old Reddit post that shows someone in so much fear to answer a question. Like she knew one wrong word would get her brains splattered. Listen very carefully with the questions asked and the answers given.

       Then read this speech from September 10,2001 by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld

       My opinion about the speech is he was letting us know on what was going to happen for us doing something what he and his associates think was wrong for our own good. Like a parent giving a lecture before a spanking for the kids own good on something the kid had no control over,or something the kid didn't even do to begin with.

       The Pentagon Bureaucracy orchestrated the 9/11 attacks using all their resources to get us to continue to finance and go along with their plan. Look where we are today since then as a Nation.

       Building 7 seems to have collapsed because the structure was exotic and experimental (so it could be built over the substation) and Silverstein ordered firefighters to let it burn. But as far as i can tell, the twin towers were not 100% airliner proof. Either way, i just found about about the fake Atta passport and fake bin Laden tapes, so I k kw those guys weren't involved.

       Usually, whatever I see on reddit, becomes popular in the mainstream. Example, memes.

       A part of me wants to think that an increasing number of redditors are willing to be open to facts which seem to negate the standard narrative for a number of different commonly discussed topics.  I think Snowden's revelations about the NSA's mass surveillance of American citizens really tipped the scale, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's been a more gradual transition that's only recently made a smaller, sudden influx.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that note, I've also noticed an increase in troll and otherwise abusive accounts in typically "conspiracy" related threads, given the greater exposure in the subreddits you've mentioned.  The only thing that makes them stand out to me is that they tend to
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       gravitate towards these sort of threads, which leads me to wonder if there's a growing opposition, perhaps even artificially so.  Logically, this possible conclusion just makes me wonder if there's another group of folks who have made the same observation regarding the increased open-mindedness and have concluded that such an increase is unacceptable in relation to their goals.

       The last ACTUAL president was murdered on November 22, 1963 and the forces behind that event are still calling the shots.

       The hyper partisan political environment is intentionally manufactured so that even if one of the "puppets" decided to go rogue, half or more of the population literally hates their guts. System is working as intended thus far.

       reddit in general thinks of this conspiracy reddit as they've been programmed via television-programming to think of it - as a bunch of weird guys sitting around with tin hats on coming up with absurd theories about how reddit is stealing your data to connect you to porn sites and then selling the information to credit card companies or other advertisers, that is, things that make no sense, are stupid to consider, and irrelevant.

       the military intell in charge of this division of conde naste is some of the best and brightest around...it is very hard to determine what they are doing, they have definite ebb and flow periods, and we see days when the shills back off, and days when they are more in your face or obvious....the isolation of r/politics is a sign that they did not like where that was going....just by pulling it off the top it now seems to have half the readership....they have studied every little aspect about attention span and time delay between flipping "pages" they know that by making it more difficult to get there many people will just get lazy and not go, this way people that come here new don't see politics and it can be corralled...also once entering politics, the top band is gone and you have to click the reddit dude to get back to the front, also making it more time consuming....as small as fractions of seconds seem, they make a difference is someones clicking habits...

       Considering that the vast majority of redditors won't lift a finger to actually overthrow the government, don't you think it's a waste of time for the shills to actually work at manipulating the content on here? I think most of the shills here are just deeply misguided basement dwellers. If the "internet community" is powerless either way, why would they bother engaging in elaborate psy-ops?

       well it's not powerless, really it's a strainer, what it is that it has the potential to be dangerous....but that comes down to one thing, and that is what the wild card is....they worry about "the one" somewhere out there is a "neo"....as you said, won't lift a finger, but if there was someone who could unify them and get them to lift a finger, well that could be dangerous, psyop has many layers....but I do know that they are worried about someone with hitler like qualities, but really, thinmgs just aren't that bad.....YET

       Why have psyops to suppress the truth when it's already out there and nobody cares? There is no "the one", if you look to Hitler for an example that fails. The conditions in Germany were ripe for fascism, and Hitler was just a useful idiot.

       It's to the point that the mainstream media is so willing to speak about NSA and Snowden that I'm beginning to think that the whole debacle is there to hide something else, something way dirtier. But I don't know what... it's just my lunatic instinct kicking in: when to media point the finger one way, look the opposite way.

       I think he means 'fight' in the sense to struggle against repression and see the truth through to the end. 
  The end goal is the truth, but the journey is the fight. The cognitive dissonance one experiences every day on their daily grind through their evidently benal bullshit existence, their self awareness of the surrounding paradigm being the only driving force towards the end goal and the removal of the status quo as the ubiquitous inevitability from peoples cortex's and the resultant influx equilibrium and truth.   As we continue our fight, with more people adjusting their worldview to be less reliant on outside forces (propaganda) which act as the desert of thought filled with an oasis of easy apathy and contantedness and more in  their own humanness, we can only hope that we will see the masks fall from these institutions built around us. There is a fight. 
The truth needs a bodyguard.
