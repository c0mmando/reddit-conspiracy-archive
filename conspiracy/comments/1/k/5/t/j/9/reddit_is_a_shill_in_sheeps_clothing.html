       Ugh... It's cringeworthy how the word "shill" is thrown around on this sub. It has basically become a word for "I am always right, my point of view and opinions are not up for debate, and I will put my fingers in my ear if you present evidence to the contrary". It lowers the quality of this sub in a big way, because the sub full of "critical thinkers and open minds" becomes a place full of people who don't want to prove their positions on various topics through logical argument and rationale, but instead just use ad hominem attacks because someone doesn't agree with them. If you find decent evidence of someone shilling, like
       <a href="/u/firemylasers">
        /u/firemylasers
       </a>
       among others, then by all means call them out. But stop using "shill" as a substitute for "you don't agree with me, you must be a paid government employee!".

       Its worse than even that. Its not as if many of these subjects are even fit for discussion. It seems most of this subreddit is becoming weekly world news style tabloid bullshit being posted by obvious mental cases, idiots, children, and trolls......

       Using the term "shill" around here is like the US government calling a whistle blower like Manning and Snowden as traitors. Just because some don't agree with your surmise doesn't mean they are a shill. If you can't convince with better evidence don't blame it as an easy cop out by calling that person a shill. It's used to readily as a cop out in arguments. Just like the government copping out on a whistle blower for being busted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with a lot of plenty of headlines such as banking, Bill of Right violations etc... as the evidence shows such a case for a conspiracy. However the have been some wild assertions based on poor research and then the OP goes ballistics and calls me a shill for calling that out.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP needs to cut down on the "shill bombs" IMO.

       I really do think that this sub should eliminate downvotes from comments and posts. Under normal circumstances it is a useful tool, but in the current situation it is nothing more then another tool for shills.

       Reddit is a part of the net that actually has a big following that questions what the media feeds everyone. They don't want any sort of questioning going on anymore. They love it too because downvotes are cheaper than bullets.

       Well taking out everyone on here by execution would really raise eyebrows. The down votes are very effective for this crowd. I couldn't care less but karma is god on here to the overwhelming majority.

       It's not really that. Its that most people just believe the numbers or just don't think about it any further. I reckon a majority of the lurkers never even clicks to the new tab. Making the down voting that much more effective

       I was asked if I was a shill by some person claiming to be a member of anon, and all I did was ask them what was so ground breaking in that video they made.  Seeing as all it was just information that was nothing new they just put it in a pretty format that was pretty eye candy.
      </p>
      <p>
       then they kicked me out of there irc channel because i asked them also what makes them think they are the ones that need to get this info out there in the way they are trying if people want to know then they will find out
      </p>
      <p>
       i am sick of the ways that some of these people or groups are trying to get others aware of all the shit that is going on i know i am not the only one out there that feels this way
      </p>
      <p>
       i am not savy in the politics of reddit and i only been at it for a year now but i see there is politics in it and a high degree of lazy and impatence by users
      </p>
      <p>
       example if it isn't perfect grammer then they bitch like i fucking care lol you know what i am saying
      </p>
      <p>
       another example is if the link doesn't load fast most will downvote it or bypass completely
      </p>
      <p>
       third is fucking front page is such a waste of time it is never anything important just pics of animals or peoples kids
      </p>
      <p>
       guess a shill is someone that don't see enough people giving a fuck so they don't either

       see this is another topic of conspiracy why do most people feel the need to be accepted and liked that is all the voting system is really for i never look at top coments just new tab
      </p>
      <p>
       it is always that bullshit site guardianuk and huffington post which i am sorry for those that like it but those two seem made for kids cause there articles are always short and vuage with lots of buzz words

      <p>
       which is what most people want something easy to remember that they can dribble out of there mouth to there fellow sheeple

       i would like to read something that is more then a few sentances like alex jones does anymore and soooooooo many people that i knew when i began to question what was in the cookies

       That's because you kept saying incredibly vague things and peppered it with 'I live you brother' and 'fuck you'.

       You were 'pounced on' because, like this post, you're

       I got bombarded with insults for i dont even know what and told to believe vague comments as well. Im thinking we are here to come up with specifics together. I love everybody. I'm peaceful in my personal life with my friends family and business associates. At the same time I don't fuck around with personal attacks and business is business at that point. I hate that everyone's balls are made of iron on here because 99% of the time it's some bitch ass pussy behind the screen.

       Basically,
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is why you were 'pounced on.'
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as coming up with specifics together, when you were asked what the photos were showing, and what that was implying (basically- what you were hoping to talk about), you wouldn't discuss anything. Just a bunch of 'open your mind' and then offensive defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not attacking you now, I'm trying to let you know why you aren't being received well (from my point of view), that the sub isn't overrun with shills because your thread didn't go well, and that
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       (I have no idea, just 'what my gut tells me', and you said trust that) if you'll throw out some specifics, we can refine said specifics
       <em>
        together.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to make sense of your thread, mostly because I don't want to give up easily, but I couldn't follow, and eventually you sounded rude. I think you're wanting to head in the right direction, I think you just got handed the wrong map.

       It went all over the place I know. In person no one ever talks to me the way I'm being talked to. I'm not billy badass but I'm not fucked with either because I have a little history of violence and my brother is off the wall. I got on here and saw what I thought was an open forum to exchange ideas on important issues. I don't go off on anyone who doesn't come off ass a bitch ass pussy. In my own defense I never said vaporized which is where I think shit got crazy.

       There are most certainly paid "special interest" groups here.  Heavy on many other subs as well.

       Reasons why I believe Dr. Judy Woods. 
1. The building started and stopped the unstoppable pancaking effect proving her anti gravity characteristics. Planes hit, weapon on weapon off. Next building same thing. Last building for the truth to be found that it wasn't the planes and fire that disintegrated the buildings into dust. 
2. They had to stop it to leave some rubble behind to not look so obvious. 
3. Her emotions in the interview proved to me she's truthful.

       Do you know what turns concrete into dust?  Explosives.  WTC 7 is the smoking gun.  They could not allow the planted explosives to be found in bldg 7.  They found we would believed the bullshit with McVeigh, and that we would also believe the same lies around Sep 11 being caused by poorly trained terrorists.  . I don't feel there is even close to enough evidence that advanced weapons were used.  If they were in our possession, they would also be used on our enemies eventually.  The theory makes us far less credible.  Believing that future space weapons were used in plain sight.  The burned out cars downtown definitely raise questions.  Not enough however to believe this was caused by antigravity/exotic energy weapons.  Simple timed chemical reactions brought the 3 towers down.
