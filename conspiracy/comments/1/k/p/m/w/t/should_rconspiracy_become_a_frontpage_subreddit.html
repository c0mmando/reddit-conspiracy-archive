<p>The most persuasive argument I&#39;ve encountered there is that doing this might make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> less explorative and supportive and more combative. Larger subreddits tend to have shittier communities.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure how to weigh this against the value of increased exposure and dialogue with the rest of reddit.</p>

I find the former to far outnumber the latter. The latter show up, quip some nasty little comments about tinfoil and are promptly run out of here when they can&#39;t back up their own bullshit with anything more than calling everyone in this sub and all material presented in it &#39;crazy&#39;.</p>

<p>I have often wondered however, if we did have the full brunt of reddit&#39;s commenters on us, whether it would change things.  Would we be able to argue away the majority of the shill comments?  Would we be able to change people&#39;s minds?  </p>

<p>I would absolutely love it if the shills ran out of intelligent arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of human nature.  Reddit is designed to cater to people who are not really into information.  The whole site is basically a rip off of 4chan memes but without the depth of a culture lending to subtlety in jokes or walls of text that really make you think.</p>

<p>The formatting of the posts itself does not lend itself to long form discussion, with each successive post getting indented and 7-8 deep requiring you link to a new page.  Besides that, it was well known before reddit that online voting systems don&#39;t accomplish much other than censorship.  All content centered forms operate by posts &quot;bumping&quot; a thread rather than voting.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth posting here because of the size of the user base, but the site is specifically designed as the gathering place of the low end of the spectrum.</p>

Right now it seems like a race between information revealing our recent history and information suppression and more false flags.  Precisely why r/conspiracy matters.

<p><a href="http://rigint.blogspot.com/">This</a> is a cool blog that has a lot of info on 9/11 and also talks about UFOs and stuff like that sometimes. I think it handles both subjects really well, it&#39;s one of my favorites and you might like it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m totally with you on revisiting 9/11. I think it&#39;s the key. Once it breaks into the mainstream... there will be so many retractions, and it will be impossible to get away with blanket dismissals of conspiracy theory &quot;cuz all cnspryc thry iz domb.&quot;</p>

<p>Honestly the more that I think about it the more that 9/11 seems like overreach... an act of desperation that will end up undoing tptb, in the end.</p>
