      <p>
       The most persuasive argument I've encountered there is that doing this might make
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       less explorative and supportive and more combative. Larger subreddits tend to have shittier communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really sure how to weigh this against the value of increased exposure and dialogue with the rest of reddit.

       I think the exposure to many topics would be great, but yes the community would water down and completely nullify any logical points and relevant info brought forward. purity is good. Quantity never trumps quality.

       Of course since more people would notice this sub, you have to take in account that there will be a lot more shills, trolls and misinformed people.

       It's already hard as it is to have mindful discussions about events. We don't need an even larger group of disinformants.

       That's exactly what I'm saying. People come to this sub for one of two reasons: they've made the choice to wake themselves the fuck up, or they want to ridicule it. I find the former to far outnumber the latter. The latter show up, quip some nasty little comments about tinfoil and are promptly run out of here when they can't back up their own bullshit with anything more than calling everyone in this sub and all material presented in it 'crazy'.

       I'm not sure... we could always migrate to somewhere like
       <a href="/r/conspiracytheory">

       or create a new subreddit were this to happen.

       No because the mind-set of a conspiracist is a very small section of society. If you step out of this sub you will see most of the things people purport to believe over here (Sept 11th False Flag, Chem trails, Aurora false flag etc) are not accepted and often ridiculed by the larger community.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub can only survive if it keeps it’s dedicated community of believers. Once it is exposed to the wider world it will be full of people ‘shilling’ or rather not believing conspiracy theories.

       I absolutely agree with your sentiment.  I don't think this sub should be default either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have often wondered however, if we did have the full brunt of reddit's commenters on us, whether it would change things.  Would we be able to argue away the majority of the shill comments?  Would we be able to change people's minds?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would absolutely love it if the shills ran out of intelligent arguments.

       (of course the flip side of this is that their arguments would become more sophisticated, which in some senses we see happening already.)

       Kind of human nature.  Reddit is designed to cater to people who are not really into information.  The whole site is basically a rip off of 4chan memes but without the depth of a culture lending to subtlety in jokes or walls of text that really make you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The formatting of the posts itself does not lend itself to long form discussion, with each successive post getting indented and 7-8 deep requiring you link to a new page.  Besides that, it was well known before reddit that online voting systems don't accomplish much other than censorship.  All content centered forms operate by posts "bumping" a thread rather than voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's worth posting here because of the size of the user base, but the site is specifically designed as the gathering place of the low end of the spectrum.

       More attention = more trouble = tighter moderation = another neutered subreddit. Maybe that
       <em>
        would

       fit with their agenda, if there is one.

       I think I'd rather just operate in relative obscurity and let topics that resonate more widely naturally rise to the front page on their own.

       I don't think that it should be default. I would like to think that this sub attracts a certain kind of person who is looking for the truth about the world around them. The community here is really quite nice in comparison with other subs.

       if it gets watered down, another subreddit will simply take over the original members - lets call it 'real conspiracy'.. the upside to this being conspiracy looses it's 'nut-job'-affiliation and gets an alternative socially accepted place amongst new-commers, that can then be enticed to go to this new 'real conspiracy' subreddit. maybe this would also further waterdown the negative perception of the word conspiracy..

       I'm with you on the importance of 9/11 truth and the general quality of this subreddit when it comes to 9/11 info, but there are probably shills here

       I agree that more exposure to 9/11 conspiracy theory and dialogue about 9/11 would be one of the main benefits of making this sub a default, and it may also serve as a tipping point for a lot of people that don't take conspiracy theory seriously.

       I'm sure there are shills in other subs as well but there are also just a lot of people that disagree with us.

       Yeah.  And the nature of the material means critical 9/11 research has to be lumped in with silly UFO shit here.  But at least it gets a wider audience.  It's sad the media has been neutered so utterly; the conversation should be as wide and public as the 60s peace movement, and not reduced to an internet forum.

       There may be UFOs, but I agree with you on the relative importance of these theories for now (and a lot of UFO shit is silly).

       I'd need a lot more evidence for UFO's than what I've seen, but as for a coming change, I'm hoping so too.  Right now it seems like a race between information revealing our recent history and information suppression and more false flags.  Precisely why r/conspiracy matters.  We can't break their narrative without publicly revisiting 9/11 and purging the entire Nazi school of Leo Strauss from our government.  Be safe, Edward Snowden, whoever you are.

       The first time I tripped I saw some UFO's :p

       is a cool blog that has a lot of info on 9/11 and also talks about UFOs and stuff like that sometimes. I think it handles both subjects really well, it's one of my favorites and you might like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm totally with you on revisiting 9/11. I think it's the key. Once it breaks into the mainstream... there will be so many retractions, and it will be impossible to get away with blanket dismissals of conspiracy theory "cuz all cnspryc thry iz domb."
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly the more that I think about it the more that 9/11 seems like overreach... an act of desperation that will end up undoing tptb, in the end.
