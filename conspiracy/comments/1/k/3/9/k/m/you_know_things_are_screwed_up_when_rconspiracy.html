Now every single &quot;news&quot; site I use too visit is so blatantly censored and propaganda filled that they are effectively useless in every way. Even other subs here on reddit are worthless now, and too make things worse it seems to me that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is quickly following them. I feel as though pretty soon there will not exist any way to get reliable news and that scares the shit out of me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s another problem in reddit, in that it does not have open courts where one can formally dispute complaints against oneself that result in censorship or bans.  This current closed court system allows brigades to remove opponents without someone having any means of defense against biased, owned, mods and admins. Because the manipulators know this, they have become very effective at crushing resistance against lies. r/conspiracy seems to be run fairly and doesn&#39;t have this problem, but other news subs definitely do. The problem is that when the brigade can&#39;t eliminate people through downvotes, they turn to meta methods. So eliminating downvotes will alone not be enough, the rules and systems need some strengthening against gaming and staff infiltration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like on most of the internet, the strategy is to dump propaganda, and derail legit discussion.  They&#39;re getting better and better at this.  Internet comments have a formula for success.  You can use this formula to your advantage to push whatever you want to push.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you see the same handful of users in every Snowden/NSA post using the same soundbites and tactics.  And then every once in a while there&#39;s a well crafted and well upvoted comment that is designed to create the feeling that we&#39;re all bugs, that the computer spy grid is inevitable, and we should love and accept our new overlords.</p>

<p>It&#39;s oppressive.</p>

<p>Here on the other hand, I think there are different tactics.  You see a lot of disinformation and &quot;turd in the punchbowl&quot; type stuff.  For normal readers, you just tune it out.  But this stuff is designed to malign &quot;conspiracies&quot; in the eyes of the general public.  So when they show up here, they see a post talking about Feinstein being an asshole (which is true), and then the same comment refers to her as &quot;Queen Jew.&quot;</p>

<p>So now in the mind of the general public who are already finely tuned to spot anti-Semitism, people who criticize Feinstein are nut-case neo-Nazis who are only mad at her because she&#39;s Jewish.  Then, to complete the one-two punch, these same people go on Maddow and see a 15 minute expose&#39; about how conspiracy theorists are actually neo-Nazis who work with Al Qaeda.</p>

<p>The GOOD NEWS, if there is good news, is that all of this seems to be targeted at young people.  I&#39;d say the battle ground is now for the hearts and minds of the 15-24 age group.  That&#39;s where all this stuff is being pitched, in tone and location and approach.</p>

<p>Why is this good news?  Because the powers that be are ultimately crusty old assholes.  Yes they hire &quot;cool ultra hip&quot; people to do their propaganda, and yes it has SOME effect on SOME people, but overall, I think the young people are clever and will ultimately see through it.  But the tactic of &quot;these people are racist&quot; is powerful, because young people are tuned to justice and peace, and for this reason they will try to stay clear of &quot;hate&quot; messages.  Especially if the connection gets strong enough between &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;conspiracy,&quot; it will be really damaging.</p>

<p>Sorry to be ranting, but it really grinds my gears, especially the way that it&#39;s now &quot;uncool&quot; to talk positively of human beings.  Saying that people are amazing creatures is cringeworthy, but praising the government or saying that their takeover is inevitable is considered sound judgement and fully reasonable.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s accurately what people think, but I think most are too afraid to look or feel uncool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s super-clear that mods of other subs, and some admins, are owned and act to censor, removing comments, banning users on behalf of requests by shills, some admins shadowbanning users upon request by certain neocons on reddit.  There&#39;s been a lot of compromising of reddit</p>

<p>r/conspiracy is indeed one of the few uncompromised news places here. No wonder r/conspiratard works so hard to try to take it down. They&#39;re doing serious levels of brigading and vote gaming this sub though. I have to wonder how long this sub will last before the tsunami crushes it.  There&#39;s the military social media manipulating teams on it, and the corporate ones (Monsanto et al) and the political ones (Obots, Hillary bots and more). There&#39;s some serious money backing the manipulators. Plus government pressure on reddit, look at all the NSA defenders who were free to lie their heads off recently.</p>

<p>To be honest, nothing. I am not here because I think it is the best idea, I just have no were else to go. There is nothing left. The gov&#39;t has destroyed every viable news source I have ever trusted. If you have suggestions then please, I am all ears.</p>

<p>This is becoming the case for me. Currently I use a combination of this sub, Godlikeproductions and Abovetopsecret to get up to date with current events.</p>

<p>If there are other sites like those two that I should know about I definitely would like to know about them. </p>

<p>Wikipedia:</p>

<p>The weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term &quot;natural born&quot; citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship &quot;by birth&quot; or &quot;at birth&quot;, either by being born &quot;in&quot; the United States and under its jurisdiction, even those born to alien parents; <strong>by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents</strong>; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship &quot;at birth&quot;. </p>

<p>The U.S. Constitution allows only a “natural born” American citizen to serve as president. Most legal scholars who have studied the question agree that includes an American born overseas to an American parent, such as Cruz.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are used to conspiracies being paranoid speculation made by people who want them to be true in order to prove a point. Now that a real conspiracy has been exposed, people do not know how to react to it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like when those Soviet cables were declassified in the 1990&#39;s (google Venona project) showing that the Russians really were conducting espionage operations against the United States and infiltrating our government. Vice President Henry Wallace was a soviet spy and could have become president if Roosevelt had died earlier. But, if you go up to a random person today and ask them about the &quot;Red Scare&quot;, they will still tell you it was unjustified hysteria. Even though we can now prove without a doubt that Alger Hiss, the Rosenbergs, etc. were soviet spies, people will still say that McCarthy was evil. </p>

<p><strong>Sometimes the only people speaking the truth are those who are biased towards it.</strong></p>

<p>That is why the only people talking about the NSA are the conspiracy folks, the libertarians, and the electronic freedom people. But just because the news fits their agenda doesn&#39;t mean it is not true. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been great lately. Also, I find a lot of stories on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> before I see them anywhere else. </p>
