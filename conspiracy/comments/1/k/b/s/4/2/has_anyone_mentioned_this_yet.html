       One of the main reasons people say 9/11 could not have been an inside job is because so many people would have needed to be involved that
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       would spill the beans.
      </p>
      <p>
       However lets look at the recent developments with NSA spying on tbe world as an example of just how many people can know something that the rest would label a conspiracy before it is uncovered to be actual truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many companies knew about the NSA spying programs? How many individuals at those companies knew what was happening years ago ... getting close to a decade. Look how long it took for one single individual to step forth and break the news to the rest of us. "News" that a seemingly large amount of people not only knew about but were also helping to facilitate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it continues. The Lavabit owner making statements like - to paraphrase - "if the American people knew what I know about email they wouldn't use it." Okay well fucking tell us already! Quit beating around the bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with the reporter - I forget his name - that has unbelievable info to share ... IN TEN DAYS! What is he waiting for?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know people are scared and/or complacent but it seems clear now that the idea that someone will always be there to immediately spill the beans is a fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hats off to Snowden for doing what hundreds and maybe thousands could have also done but chose otherwise. He is imo a true patriot.

       No man, the government is a monolithic entity, that can either be a totally incompetent bungling sloth or a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.

       And then there is real life that may stop you. If you have a young family and just sorted your life out, you are less likely to spill the beans and take punishment, which could ruin your entire life. It isn't cowardice, but self preservation. Some people just can't 'afford' to whistle blow, even if they wanted to.

       You're very right.  The problem is that too many people are ignorant, and just see the evidence we 'conspiracy theorists' show them,  and believe it is coincidence.

       the NSA surveillance was known but ignored by the majority of the population because it was never aboarded by MSM, what Snowden revealed was simply the project's name and full complicity of internet and telephony companies. Here on

       even before Snowden's reveal it was already known the full reach of the NSA.

       9/11 it wasn't necessary that many people knew, the information regarding the attack was simply drowned in white-noise, while the true architects could continue plotting their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget that usually black missions and secret programs are based on a "need to know" basis, so usually no single person or company has full access or even knowledge of the full scope of the project, besides of course those on top of the pyramid.

       To be honest the thing about 9/11 is that it is incredibly hard to comprehend if you went along with it from the start. Imagine being blissfully ignorant for over a decade then someone comes up to you and tells you "everything you know is a lie" or something along those lines. The brain would automatically reject it as it is to hard to deal with the concept the government is not there for your safety like the way you were all conditioned to believe. I think the best comparison I can make here is when people believed the world was flat then someone tells you it isnt. People rejected the information furiously but eventually everyone accepted what actually happened.

       First of all, let me say that a dozen airplane crashes couldn't have brought down the Twin Towers and the rest of the WTC as it happened on the day of 9/11. The official story is crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, maybe, just maybe, the US government wasn't in on the attacks. Since there has never been a trial where evidence for hijackings has ever been presented, all we are left with is anecdotal evidence available on the internet, and there isn't much of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you realize, like I realized a long time ago, that probably no planes at all were hijacked on 9/11, that reduces the size of the conspiracy by a great deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think, "The US government was attacked by outside sources, and got tricked into accepting the hijack story," things make more sense, especially compared to a widespread conspiracy among our most pro-government ideologists (the military and government employees).

       I think that the US Government had to KNOW about the attacks at the very least.

       Obviously the attacks themselves were Mossad ops. If you can't see that you are pretty damned blind.
