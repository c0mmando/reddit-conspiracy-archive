        The adventures of a Libyan weapons dealer in Syria
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've been reading these past months and what I now think is that essentially Libya was knocked over so it could be a supply route for weapons into Syria. I'm sure everyone has seen the
       <a href="http://youtu.be/9RC1Mepk_Sw">
        General Wesley Clark
       </a>
       video where he explains how he was told of the countries that the US would knock out in the next five years.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they did eventually kill Gadaffi, they had a massive stock pile of weapons which could be funnelled into Syria. The Reuters article I posted shows that people were collecting weapons from all over Libya and shipping them out via Benghazi. Were these people working as CIA assets creating cover for the covert operation?

       If you were to take what was said by Wesley Clark in the video as true and think about how you would knock these countries out strategically, it makes sense. Knock out Libya to make a safe supply route with less diplomatic problems as somewhere else. Then via those weapons, Syria is knocked out, Hamas are effected scoring points for Israel leading up to Iran being taken out which is the main target.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets says Syria and Hamas was intact before Iran were attacked. What would Syria and Hamas's reaction be to that? I think that retaliation would be the order of the day and Israel would be fighting not only in Iran with the US but also on their borders of Palestine and even Lebanon. Going even future back, even Iraq for me was down to Israel although there was no military involvement by them, it's shown that there were lobbyists tied to Israel making the case in the Bush Administration who prior were writing up the same plans for Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the think tank documents that are to me the plans that were drawn up. Note that the main theme is removing Saddam Hussein from power first suggested for Israel and then one year later for the US which carried it out. Richard Perle wrote the first one for Israel and was a signatory to the second one written for the US.

       The Laden fairy tale, don't know who he was exactly, but I m damn sure he didn't get "killed by marines in a raid" a few years ago. He worked for the CIA.
