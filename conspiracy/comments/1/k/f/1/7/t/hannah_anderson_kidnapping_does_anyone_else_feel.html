    <div class="md"><p>THANK YOU, OP! I was sucked into the media over-hype until I read the very quote you posted. &quot;looks like we&#39;re all in trouble now&quot; Who says that? Then I read that she talked to the guy 13 times on the morning of the murders and &quot;abduction&quot;? Yeah, they were planning something big.</p>

<p>I also have a feeling she was the one who killed the little boy. Just a hunch. The guy leads the mom out to the garage and bashes her head in while the girl strangles her little brother. I truly hope there is a diary somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>or maybe the brother was the one who discovered the whole thing... maybe he catches them in the act, why else kill the brother unless he had direct knowledge...  he probably sees them having sex and dimaggio bludgeons him with the crow bar, the commotion probably alerts the dog which he kills to shut it up, but by this point the barking has drawn the attention of the mother who comes to investigate and meets a similar fate... he then rigs a delayed explosive, giving them a chance to put some distance between themselves and the crime scene... it seems plausible... but as i think about it so many other scenarios pop into my head... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many examples posted in this very thread. To recap:
-Weekend getaways alone together
-Her comment that &quot;we&#39;re all in trouble now&quot; when they were discovered by the horseback couples
-The 13 calls between the two on the morning of the killings/&quot;abduction&quot;
-The letters from her to him found at the scene
-The bizarre social media AMA she did just days after being rescued</p>

<p>What doesn&#39;t add up is the fact that the media has been perfectly fine running with the innocent victim narrative. I guess you cannot blame them as they need to be careful to not look like they are attacking a young girl who may not be guilty of anything. I admit that there is a perfectly benign explanation for all of the points listed above (maybe she just thought she was his friend and he thoroughly manipulated her for his own sick and twisted reasons). However, the media has made a business out of being completely fucking wrong on shit like this. They want a tidy little feel-good story that involves a bad man getting killed and an innocent sweetheart rescued to the world&#39;s delight. The scenario where she was actually fucking this guy and may only have crocodile tears to shed for the loss of her inconvenient brother and mother never crosses their minds. Well, if one of those letters to him describes her wish to kill her family so that they may be together that will change in a heartbeat.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my theory:</p>

<p>She and this man had a romantic relationship. She told her friends that she found him creepy, because let&#39;s be honest any other 16 year old would find that creepy. Her mother probably found out about what their outing were really about and confronted them. This man was infuriated that he could no longer be with Hannah, so he took matters into his own hands. I don&#39;t think she was involved in their murders, she probably knew nothing about it. Maybe this man told her that he&#39;d take care of the problem and that he&#39;d pick up after cheerleading practice so that they could do one of their multi-day outings. </p>

<p>She is probably mortified right now. She will have to admit that she and this man had a romantic relationship and that she did not find him creepy. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read her ask.fm from the beginning, before this whole thing went down. Most people call her a slut on ask. fm ( I don&#39;t condone cyber bullying) and someone asked why she does whip its. She even says she likes black guys and has sex with them. This girl isn&#39;t as innocent as we think, but then again teenage girls lie. </p>

<p>I think the truth will come out, especially since they found these love letters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty much exactly my theory. I think she&#39;s afraid of the relationship coming out, both because she doesn&#39;t want it known that she was &#39;willingly&#39; (given that she was probably groomed, she&#39;s a minor, and it was statutory rape if it happened) with the guy and because she&#39;s afraid people will make the link and assume she was involved in the murders. Which, I don&#39;t think she was, personally.</p>

<p>Hmmmmm....now I&#39;m thinking why murder the dog? To make it look like the whole thing had to be the older guy&#39;s plan since she would never murder her own dog?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about this particular dog or what breed it was, but possibly (a) to stop excessive barking that might have alerted others, or (b) the dog may have attacked, possibly in an attempt to protect the boy. </p>

<p>Things don&#39;t add up. She said she wish she could have done more to save them, yet she says she knew nothing of what happened until the FBI told her. Did she not call her mom to let her know she was going on a trip with this man?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both parents strike me as very odd... who lets a 16yo go on unsupervised trips with a 40yo man, friend of the family or not, this is irresponsible... I just hope the truth eventually comes out in the wash... everyone sees a pretty, young, white, female in distress and immediately assume she is a victim... when it seems that there are many many things that just aren&#39;t adding up...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funerals are not always announced publicly are they?  If I was the father who just had my family killed by my best friend I do not think I would want media attention.  I would just want to shut myself away from the world and sleep forever, considering the murderer is dead.</p>

<p>Give it some time.</p>

<p>When my grandfather died it was not for a couple months that we had the actual funeral.</p>
