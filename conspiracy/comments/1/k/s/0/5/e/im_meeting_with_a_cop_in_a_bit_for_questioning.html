<p>I haven&#39;t broken any laws so I don&#39;t really know what to expect. What do I say? How do I respond? I&#39;m just a little nervous.. </p>

<p>EDIT: So the officer didn&#39;t specify AM or PM, so it has to be tomorrow morning I&#39;m guessing. I&#39;ll post an update after its over, if I can..</p>

<p>Update: I didn&#39;t get the phone call to go to the station, and didn&#39;t go.  Sorry for this update, but if anything comes up I&#39;ll be sure to check back in. </p>

<p>Edit: I know it sounds weird and confrontational but they are only there to make a case against you.  It&#39;s in your best interest to STFU.  Honest.</p>

<p>Request a lawyer if you cannot afford one first thing.  Don&#39;t trust the movies.  They&#39;re bad but better than nothing, for sure.</p>

<p>They will tell you, &quot;Oh he&#39;s lawyering up, he must be guilty.&quot;, etc.  Don&#39;t be persuaded into talking to save yourself.  Even a Public Defender can help you better than you know how to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it was the local sheriff&#39;s department in my case. If it was anything significant I think they would have a different department come knocking in your case.  States are hard up for money, my guess is that you probably got caught speeding or some minor violation on some camera that has no legal authority so they sent a highway patrolman in to try to intimidate you into fessing up to something or they are doing some kind of accident investigation that involved the same make/model of your car.</p>

<p>and once a person becomes a police informer, that in itself is a thing they can hang over you and use as a threat to release to anybody you associate with, your reputation will suffer, you might become a target for violence of anybody that knows this.</p>

<p>They might just want to know about somebody who they think is a criminal, a law abiding person might think its OK to assist the cops, but if you name goes down in official documents, theres always the chance that a mistake (or some corrupt cop) might get your name into the hands of the criminals via legal channels or other, this opens up a nasty can of worms for you, a life changing situation, violence and intimidation for you and your family, or moving from your home town at the least to escape problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay...So then help us out here.  Think.  What do you THINK it might be about?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Did you break any law that you know about that you <em>thought</em> you got away with but, perhaps, got caught by some surveillance cameras or something? (just grasping here, btw.  I don&#39;t know)</p></li>
<li><p>Did you run any red lights and got a picture taken of you by one of those camera lights? (although that alone is NEVER enough to get you called in to a station for)</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have any friends or buddies that you hang or hung with that you &quot;knew&quot; weren&#39;t really &quot;good company&quot; or that you heard were possibly planning on doing something bad or illegal, etc?  Maybe those buddies <em>did</em> do something bad/illegal and got caught, and the trail led back to you somehow, and so now the police want to question you about them.</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of internet searching have you done lately?  Any child porn, etc?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are all, of course, just hypotheses and wonderings on my part.  If none of them or anything <em>like</em> them are the case or apply...then 1) yeah, I&#39;d wonder what all this is about as well, but 2) I&#39;d honestly not be TOO worried about it.  If, again, none of what I said apply, the I&#39;d personally go in without too much of a conscience at all.  I mean you DIDN&#39;T do anything wrong, right?  I&#39;d answer whatever questions they have and know that although I live in a world that is, for the most part, very wrong, I personally am on the side of what&#39;s <em>right</em> and that would help keep me from feeling too scared or jittery about anything.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily expect for this perspective to keep a lot of people from still being scared...but...well, it&#39;s helped me.  It&#39;s helped me before, as I&#39;ve been stopped, frisked, taken to stations, questioned etc, etc before, and on all occasions I&#39;ve been <em>very</em>, very &quot;meh&quot; because I knew I didn&#39;t do anything, so I wasn&#39;t ever really worried.  And I was always eventually let go.</p>

<p>Just my op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend. Don&#39;t talk. Only respond to questions such as name, date of birth, adress etc. Anything else ask for a lawyer.</p>

<p>If he continues to ask you questions after the basic ones, ask &quot;Am I under arrest or am I free to go?&quot; If he tries funny stuff simply repeat the question again,  If he says you are under arrest invoke your fifth amendment right - don&#39;t say shit other than to request a lawyer. They will try to intimidate or cajol you into talking, don&#39;t, even if you have done nothing wrong. They might be trying to pin a crime on you. </p>

<p>If they are looking for you I would show up. Not showing up is just a bad idea. They might take it as an excuse to grab you on the street and beat you up. And you never know there might be a warrant out or something. In todays America you can get warrants issued for tiny things, so I wouldn&#39;t simply ignore it as some are saying. </p>

<p>EDIT: Also remember cops are allowed to lie in pursuit of their duties. Don&#39;t believe anything they say.</p>
