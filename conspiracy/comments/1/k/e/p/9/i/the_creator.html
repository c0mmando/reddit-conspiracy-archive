    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the creator is a bad subject to discuss.</p>

<p>It surely could have used a better set up than OP provided.</p>

<p>I personally DO see life as a test, multiple test really.  A series of test, some more difficult to pass than others, some so easy that people fail them on purpose.  </p>

<p>Do I think that there is one religion that is THE one you must pick to pass these tests?  Nope.  That doesn&#39;t even make sense.  I think the test is bigger than religion.  Its bigger than humanity. </p>

<p><strong>PLEASE STOP DOWNVOTING EVERY COMMENT THE OP MAKES IN HIS CONVO WITH ME... THANKS</strong></p>

<p>But that&#39;s just my opinion so don&#39;t hate me for it.  I&#39;m not trying to burn anyone over it or make anyone afraid because of it.  If I did that I would fail the test.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus when asked about the destruction of the temple and the day of judgement said &quot;this generation shall not pass (everyone listening will still be alive) before these things come to pass&quot;</p>

<p>By Jesus&#39; own words the revelation has already happened and the meek have inherited the earth.</p>

<p>Matthew 24:34</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This generation shall not pass before all these things come to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world is over (the Jewish world), it ended with the destruction of the temple.  We are the meek.</p>

<p>The question you should be asking yourself, what does it mean to be the meek?
Its important to understand that Hebrew language only considered Jews to be real people.  When they speak of &quot;the world&quot; loosely translated they speak of the Jewish world.  When they speak of the nations of the world they are saying the tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>The temple was destroyed.</p>

<p>The generation has long since passed.</p>

<p>Not one stone of the temple stands upon the other.  Like Jesus said.</p>

<p>You either take his word as the truth or you don&#39;t.  You can&#39;t pick and choose.  This is my main criticism of people who preach revelations.</p>

<p>The war of the Jews already happened in 70AD.  Its done, its over.  Just like Jesus said.  It was recorded historically by Titus a roman general and by Josephus a Jewish scribe.</p>

<p>The meek have inherited the earth.  </p>

<p>Let that sink in.  Read your bible some more, as a history book.  Everything in that book is ancient history.  There is no prophecy left in it.  </p>

<p>Pick a translation</p>

<p>They ALL say the same thing.</p>

<p>This generation shall not pass. </p>

<p>I am not the one making up new shit like (the end of time) which doesn&#39;t even make sense considering Jesus said &quot;the meek shall inherit the earth&quot; which obviously couldn&#39;t happen if time ended...</p>

<p>The end great digital prophet, like many false prophets before you, you have failed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim to know more than Jesus.  Quite the opposite of you, I&#39;m simply reading his words and aligning it to documented history.</p>

<p>The war of the Jews.  The destruction of their records (how they knew who was Jewish) the destruction of the temple.  Its all done.  Just like Jesus said.  Its over and that leaves us three distinct possibilities.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We are the meek who have inherited the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus wasn&#39;t a real prophet. </p></li>
<li><p>The temple still exists somewhere underground and is hidden from the world while an entire generation has been made immortal or capable of living for well over 2000 years.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But your hocus pocus about a prophecy having to do with time ending, that apparently only you know about is pretty much on par with &quot;God hates fags and soldiers&quot; westboro baptist church nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the dating of Revelation, you establish the true historical prospective. If you date it early, you have its fulfillment in God&#39;s judgment on Israel. If you date it late, you have every man&#39;s idea. So dating plays a very important part in its interpretation.</p>

<p>There are differences of opinion as to when this book was written. These can be summed up as the &quot;late date&quot; and the &quot;early date&quot; theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. (Revelation 11:1-19 KJV)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I laugh at how fuckin pathetic the fuckin deceivers are. You are the worst because you heard but you believed him not. Believing you know more then Jesus him self. I&#39;m just saying I&#39;m betting my soul on Jesus, because I believe that he&#39;s not the fuckin liar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. (Matthew 28:17-20 KJV)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim to know more than Jesus.  Quite the opposite of you, I&#39;m simply reading his words and aligning it to documented history.</p>

<p>The war of the Jews.  The destruction of their records (how they knew who was Jewish) the destruction of the temple.  Its all done.  Just like Jesus said.  Its over and that leaves us three distinct possibilities.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We are the meek who have inherited the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus wasn&#39;t a real prophet. </p></li>
<li><p>The temple still exists somewhere underground and is hidden from the world while an entire generation has been made immortal or capable of living for well over 2000 years.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But your hocus pocus about a prophecy having to do with time ending, that apparently only you know about is pretty much on par with &quot;God hates fags and soldiers&quot; westboro baptist church nonsense.</p>
