    <div class="md"><p>If he spent all his time and his entire fortune on the Hyperloop project it would be a drop in the bucket. That project is so massive it would take the resource of the entire country (and millions of people) to complete. Musk knows this. He&#39;s trying to get people motivated to work on his idea. But, unless someone can come up with a few trillion dollars, it&#39;s just pie-in-the-sky.</p>

<p>I saw one post on Reddit and have not seen it mentioned one other time.</p>

<p>Why do you think it&#39;s odd that Elon Musk wants to collaborate with other companies/technologies?</p>

<p>Hope this doesn&#39;t sound aggressive, it just doesn&#39;t make sense in ymy eyes that this is some distraction. If it is, it&#39;s doing pretty poorly.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t gotten that same feeling at all, and I don&#39;t think the fact that he wants other companies to work along side means he doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It seems to me that him wanting other companies to join in, means he def wants to work on it, and see where it can go in the future. Something this big needs many other industries to help to make it a reality. </p>

<p>I did not see either of those though, i&#39;m not that big of a TV watcher. </p>

<p>Nobody’s Planning to Actually Build It</p>

<p>Just a minor detail here, but someone has to step up and build the Hyperloop, which means raising a bunch of money, getting California to okay a big double-barreled tube to be built along I-5 between San Francisco and L.A., and a whole list of other details. Musk may have pitched the Hyperloop concept today, but he has no intent to actually do anything with it right now: during a Tesla earnings call last week, Musk said, “I don’t have any plans to execute, because I must remain focused on SpaceX and Tesla.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it is still pretty early, and there may not be any sort of funding at this point. I still don&#39;t believe he has no intention of working on it to get something going in the future. He just released all this to the public recently, so I think we still have a lot of time before we can say nothing will come of it.</p>
