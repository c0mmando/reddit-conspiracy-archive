       If he spent all his time and his entire fortune on the Hyperloop project it would be a drop in the bucket. That project is so massive it would take the resource of the entire country (and millions of people) to complete. Musk knows this. He's trying to get people motivated to work on his idea. But, unless someone can come up with a few trillion dollars, it's just pie-in-the-sky.

       All project planners say that to get started. But, as time goes on the cost keeps going up. Look at the "Big Dig" in Boston or the high-speed rail project in California. They ended up costing billions more than originally planned.

       Who was distracted by it?

      <p>
       I saw one post on Reddit and have not seen it mentioned one other time.

      <p>
       Why do you think it's odd that Elon Musk wants to collaborate with other companies/technologies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this doesn't sound aggressive, it just doesn't make sense in ymy eyes that this is some distraction. If it is, it's doing pretty poorly.

       What do you mean he doesn't want to work on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't gotten that same feeling at all, and I don't think the fact that he wants other companies to work along side means he doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that him wanting other companies to join in, means he def wants to work on it, and see where it can go in the future. Something this big needs many other industries to help to make it a reality.

       Nobody’s Planning to Actually Build It
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a minor detail here, but someone has to step up and build the Hyperloop, which means raising a bunch of money, getting California to okay a big double-barreled tube to be built along I-5 between San Francisco and L.A., and a whole list of other details. Musk may have pitched the Hyperloop concept today, but he has no intent to actually do anything with it right now: during a Tesla earnings call last week, Musk said, “I don’t have any plans to execute, because I must remain focused on SpaceX and Tesla.”

       I agree it is still pretty early, and there may not be any sort of funding at this point. I still don't believe he has no intention of working on it to get something going in the future. He just released all this to the public recently, so I think we still have a lot of time before we can say nothing will come of it.

        I haven't gotten that same feeling at all, and I don't think the fact that he wants other companies to work along side means he doesn't.

       The problem is you were assuming I'm operating on personal opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you replied to my comment at all with "I did not see either of those though, i'm not that big of a TV watcher." after you said "Who was distracted by it? I saw one post on Reddit and have not seen it mentioned one other time." means you shouldn't be in the "I'm a sentinel for everything" game that you seem to want to portray yourself in.

       Your claim of Personal opinions are for other subs is completely wrong though. This sub completely welcomes personal opinions, as said in the description. Being here, you should expect them. I could care less what you think of mine, but that's not going to stop me from sharing it.
      </p>

       It would be dumb to focus primarily on the hyperloop at this point seeing as the idea itself was just announced. It is still int he early stages of even full development. The reason they asked for other companies to chime in on the project is because it is completely unrealistic to go at this with just Elon Musk and no other companies to help with infrastructure/materials.

       That may be, but that doesn't mean no one is going to try. People said the exact same thing when solar panels and wind mills first became a reality. The same thing is said anytime a large life changing technology is invented. Keep that attitude and nothing will happen.
