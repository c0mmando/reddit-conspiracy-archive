        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> </p>

<p>I am usually a lurker so I do not have credibility in this subreddit but please listen to my prediction. As of this posting, Sunday night/Monday morning, I have noticed a quick shift from the left MSM on its reportings on the subject of marijuana. I&#39;ve seen polls here and there, and maybe a couple minutes of debate on the issue once in a while, but never this much in such a small few days. </p>

<p>Here are some links to check out really quick, some courtesy of <a href="/u/jsukracker">/u/jsukracker</a> :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/08/eric-holder-drug-sentencing_n_3727389.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/08/eric-holder-drug-sentencing_n_3727389.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/eric-holder-announce-major-criminal-law-reforms-monday-its-about-time">http://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/eric-holder-announce-major-criminal-law-reforms-monday-its-about-time</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.klubkushmedia.com/eric-holder-says-its-time-to-legalize/">http://www.klubkushmedia.com/eric-holder-says-its-time-to-legalize/</a></p>

<p>and of course <a href="http://www.klubkushmedia.com/eric-holder-says-its-time-to-legalize/">CNN&#39;s</a> article and one hour special by Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Discovery Channel and National Geographic have also had a few marijuana shows in the past. </p>

<p>Here is my point, however. <strong>Marijuana is going to be the next big thing for the next couple days, and possibly weeks.</strong> During CNN&#39;s &quot;Weed&quot; I even saw an ad for tomorrow&#39;s &#39;follow up with Dr. Sanjay Gupta&#39; in the morning, perhaps when Eric Holder makes his announcement? </p>

<p>To quote <a href="/u/jsukrcker">/u/jsukrcker</a>&#39;s post over on <a href="/r/trees">/r/trees</a> again, </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Eric Holder&#39;s plane just landed in San Francisco where he&#39;s meeting with the American Bar Association. He will be giving a big speech Monday at 10:30 am from the Moscone Center. Expect MAJOR policy changes in the war on drugs and marijuana specifically.
I&#39;m not positive but I believe marijuana will be rescheduled to a level 3 drug. I&#39;m very confident that at the least Holder will announce the end to federal government medical marijuana prosecutions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Also for anyone who hasn&#39;t heard yet, Dr Sanjay Gupta apologized for his previous opposition to medical marijuana and will be doing a 1 hour special on it Sunday. He&#39;s now saying he believes cannabis can be a superior medicine to pharmaceuticals in many cases. It&#39;s supposedly going to give medical marijuana significant mainstream credibility nation wide. &quot;&quot;</p>

<p><strong>I think this is conveniently occurring due to the mass outrage caused by the latest revelations of the NSA and other issues of spying, lack of privacy, etc.</strong></p>

<p>Why would this random shift of policies suddenly occur, especially with the DEA and its latest raids on marijuana dispensaries in California (where I happen to live)? I haven&#39;t given this too much thought or research, but I&#39;m definitely quite suspicious that this happening for a reason behind the scenes, whether it be about NSA or something else.</p>

<p>What do you think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
While some are arguing the timing and benefits of decriminalizing medical marijuana, please save it. This post was intended to shed light on the timings of this release on the MSM. The reason why I believe this is because CNN began to air this subject DAYS before Eric Holder&#39;s announcement. </p>

<p>I imagine it went down something like this:</p>

<p>NSA head: President, people aren&#39;t shutting up about this whole scandal, we need your help.</p>

<p>Obama: Yeah I know, the internet is pissed and it looks like it&#39;ll take a while to die down. </p>

<p>NSA head: We need a distraction for these people, mainly college aged kids.</p>

<p>Obama: Well, the debate on marijuana is long overdue, how about that????</p>

<p>Obama then tells the media to run some pro-weed rhetoric, and boom, distraction. </p>

<p>Its a story of a little girl who had seizures and pain her whole life.  Then they get some cannabis oil, and now shes kickin ass.</p>

<p>Heres my take on your query.  I believe cannabis has been demonized for a long time.  Only recently does it fit within their plans to placate the public.  It makes so much sense for legalization, but on the other hand, it still makes sense for them to keep it illegal.</p>

<p>If they do legalize it, I still won&#39;t trust the motherfuckers as far as I could throw them.  It would be like being in a loveless abusive marriage for the majority of your life, only for one day the bitch decides to give you a blow job for the first time in decades.  Fuck you bitch, that ain&#39;t good enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that story was also on CNN&#39;s hour long special. That little girl was the perfect story for the media to pick up- military dad, nice cute white wife. Poor baby doesn&#39;t make any recovery until the use of medical marijuana. It just so happens that the growers interviewed in Colorado are six camera friendly white brothers. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt the story&#39;s authenticity, but I do see right through CNN&#39;s appeal to emotion. </p>

<p>Why? Tobacco is perfectly legal to grow on your own for personal consumption, no requirements about how you process it. Personal cannabis growing is perfectly legal in WA and CO. I don&#39;t see any indication that regulations on homegrown cannabis are in the cards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Growing tobacco generally requires a warm, humid climate and good soil, and it can&#39;t really be grown indoors effectively (as far as I&#39;m aware), so already it&#39;s a more difficult crop to homegrow than cannabis. The process of drying and curing it is also fairly involved. So while people can and do grow tobacco at home, it&#39;s not especially common.</p>

<p>Well no shit, but at least they&#39;ll stay the fuck out of my garden, and the general public will have access to an industry that could certainly generate enough funds to make a Political difference. </p>

<p>Politicians backed by industries is a staple of American Politics. The cannabis industry would be no different. That is the REAL power that legalizing cannabis would grant the American public. </p>

<p>Everything the United States does is centric to protecting &#39;National Security&#39;. A cannabis industry would change the powers that currently have a stranglehold in congress. It&#39;s not a guarantee for anyone, that&#39;s the only reason it&#39;s a threat. Realistically, the corporations that are, will definitely get their hands into this industry and maintain their hold on politics, but there will be room for new corporations to get just as powerful as these old ones (JP Morgan, amongst many other &#39;securities&#39; or &#39;funds&#39;s groups). </p>

<p>There is going to be a very big power-grab if cannabis is ever legalized . Whoever gets the biggest piece of that pie is going to be commanding some real &#39;buy me the lower side of manhattan&#39; money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, mandatory minimum sentences for small time pot busts has always been Illogical and absurd. Second, as a result of mandatory minimum sentences the prisons are getting very over crowded. This is a serious financial burden. Third, the MSM is suspect as always. So this sounds like something that was in the works behind the scenes and is just a matter of politically expedient timing, due to its being announced just after the NSA scandal. Also, it sounds like a lot of talk with no actual substance. Also, this would imply that the Government is a lot more worried about the NSA scandal then they let on.</p>

<p>Greenwald and Snowden have plenty more information to leak and publish, so I&#39;d say that they have the upper hand in the situation.

    <div class="md"><p>I could see the stance change on medical MJ, but not the recreational drug. Drugs being illegal props up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Law enforcement</li>
<li>The CIA</li>
<li>The banks</li>
<li>The gambling industry and Las Vegas</li>
<li>The prison industry</li>
<li>Alcohol and Tobacco sales.</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly, drugs fund the organizations that our government uses as excuses to fund our war and intelligence machine: the Taliban, NK, the cartels, and so on.</p>

<p>There is no way in hell our federal government ever willingly reclassifies MJ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moment colorado and washington legalized, the national decriminalization/legalization was inevitable, regardless of what other factors might be related (ie snowden). </p>

<p>Once tax season rolls around, all the other states will hop on the marijuana boat as it will pull millions or even billions in taxes.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I have however, was listening to C-span this morning on my way to work and there was something said that ive been hearing alot: &quot;people dont trust their government and its at an all time high&quot;. My guess is that the government will appear to get better and allow more freedoms (marijuana being a big reference point). this will sort of be the bell they ring to bring all the sheep back into the fenced in area.</p>

<p>I believe, come 2016 we will have a new era. Poison, sprinkled pretty with galore and a misplaced sense of virtue. the beginning of the end imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First comment: I don&#39;t think random would be the right word for these shifts. If you look at the conversation about marijuana over the past few years considering the documentaries, the people backing it, the obvious facts about it, especially the fact that we&#39;ve been closing in on half the states being legal medicinal states. Once we got close to this tipping point, it&#39;s been a matter of time, and in my opinion, not so random. </p>

<p>Second point: I strongly believe that one of the original reasons for (keeping) weed&#39;s illegality was because of the mind opening effect it had on people in regards to the reality around them. For example, the vietnam war, people started realizing they couldn&#39;t support it, soldiers were smoking in the fields and second-guessing themselves and what they were doing...  &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t want people to smoke, because it pacifies you and helps you forget about anger while gaining a clearer picture. </p>

<p>Changing the pot-laws is going to let more people, get easier access, to better perception-enhancing strains. No matter what the outcome, whether this is a deception tactic or not by the NSA, it could have drastic effects on the futures of those who abuse the spying...</p>

<p>An open-minded, united, global people will not tolerate the spying for long. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Also for anyone who hasn&#39;t heard yet, Dr Sanjay Gupta apologized for his previous opposition to medical marijuana and will be doing a 1 hour special on it Sunday. He&#39;s now saying he believes cannabis can be a superior medicine to pharmaceuticals in many cases. It&#39;s supposedly going to give medical marijuana significant mainstream credibility nation wide. &quot;</p>

<p>I would like someone who follow up on this doctor a bit mroe to link me to his views previously. Im sure a good number of redditors used to think Pot was bad and will be able to see if his changes in opinion are simply a small shift, or a blatant reconstruction. Game recognize game, and if he changes his view after a &quot;long talk&quot; or some other BS like that, we can know hes full of shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i might try and do it myself since no one but you responded.</p>

<p>If what you said truly is the case, and there is no clear showing of his views on marijuana previously; then it will be safe to say he is full of shit but thats just another drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>EDIT::  </p>

<p>Quick search led me to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2387878/Dr-Sanjay-Gupta-Why-I-changed-mind-weed.html">this</a></p>

<p>still nothing solid, but im calling bullshit   </p>

<p>&quot;He says that before he started the project, he was ‘unimpressed’ by the scientific literature on medical marijuana.&quot;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&quot;Dr Gupta says he believes that he had not previously considered all of the arguments and that, now that he has, he has changed him mind on the topic.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Who the fuck reads medical data, is then &quot;unimpressed&quot; but then &quot;considers&quot; an argument or two and suddenly does a full 180? Hes been looking into this stuff for years, according to him. Marijuana may be a complex topic in a political sense, but its not deep. One can cover all the points fairly quickly. for him to suddenly hear an argument hes never heard before and change ALL his views on it? ridicules. </p>

<p>Considering how i read Holder made a statement...all part of the plan. Its time to give america another dose of pills. We just got gay rights, but were an antsy bunch so we get weed. anymore and we get a night stick</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My immediate thought when I saw the Eric Holder article was that they were going to try and make a ton of room to accommodate the tons of prisoners they&#39;re preparing to round up.  Free the old people, low level guys... keep the lower level folks from getting arrested for a while as the DEA (having been in cahoots with NSA) rounds up dealers and suppliers from around the country.  Possibly to pick up the scores of hackers they&#39;re finding.  Probably far more than anyone cares to admit.<br/>
Then the policy change, which is all this amouts to, can just shift back after &quot;reports&quot; of drug related issues of one kind or another surface.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing to keep in mind is the number of states in the last year who have become Medical Marijuana states. A record number. Over half the states now have some sort of medical marijuana laws, and in most states it is also decriminalized. </p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate that our government isn&#39;t going to completely legalize it yet. It should really do away with the corn subsidies and grow hemp. There are so many new industries that could crop up. Not to mention the tax dollars. Significant steps, regardless, I suppose.</p>

<p>That said, <strong>this is a good thing</strong> and we should treat it like a <em>victory</em>. Because it is. Many grassroots organizations and individuals have fought for drug policy reform for many years. So, hooray!</p>

<p>Just keep the NSA thing in your mind. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s going away. Snowden and Greenwald have more up their sleeve.</p>

<p>If I were to guess, I would say more content is released when and after official statements about the leak are made, in order to contradict official word and make the White House look foolish. </p>

<p>Yes, I would agree that is a plausible and likely scenario. The White House looks foolish as it is. Greenwald and Snowden are just going to bury the White House. Should be interesting to watch.</p>
