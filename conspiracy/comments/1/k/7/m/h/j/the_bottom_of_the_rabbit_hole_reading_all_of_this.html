<p>This is a link to a video  <a href="http://youtu.be/rYDxCazAQTU">http://youtu.be/rYDxCazAQTU</a> that I found on a old Reddit post that shows someone in so much fear to answer a question. Like she knew one wrong word would get her brains splattered. Listen very carefully with the questions asked and the answers given. </p>

<p>Here is her evidence. 
<a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam1.html">http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam1.html</a></p>

<p>Then read this speech from September 10,2001 by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld<br/>
<a href="http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430">http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430</a></p>

<p>My opinion about the speech is he was letting us know on what was going to happen for us doing something what he and his associates think was wrong for our own good. Like a parent giving a lecture before a spanking for the kids own good on something the kid had no control over,or something the kid didn&#39;t even do to begin with. </p>

<p>The Pentagon Bureaucracy orchestrated the 9/11 attacks using all their resources to get us to continue to finance and go along with their plan. Look where we are today since then as a Nation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone saying they believe it was directed energy isn&#39;t evidence. REAL evidence of thermite use coupled with diagonally cut steel beams near the base are far more conclusive than one paranoid person&#39;s opinion, a person you attached the personal connotation of &quot;Like she knew one wrong word would get her brains splattered.&quot;. That&#39;s just what you see. Could her idea have some underlying truth about future weapons? Sure. But I don&#39;t think that is what happened on 9/11. I think the &quot;plan&quot; was twofold, and was conspired by the Mossad along with different elements of the military industrial complex for the reasons you&#39;ve stated. The mossad wanted us to do their dirty work because Israel is like an angry chihuahua that has a mean little bark but is too cowardly and pathetic to fight for their own cause, and the Pentagon likes making $$ so they knew war would be profitable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just checked them all out and they&#39;re not evidence. The first one is just a conversation between crackpots where you are believing what the top comment on youtube tells you to believe. The &quot;star wars beam&quot; article (lol star wars) has no actual evidence, just talks a lot about an old defunded military program with no proof of anything.</p>

<p>And even if she&#39;s right, and  they invented this tech in the 80s, why use it in 2001 against 2 buildings that just had planes thrown into them? Just for shits and giggles? </p>

<p>Your theory has no motive or physical evidence. There&#39;s lots of great people out there who can sound like what people want them to. They&#39;re called actors. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t really base 9/11 being done by DEWs because some guy sounded nervous on a phone call.</p>

Use knowledge, because even if they present an ad hominem attack, responding in this manner makes you look like an immature, under educated person with nothing to back up your opinion other than insults. Just stop, dude. You don&#39;t know who is a shill, and you overuse that word and it&#39;s just cringe worthy... Like your other thread about shills. Use knowledge and logical arguments instead of trying to get the last word in. This will not only make people take you seriously, it will also improve the quality of discussion on this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets get real deep and dark people</p>

<p>This is a link to a video  <a href="http://youtu.be/rYDxCazAQTU">http://youtu.be/rYDxCazAQTU</a> that I found on a old Reddit post that shows someone in so much fear to answer a question. Like she knew one wrong word would get her brains splattered. Listen very carefully with the questions asked and the answers given. </p>

<p>Here is her evidence. 
<a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam1.html">http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam1.html</a></p>

<p>Then read this speech from September 10,2001 by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld<br/>
<a href="http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430">http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430</a></p>

<p>My opinion about the speech is he was letting us know on what was going to happen for us doing something what he and his associates think was wrong for our own good. Like a parent giving a lecture before a spanking for the kids own good on something the kid had no control over,or something the kid didn&#39;t even do to begin with. </p>

<p>The Pentagon Bureaucracy orchestrated the 9/11 attacks using all their resources to get us to continue to finance and go along with their plan. Look where we are today since then as a Nation.  </p>

<p>That was the chime video. The one he just  made public can be heard way better. </p>

<p>It seems like some of the things you are saying seems like parables. </p>

<p>Reasons why I believe Dr. Judy Woods. 
1. The building started and stopped the unstoppable pancaking effect proving her anti gravity characteristics. Planes hit, weapon on weapon off. Next building same thing. Last building for the truth to be found that it wasn&#39;t the planes and fire that disintegrated the buildings into dust. 
2. They had to stop it to leave some rubble behind to not look so obvious. 
3. Her emotions in the interview proved to me she&#39;s truthful. </p>
