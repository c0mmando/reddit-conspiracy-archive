      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are clearly a lot of people there that are really made uncomfortable by the idea that some big conspiracy theories (like "9/11 was an inside job") are true, and that a lot of false conspiracy theories are

       If r/conspiratard is about
       <em>

       then people there should have no problem with this. But everything I just linked to strongly indicates that something more is going on there.

       Ideally, yes it would. Human nature, however, doesn't work that way. They have a separate sub for a reason. It is called fragmentation. Or forking, in IT terms. The best we can do is take the lies one at a time. Complaining about the other sub is pointless.

       What I am saying though is that going over to "the other side" for a little bit and engaging in discussion over there might be a good way to change things up for a lot of people that frequent this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually learned a lot about all of the theories I am interested in and the process was really rewarding. Exposing your claims to counter-arguments will help you strengthen them and get closer to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might even find that you and some of the people you talk to will change your minds about some things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protip: don't accuse anyone of being a shill. You don't really know, and substantive engagement will always turn out better.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       and that is precisely what they've been doing ever since. It's never anything new. It's always the same disinfo, logical fallacies, name calling and other trolling tactics.

       Here is my opinion on Alex.  I personally think he agrees that 9/11 was a setup.  However, based on the fact that none of our truthers are actually doing anything (since its more than 10 years later) he is focusing his energy in other arenas.

       He definitely does, he was one of the first to make the claim.

       I'm not sure if we should be so fatalistic about 9/11. I think it is tactically very important. Realizing that it was an inside job may be a tipping point for a lot of people who would otherwise be dismissive of conspiracy theory.

       i genuinely like this post. i think alex jones is a double agent, too. he has discretely incited people to violence in his videos (i can offer a link and explanation if you would like). i also admit that i have responded to hostility i've seen on
