    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In 1986, researchers in the Netherlands, which offers transgender-related health benefits in its universal healthcare plan, calculated the prevalence of male-to-female transsexualism at 1 in 18,000 and female-to-male at 1 in 54,000.[iii] A follow-up study from 1996 cited prevalence at 1 in 11,900 males and 1 in 30,400 females.[iv]&quot;</p>

<p>If we assume roughly 1 in 10,000 males (as above) are transgender and we also assume there have been about 50 whistleblowers in the past 20 years on the scale/importance of Manning &amp; Shayler, then the probability that two of them would be transgender is about 1:82,000 (or 0.001%).</p>

<p>The next time something like this would happen (if it&#39;s just pure coincidence) would be in 1.5 million years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. This is more than I hope the sub would produce as it does seem the chances of manning becoming transgender are low but the impact will divert attention and dent his &quot;poster boy&quot; image.</p>

<p>S/he becomes, in some key quarters, the &quot;freak show&quot; the government desperately wanted manning to become. </p>

<p>Coincidence? Your stats say unlikely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if it&#39;s even more sinister than that? Hormone therapy would be a particularly devastating form of torture for anyone who doesn&#39;t want it (straight or gay). It&#39;s not enough to imprison him, they have to castrate him and remove all control over his body and dignity. And even more disgusting, the liberal masses will cheer for it and demand it&#39;s paid for by the government.</p>

<p>This brings me to doubt whether anything we hear about Manning is true, while he is in a military prison, hated as a traitor, and could be legitimately threatened with assassination at any time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good calculations but those numbers don&#39;t account for those with untreated transsexualism. From 1986, since people have been finding out that it was possible to get treated, the numbers have increased.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a 2001 investigative report on the prevalence of transsexualism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if we assume the frequency of transsexualism in that paper 1:1000 (TG transitioners (w/o SRS)) - which is far higher than what the psychiatric community estimates -, then the probability is 1:856.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spooks have a limited bag of tricks.</p>

<p>Shayler revealed that Tony Blair was MI5, then shortly afterward announced he was really a woman, which discredited his information in many people&#39;s eyes -- and how many is the question that is difficult to gauge in the public arena, thus neutralizing critical mass for public mobilization surrounding his information.</p>

<p>Manning has now rendered the iconic value of his own martyrdom to be adulterated with his own apology before the court &amp; his apparently genuine confusion about himself.</p>

<p>In both cases, men who may have been surveilled and known by the Intelligence Community to possess (what appears to significant numbers of the public to be) identity confusion became the vessels for a cause that they may have actually <em>set backwards</em> in practical terms.</p>

<p>In Congress, they call it &quot;adding a poison pill&quot; to legislation to kill it.</p>

<p>You and I may know that Shayler&#39;s info was probably truthful, but it will never gain traction with such an uncertain messenger.</p>
