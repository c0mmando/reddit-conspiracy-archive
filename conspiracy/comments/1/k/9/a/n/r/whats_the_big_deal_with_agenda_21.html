    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/corbett-report-radio-241-un-agenda-21-exposed-with-rosa-koire/">Corbett Report</a> is a great place to start to examine not only the ideology behind this document, but its advocates in government. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.postsustainabilityinstitute.org/what-is-un-agenda-21.html">Post Sustainability Institute</a> attempts to uncover the eugenically focused, malthusian madness of the power elite&#39;s reorganization of land ownership and use around the world. the central theme of redistributing people into urban centers, while opening up previously populated areas for their resources is more likely the outcome of a successful implementation of such policies, than is a healthier world for more people, the utopian sucker candy accompanying the rather banal sounding &quot;voluntary&quot; legislation. Voluntary in that nearly all of the participating nations at the rio summit voluntarily adopted the program and have voluntarily spent taxpayer funds, as well as private money administering them. Even locally, Agenda 21&#39;s language has already seeped into the statements emerging from urban development councils across the land, and fills the current texts of UD students. This, under the pretense of helping the student find a viable career within the &#39;cutting edge revolution spreading throughout the discipline.&#39;</p>

<p>a better, healthier world, through central government...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another interview with <a href="http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/radio/program.php?id=624">Koire</a>. And here&#39;s an interview with <a href="http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/radio/program.php?id=602">Eric Karlstrom</a>, whose research also contributes to an examination of the politicians as much as the politics.</p>

<p>there is no reason that a provably criminal class of power elite and their corporate profiteering nexus should be able to so blithely use Ideal statements and junk science to dramatically reorganize human development according to their elitist, eugenic insanity without a truly open, intelligent, and critical examination of not only these policies suggested, but of their authors, and their corruption-riddled implementers. </p>

<p>more central government is just not the answer to the ills created by the centralizing, corrupt, fascist authority of banking and industrial cartels, who are ultimately responsible for the creation of this document.</p>

<p>I pulled up the text of agenda 21 and couldn&#39;t find any support for their claim that it advocates impoverishing Americans.</p>

<p>is exactly what is described by &quot;environmental corridors&quot; and other proposed land use ethics in the document. </p>

<p>perhaps you seem to think you are debunking critics by claiming there is no obvious line in the document which says &quot;we will take your stuff, tough titties&quot;. well, you must be completely right then. the power elite really must just want a healthier, greener world for you.</p>

<p>read the document, between the lines, and read into its authors, and listen to the arguments made by them, and their supporters, and compare it to critics. you aren&#39;t going to ever win the argument that the document is benign when real researchers are able to look into the histories, actions, and policy projections of the power elite behind it and find more than enough to be skeptical of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>again, incorrect, and evidence of your inability to research. </p>

<p>evolution of transport, shipping, and communication form lynchpins in the plans globalists get together at private meetings like bilderberg to discuss. This is evidenced in the transnational projects and international partnerships and mergers that emerge after these summer meetings each year.</p>

<p>globalism is not some organic thing happening because the technology is here. what kind of bullshit is that? you have it all backwards. global policy development is developed by globalists, in private, often using public security money, and you are not invited to offer your opinion on it, even if it is one of support.</p>

<p>Sure it is. Individuals seeking opportunities travel to other countries, move there, go to school there, set up businesses there, etc. No one directed millions of immigrants from Asia and India to move to the USA and start families here. No one directed Apple to sell iPhones in Asia and Europe. Those were all decisions that people made because it made sense at the time, and the technology had evolved to the point where it was feasible.</p>

<p>not going to waste time with someone who is decidedly not actually interested in enlightening themselves, and is perhaps actively trying to misinform others.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong about you, and you really are just that inexperienced with this stuff, I really recommend spending some time at <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/">Corbett Report</a>, <a href="http://www.tragedyandhope.com/">Tragedy and Hope Network</a> and <a href="http://globalresearch.ca/">Globalresearch.ca</a></p>

<p>if you are a real person, you will be more informed for doing so, even if you disagree with everything you find there. at least you will actually understand what valid criticism is, and how it is different from what you&#39;ve done here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in honor of the time you took to put this garbage &quot;analysis&quot; out there, I will help unpack your comment:</p>

<p>you claim that web sites, specifically &quot;the same ones I sent you&quot;, are &quot;all lying&quot;.</p>

<p>I have asked you <strong>to prove that</strong> corbett report, tragedy and hope network, washingtons blog, dark government and whowhatwhy have lied about the claims they report. <strong>prove it.</strong></p>

<p>Next, you presume to tell people that nothing in the document is &quot;that bad.&quot; That is firstly an opinion, and is not a statement of fact. Your inability to see how it could be bad, or carry at least conflict of interest to cede American, or any other country&#39;s land use and development &quot;voluntarily&quot; to guidelines written by a nexus of power, financial and industrial elite in europe, based on a flowery document they&#39;ve produced is ridiculous, brainless, unreasonable, and demonstrates that for you, it is enough to be given a piece of paper written and supported by a provably criminal class of power brokers, proven liars and deceivers. </p>

<p>In this argument, for you, the paper is enough, and the people are irrelevant, off point, and not to be investigated. this is unreasonable, unsound geopolitical opinion, and is precisely how power elite manipulates people like you.</p>

<p>please stop trying to deceive your brothers and sisters, you mook. spend some time with corbett report and others, and learn from real journalists, or debunk them and prove they are all liars, as you blithely claim without evidence. </p>

<p>either way, this is not an argument I am willing to participate in anymore. </p>

<p>i am sure you will take the opportunity to attempt to pillory me, or come up with a clever line to give you an apparent upper hand. but i&#39;ve pretty plainly shown that you have no idea what you are talking about, and are supporting unreasonable, brainless, condescending bullshit without critical analysis. so, have at it, captain. the floor is yours. </p>

<p>I searched the Corbett report for articles about Agenda 21 and all I found was a video with two people arguing about it. What am I supposed to do with that?  You want me to watch a video about a document that you yourself have not even read?</p>

<p>And what is this obsession you have with attacking the authors of Agenda 21? How do you even know who wrote it? It&#39;s starting to sound like you just have a problem with environmentalism in general.</p>

<p>&quot;what is this obsession&quot; statements when there isn&#39;t actually obsessing are used to attempt to discredit another debater&#39;s character, by making them seem irrational. what is irrational is your refusal to acknowledge the corrupt power elite who have created and champion this document. you believe looking at the document is proof enough of what the power elite will do. This is neither skepticism nor reasonable.</p>

<p>is completely out of the blue, without evidence, and factually incorrect. ceding planning and land use authority to an international body of power, financial, and industrial elitists has nothing to do with environmentalism. you are just trying to attack me with statements like that. </p>

<p>what we have here, is how power elite assert, over time, steps towards greater control over resources, their development, and the behaviors, economic activity and freedoms asserted by the lower classes, while couching these steps in the language of social justice, such as environmentalism concepts, so that uncritical people such as yourself can fall for it and feel self righteous at the same time. </p>

<p>Agenda 21 does nothing of the sort. It is merely a set of principles that countries can choose to follow if 
they want to.</p>

<p>Furthermore, countries that adopt Agenda 21 can choose for themselves how to implement it. Agenda 21 does not specify policies that countries must adopt (which makes sense, since different countries have to address different circumstances). It  speaks in very broad, general terms about things like empowering women and protecting the rights of indigenous people. It doesn&#39;t say exactly how countries should do that, it just says it&#39;s a good thing if they do.</p>

<p>If you disagree, cite the part of Agenda 21 that says otherwise. Tell me where it implies that countries have to  cede their sovereignty to some international organization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually, we&#39;ve already been over the fact that the agenda is voluntary, meaning that nearly every nation gathered at rio had its power elite agree to voluntarily apply the principles, which is happening. in effect, authority is voluntarily ceded to new advisory councils whose policy is top-down distributed by UN agenda 21 advocates in Europe. it amounts to the same thing, because the participating elite in each country are part of the same elite class, and wouldn&#39;t need to be forced. making any argument to the contrary is either deceptive, or ignorant of reality.</p>

<p>further, there is no way power elite would have been able to implement a forced reorganization. but, since it is the elite of each country volunteering their country&#39;s public and private development funds, a forced policy isn&#39;t necessary. the argument that agenda 21 is innocuous or &quot;doesn&#39;t have teeth&quot; and is therefore NOT involved with elite development plans is fallacious, boringly common among shills, and only effective on people who have not yet done the research to see how the power class works. </p>

<p>your strongest arguments are that the document is voluntary, not forced, seemingly making it appear more innocent, casual, and well-advised. your comments stand to demonstrate the outright refusal to acknowledge facts. you keep trying to hide a proven historical corruption of an elite power class that created this document and its &quot;voluntary&quot; policies within the language of the document, itself. </p>

Private land ownership is also a principal instrument of accumulation and concentration of wealth, therefore contributes to social injustice.&quot; now, i repeat: THIS QUOTE IS NOT FROM AGENDA 21. HOWEVER, i feel that this quote IS RELEVANT because it is FROM THE U.N. during a conference discussing SUSTAINABILITY. which is the SAME THING that agenda 21 discusses: SUSTAINABILITY. i do not BELIEVE that the U.N. simply FORGOT about this idea that &quot;Land... cannot be treated as an ordinary asset... &quot;. i do BELIEVE that agenda 21, (WHICH I HAVE ALREADY STATED, so please do not beg this question) FROM WHAT I HAVE READ of this long document, is HARMLESS BY ITSELF. BUT when taken into CONJUNCTION with the U.N.&#39;s prior ideas, it is not a stretch to give credence to the POSSIBILITY that convincing people to live more sustainably is a WARM-UP to convincing people to give up land. i am NOT stating that this idea is A FACT. it is a POSSIBILITY. also, in regard to your comment in the other thread we were conversing in, i am not OBSESSING over who wrote agenda 21. i am merely quoting the same organization that you SEEM to find so trustworthy. and yes, you have been using faulty logic in this thread. before you say that you haven&#39;t, look up what a straw man argument is, and look up what begging the question is.</p>

<p>That&#39;s silly reasoning. Agenda 21 clearly states that it seeks solutions that are compatible with existing economic structures. So on its own terms it&#39;s rejecting the notion that we need to overturn fundamental principles like private ownership of property.</p>

<p>No I&#39;m not. There is nothing in Agenda 21 that defines sustainability as &quot;something someone said in 1976.&quot; There&#39;s no reason to think that&#39;s what they mean, nor is there anything compelling countries that adopt Agenda 21 to use that definition.</p>

<p>For that matter, a number of countries have signed on to Agenda 21, and none of them have abolished private property. So actual observable reality flatly contradicts your claims.</p>

<p>In fact, if anything that video undercuts your claim that &quot;a young, impressionable activist knocking on my door for a signature on a petition to the government to build more windmills to generate electricity&quot; is not planning to abolish private property, since that video was made by an <a href="http://www.forumforthefuture.org/about">&quot;independent non-profit&quot;</a>, not the UN or any UN-affiliated institution.</p>

<p>Nonsense. If rich PEOPLE can buy and own property  then private property has not been abolished. Quite the opposite in fact.</p>
