    <div class="md"><p>Disinfo bullshit. The recording industry is just an oligopoly controlled by Sony, Warner, and Universal. The &#39;mind control&#39; isn&#39;t a result of harmonics, it&#39;s the content that tells kids to feel certain ways about stuff.</p>

<p>Artists like Macklemore &amp; Lady Gaga have songs that install ideas about gay rights, so kids talk about gay rights. The industry controls what topics become relevant in pop culture, and that dictates trends and idealisms that the public latches on to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, sure, but i like to look at things from the perspective that we dont know everything. Because we don&#39;t, so why not keep an open mind and question  and consider? I think it is very likely that sound has many unseen effects on us and the world around us, that we&#39;re yet to understand. </p>

<p>To go even farther with this i think anything that generates energy has an effect on its surroundings, and as it changes its energy thus it changes that effect. Like for instance humans and emotions. Now we have no reason to see every way in which this happens as we rely on things we have to be aware of in order to survive. Yet we see the effects of emotion even on an infant who has yet to learn to speak, and emotions/tones are easy to pick up on, regardless of speaking the language. Now that we&#39;re out of the fight or flight part we can start to choose what we become, and what we&#39;re aware of. </p>

<p>For now we thankfully have science to infinitely question and consider, thus we have a great range of things we have proven, yet can never see with our own eye or truly experience ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>New Age bullshit. Read up on the Dr who came up with this shit. He&#39;s attributed to all kinds of bullshit from SARS to AIDS, to anti-vaccination paranoia. The guy makes cash off spreading pandemic bullshit to &#39;open minded&#39; new age dumbasses.</p>

<p>The stuff that I was talking about doesn&#39;t use Nazi technology. It just uses simple propaganda.</p>

<p>Practice some critical thought here man.</p>

<p>Which makes more sense. A conspiracy that uses magnetic or frequency resonance to do what exactly...?</p>

<p>Or, the fact that the media has influence on the topics that people think about, talk about, act on?</p>

<p>Come on man, this is the kind of bullshit that ruins this subs credibility.</p>

<p>Go on Google, type in &#39;influence of music on society&#39; and start reading.</p>

<p>An easy example is the influence of music on hippies during the 60&#39;s and how that created the anti-war movement that shut down the military in Vietnam.</p>

<p>In the 70&#39;s, the role of Disco on youth increased a lot early inspiration for the gay rights movement.</p>

<p>In the 80&#39;s, you had Heavy Metal and Satanism. You also had punk rock which is by far, one of the most politically inspired forms of music made. You also had the rise of hip hop which originally was very socially conscious and politically active. That was replaced by gangster rap which is laced with horribly negative idealisms and attitudes.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/cYaD7v-0N-8">Here&#39;s a quick video.</a> This one talks about how hip hop affects kids. </p>

<p>I can go on and on about this topic because there is a mountain of evidence that shows how exactly the media influences EVERYONE. Where&#39;s your proof on your Nazi Frequency theory? You have none, so how about we talk about conspiracies that we know are real?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>umm... again... not so caught up in the specifics of this as much as the theory of sound being the base of all matter beyond the quantum level. Also the idea that sound can have subtle effects yet to be understood on matter. I&#39;m not someone who is assured of the tech and its use and thinks its being used now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.. whats with all the emotion? Just talking about something in r/conspiracy so we should all start from a point of disbelief.</p>

<p>Yet even though you cant hear a difference, the point they&#39;re making is there could be a difference in how it physically effects things. It is also assuming the theory that all matter is basically sound at a very slow vibration.</p>

<p>One example is listening to a group live and unplugged, or pushed through some massive speakers. You can literally feel a difference. I think that&#39;s because one is natural and resounds with us better, while the other is cut off at places we cant hear but can still feel.</p>

<p>Music and sound have a LOT more going on then just what we hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, i just get touchy when I think someone might be reposting disinformation.  Ive been a musician for 8 years and consider myself fairly versed in psychology, having studied it for two years at a university of california.  Youre correct of course about larger speakers resonating more and producing subsonic and ultrasonic frequencies, an example is about 12 hz (humans hear 20hz-20kHz) we get the &#39;brown note&#39; that causes nausea, etc.  I just dont think &#39;nazis&#39; have anything to do with it, or that concert A tuning being 440 Hz is a &#39;conspiracy&#39;, or that 432 Hz &quot;resonates better with us&quot;.  Thats just silly, and I know a lot about acoustics and specifically even psychoacoustics.   Can you show me one site that has some real evidence to back this claim up?</p>
