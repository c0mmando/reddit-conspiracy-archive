        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The title pretty much says it all.  He believes there is a second star named Nibiru headed this way, dragging along with it 7 planetoid objects.  He believes that when it arrives here, the EMF interference from having a second star so close by will cause our planet&#39;s magnetic field to collapse.  He also believes the government is using chemtrails to hide the appearance of this star at the sunset and sunrise periods, because that&#39;s the only time period it&#39;s visible, and only on certain days.  He gets his data from solar spot activity, the occurance of larger geo-frictional activity, and based upon the testimony of a woman named Patty Brissard.</p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t the sort of thing this subreddit is used to, but could ya&#39;ll help me out and try to bring some sense into him?  I don&#39;t know if this is some sort of a mild stroke or a early-onset mid-life crisis he&#39;s having, but it has everyone in my family worried.</p>

<p>What, if any, contravening evidence is there to this claim?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our solar system is undergoing massive change currently on a very fast time scale. Jupiter has lost a 300million year old storm and it&#39;s largest stripe. Neptune&#39;s and Saturn&#39;s orbit/axis has changed dramatically. uranus has auroras now (never seen before). Mars and the moon are seeing huge amounts of geothermic activity. Earths magnetic pole is migrating to russia and we&#39;re seeing unusual weather extremes. 
If anybody is interested I will provide sources later (am at work). </p>

<p>Our solar system is changing rapidly. SOMETHING is going on. I too have been seeing a lot of these second sun pictures and indeed seeing a lot of them being taken down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In theory, the gravitational effects would wreck havoc on planetary orbits (and possibly the planets themselves) long before its EM emissions caused any noticeable problems here on earth. Also, even a &quot;dark&quot; (low albedo) object would be easily noticeable because it would block the light from other celestial objects as it passed.<br/>
Hope this helps! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To give you an idea of why this is tarded....  pretty much anything the size of a star system that comes within our sun, reflects its light... in short... we can see it... the closer and larger it is... the more sunlight it reflects... the brighter it appears.... You can get an idea for what objects are in the sky and a size/distance ratio from brightness....</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude#Table_of_notable_celestial_objects">Now heres the list of brightest things in the sky.</a></p>

<p>Now an approaching STAR SYSTEM, would have a giant ball of light emitting gas coming our way.... in short, we would see it like we see other stars...The brightest STAR in the NIGHT sky is Sirius... It is roughly twice as massive as our sun... its about 8.6 light years away...</p>

<p>The second brightest star, is about 10 times the mass of our Sun, and about 100 light years away. It&#39;s called Canopus. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not the closest star to us, thats just the brightest.... The closest stars to us is Rigel Kent binary system (known as Alpha Centauri). Both stars are roughly the mass of our sun, and about 4 light years away.</p>

<p>All four stars above, have been written about in literature since the dawn of recorded history. In short, star systems don&#39;t just SNEAK UP on you. So I&#39;d say the best way to tell your brother why he&#39;s &#39;tarded is to bring up the fact that star systems anywhere near us have been written about for 4000 years.... and don&#39;t appear from a talk show host in 1995. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people believe this. There really is something weird going on. My friend took a picture of the sunset and we saw the second sun 0.o. Theres other pictures too from oter people. It may not be close enough to do anything. It&#39;s a pretty sound theory that our solar system has a second sun at the edge and it comes around every thousands of years. Who knows though. I watched that interview and she seems definitely military, but not all there in the head. </p>

<p>I hope your brother realizes its just not a big deal. This theory is most likely false, but even if its real..well we will die so fast it won&#39;t even matter. There&#39;s nothing that can be done. I hope he will be okay .</p>

<p>My friend took it, so its not doctored. Its definitely not a lens flare either 0.o. Her picture matches others online too. Not the stupid obviously fake ones where its like this giant sun in the sky hah. But the other videos and pictures I&#39;ve seen from other people also have that small almost..moon-like color to the left. </p>

<p>Now the whole Nibiru thing to me is retarded. A solar system coming to ours with aliens that have made us to be gold slaves in the past :P. I don&#39;t know about that. But what is possible in my mind, is that theory some scientists have talked about. That second sun at the edge of our solar system that comes around every thousands of years. We know that Earth does have a systemic extinction every thousands of years, so that&#39;s one theory they have for that reason. When the sun makes its way around, it messes with the asteroid belt and throws a bunch of junk at us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that it may be just far away enough to do nothing to us. Or we may miss any incoming asteroids that the sun threw around. or..maybe we will all just die :P. Either way, there seems to really be something in the sky that was not there before 0.o.</p>

<p>If anyone has a thermographic/ infrared telescope for some reason, you should try to find it! Apparently that&#39;s really the only way to see it, unless you&#39;re lucky and catch it at the right time, since it&#39;s a...brown or red dwarf supposedly? So its low luminosity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very curious to see if anything happens with this.</p>
