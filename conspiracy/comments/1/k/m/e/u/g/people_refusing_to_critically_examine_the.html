        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After some rather hilarious and pathetic exchanges on a CMV and a mind blowing &quot;Best Of&quot; post on Reddit yesterday around 9/11 I am absolutely shocked at how many people simply refuse to critically examine the, at this point overwhelming, body of evidence that calls into question the official account of the evens of September 11, 2001.  Will this ever change?  What can be done?  In this day and age there is very little excuse for anyone to take the official version seriously anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Will this ever change ? Probably not. Why ? Because the Government is a religion to a lot of people. Religions are never questioned. So, if the Government is revered the way a religion is, then questioning the Government is sacrilege, no matter how absurd the official story is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, this. the best way to approach and analyze statism is to frame it as a religion - that really is what it is. you have to understand that the loyalty and trust that &quot;normal&quot; people feel for the government is the same kind of loyalty and trust that people feel for their god and religious hierarchy in their respective religions. it is a deep-seated feeling that defines them down to the core of who they are and how they interact with the world around them at a base level, just like religion is for religious people.</p>

<p>this took me a long time, personally, to wrap my head around, because from our point of view it is just so outlandish. the thing is, even if there was <em>even more obvious proof</em> that 9/11 was bogus, people <em>still would not believe</em>. why do you think catholicism is still going strong even after it has been revealed that the organization is little more than a paedophilia pyramid scheme? to religious people, the &quot;truth&quot; does not matter, and never will - only the feelings that define them matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you post evidence they insult you.  If you have a legitimate counterpoint they ignore it.  You can&#39;t keep them on issue very long.  Some in the 9/11 Truth movement feel it&#39;s good to have them try to debunk you because it&#39;ll lead them to research it, and it&#39;s hard not to come away empty-handed when seeking the official story. So it&#39;s good to keep these arguments going, even if they call you retarded.  If people call Galileo retarded it doesn&#39;t change the fact earth is heliocentric after all.   </p>

<p>I think we need humor on our side.  We&#39;re all an intense bunch of folks.  We need to show people it&#39;s okay to laugh at the official claims.  Because when people laugh they use a different part of their brain from when they think they&#39;re fighting.  We can all agree some parts of the official story are hilarious.  The passport that survived the magic fire.  The quickly revealed and never-explained hijacker listings.  The intense resistance to investigation.  It&#39;s all laughable.  We just have to show people it&#39;s okay to.  </p>

<p>That is why this is one of the best 9/11 videos:

    <div class="md"><p>Up until about a year ago, I was one of the people who believed all those &quot;911 truthers&quot; were on the same level as the people looking for Obama&#39;s birth certificate. Conspiracy nuts with too much free time and too little critical thinking skill.</p>

<p>The hardest thing for me to overcome was the knowledge that the country I&#39;ve loved all my life is actually capable of that level of evil. I still struggle with it. </p>

<p>My tipping point for knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that 911 was a false flag was when I finally realized what happened to JFK. Once you come to terms with the fact that the people who killed JFK are still running the show, well anything is possible.</p>

<p>To answer your question, I honestly don&#39;t know. Accepting the truth is very painful. Some people want the blue pill, and I&#39;m fine with that.</p>

<p>Of course it is. The US faked a terror attack in Vietnam on their own ship and over 60,000 American soldiers died in the subsequent war. Those soldiers were American citizens. The Iraq war was also a massive lie and over 4000 American soldiers have dies there and they were American citizens.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve injected people with diseases, done sick experiments on people like guinea pigs, overthrow elected governments and massacred people and that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>What you need to realise is that people have a psychopathic, elitist mentality and you are literally nothing but a tax contributor to their criminal empire and you&#39;re basically worthless. That&#39;s honestly a real way in how people think of you and it&#39;s shown by their utter disdain for human life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you convince a &quot;9/11 denial&quot; person that the JFK assassination was done by more than one shooter?</p>

<p>Because, I&#39;ve spoken to individuals who argue that the JFK assassination wasn&#39;t a conspiracy.</p>

<p>If there was more than one shooter, it was a conspiracy.</p>

<p>The president was shot from multiple, different angles. Then his head was almost blown off from a frontal blast. </p>

<p>After watching the video of JFK being shot, How the fuck could any logical, rational thinking person ever come to the conclusion that Oswald shot him from the book depository? </p>

<p>How could any person with a working brain think JFK was killed anywhere other than the frontal blast? The physics is impossible otherwise. His head literally jolts back off his neck. There&#39;s no fucking way the shot came from behind him.</p>

<p>Edit: excuse my language, but seriously. How could you ever think otherwise? Your brain is fucked if you can&#39;t come to terms with the fact that the JFK shooting involved 2 people and is therefore, by definition, a conspiracy.</p>

However, to openly admit it to themselves or another, then leads to the conclusions we have dealt with all these years.

<p>People owe themselves, their children and their grandchildren the examination of the official version of events that day. they should form a few simple questions that can&#39;t help but come from an interested party.</p>

<p>.. have lent so much credibility and validity to the 9/11 Truth movement that it&#39;s become more and more difficult to ignore. </p>

<p>It&#39;s becoming harder and harder for the shills and parrots to find support or sympathetic ears when so many professionals are arrayed together for the sole purpose of not proving that it was an &quot;inside job&quot; but simply taking a position of <em>&quot;Tell us something that rings true&quot;</em> about the buildings&#39; collapse.  Not to mention the mountain of odd <a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2004/08/coincidence-theorists-guide-to-911.html">&quot;coincidences&quot;</a> that collectively, necessarily, and unbelievably had to happen to facilitate the events of 9/11.</p>

<p>In aggregate, the available evidence (or official lack thereof), legions of experts, and the glaring problems with the 9/11 Commission itself,  makes anyone waving the the 9/11 Commission report as gospel look like a gullible tool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL...the guy who got the gold was some knob who just parroted back the NIST report...did you even read it??  That whole post is one giant testament to how desperate some people are to cling to the official story no matter how ridiculous it&#39;s shown to be or how much evidence there is that calls it into question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanna say that I&#39;m really impressed with all the candor and honesty in the responses to this post.  When I posted it I wasn&#39;t sure what the reaction was going to be-- even in this sub you never know when the brain-dead brigade from conspiritard is going to show up to fling poo everywhere or downvote everything to hell. This is one of the most important issues out there right now and anything we can do to get more people aware, the better...</p>
