       I think there's an international child trafficking system that gets a lot of exposure from time to time but very little analysis. Or at least, not the level of analysis you'd expect from a political class that is constantly talking about the evils of violence and sexuality being placed upon our children.

       You all know the saying, psychopaths (or is it sociopaths) share similar characteristics to ruthless corporate types. These people rise to these positions and use their power to fulfill their illegal and immoral desires. It's different for each. Alcohol, drugs, extensive wealth, or pedophilia are all sated by those who reach the top. Point is, the people who become the most successful, are also more prone to showing these tendencies as they have the natural predisposition for them. The reason why we see so many higher ups practicing corrupt practices and having these sick urges is because typically only the sociopaths are okay with stepping on so many people to reach their positions of power. Normal moral people do not have the heartless tendencies to rise to power like that.

       Clinical usage in psychology is kind of fucked up anyways. We're all a lil bit crazy. For instance, being an avid collector and being a hoarder are a stones throw from each other. What really matters in the end is detriment to self or society.

       Fair enough.  I just take issue with people who seem to think "psychopaths" are just these mindless lunatics acting on their every random whim.  Its an idea thats based more on television than on reality.

       Watch 'Conspiracy of Silence' on youtube and you'll be in no doubt whatsoever that there are a ton of pedos in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that (as OP pointed out) there are over five thousand Pentagon workers looking at child porn, and that they have not been investigated is clearly a huge red flag here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that OP is spot on with this. I don't know why I didn't think of it. But if you give pedos access to all this information, what do you think they are going to do with it?

       Also, they will start using all this collected information to "protect children" (a.k.a. take the kids away from their parents on trumped up charges) and put them into foster care. Once these kids are in the system, anything can happen.

       One statement is true, the other is not. The government is not "filled with pedophiles," but a pedophile would certainly gain from being in a position of power.

       I think you can safely assume that there are pedophiles in positions of power, but you cannot assume people in power are pedophiles.

       I don't think the main focus of the government is to groom a nation of willing perverted underage sex slaves.  That's way too alarmist.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOWEVER, that is the problem with surveillance systems like this - they aggregate
       <strong>
        too much power
       </strong>
       in a system
       <strong>
        too ripe for manipulation.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's examine Snowden for a moment.  This man made a decision about the amount of power being amassed, then used that very system to gather intelligence and protect his own life.  That's what he decided to do with his access, and the system was a key tool in his ability to make the moves he did and in getting away with it thus far.  He showed how vulnerable the system is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so out of 100,000 IT guys - how many are stunted nerdsexuals who read Tentacle Porn Manga, and play Skyrim as a badass sorceress named Fafnir or Freya the Busty?  20%?  50%?  And how many of these have been previously abused?  How many raped?  How many human beings with less than perfect self-esteem and some serious sexual hang-ups are there out in the world?  Certainly enough to guarantee more than a couple at the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now say, I'm a sysadmin working on a top secret government project: it's compartmentalized, so I don't really know the whole picture, but my brain isn't, so I start looking at the larger system, and decide to increase my personal access to "the Feed."  And because it's my job to build systems and network them - I figure out how to gain unrestricted access to the entire Internet - because that's what we're talking about here with the NSA, Total Info Awareness, like dipping into the stream in real-time and pulling out whatever I want.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like jerking off with a Pensieve.  High school cheerleaders' laptops cameras sitting on the bed at home?  Check.  Scarlett Johansson's first naked selfie?  Check.   The snuff film collection on Cheney's iPhone?  Check.    All my ex-girlfriends' email, photos, Instagram, Gmail, and live cell phone camera to see which ones are ripe for a rebound (or just to jerk it)?  CHEEEEEEE-ECK.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I personally would be above such petty temptations to spy on people, and only use my superpowers for good plus the occasional harmless wank to Olivia Wilde's laptop feed.  But it's a pretty serious amount of trust and temptation to put on people who are used to and good at secrecy - a few of whom likely have real life practice because of various sexual hang-ups, fantasies and darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if we continue to turn a blind eye, as in the case with the Pentagon CP problems, we encourage conspiracy and continued troubles with this type of dangerous behavior and the exploitation of children by persons in positions of rarefied power.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr:  Only a few people in the government want to cannibalize your children, but the system is the trouble because it encourages grave trespass.
