        System Planning Corporation's Command Transmitter Systems (CTS) provide remote control and flight termination functions through a fully-redundant self-contained solid-state system.

        ... The CTS is a tunable UHF FM transmitter designed for ground use in controlling guided missiles, pilotless aircraft and pilotless boats.

       Edit:
       <strong>
        CORRECTION.
       </strong>
       As kahirsch point out in comments, the 2.3 trillion was not "announced" on Sept 10, nor "missing" in the sense I implied in the title. The unbalanced accounting entries seem to be due to procedural inefficiencies, and appear to have been handed-over from the Clinton era.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        January 7, 2001
       </p>
       <p>
        The Defense Department's inspector general recently identified $6.9 trillion in accounting entries, but $2.3 trillion was not supported by adequate audit trails or sufficient evidence to determine its validity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another $2 trillion worth of entries were not examined because of time constraints, and therefore, the inspector general was able to audit only $2.6 trillion of accounting entries in a $6.9 trillion pot.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contra Costa Times (California)

       Is there corruption and wastage? Yes, obviously. But while the Pentagon's own auditors admit they can't/couldn't account for 25% of what they spend (
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/01/29/eveningnews/main325985.shtml">
        source
       </a>
       ), 25% of Pentagon expenditure, even over the entire 1990's, is still far less than 2.3 trillion. In 2000 the official DoD budget was
       <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Defense_Spending_Trends.png">
        approx 300 billion
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, it appears this is something that the "debunkers" are actually right about. Sorry, guys. I'll leave this post here because the other details about Zakheim are interesting, and I think the correction is worthy of attention.

       That's the idea of Modern Monetary Theorists, an increasingly prominent field of economics. These theorists have little to no policy-making power however, because as any good conspiracy theorist knows, the powers that people rely on controlling the currency to maintain their control. We're essentially slave labor in the "free" market.

        Is there corruption and wastage? Yes, obviously. But while the Pentagon's own auditors admit they can't/couldn't account for 25% of what they spend (source), 25% of Pentagon expenditure, even over the entire 1990's, is still far less than 2.3 trillion. In 2000 the official DoD budget was approx 300 billion.

        In short, it appears this is something that the "debunkers" are actually right about. Sorry, guys. I'll leave this post here because the other details about Zakheim are interesting, and I think the correction is worthy of attention.

       No, the "debunkers" are not right. The
       <strong>
        government
       </strong>
       announced that $2.3 trillion was not properly accounted for. That's a hell of a lot of money, whether the discrepancy accrued over a short period or over decades. Even if it was only a matter of delays in reconciling accounts, that's utterly unacceptable. How can Congress and ultimately the people exercise oversight over the Pentagon without timely and accurate information? And realize that claims of inefficiency or incompetence can be used to cover up corruption.

       could also be related to unauthorised cost overruns of govt/contractor projects too.

       but of anybody has read up on Chip Tatum and the CIA's drug running in the 70s and 80s, theres the little matter of the missing 50 C130 Hercules aircraft, sold off and/or given to the Forestry agency, and passed on to contractor companies related to the CIA's drug program in the 80s. All the little frauds and scams add up over the years.

       Govt is a massive money handling machine, lots of people and lots of potential for fraud and misuses and incompetence too..

       Yup. Serious issues with Pentagon finances have been an ongoing concern for decades. The announcements about $2.3 trillion did come out nowhere, but they are notable events in the public's struggle to see accountability and restraint in government spending.

        TIL Dov Zakheim was the Pentagon's money manager when 2.3 trillion went missing;
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The "2.3 trillion dollars" figure comes from
       <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports/fy00/00-179.pdf">
        an audit
       </a>
       done in the year 2000 of the DOD's accounting for fiscal year 1999. This was before Dov Zakheim was at the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that figure refers to transactions that are not supported by "adequate research and reconciliation", not "missing money". There could be missing money, but certainly nowhere near $2.3 trillion, since that is over 7 times the Defense Department budget for that year.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, if you read the report, at least $1.4 trillion of the $2.3 trillion is completely innocent. It is an inefficiency in how the accounting is done, but it doesn't reflect any inaccuracy.

       The inefficiency was that, every month, accountants had to manually enter financial data, then manually delete it, because the automatic data feed wasn't ready in time for a required report.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, every month the accounts might have entered $59 billion dollars worth of transactions, then entered $59 billion dollars worth of rollbacks. If you add that all together, you get $118 billion dollars worth of transactions each month, or $1.4 trillion each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the inefficiency comes from the extra work that was done, which is maybe a few thousand dollars a month. Or maybe less, depending on the level of detail of the transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sums of transactions are not the same, at all, as a given quantity of money. One expenditure is counted many times in different transactions. Accountants have to keep track of multiple time periods, many different organizational levels, different projects and categories (payroll/capital/supplies/etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the Defense Department accounting system is

       the GAO report of federal credit card fraud circa 2005 or 2006, 40% of 16 billion is fraud or has a serious lack of recording.
      </p>
      <p>
       then last year or early this year the GAO again reports on the current sad state of federal credit card misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       allowing federal employees to play with their CCs and do  naughty things with them, is very beneficial for the govt, for a small amount of fraud, they get immense leverage over the users of those CCs, 'do as we say or get busted and have your life ruined'
