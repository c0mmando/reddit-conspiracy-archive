<p>Edit: <strong>CORRECTION.</strong> As kahirsch point out in comments, the 2.3 trillion was not &quot;announced&quot; on Sept 10, nor &quot;missing&quot; in the sense I implied in the title. The unbalanced accounting entries seem to be due to procedural inefficiencies, and appear to have been handed-over from the Clinton era.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>January 7, 2001</p>

<p>The Defense Department&#39;s inspector general recently identified $6.9 trillion in accounting entries, but $2.3 trillion was not supported by adequate audit trails or sufficient evidence to determine its validity.</p>

<p>Another $2 trillion worth of entries were not examined because of time constraints, and therefore, the inspector general was able to audit only $2.6 trillion of accounting entries in a $6.9 trillion pot.</p>

<p>Is there corruption and wastage? Yes, obviously. But while the Pentagon&#39;s own auditors admit they can&#39;t/couldn&#39;t account for 25% of what they spend (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/01/29/eveningnews/main325985.shtml">source</a>), 25% of Pentagon expenditure, even over the entire 1990&#39;s, is still far less than 2.3 trillion. In 2000 the official DoD budget was <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Defense_Spending_Trends.png">approx 300 billion</a>.</p>

<p>In short, it appears this is something that the &quot;debunkers&quot; are actually right about. Sorry, guys. I&#39;ll leave this post here because the other details about Zakheim are interesting, and I think the correction is worthy of attention.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the idea of Modern Monetary Theorists, an increasingly prominent field of economics. These theorists have little to no policy-making power however, because as any good conspiracy theorist knows, the powers that people rely on controlling the currency to maintain their control.

<p>No, the &quot;debunkers&quot; are not right. The <strong>government</strong> announced that $2.3 trillion was not properly accounted for. That&#39;s a hell of a lot of money, whether the discrepancy accrued over a short period or over decades. Even if it was only a matter of delays in reconciling accounts, that&#39;s utterly unacceptable. How can Congress and ultimately the people exercise oversight over the Pentagon without timely and accurate information? And realize that claims of inefficiency or incompetence can be used to cover up corruption. </p>

<p>TIL Dov Zakheim was the Pentagon&#39;s money manager when 2.3 trillion went missing;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;2.3 trillion dollars&quot; figure comes from <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports/fy00/00-179.pdf">an audit</a> done in the year 2000 of the DOD&#39;s accounting for fiscal year 1999. This was before Dov Zakheim was at the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Also, that figure refers to transactions that are not supported by &quot;adequate research and reconciliation&quot;, not &quot;missing money&quot;. There could be missing money, but certainly nowhere near $2.3 trillion, since that is over 7 times the Defense Department budget for that year.</p>

<p>In fact, if you read the report, at least $1.4 trillion of the $2.3 trillion is completely innocent. It is an inefficiency in how the accounting is done, but it doesn&#39;t reflect any inaccuracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The inefficiency was that, every month, accountants had to manually enter financial data, then manually delete it, because the automatic data feed wasn&#39;t ready in time for a required report.</p>

<p>So, every month the accounts might have entered $59 billion dollars worth of transactions, then entered $59 billion dollars worth of rollbacks. If you add that all together, you get $118 billion dollars worth of transactions each month, or $1.4 trillion each year.</p>

<p>But the inefficiency comes from the extra work that was done, which is maybe a few thousand dollars a month. Or maybe less, depending on the level of detail of the transactions.</p>

<p>Sums of transactions are not the same, at all, as a given quantity of money. One expenditure is counted many times in different transactions. Accountants have to keep track of multiple time periods, many different organizational levels, different projects and categories (payroll/capital/supplies/etc).</p>

<p>That said, the Defense Department accounting system is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/09/us-usa-pentagon-payerrors-special-report-idUSBRE96818I20130709">still fucked up</a>, even in 2013.</p>
