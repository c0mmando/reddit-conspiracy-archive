    <div class="md"><p>Monsanto has never been afraid to sue any farmer that they suspect of growing their patented seed, even if that seed arrived on the farmer’s property from a bird flying by or on a particularly windy day. Over the years, Monsanto has sued 410 farmers in more than 27 states, in some cases destroying generations-old farms. And while organic farmers struggle to keep Monsanto seed out of their crops, conventional farmers often find that they no longer have a choice about what to plant since 93-percent of soybeans and 88-percent of corn grown in the US now comes from Monsanto’s genetically modified seed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/saved-seed-farmer-lawsuits.aspx">145 lawsuits in 14 years doesn&#39;t really sound excessive to me.</a></p>

<p>Especially considering the 250k farmers and the massive market share that Monsanto has. Every single case that I&#39;ve read about in the news turned out to be a case where the farmer was intentionally isolating Monsanto seed and replanting it, which is a violation of a law that has been on the books since 1930.</p>

I don&#39;t really know how to spot a shill, but if I had to put my money on yay or nay, after looking through your post and comment history I&#39;ve got to say, you either have a clear agenda to try and discredit anything anti gov or anti corporations, or your simply the dimmest person I&#39;ve come across in a very long time. </p>

<p>Check out his comments in this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1kxe1y/hedge_funds_insider_traders_begin_dumping/">thread</a> or any of his past posts and comments, which makes me wonder, for someone who says &quot;he doesn&#39;t care&quot; about everything we discuss here, why does he come back, and why does he post? I&#39;d really like to see this user banned, not because I can&#39;t handle people who disagree with my pov, but because of his attitude. </p>

<p>Simply my opinion though. </p>

if it was a good company maybe this would be a conflict of interest. but having this guy as a lawyer FOR years working for monsanto-then get a job to be a supreme court justice is more then sick.
