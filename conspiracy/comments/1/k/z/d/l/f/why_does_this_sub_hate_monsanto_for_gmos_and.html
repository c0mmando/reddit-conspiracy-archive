       Monsanto has never been afraid to sue any farmer that they suspect of growing their patented seed, even if that seed arrived on the farmer’s property from a bird flying by or on a particularly windy day. Over the years, Monsanto has sued 410 farmers in more than 27 states, in some cases destroying generations-old farms. And while organic farmers struggle to keep Monsanto seed out of their crops, conventional farmers often find that they no longer have a choice about what to plant since 93-percent of soybeans and 88-percent of corn grown in the US now comes from Monsanto’s genetically modified seed.

       Especially considering the 250k farmers and the massive market share that Monsanto has. Every single case that I've read about in the news turned out to be a case where the farmer was intentionally isolating Monsanto seed and replanting it, which is a violation of a law that has been on the books since 1930.

       Just like ANY other seed company they all sue they have no choice or their patent will become generic, majority of all commercial farmers use patented seeds and sign contracts.

       Monsanto has blocked farmers from selling their corn, even when the farmer has not used Monsanto seed, by claiming it was pollenized from the farm next door. (Which does happen)  They then drag out the case in court until the farmer is bankrupt.

       Why do you post here? Go back to posting pics of your dick on gonewild. I don't really know how to spot a shill, but if I had to put my money on yay or nay, after looking through your post and comment history I've got to say, you either have a clear agenda to try and discredit anything anti gov or anti corporations, or your simply the dimmest person I've come across in a very long time.
      </p>

       Check out his comments in this

       or any of his past posts and comments, which makes me wonder, for someone who says "he doesn't care" about everything we discuss here, why does he come back, and why does he post? I'd really like to see this user banned, not because I can't handle people who disagree with my pov, but because of his attitude.
      </p>

       Simply my opinion though.

       To see me banned for having a different opinion? That is quite the exact attitude you have against me, a different opinion, yet I am mostly a politely spoken person, unlike your derogatory comments calling me a shill.

       It's an scorched earth issue. Agent Orange is believed to have caused cancer in the soldiers. Cancers in the Vietnamese. The birth defects were under reported. The cancers were denied by the military and government.

       Enslave is the wrong word. I work for an EVIL corporation but I am far from a slave. I make my own hours and have no quotas, and if I try hard enough can pull $3000 a week, I don't try so I only make $1500 part time.

       if it was a good company maybe this would be a conflict of interest. but having this guy as a lawyer FOR years working for monsanto-then get a job to be a supreme court justice is more then sick.

       I am sure all supreme court justices have worked for companies people disagree with. What is your definition of a good company? All commercial farmers use a patented seed from a corporation and all farmers sign a contract detailing the terms and conditions no better or worse than any other company, including Monsanto.

       are you kidding me? So if i'm a judge- and my son rapes you, then you go to my court. Guess what will happen? You think you will get justice? It's the same thing with Monsanto. The fact that farmers cant grow their own food without some corporate douche in the way of personal progress is beyond evil. Spain is trying to patent the sun, you think that is no better or worse? how about the air you breath, should a company own that too?

       Well water can be patented and trademarked so I'm sure Democrats will find a way to tax clean air.
