        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I know that The Truman Show was based around the idea that his whole life was a TV show. But considering surveillance these days, that&#39;s pretty much what we&#39;ve become right? Not only that but the whole driving factor to make sure Truman stayed in his picturesque community and his &quot;perfect life&quot;, was fear. Truman experiences this traumatic situation with his father that makes him terrified to ever leave where he is. I thought it was interesting....any thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say Enemy of the State is a more accurate depiction into our lives now, also released in 1998.  Truman Show does resonate as well though, but maybe as more of a depiction of the illusion of hollywood, rather than real life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so I&#39;ve been thinking this idea for a while. Hear me out guys. </p>

<p>What if instead of being filmed like truman was with small cameras hidden and monitored by people, the camera used was two contact lenses which allowed streaming to a broadcast centre which would then relay the video to millions if not billions of approved televisions around the globe. Inb4 &quot;the contact lense might fall out.&quot; Technology could be wired into his brain to relay back his vision to the broadcast station.</p>

<p>This seems like a much more foolproof version of the truman show.</p>

<p>I got the idea of a contact lense camera from the book Artemis Foul, a teen fiction, but it was my idea to combine it with the truman show.</p>
