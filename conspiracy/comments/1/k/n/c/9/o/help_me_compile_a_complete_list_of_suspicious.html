<p><strong>The Anomalies of Building 7</strong> <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/06/compiling-important-anomalies-of.html">(sources provided at this link)</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>No plane hit World Trade Center 7 </p></li>
<li><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded in their report on Building 7: &quot;While debris impact from the collapse of WTC 1 initiated fires in WTC 7, the resulting structural damage had little effect in causing the collapse of WTC 7.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>NIST admits that Building 7 is the first time a building over 15 stories tall has EVER collapsed due to fires. </p></li>
<li><p>NIST admits to a free fall acceleration over 2.25 seconds. </p></li>
<li><p>The official 9/11 Commission Report does not discuss Building 7 </p></li>
<li><p>Fell neatly into its own footprint</p></li>
<li><p>NIST refuses to release data inputs for their computational collapse model, saying it &quot;...might jeopardize public safety.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>The model was built without physical evidence. &quot;In the month that lapsed between the terrorist attacks and the deployment of the [FEMA] BPAT team, a significant amount of steel debris—including most of the steel from the upper floors—was removed from the rubble pile, cut into smaller sections, and either melted at the recycling plant or shipped out of the U.S.&quot; -Joseph Crowley, U.S. Congressman, Committee on Science, 2002. </p></li>
<li><p>$200 million was spent &quot;...cutting out floors, adding elevators, reinforcing steel girders, upgrading power supplies and making other improvements in its million square feet of space,&quot; in 1990. </p></li>
<li><p>Collapse is symmetrical. </p></li>
<li><p>Cracking middle folds downwards precisely as in a controlled demolition. </p></li>
<li><p>NIST declined to test for chemical explosives used in demolition.</p></li>
<li><p>BBC reported the collapse hours before it happened, twice. </p></li>
<li><p>Experts agree it is a textbook case of controlled demolition, before being told the building collapsed on 9/11. </p></li>
<li><p>Barry Jennings, the Deputy Director of the Emergency Services Department for the New York City Housing Authority, was trapped inside Building 7 when the first plane hit. He has repeatedly told his story of hearing explosions on the 20th and 22nd floor while trapped inside. He did mysteriously in 2008, days before the release of the final NIST report. The cause of death has not been made public. </p></li>
<li><p>With rare exceptions, the media does not discuss building 7. </p></li>
<li><p>Larry Silverstein, owner of the WTC complex, famously made the command to &#39;pull it&#39;, in reference to building 7. </p></li>
<li><p>Multiple reports made by professionals of molten steel beneath the rubble that lasted for weeks. </p></li>

<p>A very important thing to note is that, 13/15 on that list were either partially recovered or lost in water at the location of the crash(es). The other 2/15 were neither over water <em>nor</em> partially recovered. The only 2 in history. Just take a guess which one&#39;s those were. Of course, one could argue that &quot;there&#39;s a first time for everything,&quot; but that argument falls apart once you realize it happened <strong>twice</strong> on the <em>same</em> day in just about the <em>same</em> location.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s put it this way. Say there was 4 hijackers on the plane, and 196 other passengers (I don&#39;t know how many there were, perhaps someone can enlighten me). Say they find one passport only, and it&#39;s a hijackers... it&#39;s only 50 to 1 odds. It&#39;s uncommon odds at best.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested in the actual numbers. I&#39;m sure all you people who&#39;ve &quot;done your research&quot; can answer without even looking it up by now. You&#39;ve had 12 years after all.</p>

<p>Consistent conditions? you mean like physics? any sane person would expect them to be. Unless youre suggesting fire is only hot sometimes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you seem to think the exact same fate will meet every object in that environment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because 11400 gallons of jetfuel is not a picky 12 year old girl. If its in the proximity it gets burned. the fact i have to explain fire to you is mind numbing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why are you still talking about melted steel after 12 fecking years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it happened? Its part of some theories, its claimed in the commission report, and theres pictures. Why are you NOT talking about melted steel? look to your right and gaze at the photos of all the steel frame structures that were in much more intense fires AND DIDNT COLLAPSE. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A passport is light and relatively rigid so it&#39;s going to end up in a different place than a fairly heavy box in a cupboard.</p>

<p>Are they also fire retardant to combusting jetfuel (850+ Celsius)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Part of the issue seems to be that conspiracy theorists don&#39;t accept complex, chaotic situations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>theres a difference between complex and chaotic with outright lies and bullshit. Just because something is &quot;chaotic&quot; or &quot;complex&quot; means they receiver a waiver from the universe and are able to defy physics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>everything must be easily explainable. any oddities are immediately considered suspicious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>have you seen some theories? no one is looking for easy explanations. just because youre willing to sit on your thumb and just nod at the idea &quot;its too complex for my little brain to understand&quot;.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Your argument is simply that i should accept the fact that all the events on 9/11 defied physics (in conjunction with the official story) based off the principle of its &quot; an odd and uncertain world&quot;, a world apparently void of laws or rules.   go away, its clear you dont know what youre talking about.</p>

<p>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  </p>

<p>Its even funnier the second time!<br/>
From the man who claims a paper passport can survive a jetfuel explosion strong enough to collapse and entire steel framed structure. Lets build building out of passports, since they seem to be more reliable and fire resistant than concrete and steel! hilarious!</p>

<p>it clear by your blatant avoidance of the rest of my comment and focus on 3 words i said, that  you have no leg to stand on. Go away, and dont contaminate the gene pool</p>

<p>American Airlines Flight 11 – One World Trade Center</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they crashed into top of the buildings, not the ground floor, and then someone had to pick all that up, aka sift through it. So it wasn&#39;t buried under the whole thing and left for a decade. It was buried under a 1/4 of it and picked through for over a year.</p>

<p>Also, it was a huge, historical event, and you&#39;d expect that they gave it their best shot at sifting through the rubble, for bodies and for black boxes as well, obviously. And then of course there&#39;s the forensic wealth to be discovered.</p>

<p>No, wait, that&#39;s not what happened, though. Instead, the <em>exact opposite</em> happened. They found a paper passport that was on the plane, and literally sold the rest of the rubble to China immediately (or so I hear all the time).</p>

<p>But wait, is that true? <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/september-11-attacks/8722638/21-awful-truths-about-911.html">This link says that they searched in the rubble for over a year, only recovering 1400 bodies. Is that even half of the bodies?</a></p>

<p>But if bodies and paper could be found after looking for more than a year, why not titanium and steel purpose-built devices created solely to preserve data through a catastrophic failure, such as a plane crash?</p>

<p>My question: If you&#39;re a terrorist and your plan is to hijack a plane to suicide crash it into a building, why would you need to check your luggage to make sure it was on that plane with you, especially if you had your Will inside?</p>

<p>Plane <em>parts</em>. The plane broke apart, no? As in, an extremely durable thing that holds hundreds of people entrusting their lives in its ability to take them through the air at hundreds of miles per hour across the country/planet? But the passport was all fine and dandy, no?</p>

<p>Seat cushions? You mean durable things that hold multi-hundred pound apes in comfort? That <em>broke off</em> from the thing in which they entrusted their lives?</p>

<p><em>Pieces</em> of people? I&#39;m pretty sure every part of me is far more durable than paper. Preeeeeetty sure. Finding a readable passport in the debris would be like finding a dude that survived the crash and walked away from it without needing to go to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mail from the plane? Ok, now we&#39;re on to something. Very comparable. Fully intact mail that could conceivably be delivered? That weren&#39;t in a protective bag?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like who would be carrying a terrorist passport? Like the terrorist right? And conceivably he was flying the plane into the big large ass building right? So that means he was in front of the plane right? And the plane was moving like 500mph, so conceivably the terrorist who is now in several thousand pieces was ahead of the big explosion that would have taken place in the wings right? because the fuel is in the wings. Correct? So things could have gone right through the building (with the tower being mostly air after all with its spacious floor plans)ahead of the explosion would have ended up on the street right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah it appears you are correct...</p>

<p>Springman learned from contacts within the government that the American Consulate in Jeddah was one of several conduits to the United States of young Moslem men who were destined to be trained at American military basses in hit and run operations and terrorist tactics, and then sent off to Afghanistan to employ their newly acquired skills against Soviet troops there.</p>

<p>The value of Springman&#39;s testimony is showing how passports are issued on National Security grounds for questionable characters who may in the end be terrorists, or involved in a plot conducted by the CIA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several weeks after the 9/11 attacks it was reported in the press that of the nineteen hijackers who commandeered aircraft on the morning of September 11, 2001, fifteen had obtained their visas at the American Consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.12 Springman was surprised to read this. He had thought that the CIA operation in Jeddah had been closed down long before the 9/11 attacks, considering he, &quot;had complained to the diplomatic security in Washington…had complained to the General Accounting Office…had complained to the State Department Inspector General&#39;s office, and…had complained to the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department.&quot;13 It would seem that Langley takes little notice of storm warnings emanating from Foggy Bottom.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, in November 2001 an Yemeni citizen who worked at the Jeddah Consulate was arrested in Las Vegas for providing fraudulent visas to foreigners.14 He was in America accompanying a trade delegation from the Mideast. Well, does &quot;trade delegation&quot; ring any bells? It should. Remember the two Pakistanis who said they were part of a Commerce Department-sponsored trade mission, but couldn’t remember the name of the trade show they were going to, nor the location of the city it was to take place in? </p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t answered my question, how were they supposed to find a plane that they didn&#39;t even know was hijacked? They can&#39;t read minds of the controllers and pilots.

<p>Not only was the military well prepared for this scenario, (scrambles are ordered all the time, and practised often) but they were practicing this very scenario on the morning.</p>

<p>What slowed them down was <em>not</em> picking out the correct aircraft, waiting for removal of training &#39;blips&#39; (fake radar contacts) was what slowed the appearance of the training aircraft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They intercepted so late is no one knew where the hijacked plane was going. </p>

<p>It was camouflaged in normal air traffic. The controllers had to relay the information where flight 11 was, while it was moving really fast, to NORAD people, and then the NORAD people had to tell the fighters where to go. This was the critical breakdown because hijacking at the time were seen as &quot;peaceful&quot; events. They would land, and there would be a hostage situation, etc. Not determined suicide weapon attacks on buildings. They thought they had time. </p>

<p>So NORAD responded very quickly, the problem was the breakdown of communication between, controllers, FAA, NORAD and the fighters.</p>

The hijackers turned off the transponders, so the interceptors would have had to rely on radar to find the planes. Just to illustrate how many planes are in the sky at any given time, check out the following:</p>

<p>NORAD can see ANY and ALL aircraft in the sky just fine, thank you, without the plane squwaking normally OR ident.</p>

<p>In fact, having the transponders off makes their job EASIER if anything...because then they&#39;re just looking for planes NOT squawking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As others have pointed out they have to actually be looking for it. When the transponders went off, there was initially no thought that the planes were being hijacked with the intent of flying them into buildings.</p>

<p>There was a lot of confusion on that day. Combine that with the fog of war environment and it is not at all unreasonable that there were conflicting orders and conflicting information coming in, resulting in the planes not being intercepted before they hit the buildings.</p>

<p>&quot;According to a statement from NORAD, &#39;Before September 11th, 01, NORAD regularly conducted a variety of exercises that included hijack scenarios. These exercises tested track detection and identification; scramble and interception; hijack procedures; internal and external agency coordination and operational security and communications security procedures..... At the NORAD headquarters&#39; level we normally conducted four major exercises a year, most of which included a hijack scenario.&#39;&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>The radars in any major &quot;center&quot; show the &quot;blips&quot; (planes) with markings next to them indicating flight, vector, and altitude. This information is tied to the plane&#39;s transponder, which can &quot;squawk&quot; any 4-digit number. Before you take off you are given a number by ATC to squawk so they know who you are. If they ask you to &quot;squawk ident&quot; you basically push a button marked &quot;IDENT&quot; on your transponder, which makes your blip &quot;bloom&quot; on the &#39;scope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously don&#39;t know much about ATC.</p>

<p>NO one controller sees that many planes...EVER. They see what&#39;s in their &quot;sector&quot; which can be up to 20 planes at a go in a busy sector. Remember that each of these planes has an identifier, a vector, and an altitude. When a transponder is turned off the plane will &quot;drop off&quot; the scope for most civilian controllers...but military ATC uses far more powerful radar that will discern the aircraft even with the transponder off.</p>

<p>Therefore, on 9/11 it would have been as easy as to see what plane WAS NOT displaying this information. 99.999% of them would have been showing something.</p>

<p>stop wasting time grasping at straws. 9-11 could have been prevented on many fronts. the same types that oversaw Iran -contra and was birthed out of the corrupt Nixon Administration. they got their &quot;pearl harbor&quot;. they got their draconian patriot act which was drafted in 1997. they got their middle east war that they had planned in the PNAC documents. And now Obama continues this. Time will tell if the Bush doctrine creates a peaceful middle east (by getting rid of the trouble makers) or if it makes it worse. </p>

According to this article from 2002, Cheney authorized the shoot down of the Shanksville flight while military personnel were tracking it: fter the planes struck the twin towers, a third took a chunk out of the Pentagon. Cheney then heard a report that a plane over Pennsylvania was heading for Washington. A military assistant asked Cheney twice for authority to shoot it down.

<p><strong>The history of Bin Laden leading up to 9/11</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. Al-Qaida, literally &quot;the database&quot;, was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians. Inexplicably, and with disastrous consequences, it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way, Bin Laden&#39;s organisation would turn its attention to the west.&quot; - <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development">Robin Cook, former UK Foreign Secretary</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.millat.com/democracy/Foreign%20Policy/Briefing_Paper_english_11.pdf">The CIA created and armed the Mujahideen with 7.5 billion in 1979 </a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6033383.stm">the Saudis matched them dollar for dollar</a></p></li>
<li><p>Bin Ladens MAK, precursor to Al Qaeda, received funding from the ISI (which received funding from the CIA)</p></li>
<li><p>Bin Ladens tunnel complex, which he would later use after 9/11, was <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/2001/pittsburghpostgazette092301.html">financed by the CIA</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The Sudanese security services, he said, would happily keep close watch on bin Laden for the United States. But if that would not suffice, the government was prepared to place him in custody and hand him over, though to whom was ambiguous. In one formulation, Erwa said Sudan would consider any legitimate proffer of criminal charges against the accused terrorist.&quot; Their negotiations concluded as such: &quot;&quot;We said he will go to Afghanistan, and they [US officials!] said, &#39;Let him.&#39;&quot;- <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/18/AR2007111800593.html">Washington Post 2001</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/etc/cron.html">Clinton declined to charge bin laden with a crime in 94</a> even though he had been clearly linked to the WTC bombings.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/10/uk.davidshayler">MI6 paid large sums to al qaeda in Libya to assassinate gadhaffi in 96</a>. Gadaffi issued an INTERPOL arrest warrant for bin Laden in 98, US and UK downplayed it, likely because they had recently funded the libya cell. 5 months later, al qaeda bombed US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya</p></li>
<li><p>Al Qaeda and the US fought on the same side of the war in Kosovo and Bosnia. They recently repeated the process with Libya and Syria</p></li>
<li><p>According to the official story, bin Laden turned against the US after they occupied military bases in Saudi Arabia. This doesnt make sense, because: Scott Armstrong, at the time the top investigative reporter for the Washington Post, <a href="http://emperors-clothes.com/news/arming-i.htm">stated that the United States and Saudi Arabia had jointly conspired to covertly build $200 billion worth of military installations between the years 1979 and 1992</a>. Steve Coll, eminent Bin Laden biographer, states that the Binladen group received a multitude of these contracts, with the knowing intent to support to house US military personal during wars that may threaten Saudi territory. This was occuring at the same time that Osama was tight with his family and using Binladen group assets to build bases in Afghanistan. Of course he was aware of the business dealings between the company.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0110/01/lkl.00.html">Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia, on Larry King Live</a>: &quot;In the mid-&#39;80s, if you remember, we and the United - Saudi Arabia and the United States were supporting the Mujahideen to liberate Afghanistan from the Soviets. He [Osama bin Laden] came to thank me for my efforts to bring the Americans, our friends, to help us against the atheists, he said the communists. Isn&#39;t it ironic?&quot;</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>and then there is the fascinating story of Egyptian Ali Muhammed, only tangentially related but thoroughly interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>He was a part of the fundamentalist military unit that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">In 1984, he was hired by the CIA</a>, though they claim that their relationship was short-lived. He would soon join the military and become a member of the Green Berets, and serve as a drill sergeant at Fort Bragg while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Abouhalima">providing clandestine training to jihadists such as Mahmud Abaouhalima</a>, convicted perpetrator of the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">He would take a short leave from his military duties and travel to Afghanistan in 1988 to assist the Mujahideen</a>, returning just months later.</p>

<p>In the early 1990&#39;s he would return to Afghanistan and began training jihadists with the skills he had learned at Fort Bragg. According to former FBI special agent <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html">Jack Cloonan, in an interview with PBS</a>, his first training session included Osama bin Laden, as well as Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of Al Qaeda.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Sacred-Terror-Radical/dp/0812969847">Former Directors of Counter-terrorism at the National Security Council have alleged</a> that Muhammed took maps and training materials from Fort Bragg and used them to write the Al Qaeda terrorist training manual.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2009/11/29/fort-hood-the-ksm-trial-part-i-what-do-these-terrorism-stories-have-in-common/">His superior at Fort Bragg, Lt. Col. Robert Anderson, has stated that</a> “I think you or I would have a better chance of winning the Powerball lottery, than an Egyptian major in the unit that assassinated Sadat would have getting a visa, getting to California, getting into the Army and getting assigned to a Special Forces unit. That just doesn’t happen.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Al-Qaeda-terrorist-worked-with-FBI-Ex-Silicon-2861719.php#page-2">Elsewhere he stated that</a> &quot;It was unthinkable that an ordinary American GI would go unpunished after fighting in a foreign war,&quot; and that he assumed that Muhammed was sponsored by the CIA.</p>

<li>That the Patriot Act was drawn up 20 years previous to the attacks but it sat in the proverbial drawer until proper justification could be made - couple this with the PNAC statement that a &quot;new Perl Harbour would be needed&quot; to further America&#39;s domination.</li>

</blockquote>

<p>Just to clarify on these two points: the <del>engineer</del> architect was referring to low flying, slow moving aircraft that were lost in the fog on their way to/from an airport. Also, at the time the towers were built, 747s didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>The case of the B-25 colliding with the Empire State Building was at a much slower speed and was not a direct head-on collision. Also a B-25 weighs significantly less than a 747. (Maximum of under 50k lbs vs maximum of close to 1M lbs.)</p>

<p>These two situations aren&#39;t entirely comparable.</p>

<p>The maximum weight of a B-25 ranged from 27,100 lb to a limit of 41,800 lb, for instance (see <a href="http://www.warbirdsresourcegroup.org/URG/b25mitchell.html">www.warbirdsresourcegroup.org/URG/b25mitchell.html</a>). A 767-200 ranges from 179,080 lbs (empty) to 395,000 lb (maximum takeoff load) (<a href="http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jetliner/b767">www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jetliner/b767</a>), and FEMA said the 9/11 planes had “an estimated <strong>gross weight of 274000 pounds</strong>&quot; ( <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch1.pdf">http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch1.pdf</a> ).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, the WTC was designed for a 707</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boeing: 707 Advanced 707-320B;</p>

<p>Wingspan : 145 feet 9 inches (44.42 m)</p>

<p>Length : 152 feet 11 inches (46.6 m)</p>

<p>Wing Area : 3,010 square feet (280 m 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Gross Weight : 336,000 pounds</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/707family/product.html">http://www.boeing.com/commercial/707family/product.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Leslie Robertson, one of the two original structural engineers for the World Trade Center, is asked at a conference in Frankfurt, Germany what he had done to protect the twin towers from terrorist attacks. He replies, ‘I designed it for a 707 to smash into it,’ though does not elaborate further.”[6]</p>

<p>[Leslie Robertson:] “The twin towers were in fact the first structures outside the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airplane.”[7]</p>

<p>[Frank A. Demartini:] “The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it. That was the largest plane at the time. I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door -- this intense grid -- and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting. It really does nothing to the screen netting.” Frank A. Demartini, on-site construction manager for the World Trade Center, spoke of the resilience of the towers in an interview recorded on January 25, 2001.[8]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked at the WTC temporarily a few times about a year before 9/11.  There were contractors that had access everywhere in the building, I looked up when one was on a ladder and he was working directly on the steel joints of the building.  These guys were everywhere in the building for months.  Any visitor such as myself, had to be escorted at all times by an employee of the business we were visiting.  These guys didn&#39;t look like any normal maintenance men to me, I had worked in many Manhattan highrises, and these weren&#39;t your typical joe shmoes.  They were very professional and clean cut, like maintenance men I&#39;ve never seen in any building, and they didn&#39;t like when I tried to see what they were doing.  You need to find more eyewitnesses who worked there to corroborate my story.  From what I was told, everyone knew of them, and they were there almost 24/7.  I really can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t heard of this from anyone anywhere before.  No accents, clean cut, not exactly military types, but also not a regular handy man.  From what I remember, they were private contractors.  They had their own security badges and access everywhere.  Employees that worked there only had badges and access to their own businesses.  These guys would walk right through security without being checked because of their badges regularly with small to medium sized bags all the time, anyone else had to have their things checked.  I don&#39;t necessarily believe in most theories behind 9/11, but I believe in asking questions.</p>

<p>Your story along with this is very interesting. Why would it be that hard to imagine that buildings as important as these wouldn&#39;t have some sort of self-destruct sequence in the even that some foreign power took over Manhattan, for example. There were extremely important documents in each of these buildings, probably worth more than the lives that were inhabiting them, at least to some power-hungry psychopath.</p>

<p>If there is anyone out there who has already done their fair share of research, i cannot recommend this book enough: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Rubicon-Decline-American-Empire/dp/0865715408/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1376894339&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=crossing+the+rubicon">Crossing the Rubicon</a>. It&#39;s intense, and you&#39;re a better man than i am if you can take it all in on the first read, but it is without a doubt a must-read if you really want to understand this thing properly.</p>

<p>There is stuff in there that needs to be read by a lot of people, as it seems to me like people who think they have this whole thing figured out really haven&#39;t put the time in, especially the &quot;it was the Israelis&quot; crowd. This is a proper investigation: there is very little conjecture in the book, and <em>everything</em> is sourced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Various parties. If there was one guy that you could put in jail over all others, going by the evidence presented in the book: Dick Cheney. It&#39;s quite complicated to place real blame, as massive portions of it were obviously heavily compartmentalised, but there are a few specific names that come out as being the guys you&#39;d want sat in orange jumpsuits in a courtroom. PNAC would be the group that you&#39;d probably focus most attention on if you were looking for a group of people who would likely have actually discussed this between themselves. Ruppert called them a &quot;government in waiting&quot;. And someone made sure they were &quot;waiting&quot;, and not &quot;hoping&quot;. But again, the blame doesn&#39;t stop there.</p>

<p>Yes, the Israelis (Mossad), had involvement, but as far as this book goes, the involvement was fairly minimal. From what i recall (i need to read it again at some point), the suspicion is that those agents inside the US were basically keeping an eye on the hijackers. I don&#39;t want to say any more than that, as my memory sucks and i&#39;ll probably get something wrong, but there was a motive for the surveillance - i&#39;d have to go back to the book to give you any more details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s free copies of the book online. Ruppert spends most of the book running through the evidence and keeping conjecture to himself. In the final chapter he gives a succint version of his opinion of what happened and who was running the show (spoiler alert: cheney et al + elements of other governments). Crossing the Rubicon is the most well researched book on this topic I have come across. His chapter on PROMIS software is more relevant now then when the book came out due to recent NSA drama. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I had a long conversation today with Max Fraser, an independent documentary filmmaker in Whitehorse, that has left me stunned.</p>

<p>He has performed an impressive feat of investigatory work in the research for his documentary, &quot;Never Happen Here: The Whitehorse 9/11 Story.&quot; ...</p>

<p>...As part of his research, <strong>Fraser has uncovered strong evidence that contradicts official claims and statements about what happened after a Korean Airlines 747 bound for Anchorage inexplicably sent out a text message saying it was hijacked.</strong></p>

<p>No one has ever explained why the text message &quot;HJK&quot; was sent by the pilot. Fraser does not dispute that message. It remains unexplained. He said he was stonewalled by Korean Airlines, which refused to comment on the matter.</p>

<p>The text message was cited, in testimony to the Alaska Legislature in 2002 by Gen. Norton Schwartz, now the head of the U.S. Air Force, as the first sign that the plane may have been hijacked.</p>

<p>Schwartz went on to say that the second sign was that the plane was sending out the 7500 squawk code, which is a distress call that the plane has been hijacked.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The film and the controller say that <strong>the Federal Aviation Administration actually gave the order for the Korean jet to transmit the electronic signal that it was being hijacked.</strong> This was a foolhardy thing to do when armed F-15s are following the jet, thinking that it might be controlled by hijackers.</p>

<p><strong>Fraser obtained FAA documents that show the agency ordered the jet to send the distress call. He also has transcripts of statements by Whitehorse RCMP officials who said the pilot told them he was ordered by the FAA to make the distress call.</strong></p>

<p>This is an alarming piece of evidence because it put the lives of innocent people at risk. The nation was in a panic mode that day. A lot of things happened that probably would not have happened under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>Rick Wilder, a retired pilot and air traffic controller who was working in Anchorage that day, said <strong>the &quot;worst thing I&#39;ve ever had to do&quot; was to issue the order to the Korean jet to issue the 7500 squawk code. He said it made no sense that day and it makes no sense now.</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;The 7500 squawk was the hijack code,&quot; Wilder said. &quot;A supervisor came down and said we need to have the Korean Air squawk 7500.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t really think it was the right thing to do,&quot; he said. &quot;So they actually left and regroup and talked about it. I had my opinions of why it wasn&#39;t, but then later I was ordered to do it.&quot;...</p>

<p>...Here is a video of Townsend&#39;s interview with the controller that was shown after the documentary. He does not appear in the documentary. Wilder did contact Fraser after he first saw the film and let him know about it being the worst action that he had to take in his working life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are pictures of the pentagon <em>prior</em> to the widely shown roof collapse photos.  They clearly show a hole too small for a 747.  Also, the portion of the pentagon which was hit was already under construction, and part of the records which were destroyed was about the 500 million missing from the budget that Rumsfield had announced 2 days before.</p>

<p>There were only 5 lo res frames released of the pentagon attack.  All other videos were confiscated.  The 5 frames also appear to be doctored, some have rounded edges, others don&#39;t.  (All videos of the OKC bombing were confiscated too btw)</p>

<p>Many reports from the pentagon say it looked like a missile.</p>

<p>There were an abnormally high amount of govt personnel on the planes.</p>

<p>Several planes routes took them over military bases, where their transponders were messed with.</p>

<p>PNAC wanted &quot;A New Pearl Harbor&quot;</p>

<p>Just after 9/11 financial rules were temporarily changed for a few days allowing many billions in bonds to be transferred without the verification they normally required.</p>

<p>All the training exercises going on at the same time.</p>

<p>Bottom line, in my opinion there were several reasons for the attacks, and they were done by &#39;terrorists&#39; from within our own government.  It was to ramp up the military-industrial complex, but the main reason was to lay the framework so a select few could become even more rich and powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please look up all you can on &quot;The B Thing&quot; so called &quot; art installation&quot; in the Twin Towers:Balcony Scene (Or Unseen) Atop the World; Episode at Trade Center Assumes Mythic Qualities &quot;In the spring of 2000, Gelatin and 14 other artists shared free studio space on the 91st floor, where the group&#39;s artmaking appeared to consist of building a clubhouse out of cardboard boxes.&quot; source <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/18/nyregion/balcony-scene-unseen-atop-world-episode-trade-center-assumes-mythic-qualities.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/18/nyregion/balcony-scene-unseen-atop-world-episode-trade-center-assumes-mythic-qualities.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=</a></p>

<p>very strange- possible Mossad &quot;art students&quot; (quotes intentional) build bizarre balcony that juts OUT from a 91st floor window, they did it all very surreptitiously and without permission, then took it all down quietly. For more information on weird &quot;art students&quot; just do a simple web search for &quot;Israeli art students&quot; there are many suspicious instances regarding persons claiming to be art students eager to show/sell their &quot;art&quot;: very poor renditions- they always try to enter secure buildings or make friends with important persons. Another thing to look up are Mossad mall kiosks! Very interesting, you&#39;ll waste some hours reading. These phony art students have been investigated and followed by law enforcement. You will not hear many stories or opinions from US law and intel agents regarding what the real story is as the media is not controlled by them- but by our enemies who are eager to change your mind to believe a lie. 
Thanks for considering// we can&#39;t let this 911 fiasco get away with the phony mainstream explanation. I watched non-US satellite tv (free to air Ku band) and before US news got the scoop, it was already on arab TV about the so called terrorists that were named found alive and well and wondering why their names were associated with this tragedy. They also exposed the phony &quot;celebration&quot; taking place in Palestine that was in reality an old file footage of a political parade for a local Palestinian politician. Not shown on Western media til much later and without all the fanfare on non-western media of course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here, in Bosnia, there are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LzL34.jpg">two twin skyscrapers</a> in our capital, Sarajevo. Just behind those two buildings there is an <a href="http://i52.tinypic.com/n1eyqr.jpg">American embassy</a>. Now, you may notice that the embassy is surrounded with 2-3 meters long wall. There is a claim that they practiced right here for the attack and calculating how to destroy the building. There were constant observations and FBI agents visited the building few times before the 9/11 to look at their infrastructure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be glad to answer you, and I&#39;ll take the opportunity to tell a little bit more about that buildings and the U.S. embassy two blocks away.</p>

<p>First of all, these buildings are old, they were built in 1984 I think. They were highly damaged during the Yugoslavian war in 1990s. (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/UNIS_towers_may_1996.png">here&#39;s the picture of the tower after the battle for Sarajevo was over</a>, <a href="http://www.e-novine.com/files.php?file=photo/region/BiH/sarajevo/momo_i_uzeir/Momo_i_Uzeir_02_t_722837327.jpg">another one</a> and <a href="http://www.e-novine.com/thumbnail.php?file=photo/region/BiH/sarajevo/momo_i_uzeir/Momo_i_Uzeir_01_u_310955959.jpg&amp;amp;size=article_large&amp;amp;scale_by=width">another one</a>). The buildings were built ten years after the World Trade Center, using World Trade Center as a model. There was even a fire in one of the towers during the war, but the buildings survived without collapsing. The American embassy was built after the battle for the Sarajevo. The war was still going strong. The year was 1994. Obviusly the Americans were impressed that the building survived.</p>

<p>Wikipedia says that the American intelligence analysts became concerned that Arab immigrants in Bosnia and Herzegovina planned to attack the US Embassy in Sarajevo just after 9/11, and, as a part of that attack, crash into those towers. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States%2C_Sarajevo">source</a>). As I&#39;ve pointed out in my previous post, there are evidences that the FBI agents inspected those towers, but not after the 9/11, <strong>before</strong>. And not once, a couple of times, last inspection was on the September 1st, ten days before planes crashed into WTC. Six men were even arrested because they were &quot;connected to AlQuaida and planned that attack&quot;. Of course, there were no evidences, US admitted that and they were released from Guantanamo in 2008. So, they&#39;ve spent seven years in Guantanamo for nothing. The story was not covered by the mainstream media.</p>

<p>In 2011., there was a minor &quot;terrorist attack&quot; on the U.S. embassy (<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2012/individual-indicted-in-connection-with-machine-gun-attack-on-u.s.-embassy-in-bosnia-herzegovina-in-2011">here&#39;s the report from the FBI</a>], basically nothing more than one guy with a machine gun and he didn&#39;t manage to kill nobody. Funny thing is he just walked inside the embassy. Through the main gate. With a shotgun. Nothing suspicious at all. Nobody even tried to stop him. During the trial, he said that he did that because the U.S. planted the bomb in the infrastructure of those two towers during the war. According to him, the bombs were planted while the towers were reconstructed (so between 1994 and 1998). The bomb was never found, nobody even looked for them. Ever. And he had some evidences to support that claim, but still... nothing. According to AlJazeera Balkan, that was nothing more than a &quot;propaganda&quot;. The rest of the media just followed what AlJazeera reported. He&#39;s serving 10 years in prison here in Bosnia now. Nine to go.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much all I know. So I have to say that in my opinion these two towers are VERY much connected to the 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mechanics of Twin Towers&#39; collapse
Both buildings collapsed symmetrically and more or less straight down, though there was some tilting of the tops of the towers and a significant amount of fallout to the sides. In both cases, the portion of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed, which allowed the section above the airplane impacts to fall onto the undamaged structure below. As the collapse progressed, dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction, caused by the sudden rush of air from the upper levels. The first fragments of the outer walls of the collapsed North Tower struck the ground 11 seconds after the collapse started, and parts of the South Tower after 9 seconds. The lower portions of both buildings&#39; cores (60 stories of WTC 1 and 40 stories of WTC 2) remained standing for up to 25 seconds after the start of the initial collapse before they too collapsed.[12]</p>

<p>While the buildings were designed to support enormous static loads, they provided little resistance to the moving mass of the sections above the floors where the collapses initiated. Structural systems respond very differently to static and dynamic loads, and since the motion of the falling portion began as a free fall through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or 10 feet), the structure beneath them was unable to stop the collapses once they began. Indeed, a fall of only half a meter (about 20 inches) would have been enough to release the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.[50]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the <strong>undamaged massive lower section of each tower offered <em>no</em> resistance whatsoever</strong>. The larger, more robust lower section should have measurably slowed the collapse and then arrested further collapse. A building cannot pile drive itself into dust. If ten floors fall on the floors below, each of the ten floors will consume itself in destroying another floor. After the ten floors have expended their energy none remains to do any crushing as the building has always been supporting the weight.</p>

<p>boston bombers tamerlan and jahar thought 9/11 was an inside job and may have been framed</p>

<p><strong>Phillip Marshall</strong></p>

<p>Marshall, his two kids, and dog were found dead in early february. The police declared it a murder suicide the day he was discovered, and claim to have ruled out foul play. They did a short investigation and backed up their claims saying that they have medical records proving he is mentally unstable and surveillance video of him buying a gun the week before. They also claim to have police reports from 2008 regarding conflict between him and his wife. His wife has said very little publicly and there has been almost no msm coverage: <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/hundreds-mourn-teen-siblings-killed-by-father-in-murder-suicide.html">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/hundreds-mourn-teen-siblings-killed-by-father-in-murder-suicide.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;Marshall, a former United Airlines pilot, has written about his work with drug-runner Barry Seal during the Iran-contra scandal. Seal was murdered in 1986. Also, Marshall has challenged official accounts of 9/11. He was working on a new book about the 1963 assassination of President John Kennedy, one of more than 250 by various authors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Many news reports have been quick to echo what the Calaveras County Sheriffs Department has claimed; Philip Marshall killed his two teenage kids, his dog, and himself. What we know is that there is no motive for the allegation, and we know that this conclusion was made the same day that the three bodies were found.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The biggest conspiracy theory here is the one that the police have come up with. Have they tested Philip Marshall for gun residue (ballistics testing)? The police department have not released any information about this question and I haven’t seen it asked in the local news reports about Philip Marshall.&quot;</p>

<p>Why would he have killed his kids because of a dispute with his wife? Neighbors and close friends report that he was very close to them, involved in their school activities, etc. There was an upcoming divorce hearing in late february, but it&#39;s unlikely they would have wanted to move away rather than finish high school where they were, with their friends.</p>

<p><strong>More on PTECH</strong></p>

<p>Ptech was a Boston software firm financed by Saudi businessman <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasin_al-Qadi">Yassin Al-Qadi</a>. The UN placed sanctions against him in 1999 and 2000, when he was named by UN Security Council Resolutions 1267 and 1333 as a suspected associate of al-Qaeda. </p>

<p>Oussama Ziade, CEO of Ptech, claims that <a href="http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?id=1521846767-237">al-Qadi &quot;talked very highly of his relationship&quot; with Dick Cheney</a>.</p>

<p>In mid-June of 2002, Joe Bergantino, a reporter for WBZ-TV&#39;s investigative team was <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/boston-station-loses-scoop-after-agreeing-not-air-story">working on this story</a>. He received a tip from Indira Singh who suspected that Ptech had tied to terrorists. His research revealed that Ptech&#39;s clients included many federal government agencies including the U.S. Army, Air Force, Naval Air Command, Congress, Department of Energy, Aviation Administration, Internal Revenue Service, NATO, FBI, Secret Service, and the White House.</p>

<p>In September, Bergantino was told by federal authorities not to air the story because it would jeopardize their investigation and threaten national security. These authorities claimed that if the story was run, documents would be shredded and people would flee.</p>

<p>Despite an October 2001 Executive Order signed by Bush which froze the assets of individuals linked to terrorism, a list which included al-Qadi, the government did not investigate Ptech in October 2001. It waited until August 2002, when Bergantino called attention to Ptech.</p>

<p>After Bergantino pushed again to air the story, the government became abusive and claimed they would blame WBZ-TV if their investigation got botched. They promised Bergantino that if he held the story, he would have advance noticed about a planned raid on Ptech. They did not tell him, and alerted an ABC News reporter instead.</p>

<p>Jonathan Bush&#39;s Riggs Bank has been found guilty of laundering terrorist funds and find a US-record $25 million:

<p>43 lbs of heroin was found on board the Lear Jet owned by Wally Hilliard, the owner of Atta&#39;s flight school, three weeks after Atta enrolled - the biggest seizure ever in Central Florida. Hilliard was not charged: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040409154402/http://longislandpress.com/v02/i08040226/news_02.asp">http://web.archive.org/web/20040409154402/http://longislandpress.com/v02/i08040226/news_02.asp</a></p>

<p>Hilliard&#39;s plane had made 30-round trips to Venezuela with the same passengers who always paid cash. The plane had been supplied by a pair of drug smugglers who had also outfitted CIA drug runner Barry Seal. 9/11 commissioner Richard ben-Veniste had been Seal&#39;s attorney before Seal&#39;s murder.</p>

<p>George Bush found success as a businessman only after the investment of Osama&#39;s brother Salem and reputed al Qaeda financier Khalid bin Mahfouz: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/31/pressandpublishing.saudiarabia">http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/31/pressandpublishing.saudiarabia</a></p>

<p>One of George Bush&#39;s first acts as President, in January 2001, was to end the two-year deployment of attack submarines which were positioned within striking distance of al Qaeda&#39;s Afghanistan camps, even as the group&#39;s guilt for the Cole bombing was established</p>

<p>The standing order which covered the shooting down of hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001 to take discretion away from field commanders and place it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense. The order was rescinded shortly after 9/11: <a href="http://911review.com/means/standdown.html">http://911review.com/means/standdown.html</a></p>

<p>FBI Special Investigator Robert Wright claims that agents assigned to intelligence operations actually protect terrorists from investigation and prosecution, that the FBI shut down his probe into terrorist training camps and that he was removed from a money-laundering case that had a direct link to terrorism.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I&#39;m Canadian. :-)  But my country has sent troops to die in these wars, and after reading all 3 of the US governments reports regarding 9/11 (they had to keep commissioning new ones after flaws were pointed out) I have to conclude that they did a sloppy investigation all 3 times.  I was 30 years old on 9/11... I watched the news from the moment the first plane hit.  I saw interviews with people who said there were explosions.  I saw interviews with Firefighters and heard the explosions in the background.  When asked if NIST investigated of there was any evidence of explosive devices, they said no, but they admit they didn&#39;t look for any. Hunh?  The biggest terrorist attack in US history and you don&#39;t even think that it could be a possibility that planes were not the only reason those three buildings fell?  It&#39;s the avoidance of researching probable scenarios that makes me suspicious of the government&#39;s involvement.  And if I can just get back to building 7 for a second, the NIST report attempts to explain how the building fell.  The problem is that their models and diagrams show the building collapsing in a way that the visual evidence simply does not support.  It looks completely different, and they refuse to
supply the parameters upon which their hypothesis is based.  Some of the stuff in this thread is overwhelming, but this fact is irrefutable.  If you&#39;re interested I know you can find the final NIST report online, I think the building 7 stuff starts around page 300ish.  The artwork doesn&#39;t match what we can see with our eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hockey is allright.........ahh fuck it, THANKS! But seriously, thank you for Steve Nash and Pamela Anderson. Awesome job.</p>

<p>I viewed the whole thing as it happened aswell. Over here it all started at 3 in the afternoon, so everyone just got back more or less. I lost a good friend in Iraq because of this, so it&#39;s close to my heart aswell. I heard most of the interviews aswell, and you can of course view them on youtube now. I believe a lot of explosions did happen that day, I just cant see it would be planted explosives. </p>

<p>My rational mind is just asking my why you wouldnt just set off the bombs immediatly and get max kill numbers, instead of going through all these random times, of planes hitting, towers collapsing at random times, the plane that crashed in the field etc.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your point of view on that?</p>

<p>Building 7 was destroyed because of the information that was there? Why would they not just blow that building up aswell immediatly, instead of letting it collapse later in the day when that information could have been salvaged?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think if they just blew everything up at once, it would be obvious to everyone who witnessed it that the explosions would have to be investigated.  Questions would be asked.  The most important of which would be, &quot;How could enough explosives be planted to accomplish this without it raising any suspicions?&quot;  The only conclusion would be that there would have to be someone on the inside orchestrating it.</p>

<p>(on a side note, in the 4 months leading up to 9/11, WTC 1&amp;2 were a part of the largest elevator upgrades in history.  Is it possible, they were wittingly, or unwittingly involved?)</p>

<p>By crashing planes into the building first, there is a diversion of focus and time to evacuate as many potential &#39;up close&#39; witnesses as possible, allowing them to paint the remaining witnesses as unreliable, delusional, or simply mistaken due to trauma.</p>

<p>This is just a theory of course, but again, the fact that from day one, no one in the US government would even entertain the possibility of explosives is baffling.  The fact that they flat out refuse to investigate that possibility is an afront to the Scientific Method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it would be investigated, and it would conclude that Osama did it. Would it not be more spectacular, and give them even more reason to just do whatever they wanted to? What is the difference from security lacking in the air or in the WTC? I know I am just being the devils advocate here, but I just can&#39;t see the reason for the extreme attacks. Would any public target not been enough to fuel a war?</p>

<p>As for the reasoning behind the investigation is lacking. I would assume they wouldn&#39;t be interested in paying the $ neccesary for an investigation they deem unreasonable. The wittnesses who claims there was bombs clearly aren&#39;t good enough. I heard most of the bomb claims, and they are all random. &quot;We heard explosions.....&quot; Yeah, well shit was blowing up. But there havent been any claims of a clear explosion as when the planes hit? If so, just link it, I would be extremely interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying and there is some sense to it for sure. While I agree they would still blame it on Bin Laden, people would be like, &quot;how the fuck did Al Queda get access (for months) to all those buildings?&quot; there would need to be some blame placed to at least SOME of the staff in the buildings.  That being said, no one to date from the airlines have been blamed or faulted so maybe it would also get swept under the rug.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have all the answers to be sure.  I&#39;m at work and Googling reports of explosions on my phone is cumbersome.  Some of the evidence listed in that thread is a reach, but there&#39;s also a lot of very valid points that I&#39;ve investigated.  My gut says that with all the facts presented, there WERE people in high places that knew this was going to happen and by being either involved directly, or simply allowing it to happen, it would further their war agenda.  And if all this death and war were simply about 9/11... Why are we still in it? Bin Laden is dead and so is Hussein, and for 12 years the news pops up now and again how they have captured or killed one of Osama&#39;s right hand men.  Seriously, how threatened should we feel?  At this point I won&#39;t even cross the border to the US because it is being run by fascists... Road side strip searches, warrantless spying and confiscation of cellphones and laptops.  People killed on American streets by drones and police without even a trial.  This is what America has become because of 9/11.  They have almost complete control over their citizenry and I don&#39;t believe for a second that it&#39;s some kind of a &#39;natural progression&#39; I believe Sociopaths and Psychopaths have infiltrated some very high places in all branches of government, and the only thing they care about is money, power,  and their own agenda.</p>

<p>For instance, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/interview-john-potash-author-of-the-fbi-war-on-tupac-shakur-and-black-leaders-1">this</a> is an interview with someone who has written a book which claims that the fbi killed mlk as well as many other black leaders. Knowing what the fbi and cia have done, are doing, and plan to do is important. Knowledge of this history is why I don&#39;t believe that jahar and tamerlan are guilty on the basis of the fbi&#39;s word alone.</p>

<p>Every conspiracy you don&#39;t get right, only spreads negativity and uncertainty, mistrust etc. No way you can debate me on that. But you again avoided the question.

<p>How do you weigh that in advance against the ones we do get right? I think that learning is an intrinsically valuable endeavor and I am interested in conspiracies because they seem to get at the heart of so many problems we face today.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what the end goal is. I don&#39;t think it can be determined so precisely before we get there, or we wouldn&#39;t be learning anything. I want to know what&#39;s going on so that I can use that knowledge to make the world a better place. I want to be able to share my knowledge with others and learn from others in turn. That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>So much of history is a lie. I think that our educational system is broken, and making sure that future generations learn what actually happened seems pretty important to me.</p>

<p>We happen to be doing this right now with blogs and through discussions on reddit. I&#39;m going to write a thesis on conspiracy theory two years from now. I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m going to do after that.</p>

<p>I have a hard time really writing what I am thinking here. Though I get what you&#39;re saying....</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust everything blindly, far from it, but on the other hand, I don&#39;t distrust it blindly. I am aware of people, and the mistakes they can make, innocently and on purpose. I just always have a hard time having rational conversations with &quot;conspiracy people&quot;, and they often end in a angry fashion, even though I don&#39;t want them to, they often end in: &quot;Fucking shill&quot; &quot;Disinfo agent&quot; etc. </p>

<p>So if these are the people who are solving all these cases.........well consider me amazed.</p>

<p>Good read, the link. I&#39;m halfway through already. But had to write this question before i forgot: </p>

<p>Lets say these psycho&#39;s actually have managed to get in the right political positions worldwide, and they are just doing evil horrible stuff on a daily. Could it not just be a natural thing for us people? We get on top, and we get straight up evil, always, no excuse.
And if you are not in a position of power, you only see the bad in people, conspiracies everywhere.</p>

<p>I think it is natural, to an extent. But I don&#39;t think that means it&#39;s unchangeable or inevitable. hierarchies tend to exacerbate this and working to undo hierarchies and replace them with horizontal structures would hopefully do a lot to overcome it.</p>

It&#39;s the other way around. Why spread tons of negativity and falsehood JUST IN CASE when in reality it&#39;s probably not a secret society at the top trying to fuck people over.</p>

<p>And truth is relevant too. For example, the truth behind a moon conspiracy would just be lies(granted, big ones). The truth behind a 9/11 coverup would mean that a GOVERNMENT MURDERED THOUSANDS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE. Clearly not all of them are created equal, so how could you say the truth would be worth it? Who would it really affect? You could have convinced someone that the government was responsible for their father&#39;s death because you&#39;re trying to spread &quot;truth&quot;.</p>

<p>The negativity surrounding 9-11 conspiracies and the others that question the governments actions are furthered most by the complete lack of cooperation of govt officials that are supposed provide a certain level of transparency to the people that they are charged to defend.</p>

There are so many more valuable targets where you could have many more casualties. 
4/4 on hijacking commercial AMERICAN aircraft? Then plan relies on that happening. Without that, plan fails. Why would you waste resources like embedded cells on something as high risk as that?

    <div class="md"><p>So many of these alleged facts are misrepresentations, or distortions of the actual facts, such as a number of NIST&#39;s findings on Building 7&#39;s collapse.</p>

<p>Many more are simple fantasies, such as evidence of nanothermite (which you rather laughingly suggest has been peer reviewed by the BenthamOpen Chemical Physics Journal.)</p>

<p>Still more appear to have no connection whatsoever to the tragic events of 9/11 and appear to have been included simply to bulk up your list, or because their inclusion seems to support your overall narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sibel Edmonds is the founder of Boiling Frogs Post. She is known by many for her 6 month tenure as an FBI linguist which ended in termination. Edmonds termination was, in-part, a retaliation for the continuous concerns she raised about a co-worker; concerns that caused many in the Bureau to find Edmonds disruptive. After being fired, Edmonds was vocal about being wrongfully terminated. Long story short, Edmonds persistence resulted in exposing the FBI&#39;s poor internal investigation practices and significant reform of these practices.
That being said, I&#39;ve listened to a lot of her appearances with various alternative media outlets as well as her own material at Boiling Frogs Post. Edmonds seems to be universally praised by the alternative media and her pontifications are mostly treated as likely accurate because of her &quot;insider&quot; status based on her history. As I became more exposed to Edmonds thoughts on a plethora of topics, I found myself having growing doubts about most of her claims/theories on issues of the day and wondered why her ideas were never challenged by others in alternative media; I was perplexed, so I decided to examine Sibel Edmonds background and experience that makes her such an important &quot;insider&quot; because clearly I must be missing something.
I read countless materials about her in order to understand why she is hailed as this great government &quot;insider&quot; who is intricately knowledgeable about the secrets of the justice department.
(Fun Fact: She&#39;s an author, in 2012 she wrote &quot;Classified Woman-The Sibel Edmonds Story: A Memoir&quot; which I obviously thought was a big deal and would boost her credibility until I noticed her publisher is Sibel Edmonds... Yes, it is self-published; you could do the same thing for yourself, Amazon will show you how)
For background, here is what the ACLU writes about Edmonds FBI tenure which lasted from late-September 2001 until 22 March 2002 (just 6 months): <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/sibel-edmonds-patriot-silenced-unjustly-fired-fighting-back-help-keep-america-safe">http://www.aclu.org/national-security/sibel-edmonds-patriot-silenced-unjustly-fired-fighting-back-help-keep-america-safe</a>
While an FBI translator, Edmonds discovered poorly translated documents relevant to the 9-11 attacks and reported the shoddy work to her supervisors. She also expressed concerns about a co-worker who had previously worked for an organization under FBI surveillance and had a relationship with a foreign intelligence officer also under surveillance. In addition, Edmonds claimed that she was told to work slowly to give the appearance that the agency was overworked so it would receive a larger budget, despite a large backlog of documents that needed translating.
Even though she followed all appropriate procedures for reporting her concerns up the chain of command, Edmonds was retaliated against and fired.
However, I figured that surely her pre-FBI experience must be vast; I was sorely mistaken...
According to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General&#39;s 2005 report titled &quot;A Review of the FBI&#39;s Actions in Connection With Allegations Raised By Contract Linguist Sibel Edmonds&quot; which details her experience prior to her 6 months at the FBI: <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/sedmonds.html">http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/oig/sedmonds.html</a>
Edmonds, who was born abroad and speaks English fluently, moved to the United States in 1991 to attend college. She married an American citizen in 1992. Before joining the FBI, Edmonds worked as a volunteer at a local courthouse, as a court-appointed special advocate for children, and for the Rostropovich foundation, a non-profit organization that delivers medical supplies and food to a children&#39;s hospital. In addition, Edmonds served as a corporate officer (Secretary) for her husband&#39;s consulting business.
Her experience is flimsy at best.
After trying to debunk my own doubts about her, my research has resulted in even more doubts about her credibility. So, I figured I&#39;d ask if there is something that I am missing???? I mean Sibel Edmonds is hailed as such a trusted voice and purported &quot;insider&quot; by so many in alternative media but her experience doesn&#39;t even come close to meriting her pontificating &quot;insider&quot; info on so many current topics.
After learning her background, I really feel like Dorothy after Toto pulls aside a curtain, revealing the Wizard to be a harmless elderly illusionist...</p>

<p>Is it the self published book?  I&#39;m willing to bet many publishers would not touch her given the ongoing litigation.</p>

<p>Is it the fact that she only had 6 months experience at the FBI?  She was recruited by them specifically because of her language skills.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I cannot see anything based on what you wrote which is a valid criticism of her legitimacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edmonds is treated as an oracle of government secrets &amp; her analysis is almost universally praised in alternative media when her credentials do not merit or validate her expertise.</p>

<p>One MAJOR point that what is consistently missed by the hype and fawning over her is that she blew the whistle on the FBI&#39;s abysmal internal investigation practices related to handling one employee&#39;s concerns about another employee. </p>

<p>While she should be commended for being the catalyst for the FBI reforming these practices. However, her actions were not privy to or revealing of anything that would provide her with unique, specific information on 9-11 which is what she claims.</p>

<p>Considering her entire professional career experience prior to her six months with the FBI was: volunteering at a local courthouse as a special advocate for children and volunteering for the Rostropovich foundation; and by examining her duties while with the FBI it is clear that she lacked access to the information she claims and that she did NOT blow the whistle on anything related to 9/11 as she claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you are correct, she did not blow the whistle on anything 9/11 related, except to say that she had seen some suspicious documents while doing translating.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t like her, that&#39;s ok, I think she&#39;s ok, that should be ok too.</p>

<p>As far as her credentials:  In the aftermath of 9/11 the security state shifted gears and went into overdrive.  They were hiring all over the place.  She happened to be fluent in the languages they required, therefore qualified for the job.  She was not an analyst, she was not a field agent, she was employed simply to translate.  While she was doing this she may or may not have seen some shady stuff regarding 9/11.  </p>

<p>What I can tell you is that the foreign languages division is near <em>always</em> the most sensitive department of an intelligence organization, it has a huge potential for abuse (read: falsifying information/manipulating translations)  It would not surprise me if she had seen a lot of different things there that would shock anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your thoughtful reply and our dialogue.</p>

<p>I  was a fan of Edmonds and would regularly listen to her interviews &amp; podcasts. After hearing her repeated references to her time at the fbi being the foundation of her claims and insights I started researching her time at the FBI and was quite surprised with what I learned. I thought I must be missing something and began a thread here asking for assistance to fill in the blanks; I learned there weren&#39;t any holes in my research.</p>

<p>Based on this, it was clear that her alleged extensive contacts and intimate knowledge of the inner workings were severely embellished and  that such claims serve as the foundation for her credibility then it is impossible to accept each theory she utilizes about a particular topic as valid which most alternative media being with her.</p>

<p>I just think it&#39;s important to vet sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, it wouldn&#39;t really surprise me if she did embellish here and there.  Of course that does hurt her credibility.  I guess I&#39;ve seen enough video of her speaking to believe that she really does want to do the right thing, that she&#39;s not really in it for the money like some others are, she genuinely cares; or at least she appears that way to me.</p>

<p>Anyways, cheers to the discussion.</p>

<p>No. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a list of all supposed &quot;suspicious circumstances and flaws&quot; regarding 9/11. You&#39;re trying to turn it into a discussion about freefall because you have poor reading comprehension and can&#39;t bring yourself to admit that you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but in the video you can watch, repeatedly, the building fall into its own footprint as perfectly as you can imagine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I can&#39;t. It&#39;s too far away and to blurry to make any decision on whether or not it fell exactly into its own footprint. You can&#39;t see much below the 29th floor, over 600 feet above the ground. You can&#39;t see the footprint <em>at all</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In any case the video shows clearly that Building 7 fell due to controlled demolition</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. It attempts to demonstrate (perhaps correctly, I haven&#39;t checked the data) that building 7 was in freefall. I does not provide enough evidence to definitively prove that it was demolished (for example, where are the demolition charges, who planted them, and when?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some highlights from the norad tapes</p>

<ul>
<li><p>NORAD Exercises: Simply, the mention of exercises during the day debunks the myth that the gov&#39;t had no idea that they were planning something like this.  They were well aware of the threats, and they were keeping the FAA and other agencies pretty busy that morning with fake stuff that led them away from the &quot;real world&quot; actions taking place.  They aren&#39;t innocent by any means, and this proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt.  They refer to &quot;falcon&quot; repeatdly, and eventually bring down the training planes, but not until they confused the hell out of the operators.</p></li>
<li><p>The reports of the first plane: The initial reports were that either a bomb or a smaller aircraft (737) had hit the WTC, instead of American 11.  American 11 was tracked after the hit, so why wasn&#39;t a better effort made to find out what really hit WTC 1?  This would also explain why the first building collaped after the second tower...which was hit hours later.  The plane was lighter, so the stress wasn&#39;t as great?  Or...did bombs in the basement still bring those buildings down?  The whole WTC is fishy.  WTC 7 flat-out-stinks...but that&#39;s another story.  But, why were these people seeing this for the first time on CNN anyways?  How did these attacks surprise them?  Aren&#39;t they supposed to know where planes are?  They could all see Flight 11 on radar even after it had supposedly hit...were they all wrong?</p></li>
<li><p>Phantom Flight 11: American 11 (the first plane) was tracked for about 20 minutes after it hit the WTC, they were still tracking it when someone saw on TV that the towers had been hit.  The people tracking it had lat/longs, tail numbers, radar...and were very confident of what they were tracking, all after the first plane hit the WTC.  They were confident that something else hit the WTC, perhaps a 737?  Was there a switch with one of the planes used in the exercises?  What happened to Flight 11?  Why did they give up on Flight 11?  Was it because of Delta 1989?  Why do they all claim it was a 737, and not a 767?  Why was Langley so interested in Flight 11?</p></li>
<li><p>Delta Flight 1989 (89): This plane was picked up shortly after a very ominious-sounding voice from Langley talked to one of the controllers about getting info on the phantom Flight 11.  All resources seem to be diverted to this &quot;special&quot; target...until it was suddenly switched to &quot;friendly&quot; after a good deal of wasted time, with nobody&#39;s approval.  This plane landed in Cleveland.  Is this why Cleveland Airport was evacuated?  They said it was a &quot;friendly&quot;, but they evacuated the airport...and reports say that two flights landed there and were escorted into a NASA hangar.  Were these the actual planes in the &quot;official&quot; story being landed and hidden?  Was the airport evacuated to make room for these planes?  What ended up happening to this plane?  Why were people so wrong about it?  Was it just a diversion to take people off of Flight 11?</p></li>
<li><p>Flight 93:  When this flight was first picked up, there were reports of a bomb onboard.  All further mention of this plane on the tapes was linked to talk about the bomb on board.  It was reported &quot;down&quot; northeast of Camp David, not in Pennsylvania.  Eyewitnesses on 9/11 say that there was a fire emergency in the federal land north of Camp David, but that the public was not able to get near enough to see what had happened.  Eyewitnesses near the &quot;official&quot; crash site reported seeing very little debris, and not really much that would even suggest that a plane had crashed.  Is this hidden site near Camp David the real resting place of Flight 93?  Was the &quot;Let&#39;s Roll&quot; speech fake?  Was there a bomb on board?  Is there another crash site?</p></li>
<li><p>Boston Military: Colin Scoggins from Boston had some of the consistently best intelligence through the whole operation.  The female operator (who I don&#39;t know the name of) at the FCC was relying heavily on him for information, and wasn&#39;t getting any from anywhere else.  Scoggins was also tracking the phantom Flight 11, and was one of the go-to guys during the early stages of the day for decent intel.  He seemed to know what was happening, and seemed very calm and informed.  She was often frustrated with the people in Washington she was speaking to, and actually asked someone from New York Central to talk some sense into the Washington people, because the only good information she was getting was coming from Boston.  She felt that she wasn&#39;t being taken seriously, and that sentiment was echoed by others in the center.  The Boston Center was shut down due to a terror threat.  Was this to keep them from chasing down the info they were working, which seemed to be the best intel anyone had?  Was this part of the plan?  Find the people with the most information and take them out.  Is that the real reason Boston shut down?  They knew too much?</p></li>
<li><p>Friendlies &amp; Frustration: The controllers were so busy with &#39;friendlies&#39; that they were led away from the Phantom 11 for the most critical part of the operation.  When they lost the signal, got it back and lost it again, they were pulled away to a number of false-friendlies, and the controllers were even saying &quot;Get these friendlies out of my face&quot;.  They wanted to find the bad guys, but were being led around by people who wanted them to chase real ghosts.  The plane in Cleveland was an example of that, and this all proves that there were many exercises going on that morning.  The operators faced nothing but confusion when speaking with Washington, and frustration was rampant when it became realized that this was all &quot;real world&quot; and not an exercise.  When they finally grounded all of the training exercises, is it possible that the real-world planes got put into that pile and were erased off the board in the confusion?</p></li>
<li><p>The Pentagon: There was very little mention made of the Pentagon until they saw it on CNN.  They were tracking the Phantom 11 towards Washington, but they weren&#39;t tracking much...except for Flight 77, which they tracked briefly moving AWAY from Washington.  The attack took them by complete surprise, and you would have thought they should have been able to have followed that one in...<strong>Cheney and Mineta proved that theory wrong by tracking a bogey coming in from miles away.  How did they know about it for so long when the FAA and NORAD didn&#39;t?</strong>  They theorized that Flight 77 could have been the plane, but they can&#39;t prove it in the mess.</p></li>

<p>Because the report is on the attack on the Twin Towers. It&#39;s outside of the report&#39;s remit. Does it discuss any of the other WTC buildings other than WTC1 and 2?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and then there is the fascinating story of Egyptian Ali Muhammed, only tangentially related but thoroughly interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>He was a part of the fundamentalist military unit that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">In 1984, he was hired by the CIA</a>, though they claim that their relationship was short-lived. He would soon join the military and become a member of the Green Berets, and serve as a drill sergeant at Fort Bragg while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Abouhalima">providing clandestine training to jihadists such as Mahmud Abaouhalima</a>, convicted perpetrator of the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">He would take a short leave from his military duties and travel to Afghanistan in 1988 to assist the Mujahideen</a>, returning just months later.</p>

<p>In the early 1990&#39;s he would return to Afghanistan and began training jihadists with the skills he had learned at Fort Bragg. According to former FBI special agent <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html">Jack Cloonan, in an interview with PBS</a>, his first training session included Osama bin Laden, as well as Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of Al Qaeda.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Sacred-Terror-Radical/dp/0812969847">Former Directors of Counter-terrorism at the National Security Council have alleged</a> that Muhammed took maps and training materials from Fort Bragg and used them to write the Al Qaeda terrorist training manual.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2009/11/29/fort-hood-the-ksm-trial-part-i-what-do-these-terrorism-stories-have-in-common/">His superior at Fort Bragg, Lt. Col. Robert Anderson, has stated that</a> “I think you or I would have a better chance of winning the Powerball lottery, than an Egyptian major in the unit that assassinated Sadat would have getting a visa, getting to California, getting into the Army and getting assigned to a Special Forces unit. That just doesn’t happen.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Al-Qaeda-terrorist-worked-with-FBI-Ex-Silicon-2861719.php#page-2">Elsewhere he stated that</a> &quot;It was unthinkable that an ordinary American GI would go unpunished after fighting in a foreign war,&quot; and that he assumed that Muhammed was sponsored by the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be glad to answer you, and I&#39;ll take the opportunity to tell a little bit more about that buildings and the U.S. embassy two blocks away.</p>

<p>First of all, these buildings are old, they were built in 1984 I think. They were highly damaged during the Yugoslavian war in 1990s. (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/UNIS_towers_may_1996.png">here&#39;s the picture of the tower after the battle for Sarajevo was over</a>, <a href="http://www.e-novine.com/files.php?file=photo/region/BiH/sarajevo/momo_i_uzeir/Momo_i_Uzeir_02_t_722837327.jpg">another one</a> and <a href="http://www.e-novine.com/thumbnail.php?file=photo/region/BiH/sarajevo/momo_i_uzeir/Momo_i_Uzeir_01_u_310955959.jpg&amp;amp;size=article_large&amp;amp;scale_by=width">another one</a>). The buildings were built ten years after the World Trade Center, using World Trade Center as a model. There was even a fire in one of the towers during the war, but the buildings survived without collapsing. The American embassy was built after the battle for the Sarajevo. The war was still going strong. The year was 1994. Obviusly the Americans were impressed that the building survived.</p>

<p>Wikipedia says that the American intelligence analysts became concerned that Arab immigrants in Bosnia and Herzegovina planned to attack the US Embassy in Sarajevo just after 9/11, and, as a part of that attack, crash into those towers. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States%2C_Sarajevo">source</a>). As I&#39;ve pointed out in my previous post, there are evidences that the FBI agents inspected those towers, but not after the 9/11, <strong>before</strong>. And not once, a couple of times, last inspection was on the September 1st, ten days before planes crashed into WTC. Six men were even arrested because they were &quot;connected to AlQuaida and planned that attack&quot;. Of course, there were no evidences, US admitted that and they were released from Guantanamo in 2008. So, they&#39;ve spent seven years in Guantanamo for nothing. The story was not covered by the mainstream media.</p>

<p>In 2011., there was a minor &quot;terrorist attack&quot; on the U.S. embassy (<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2012/individual-indicted-in-connection-with-machine-gun-attack-on-u.s.-embassy-in-bosnia-herzegovina-in-2011">here&#39;s the report from the FBI</a>], basically nothing more than one guy with a machine gun and he didn&#39;t manage to kill nobody. Funny thing is he just walked inside the embassy. Through the main gate. With a shotgun. Nothing suspicious at all. Nobody even tried to stop him. During the trial, he said that he did that because the U.S. planted the bomb in the infrastructure of those two towers during the war. According to him, the bombs were planted while the towers were reconstructed (so between 1994 and 1998). The bomb was never found, nobody even looked for them. Ever. And he had some evidences to support that claim, but still... nothing. According to AlJazeera Balkan, that was nothing more than a &quot;propaganda&quot;. The rest of the media just followed what AlJazeera reported. He&#39;s serving 10 years in prison here in Bosnia now. Nine to go.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much all I know. So I have to say that in my opinion these two towers are VERY much connected to the 9/11.</p>

According to this article from 2002, Cheney authorized the shoot down of the Shanksville flight while military personnel were tracking it: fter the planes struck the twin towers, a third took a chunk out of the Pentagon. Cheney then heard a report that a plane over Pennsylvania was heading for Washington. A military assistant asked Cheney twice for authority to shoot it down.

<p>I think it is natural, to an extent. But I don&#39;t think that means it&#39;s unchangeable or inevitable. hierarchies tend to exacerbate this and working to undo hierarchies and replace them with horizontal structures would hopefully do a lot to overcome it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s free copies of the book online. Ruppert spends most of the book running through the evidence and keeping conjecture to himself. In the final chapter he gives a succint version of his opinion of what happened and who was running the show (spoiler alert: cheney et al + elements of other governments). Crossing the Rubicon is the most well researched book on this topic I have come across. His chapter on PROMIS software is more relevant now then when the book came out due to recent NSA drama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Various parties. If there was one guy that you could put in jail over all others, going by the evidence presented in the book: Dick Cheney. It&#39;s quite complicated to place real blame, as massive portions of it were obviously heavily compartmentalised, but there are a few specific names that come out as being the guys you&#39;d want sat in orange jumpsuits in a courtroom. PNAC would be the group that you&#39;d probably focus most attention on if you were looking for a group of people who would likely have actually discussed this between themselves. Ruppert called them a &quot;government in waiting&quot;. And someone made sure they were &quot;waiting&quot;, and not &quot;hoping&quot;. But again, the blame doesn&#39;t stop there.</p>

<p>Yes, the Israelis (Mossad), had involvement, but as far as this book goes, the involvement was fairly minimal. From what i recall (i need to read it again at some point), the suspicion is that those agents inside the US were basically keeping an eye on the hijackers. I don&#39;t want to say any more than that, as my memory sucks and i&#39;ll probably get something wrong, but there was a motive for the surveillance - i&#39;d have to go back to the book to give you any more details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure where the criticism of her credibility here is?</p>

<p>Is it the self published book?  I&#39;m willing to bet many publishers would not touch her given the ongoing litigation.</p>

<p>Is it the fact that she only had 6 months experience at the FBI?  She was recruited by them specifically because of her language skills.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I cannot see anything based on what you wrote which is a valid criticism of her legitimacy.</p>

<p>Also very interesting--have you heard about the Gomel Chesed Cemetery incident? A Jewish man, months before 9/11, watched a meet-up in the cemetery while hiding. The people talked (in Hebrew) about how America would cave to Israeli demands &quot;once the twins were destroyed in September.&quot;</p>

<p>He tried to alert the FBI (IIRC) three times and was dismissed as a crackpot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edmonds is treated as an oracle of government secrets &amp; her analysis is almost universally praised in alternative media when her credentials do not merit or validate her expertise.</p>

<p>One MAJOR point that what is consistently missed by the hype and fawning over her is that she blew the whistle on the FBI&#39;s abysmal internal investigation practices related to handling one employee&#39;s concerns about another employee. </p>

<p>While she should be commended for being the catalyst for the FBI reforming these practices. However, her actions were not privy to or revealing of anything that would provide her with unique, specific information on 9-11 which is what she claims.</p>

<p>Considering her entire professional career experience prior to her six months with the FBI was: volunteering at a local courthouse as a special advocate for children and volunteering for the Rostropovich foundation; and by examining her duties while with the FBI it is clear that she lacked access to the information she claims and that she did NOT blow the whistle on anything related to 9/11 as she claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you are correct, she did not blow the whistle on anything 9/11 related, except to say that she had seen some suspicious documents while doing translating.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t like her, that&#39;s ok, I think she&#39;s ok, that should be ok too.</p>

<p>As far as her credentials:  In the aftermath of 9/11 the security state shifted gears and went into overdrive.  They were hiring all over the place.  She happened to be fluent in the languages they required, therefore qualified for the job.  She was not an analyst, she was not a field agent, she was employed simply to translate.  While she was doing this she may or may not have seen some shady stuff regarding 9/11.  </p>

<p>What I can tell you is that the foreign languages division is near <em>always</em> the most sensitive department of an intelligence organization, it has a huge potential for abuse (read: falsifying information/manipulating translations)  It would not surprise me if she had seen a lot of different things there that would shock anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, it wouldn&#39;t really surprise me if she did embellish here and there.  Of course that does hurt her credibility.  I guess I&#39;ve seen enough video of her speaking to believe that she really does want to do the right thing, that she&#39;s not really in it for the money like some others are, she genuinely cares; or at least she appears that way to me.</p>

<p>Anyways, cheers to the discussion.</p>
