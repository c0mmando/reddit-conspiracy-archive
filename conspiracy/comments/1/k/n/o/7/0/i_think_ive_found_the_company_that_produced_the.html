        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve held onto this story for a while. I was hoping someone else would stumble upon it. The events leading up to my discovery kinda had me a bit shook up. However, seeing as no one has yet picked up on it, and how little of a chance of it spreading from this point, I figure it can&#39;t hurt to let it out now. I was very worried that I had overstepped Occam&#39;s Razor, that I was imagining that someone was leaving my breadcrumbs. Whether this is the case or not, it doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is what I found.</p>

<p>The company I am talking about is Nexidia. <a href="http://www.nexidia.com/">Here</a> is their homepage. </p>

<p>This all started when one night I got a strange text message. The number that it had originated from was one digit away from my phone number. It wasn&#39;t apart of my family plan. If my phone number was XXX-XXX-XXX1, this one was XXX-XXX-XXX2. </p>

<p>The content of this message was &quot;3217walit road 19114&quot;. Now, I had been getting strange wrong number calls every once in a while, and it kinda bothered me, so I decided to google the content of the message. You&#39;re welcome to do so yourself.</p>

<p>However, when I modified the message to &quot;3217 walit road 19114&quot; (notice the space) I happened upon an interesting website. Only one of the results I&#39;m talking about now shows up on the first page of results, but there were originally 3, all from the same site, and the only results. Three total results for a google search doesn&#39;t happen often.</p>

<p><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/master/sgp/sgpsas/1918/191806/19180621/07.pro">http://memory.loc.gov/master/sgp/sgpsas/1918/191806/19180621/07.pro</a></p>

<p>These appear to be hidden locations within the Library of Congress website. Files located on their server. Each one is a string of numbers, with very jumbled words interspersed throughout. Picking through them, you will see that they are issues of Stars and Stripes, the military&#39;s internal newspaper, from World War 1. Also, you&#39;ll notice certain keywords present in each document, such as &quot;bomb&quot; or &quot;explosion&quot;.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you will see that these are .pro files. What the heck is the .pro extension? A little google fu brought me to a program called Fast Talk. </p>

<p>Fast Talk is speech to text conversion software. However, instead of the program listening to a recording and picking out phonemes, Fast Talk makes an estimation of what the word most likely is, thus making the program much much faster at transcribing, to the point of being able to simultaneously transcribe thousands of calls at once.</p>

<p>Who makes Fast Talk? Nexidia. </p>

<p>Nexidia has contracts with a lot of companies that have to do customer service calls. Being able to transcribe those calls and pick through common phrases is great for speeding up problem solving. </p>

<p>The big thing is that Nexidia has contracts with the Department of Justice and the US military.</p>

<p>Furthermore, look at their board of directors and see if something doesn&#39;t stick out to you. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nexidia.com/nexidia/about_us/board_and_management/board_members">http://www.nexidia.com/nexidia/about_us/board_and_management/board_members</a></p>

<p>Another thing to note is that Nexidia started as a military contractor before going commercial. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you guys pick through this. I&#39;m sure there are more connections to be made here. Like why was a written article made into a speech to text conversion file? Is there more to Fast Talk than just vocal transliteration? Also, not just who the board members are, but who they represent, their ties to other organizations.</p>

<p>The point is, when Obama said no one was <em>LISTENING</em> to your calls, he was right. They aren&#39;t listening, they&#39;re reading.</p>

<p>EDIT: Alright, I&#39;m seeing people getting....evasive, or trying to sidetrack the conversation. </p>

<p>However I stumbled upon the data is irrelevant.  I just posted it as a kind of chain of evidence. PrimeOCR is likely the program used in the files, but Fast Talk is the one that caught my eye, and the jumbled words made me think of speech to text translation, so it wasn&#39;t a huge mental leap.</p>

<p>I fully admit to questioning if I pushed conclusions too far, but the end of the rabbit hole bore fruit.</p>

<p>As for who I am, I&#39;m no one special. Just another unemployed bum. IF (big if) this was a breadcrumb trail, the only reasons I can think that someone picked me out was from my time in Anonymous, where I headed up many discussions of ways to be a cyber activist without hacking, or it was my paper on Operation Earnest Voice, the military&#39;s sock puppet program.</p>

<p>If we are using strict logic and facts, ignore my chain of investigation. What I found at the end of it cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>Today, a large percentage of the world&#39;s voice traffic is recorded for security purposes and most of it is manually monitored by analysts and linguists. This complex process- translating, transcribing, and searching through vast amounts of communications- not only costs precious time, money, and resources, but can also lead to an increased chance of missing critical information that could have been identified as a significant threat.</p>

<p>Nexidia automates the search process, increases operator efficiency and provides targeted listening - all with minimal impact to your agency&#39;s current workflow.  The result is faster, better analysis that enables superior threat detection and response.</p>

<p>Nexidia is the leading provider of phonetic speech technology solutions to agencies including the U.S. Department of Defense, intelligence gathering organizations and Federal and State Law Enforcement agencies. Nexidia&#39;s advanced technology quickly process large sets of audio files by identifying phoneme patterns, the smallest units of speech.  This makes it possible to identify the most critical intelligence in seconds, rather than hours or days – aiding in the mission to immediately identify and prioritize threats and topics of interest. By enabling agencies to analyze large amounts of recorded audio/video data often in multiple languages at unprecedented speeds, Nexidia helps win the battle against information overload.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Niloo&#39;s page it shows her affiliation with Endgame. Her link with both Paladin and Endgame is kinda big. Her and Minihan serve on both boards. Endgame is basically a cyber-warfare arms dealer.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t see Endgame&#39;s client list, but I wouldn&#39;t put it past them if they were selling shit to the Chinese or Iranians. I fully accept that I am just conjecturing though. If we could get a hand on that client list, that would be some damning material, and could possibly be something to show the public the dangers of the revolving doors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, you&#39;re probably right. It&#39;s just always been the best business move for arms dealers to sell to both sides. </p>

<p>The whole concept of Endgame bothers me. I mean, if this is a private company selling Zero Day exploits all over the place, where is the operational security? If all of your friends have the same toys, and those toys are just easily copied software, how do you make sure it doesn&#39;t slip out?</p>

<p>Each of those .pro files has a matching PDF file. For example,<br/>
<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/master/sgp/sgpsas/1918/191806/19180621/07.pro">http://memory.loc.gov/master/sgp/sgpsas/1918/191806/19180621/07.pro</a><br/>
and<br/>
<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/service/sgp/sgpsas/1918/191806/19180621/07.pdf">http://memory.loc.gov/service/sgp/sgpsas/1918/191806/19180621/07.pdf</a></p>

<p>In that 07.pro file, the word &quot;walit&quot; is in this paragraph:</p>

<pre><code>It is a long, narrow trough of stone
iln Ia big sst alhe, at oe oe e   wlich
tile horse is introduced  and, stepping
of&#39;, is l)lrlugedi l into a mixitlre of acids

cliains while lhe is going througlh, anld, in-

</code></pre>

<p>that comes from a paragraph in the 4th column of the newspaper page, a
little below the heading &quot;Ready for the Next Batch&quot;:</p>

<pre><code>  It is a long, narrow trough of stone
in a big stable, at one end of which
the horse is introduced and, stepping
off, is plunged into a mixture of acids
and things that is good for what ails
the equine pelt.  The thing is so deep
that the horse can&#39;t touch bottom, but
is help up on either side by ropes and

swimming.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but then he makes some kind of illogical leap and implies they are .pro files from some speech to text program. And that they are transcribed phone calls, which is completely false and not what the files are. Why would you use speech to text on a image of a newspaper?</p>

<p>How do you jump from OCR of a WW1 newspaper to transcribing phone calls?</p>

<p>He also says they are hidden, when they are cataloged on google. You can browse right to them from the LOC website and get the source tif and the .pro file.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To permit text searching, the images were processed with PrimeOCR optical-character-recognition software. Settings allowed automatic zoning to recognize columns and ignore pictorial elements containing no text. Each character was analyzed by six OCR algorithms, and PrimeOCR&#39;s Lexical Check was employed. Output was in the form of PrimeOCR&#39;s proprietary &quot;.pro&quot; format, which included the text gleaned from the images, along with information about each character&#39;s location and confidence level. One file was created for each page image. The information in the separate files was merged into one large file in a batch process to make it more efficiently searchable. A keyword search in American Memory or a search within the Stars and Stripes collection will first access the textual information. Once a specific record is selected for display, the character-location information is accessed, highlighting the location of the best match on the page.

    <div class="md"><p>upon googling &quot;nexidia nsa&quot; I found a link to this article from 2007 <a href="http://cernigsnewshog.blogspot.com/2007/08/yes-its-surveillance-state.html">http://cernigsnewshog.blogspot.com/2007/08/yes-its-surveillance-state.html</a> which includes an email from a whistleblower confirming this and  elaborating on the nsa program</p>

<p>&quot;You should be aware that various Bush officials are lying or misdirecting the public when they say that none of their domestic suveillance programs includes widespread data-mining.</p>

<p>CIA director Stephen Hadley has said &quot;it is not a driftnet&quot; and John Negroponte has said the NSA was &quot;absolutely not&quot; monitoring domestic calls (link). Both are lying.</p>

<p>Domestic surveillance isn&#39;t just about call logs and although the calls themselves aren&#39;t sifted, recordings of those calls are. Despite the claims of NSA Director McConnell, the programs run by the NSA are neither surgical (link) nor &quot;limited to 100 wiretaps&quot; (link). Certain aspects of the NSA programs may be as they describe them, but they aren&#39;t describing the whole thing.</p>

<p>A company called Nexidia, developed the software used by NSA and offers a commercial version to call center companies. Nexidia admits in it&#39;s in-person pitch to those call centers (but not on its website) that it provided the NSA software. On its website it simply says - during a promo video - that &quot;Nexidia is also used in the government marketplace.&quot; Watch the video for yourself. Those words are at the end between 1:35 and 1:40.</p>

<p>Nexidia&#39;s software basically takes recorded audio and indexes it the way Google does text on a page. Type in your search string, wait a while for the database search to compile, and all the calls with that instance come up with the audio passage itself marked. You can isolate every instance of &quot;ass hole&quot; and &quot;damn you&quot; and &quot;shut the hell up&quot;, for example. When used by the NSA on recorded phone calls, that constitutes data-mining and a &quot;driftnet&quot; approach, to my view. These officials need to be exposed as the liars they are.</p>

<p>Gen. Hayden and the rest are lying to the public. They talk as if these &quot;alleged keyword searches&quot; are some fantasy, pie-in-the-sky approach to data mining, when in fact they are publicly available technologies that corporations are already using. This is not about the people at Nexidia who have developed this technology nor the call centers using it for legal commercial purposes. It may even be true that being able to audit large swaths of audio recordings for particular keywords, when such auditing is done within the law, can be a powerful tool to help protect the people of the United States from threats like terrorism.</p>

<p>This is strictly about administration officials&#39; treatment of this technology. It is not fanciful, it is not myth, and it is not some dreamland of computer technology. It is in use today and has been used by NSA. It may still be in use by NSA. When NSA threatens action against the nation&#39;s largest cellular telephone providers unless they provide data, and technology such as Nexidia&#39;s software is in use by them, the public has a right to know about the ease with which their government can listen in on their personal communications.&quot;</p>

<p>Boom.  That&#39;s a <em>biiiig</em> fucking deal right there, man.  A <em>big</em> deal.  Like you said, it&#39;s basically Google for people&#39;s conversations.  This takes data mining to the next, NEXT level.</p>

<p>In Lt. Gen. (Ret.)

<p>The program is apparently some sort of vetting process by which certain technologies and are approved for government use.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for this. This is probably what makes this story even bigger.</p>

<p>We have Minihan, who ducks out of the NSA and heads up an investment firm to start up cybersecurity companies, and having previously had a say in which programs get recommended, his word is probably still listened to.</p>

<p>So this guy basically creates companies, recommends them to the government, and then has private companies in his pocket to give them the green light. </p>

<p>Minihan is at the center of what is looking to be a money making machine. </p>

<p>I&#39;d go so far as to say that this guy looks like the J. Edgar Hoover of the cybersecurity industry. We can trace the genesis of a lot of this back to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I responded to this in the edit, but just to make sure you see it...</p>

<p>I&#39;m nobody. An average unemployed internet junkie. IF (big if) this was some kind of breadcrumb trail, I could only think of two reasons why someone would pick me.</p>

<p>1) I spent some time with Anonymous. Never did anything illegal, wasn&#39;t any of the big shots there, but I did lead some pretty deep discussions about how to be an internet activist without being a hacker. After Sabu was shown to be a mole for the FBI, I helped introduce the idea of everyone treating everyone as an FBI agent until they could prove otherwise, thus making sure no one left loose ends to get caught. I have no proof, but there were many people attempting to gain my trust or lure me into cybersex or onto their game servers in an attempt to gain my IP address. Hackers being hackers, it&#39;s safer to assume that someone was just trying to dox me for fun, but after Sabu, everything changed. I got out.</p>

<p>2) I wrote an extensive paper on Operation Earnest Voice for a Political Science class. No big deal, but it&#39;s something that&#39;s been under the radar for a while. It&#39;s the military&#39;s psychological warfare internet sock puppet operation. Now that the Smith-Mundt act has been negated by the NDAA 2013, you can bet its in full affect against the American people. I did a presentation on it, only to find out that one of my classmates worked for DHS and was getting her masters to get a better position. So I kinda outed both of these facts to the DHS.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten a reputation for not making up theories, but connecting dots. But I doubt I was someone&#39;s personal wikileaks. The only thing astounding about my digging is where it ended up, not how I came upon it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sort of. We know Paladin is the group behind both companies, and many others as well.</p>

<p>Endgame also has links with Palantir and HBGary, subjects of the Stratfor leak.</p>

<p>If you look at the Stratfor leaks, there is talk of this sort of consortium between all these cybersecurity companies. Working on shared projects, pacts to not poach customers and the like.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the kind of links I&#39;m looking for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, aren&#39;t they all selling to the government? It&#39;s a mutual best interest automatically just because of the budget. And what they sell are spy-warez, which only governments buy. Are you asking if they are organized instead of independent competitors? And if they are, what does that mean?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it like this. </p>

<p>The former director of the NSA invests heavily in a company, then goes back to the NSA and says &quot;psssst, go with these guys, you know I&#39;m good at picking winners&quot;. NSA picks the company, the company gets a lucrative contract, their stock shoots up, and the former director of the NSA gets a nice fat dividend check.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like insider trading and no bid contracts combined with an oligopoly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a bunch of bullshit, sir.
Google search results happend because that file is full of numbers, misspelled words, and each one of your word happens to be inside that file.</p>

<p>You know, searching random words often leads you to dictionary files...</p>

<p>try google &quot;48326 random numbers 48663&quot; and please make another post on what interpretation you can draw; i&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll find a cool story, bro.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm. Interesting that it doesn&#39;t list Minihan as Principal and Director like Businessweek.com says. </p>

<p>The page you provided shows it was last edited on 7/29. Does this mean that Minihan is no longer with Paladin, or is the page in error? Has someone edited him out? </p>
