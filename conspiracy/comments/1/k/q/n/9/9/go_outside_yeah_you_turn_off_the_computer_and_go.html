       You speak truth. And get off the phones too! I hate it. Everyone's obessed with it and forget to enjoy boredom haha. People don't just sit and wait anymore and look at the cracks in the wall or people watch. Instead they just are distracted all the time because we have pocket computers basically.

       Yeah. That's another aspect that annoys me. No community in America, for the most part. We are scared of strangers and you are a weirdo if you try to make conversation with a stranger.  No wonder why there's so many lonely people. I've talked to a lot of troubled people and majority of them are just simply lonely. All I've done is just talk to them and gave them my time and their depression started to subside. I call that invisible suffering.

       Yes, that definitely flared up this type of thinking.  I also think it's just what we are taught because America is all about the I, the individual. That's the driving force of capitalism. America is all about doing things to better your own situation. The independent, the free, yadda yadda. Not so much about what can we do to better everyone, human kind.  But I think that leads to loneliness and depression. There's a lot of poor regions in the world who are still happy because they have such community and human connection.

       Wasn't quite this bad when I lived in the south (except the 'civilized' big cities). But here up north Im definitely a crackpot for starting a conversation with a stranger. And heaven forbid its a member of the opposite sex. Deer in headlights waiting for the bullet look.

       Yes, displaced Southern in New England here! People don't make eye contact as much here. They also like, never move out of their birth zip code. (I mean, I think it's wonderful one of my friends lives in the home his grandfather built, in the country.) But families will rent a house even, FOR DECADES.

       As someone who's hobby and vocation is talking to strangers, the thing I find most interesting is that people will mean mug you and avoid you,
       <em>
        right up until
       </em>
       you smile and talk to them. You're right, everyone is lonely. Acknowledging someone can make their entire day.

       You're right. People tend to want to fix the world and the government. Which is cool.  But I think we need a big revolution on a more personal level too. Everyone needs to start doing random acts of kindness, be kind to strangers, really give your time to people. Friends, family, neighbors, strangers.  We live in a society where people rather pay extra money to save their time. So instead lets use our time to make others less lonely. It's pretty crazy what a nice comment can do for a person.

       I started talking to a family (mom, dad, 2 kids) while we were waiting in line the other day. Casually, no big deal, I was just trying to be friendly, killing some time before the line moved... and one of the kids says "Who is that, mommy?" She says "I don't know" and then crickets... they made it so awkward that a stranger would actually speak to them. So Strange.

       This is one of the main reasons that I still have a basic phone only for calling and texting. My friend's give me a hard, but jokingly, time for living in the stone age. I have considered getting a pocket computer, but my life is just fine without the extra convenience. Additionally, having everything at your fingertips takes the fun out of working for your information.

       Also those simple phones don't have GPS so they don't get a second by second, meter by meter readout of everywhere that you go.  They can still triangulate you pretty easy but its not something that they are always contantly doing and the accuracy is quite a bit less.

       Hey thanks. I have Lyme disease, mold toxicity, and co-infections. Been sick for 10 years and I'm only 21 years old bleh . If you want to really talk about some conspiracy stuff, really research lyme. We are so prejudiced against, the CDC doesn't want to recognize us. CDC finally admitted that the 30,000 a year is false and it's really over 300,000 people a year getting infected. But even with antibiotic treatment, we are still sick and there is no protocol or recognition for us.  It's really crazy. I want to make a video breaking down the controversy behind it. So many are suffering. Thanks for that though!

       <em>

       hated waiting. Gawd, counting ceiling tiles or floor tiles... trying to remember lyrics.. hell with that. We had our own distractions though. We had etch-a-sketch and Mattel electronic games, and books! The distractions changed just changed is all.

       Well yeah. You have a point, but it's a lot worse now. I'm not sure if you've seen it, but I to a diner. You will always see groups of people, not talking to each other, and just on their phones. Technology is making social interaction obsolete pretty much. It's bizarre. We are in a time of such excess.

       It'll change. For better or worse, who knows, but it will change. The current societal norms we live under are untenable.  That said, I wouldn't worry too much about it. People conversing (like us) on Reddit is a tried and true social interaction. Lots of us have day jobs, friends, family that we spend time with. Don't worry too much about people who spend time on the internet. Worry about the ones playing Angry Birds all day and then going home to watch TV.

       If the Bible is translated correctly, that's what it says was the point of the human race to begin with. You should read it some time, a paraphrased Catholic Bible would be my recommendation if you were to try to translate it instead of reading the literal word.
      </p>

       Oh boy... Three dots, that means that you think I'm an idiot and that you believe that the tree of knowledge of good and evil is literally a tree. The irony of this soon to be argument is, is that translating the Bible is how I figured out that we were originally engineered to be a slave race. &lt;--- And that's where ya lost me.

       I don't think anyone is an idiot until they prove me wrong. I do the dots for shits and giggles. I know the bible to be nothing but stories, and going to that grade school only emboldened me to find other meanings to life. We are still slaves.

       I misjudged. And I agree, one should find their own meaning to life. Though I believe I've found the history of the human race in the Bible I find meaning in physics and nature.

       im lucky enough to be near a very "naturey" area. I go on long walks through some wooded area all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont forget, nature is mans natural habitat. Cars, roads, houses, TVs, all of it is unatural. Turn off the phone and leave it home and go for a walk. Look at the trees, the leaves, the insects, hear the birds and animals in the trees.  Everything you need to survive is litterally on the ground. its reached the point (for me at least) that im almost literally on a different planet in a different dimension. It really brings you back to reality, and reminds you that the world isnt different from 100, 500 or even 5000 years ago, theres just more stuff in it

       I went for a walk around town with a friend of mine last Saturday, and we stopped by several friends' houses. 
Everyone inside was either bored or depressed. Noticing the pattern, I ask my buddy,"Doesn't it seem like we're havin a better time out here on our walk than everyone else is inside?" "Yup.This is why I go on walkabouts."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, go outside more, kids. Walk around. See the world around you. The internet can wait.

       Well, except for Stronghold Kingdoms. That game was pretty unforgiving as far as missing a day or two goes. Come back and I have to rebuild my castle and my army due to AI raids. I gave up on the game eventually. Didn't have time for it.

       That is one of the reasons that I really enjoy European cities.  In L'viv I would walk around at night with a few different friends for a few hours at a time.  There were so many great buildings and it was much more casual then being on a tour.  Part of the thing about most area that I have lived in America is that there is just not much to see outside.  Often times the new houses are just two versions with a mirror image each.  Then the commercial centers are just large boxes with huge parking lots and that is about as inspiring as a root canal.  I think that often people don't go outside because there is nothing to see, no one to talk to and nothing worth pissing on.  In many areas walking is just a dull poor mans car.

       He can't hear you, he found a good solution and posted the message right before going back outside for a beer.

       It's how you take it, right Sir?  He's saying it not to be a dick....he's saying it because he cares and because he feels that like minded people on here (See: You and I) need to have a break once in a while!  Again, he says it because he cares.  If he didn't he would tell you to get your dick stuck in a electric mixer!

       C'mon.  We're all on the same team.  If you're not, then disregard!  If so, then there is one person out there who will be in better mental shape in order to tackle the issues we need tackled.  If he can get you and me to be in better shape, then there are two people better able to do so.  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're just in a bad mood.  I shrugged off one of these posts a long time ago and now.....I'm not there.  I'm going outside to sit and have drink, wait for the guy to fix my hot water tank.

       Keep it up man, you're not alone no matter how shitty you may think it is.  We're all here.  Typing away.......let's get through it......after this short break......

       The worst is walking on a college campus. I won't sit here and say I never get on my phone and always enjoy what's around me, but its sickening to see thousands of people my age walking around like mindless drones staring into their phones. Whenever I'm walking around somewhere or out to dinner with anyone I try to stay away from it as much as possible. Casual conversation with strangers has been destroyed with everyone constantly on phones. Can't tell you how many couples I've seen in restaurants staring at their phones the whole time.

       TL;DR = Man goes for evening walk.  Police stop and detain him because man's behavior is abnormal:  Nobody walks for no reason.  Man insists he is merely walking for reflection.  Police arrest and transport him to Psychiatric Detention.

       Went outside for a drive not too long after posting the above response.  Drove around, smelled the
       <del>
        fresh
       </del>
       air (Los Angeles..."fresh" shouldn't quite be the word that describes the air here), and continued with the long, meditative contemplations that I usually engage in throughout the day anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to regularly go on a "daily drive"...just to contemplate and think...not that I don't do that (contemplate) here in front of a computer, of course, but...it (going for drives) seems to regularly provide a different "contemplative/meditative" concentration of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       That can be beneficial often enough.

       Well...Driving seems to have been not a horrible way to help me sometimes sort my mind a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and I actually don't have a radio in my car.  Haven't had one in quite a while (as in years).  I've actually found this to be a shockingly - a surprising and
       <em>
        amazingly
       </em>
       - good thing.  Although most in the world absolutely
       <em>
        live
       </em>
       by a play list of songs - and although I don't
       <em>
        horribly
       </em>
       fault too many for this (as I used to be that very way myself) - I've found that the moment I killed/cut out/
       <em>
        drastically
       </em>
       reduced the music and songs I listen to in my life, I was able to focus and keep my mind much more clear and concentrated upon whatever it was I thought about.  It's been coming on ten years now since I started doing this and, like I said, I pretty much have cut a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       portion of the music/songs I listen to out of my life altogether...and it's actually been to a great extent for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you want to know what the craziest, most ironic and paradoxical thing about all this is?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm actually a
       <em>
        musician
       </em>
       . lol
      </p>
      <p>
       Go figure. :)

       I've been thinking about what you said but I just freaking love music. I sing and dance. In the car. By a camp fire by the river. All over my apartment. I don't know if I think less, but maybe that's why I love it, it "turns my brain down" a lil.

       Ha.  No I understand, man.  Totally.  Not only am I a musician, but I've played drums, keyboards, and have been the front man/lead vocalist for various bands for years...and this in many ways is/was my life's blood.  Again, I totally understand.  However, I'll also say that, in my life, the intense connection that I have had with much music - along with the emotional associations that have gone along with it - has made it
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       difficult for me to concentrate on things
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        independent
       </em>
       of music itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT is a problem - especially when the association is not a good or positive one that I can't "turn off", get rid of, or stop thinking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, our attachment to things often becomes a debilitating crutch if and when we become incapable of functioning properly
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       the thing in question, whatever that thing may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having the ability to still the mind independent of any distractions or attachments - musical or otherwise - can often help one achieve a much greater level of clarity and focus in their life, which in turn helps one develop mentally, spiritually, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attachment most of us have to music - an attachment that most of us are not even consciously aware that we even have in the first place - often makes it nearly impossible to achieve the level of stillness and (of utmost importance)
       <em>
        material non-attachment
       </em>
       necessary to develop one's mind, one's being, and one's spirit.

      <p>
       Yeah.  I understand.  Imagine a state, however, where you have enough control of your brain where, instead of "turning it down", you can actually blast it
       <em>
        up
       </em>
       at full volume on level 10/11 and
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       function properly - clearly, cogently, and in control...actually function even BETTER and in a heightened state of awareness and understanding.  And don't confuse this w/any sort of substance use/abuse.  That's actually all that is:
       <em>
        Abuse
       </em>
       , and that actually significantly
       <em>
        retards
       </em>
       one's growth, development and advancement - not the other way around - because it greatly diminishes and does away with one's ability to control, guide, and be
       <em>
        aware
       </em>
       of one's self and actions (a great part behind the whole point behind advancement and development in the first place).  Most of us have to find ways to, as you said, "turn our brains down" because we are not in proper control of everything that's going on in the world around us, and more often than not, that simply scares the hell out of us.  Music - among many other things - helps us, as you correctly implied, simply "shut down"...i.e. run away from our inability to properly function/control things in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Difficult as it is, and far from actual,
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       success as I very much still am, I've realized that I'd rather turn the light of scrutiny up on the nakedness of my insecurities and inabilities in the hopes of being able to better examine them and, hopefully, slowly but surely improve their failings, than to cast a dark shroud of distractions over them in the hopes that my being temporarily blind to their existence might make them permanently go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       They never do, however.  They never go away that way.  Matter of fact, the darkness just makes them stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I gotta shine the light on them.  Scary as it is, I gotta keep letting the light of undistracted (self) scrutiny shine in upon these issues and problems (significantly diminishing my dependence and attachment upon music being but one of various methods used) and the problems and failings will eventually all burn in the heat of ultimate self understanding.

       It certainly can be.  It (i.e. listening to some compositions) is an activity that can also be fraught with many pit falls if one does not develop the ability to use the (listening) process wisely, however.  It is easy for the process to end up being more of a detriment than a benefit, and for most it ends up being more of a crutch and an impediment to development than a boon - even if the individual themselves does realize it.

       I'm a huge outdoorsman. I love mountain biking, hiking with my dogs, canoeing, camping. I do feel more in touch with myself and my life as it relates to this planet. It's all amazing and beautiful and it is for these reasons I come back online, learn all I can, and do anything I can to fight the psychos who run shit. This place is too beautiful to let a few selfish, lying, control freaks ruin it for the rest of us.

       I have been planting shit, building fences, acquiring skills, I don't need to be told to go outside. I am an out doors man of this generation. I knew the boy scouts were bunk, I know how to dismantle a deer, and tell if it has wasting disease. I am set when the shit hits the fan, good luck to the rest of you....

       I not arrogant, I'm angry, that the chance for people to actually do this is dwindling, fast. It will be next to impossible for anyone in the next  generation to acquire land, so they can become such sufficient. You can't plant a garden in a 5x5 apartment. That is what they are collaring us towards. Illegal foreclosures, seizure of crops on farms for no reason, the banks have been scooping up land left and right. I'm angry that our parents let it happen. I'm angry at the propaganda machine that is still churning out peons.

       Or you can mind your own business and let people live their lives. Granted I have no problem with the outdoors, but as an introvert, sometimes the whole people thing is a painful experience. Its also amazing how many people on here hate the idea of one group or another conspiring to control our lives yet jump to say how others should live.

       The fact that you came here to comment about it just confirms that it's a new deal for you and yet you want to expound "wisdom" you've gained?

       He can't hear you, he found a good solution and posted the message right before going back outside for a beer.

      <p>
       It's how you take it, right Sir?  He's saying it not to be a dick....he's saying it because he cares and because he feels that like minded people on here (See: You and I) need to have a break once in a while!  Again, he says it because he cares.  If he didn't he would tell you to get your dick stuck in a electric mixer!

      <p>
       C'mon.  We're all on the same team.  If you're not, then disregard!  If so, then there is one person out there who will be in better mental shape in order to tackle the issues we need tackled.  If he can get you and me to be in better shape, then there are two people better able to do so.  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're just in a bad mood.  I shrugged off one of these posts a long time ago and now.....I'm not there.  I'm going outside to sit and have drink, wait for the guy to fix my hot water tank.
