       There are really two categories of "free energy" things that I really enjoy reading about. First, I love the
       <del>
        nutjobs
       </del>
       people who string together incoherent sentences with words like "zero point energy" and "magnetic monopoles" and usually want you to invest in their new technology. More realistically, I enjoy reading about "backyard" technology, like hydrolysis, wind power, possibly solar (not counting silicon-based solar cells). I came to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       because the latter category of "free energy" is something that could plausibly destroy the existing energy monopoly, and supplies a realistic motive to be kept secret by shady organizations and powerful people. It's all just really fun to read about.

       Actually, we understand the behavior of photons perfectly well. Quantum mechanics does a fine job of that, even if it's a probabilistic formulation of physics. And there's nothing at all in the "physical laws," whatever that means, to prevent steel from disintegrating. That's on a very different level from the concept of conservation of energy.

       From what I just googled, she's some kind of 9/11 conspiracy celebrity? I just don't feel like arguing about 9/11, since those types of discussions never go anywhere. On the other hand, I really enjoy talking about physics and energy and photons and whatnot. Why are you bringing up human powered helicopters and 9/11 anyway? I don't see the connection.

       Except that is a press release from the guys that made one. And then claim, in a press release mind you, that people have been saying it was impossible. I suspect if you had asked most scientists if it was impossible or not you would be met largely with apathy.

       That article was an interesting read, but was also horribly wrong. For example, to quote the article: "James Clark Maxwell developed [E&amp;M theory] 136 years ago in an exotic algebra known as quaternions. In order to render it more assimilable for use by working electrodynamicists, it was deliberately re-written in much simpler language by Oliver Heaviside (and Gibbs) in 1903. This simplification (and truncation) eliminated a whole subset of the equations including the scalar electromagnetics and the gravitational aspects that were contained in the original theory."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's not true at all. We still have Maxwell's original published work (you can even read it
       <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field">
        here
       </a>
       ) and he doesn't formulate it in terms of quaternions. And quaternions are regularly taught to undergraduate students today, it's not the obscure language that the author makes it out to be. The "re-written" equations are only re-worded in terms of modern vector notation, which is equipped to deal with multiple spatial dimensions at once (that's why there are fewer of them). There isn't any information lost in them compared to the original twenty. And as for gravitational waves in Maxwell's original paper? You can read the paper for yourself, that's easily verified as bullocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and a little further down: "A further impediment to the theoretical extraction of "free" energy was also imposed on what was left of Maxwell’s already diluted EM Theory by H.A. Lorentz around 1902. He simply arbitrarily threw away the monstrous amount of current outside the circuit that was not intercepted by the circuit, and that he could not theoretically account for."
       <em>
        That would be so easy to provide a citation
       </em>
       (if it were true). No citation =&gt; no credibility.

       Admittedly, I didn't read the entire website, but the first few pages were enough for me. Whoever wrote this is talking right out of his sphincter.

       "ECAT" has been proven to be a fraud. The assertion is that nickel-58 gets somehow magically combined with a free proton (hydrogen ion) to become copper-59. But copper-59 is unstable, with a half-life of just over a minute, and it decays into nickel-59 via positron emission. The "demonstrations" of the purported "ECAT" show that the product of the reaction is copper in naturally-occurring isotopic ratios, not nickel-59 at all. So it's a hoax. It doesn't actually do what it's claimed to do.

       Now this the kind of information I was looking for. This guy has a really snazzy website too. My only complaint is that it's more marketing than science. There are no control experiments to confirm that he's actually fusing Nickel and Hydrogen, and of course he can't disclose the "secret catalyst." Actually, he doesn't really give any experimental data other than the claim that he's fusing Hydrogen and Nickel. You know what they say about extraordinary claims and extraordinary evidence.

       to be fair it is probably vapourware, but i think it is worth watching as he is talking about actually selling a product. rather than selling "plans" over the internet. it is probably worth noting the name change from "cold fusion" to "Low Energy Nuclear Reactions" as well.

       There is likely not going to be free energy for the foreseeable future, at least 30 years out, though we may find "unlimited or self generating energy and have cheaper energy that todays.

       True, but those are the concepts that are really fun to read about. Seeing the first steps of these new technologies that might become viable in 100 years is fascinating. You sound pretty pessimistic about the prospect of easily accessible, cheap, renewable energy.

       You haven't convinced me that you're not joking. Einstein won the Nobel Prize for explaining the Photo-Electric effect, and his "Quantums" have been given a more modern name since then, namely photons. As in light. Einstein showed that light was quantized in little packets called photons. That's not debated by the scientific community in the slightest. And I have no idea what you mean by "this process," since all sorts of physical processes produce light (or Quantums, if you prefer misleading archaic terminology). And the FBI certainly won't shut you down in the interest of national security for studying magnetic fields and light.

        here it is, if you're curious
       </a>
       ) and it seems to be a scheme for improving the efficiency of a DC magnetic motor, not for power generation in its own right. I can't find any reasonable explanation for why the efficiency should be over 100%. Also, many of the websites I could find relating to the Bedini SG are trying to sell me something. That's always a red flag in my book. Do you have a good source for the physics behind the alleged over-unity efficiency?

       Now that's actually pretty cool. This is the kind of idea that I'm looking forward to seeing developed and distributed on a large scale in the near future. I saw something similar recently where somebody built a soccer ball with a magnetic generator built into it that would charge a battery during a soccer game (

       ). I don't know why this idea isn't already in production, since it seems simple and cheap enough to deploy all over the world. That's where I become a bit of a conspiracy theorist myself...

       The guy on the youtube channel 'off grid project' has been building and using them to recondition old batteries he seems to 'bring back from the dead'.

       You haven't convinced me that you're not joking. Einstein won the Nobel Prize for explaining the Photo-Electric effect, and his "Quantums" have been given a more modern name since then, namely photons. As in light. Einstein showed that light was quantized in little packets called photons. That's not debated by the scientific community in the slightest. And I have no idea what you mean by "this process," since all sorts of physical processes produce light (or Quantums, if you prefer misleading archaic terminology). And the FBI certainly won't shut you down in the interest of national security for studying magnetic fields and light.

       I'm not even going to try to argue with your original statement, since that sentence was an incomprehensible mess of pseudo-scientific jargon.

       do you have a link to this "proof"? i would be interested in seeing it. because e-cat does sound to good to be true, which does ring some alarms for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       i certainly don't have proof it works as stated, maybe it operates via a different mechanism, is the heat production worth studying?
