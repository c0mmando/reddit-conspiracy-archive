<p>For about the next three months from this coming Saturday 8/17/13 to about November or so, we are all going to be 100% dead unless we are part of the .0001% that took the necessary precautions against what this person claims is about to happen.</p>

<p>She says she used to work for the military and was privy to a LOT of secret information.  She says that we actually don&#39;t live in a <em>single</em> sun system.  This solar system is actually a <em>binary</em> system.  The second sun - in orbit around the sun we are familiar with - is a <del>red giant</del> brown dwarf (thanks for the reminder and correction, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1k41oa/according_to_this_person_we_are_all_going_to_die/cbl67y3">ForgedSanity</a>) that itself has an accompanying seven other planets revolving around it.  That particular <em>other</em> sun and its seven accompanying planets comes in very close proximity to &quot;our&quot; sun and our planets every few thousand years, and well...it&#39;s about that time again.</p>

<p>On one level I certainly hope she&#39;s wrong.  It&#39;s not because I have <em>any</em> fear whatsoever of death itself.  I&#39;m just not looking forward to the possibility of suffering immensely <em>on my way</em> to it.  I&#39;d rather it be nice and painless, and some of the things she describes might happen as this other sun and its seven accompanying planets begin coming in contact with our sun and our planets (and <em>colliding</em> with them as well as heavily influencing the gravitational field of Earth) does <em>not</em> sound good at all.  Some could write her off and say she&#39;s just a crazy kook, but she doesn&#39;t really sound like she&#39;s fucking around, trolling, or playing any sort of joke.</p>

<p>I guess we&#39;ll find out in a week.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Holy shit.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ClqtMvZeIs">This right here</a> in and of itself doesn&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; what the interviewer has said...but damn.  It gives some very, very interesting/provocative added information.</p>

<p>Again, holy shit.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT II:</strong>  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1k41oa/according_to_this_person_we_are_all_going_to_die/cbngpjd">visualculture provided this response</a> that I think is worth mentioning here as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t remember 100% exactly, as I listened to her interviews a couple of days ago, but I believe she might have mentioned that the second sun and some of its planets <em>are</em> already detectable.</p>

<p>She said that during sun up and sun down you should be able to see that our sun has a LOT of haze around it that is uncharacteristic for it, and this is a sign of what&#39;s happening.  I&#39;m not doing justice to what she said, and am not explaining it as well as she did, but I <em>do</em> know that the other day before I heard the interview, I remember being able to look literally <em>right</em> at the sun because it was so dull and orange and it was covered by so much haze.  I also live in Los Angeles, however, so it&#39;s <em>always</em> smoggy and hazy around here, but I DO remember thinking &quot;Damn.  This is a LOT more hazy and smoggy than even <em>we</em> here in Los Angeles usually are.  Weird.&quot;</p>

<p>And then I heard this interview and it made me think back to that moment.</p>

<p>Well...according to her, it&#39;ll be a <em>long</em> blink.  About three months or so actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention that there are all the other &quot;Aliens&quot; to consider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you referring to the ones that are on this planet?  I imagine that they are either taken care of by the MIC or their own interstellar family or part of their voyage/&quot;mission&quot; here on this planet is to experience just such a catastrophic occurrence as the very one that the Brassard mentions is about to occur.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We mere Earthlings aren&#39;t alone in this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very, very true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a cosmic shit storm, not mere Earth politics, entirely</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, at the very least a stellar and <em>solar system</em> shit storm...possibly even a galactic shit storm.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s cosmic significance to it too, but I would imagine that the kind of thing Brassard predicts happens <em>all</em> the time on a cosmic level, so there might not be <em>that</em> much brouhaha in the grander universal scheme of things.  You&#39;re definitely right, however, that it&#39;s not just about &quot;Earth politics&quot;.  That&#39;s <em>real</em> small potatoes in comparison with what&#39;s really going on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Should make some good headlines either way.</p>

<p>Yeah...If what Brassard says is valid though, then the news simply won&#39;t be around <em>to</em> print any headlines at all.</p>

<p>Not entirely. There are other beings that don&#39;t hang out on Earth directly but that have a vested interest in Earth just the same. Remember Earth is part of a wider community. This wider community, unlike Earth politics, actually has a well balanced system at work. If the Earth gets taken out then this upsets the universal balance. This is why all the UFOs suddenly stated to appear when we Earthlings started firing off nukes left and right.</p>

<p>This, of course, is most definitely true.</p>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sounds about right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Earth gets taken out then this upsets the universal balance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s an even larger system, however, than the proximate one that the Earth and the other galactic beings here immediately belong to.  It is true that we are part of a larger galactic council...but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">there are literally <em>billions</em> of galaxies</a>, each with their own congregation (their own &quot;galactic UN&quot; of sorts) representing each area, each sector, and the many beings living amongst the billions of stars in each of the billions of galaxies in the cosmos.  Taken in this context then, what happens to one of the <em>billions</em> of star systems in the outskirts of <em>this</em> particular galaxy is something that the &quot;Milky Way UN&quot; presiding here has to deal with on its own <em>without</em> worrying too much that such an event is going to be much more than a tiny blip on the cosmic radar of &quot;current events&quot; in the entire universe as a whole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Earth gets taken out then this upsets the universal balance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh no, my brother.  Brassard is in no way saying that the Earth is going to get &quot;taken out&quot;.  She makes no mention of this whatsoever.  The Earth isn&#39;t going to get &quot;taken out&quot; according to her <em>at all</em>.  It&#39;s merely going to experience a &quot;slight shifting&quot; as it will be influenced by the gravitational pull of the other planets that will be passing by in close proximity to it.</p>

<p>This &quot;slight gravitational pulling&quot;, of course, will be enough to cause the oceans to entirely engulf all coastal land masses, however, along with undermining all nuclear power plants, etc - resulting in billions of human non human deaths.  This &quot;slight gravitational pulling&quot; will destroy the delicate balance of human life on this planet.</p>

<p>It will be little more than a slight jostling to the planet Earth <em>herself</em>, however.  <em>She</em> will be fine.  Mother Earth will be okay.  The tiny ants littering her will have to come back another day though - cuz many of them (us) will be gone according to Brassard&#39;s information.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...Not a horrible question.  Brassard herself made mention that TPTB actually <em>knew</em> that nothing would happen on 12/21/12 but drummed up the paranoia on purpose so that the population could be lulled to sleep by thinking &quot;This 8/17/13 thing is just another doomsday hoax like 12/21/12.&quot;  This, again, will cause the masses to not really act while the <em>elite</em> elite are preparing so that when the disaster DOES hit, they can quickly tuck themselves away in their previously prepared safe houses while everyone else dies.</p>

<p>So yeah...Perhaps shit&#39;s <em>still</em> about to go down, and in a <em>big</em> way.  Perhaps the Mayans were right after all...Just off by a few months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw this too and it caught my attention for a few reasons, but first to clarify for OP she said that the 2nd star (I will call it Sol 2) is not a red giant but rather (And I might be misquoting) a brown dwarf that is about 1/10th the size of Sol (our sun). Also while she did say that you could see it and sunrise/sunset I don&#39;t remember anything about haze rather she said you can actually see it, as in an extra glowing dot next to our normal glowing dot (Although you may need to view it through a  filter* for it to be visible *don&#39;t remember what it was called, but she said it was pretty easy too do.). I have tried to check myself, but I live mountainous area so I can&#39;t really see the sun rise and set. </p>

<p>The interesting thing about this is that it blends rather well with many other theories that I have heard before, yet she doesn&#39;t seem interested in promoting them or anything rather just presenting her knowledge to the public as it stands. I will try and summarize the important stuff.</p>

<p>1) Sol 2 is a star that orbits our sun and every few thousand years (don&#39;t remember the exact time-frame) it has reaches its closest past to earth which she claims will be about .32 AU this time.</p>

<p>2) Sol 2 has 7 planets in orbit around it. Interestingly during one of the interviews she makes the claim in passing that there are intelligent beings that live there and that the gov&#39;t has made contact and in fact they are responsible for messing with human genetics in the past for the purpose of making us a slave species. This is an already existing theory and it is interesting because after making this comment the interviewer tried to press her for more info, but she declined because it was &quot;irrelevant&quot; to the current emergency and she didn&#39;t want people too not believe her.</p>

<p>3) As Sol 2 approaches its magnetic influence on earth increases and this is what has caused the accelerated polar shift that has been documented by scientists. Also when Sol 2 crosses the critical point where it is closer Earth then Sol, Earths magnetic field will be so heavily interfered with that it will temporary collapse leaving us exposed to dangerous UV and microwave radiation.</p>

<p>4)The &#39;event&#39; has already begun and will begin intensifying to a point where it is undeniable around 8/11 or 8/12 (tomorrow or the day after as of posting this) and will climax around 8/17.</p>

<p>5) The Gov&#39;t has been aware that this was going to happen for decades and has prepared underground bases that will protect the elite of the world while everyone else is left to die.</p>

<p>This is the quick version of the claim and if you want more detail then you can listen to this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye9BgvNvjK0&amp;amp;list=PLedZE99g4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye9BgvNvjK0&amp;amp;list=PLedZE99g4</a> </p>

<p>which is a much better quality interview then the one posted on this sub a few days ago.</p>

<p>If anyone finds any verifying evidence to support this claim please post it as I am still not sure about the legitimacy of this person. </p>

<p>I believe you are very correct, actually.  It&#39;s a brown dwarf.  Not a red giant.  Thanks for that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, sir.  Indeed it does.  All the flood &quot;myths&quot; in so many religions go along well with this, as well as offering a decent explanation for why there are so many darned &quot;submerged cities&quot; at the bottom of the ocean.  Perhaps they experienced the kind of overwhelming flood Brassard mentions will overtake this current civilization soon.</p>

<p>I think this actually fortifies her information for me because it shows that she&#39;s not really interested in presenting any sort of greater, historical or academic context behind her information.  She&#39;s more interested in just making sure that the information gets out there in the first place and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Yep.  I remember that.  It was pretty much exactly in line w/Sitchin&#39;s work and what&#39;s been said about the Anunnaki, etc.</p>

<p>Yep.  Seems to show that she actually <em>isn&#39;t</em> interested to any extent in anything but the nuts and bolts information that she&#39;s presenting.  &quot;Just the facts, ma&#39;am.&quot; kind of thing.  This gives the information more validation, not less.</p>

<p>The key here, of course, being &quot;that has been DOCUMENTED BY SCIENTISTS&quot; - for those so starving for &quot;proof&quot;.</p>

<p>If this is true - and, like you said, certain facts have already begun to be scientifically documented - then...watch out, Earth human population.</p>

<p>Thank you for this quick overview.  Very much appreciated, good sir.  Well done.</p>

<p>Every time I see a new theory I go at it with the mindset that there are 3 possibilities and then work through process of elimination to find the truth. The 3 possibilities being 1) They&#39;re crazy 2) They&#39;re lying or 3) It&#39;s the truth. In this case based on what I have heard form her I am fairly convinced that she isn&#39;t lying. This means she is crazy or she is telling the truth and the latter of those is rather terrifying. At this point I think that only thing to really do is wait and see in order to learn which it is. Unless of course someone posts evidence that confirms the claim in which case it has been fun and I hope you all find a good way to spend your last days on Earth.</p>

<p>Also in her interviews when she was mentioning the aliens that are suppose to live there I got the impression that she was implying that there was more then one species of them and that at least one of those species was benevolent. If this were the case I wonder what the chances are that they would try and save Earth, seeing as how I would imagine that a species as advanced as they are implied to be would have worked out a way to protect their planet from the similar effects that it would also be experiencing. Just a thought.</p>

<p>Oh well that is most <em>definitely</em> the case, and we didn&#39;t need her to tell us that.  There are various other individuals and sources that have attested to this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this were the case I wonder what the chances are that they would try and save Earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nu uh, brother.  It&#39;s not like that.  The Earth won&#39;t need any saving.  She won&#39;t be dying.  She&#39;ll only be jostled about a bit by the gravitational undulations the planet fly byes will cause upon her surface.  She&#39;ll wobble this way and that, her poles will shift, she&#39;ll get a bit of a &quot;make over&quot;, etc, but nothing much else will happen to her in the &quot;catastrophic&quot; sense.</p>

<p>Many of the little fleas on her, however (human fleas and otherwise), will likely <em>definitely</em> go bye bye.  That won&#39;t bother her much though.  She&#39;ll be okay.  Again, she won&#39;t need any ETs coming in to help her.  I think she&#39;ll ultimately be fine.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A few things:  One, I personally don&#39;t think that humans <em>deserve</em> saving.  We&#39;re, for the most part, fucking assholes.  We kill each other left and right, to say nothing about how we treat other forms of sentient life.  Not only that, but I wouldn&#39;t doubt if other ET beings are under a galactic &quot;non interference&quot; order of some sort.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t interfere with primitive, developing species.&quot; - humans being a prime example of such.  Perhaps a few of us might be helped.  Most of us would likely have to reincarnate again if we want to have another stab at &quot;being human&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally not sure I&#39;d <em>want</em> another go around, however. :)</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t disagree with that...but I think <em>this</em> particular iteration of humanity...might just be on about its last legs.  It might be ready for a reboot.  The REAL powers that be (not the Earthly ones) might be like &quot;OK.  This version is too much of a fuck up too.  Time to start over and try another version of humanity.

<p>While this may be true, I hold that it doesn&#39;t have to be. I still think we could be saved if we tried hard enough, and perhaps got a little outside help. The biggest factor in this fight is the fact that almost no one is trying, no one knows that they are about to lose it all. Furthermore many of those who do know something is wrong are under the illusion that it will be the future generations problem to deal with, but the simple truth is that if people don&#39;t wake up now...there will be no future generations...or those generations will be hopelessly devastated by tragedy and injustice.</p>

<p>In one sense, this way of grading seems like it might have some merit.  In another, I imagine that there is a great extent to which one&#39;s performance is based upon how one did <em>independent</em> of the outside influences.  It seems that&#39;s part of what makes ones actions count.  What did you do <em>independent</em> of your circumstances or the difficulty you found yourself in?</p>

<p>There&#39;s supposedly <em>another star</em> within 1 AU from us <em>right now</em> according to this. How could it possibly be limited to sunrise and sunset? That&#39;s right, it can&#39;t be.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t think that this sort of thing would be at all possible to be censored by the media. Nor would they want to.

However to play devils advocate, if a star 1/10th the size of the sun were approaching from an angle that placed it opposite the sun from our perspective then I could see how we might be unable to see it directly until it was too late.</p>

<p>Some might argue that those are forms of media that would also be subject to censorship, legal or otherwise, especially for top secret information. Also some might argue that those methods of information dispersal are exactly how this claim reached you to begin with.</p>

<p>You assume that the only way the gov&#39;t can censor media is by paying them off. Who knows maybe this story (or something like it) is why people like Micheal Hastings got killed. Just a thought, take it for what you will.</p>

<p>Seriously?  You gotta work a little bit harder than this to freak most people here out.  Personally I&#39;ve probably seen about 5 million end of the world predictions come and go.  They&#39;re bullshit and distractions and way too easy to hype because they just work by poking our monkey brain with a stick.</p>

<p>And the trick is to keep saying &quot;Oh I hope I&#39;m wrong but what if I&#39;m not&quot; which puts the onus on the listener to lend the theory credence &quot;for his own safety.&quot;</p>

<p>Dude.  That&#39;s really sad (on your part).  You see, there&#39;s <em>nothing to settle</em>.  It simply is what it is.</p>

<p>What are you going to do if the information is wrong?  Are you going to come back here on Sunday 8/18/13 and say &quot;Ha ha!  See, no1113?  We&#39;re still alive!&quot; lol.  Man...I&#39;m literally just shaking my head at the stupidity of you people.</p>

<p>We&#39;re most certainly all going to die eventually - and that&#39;s a <em>good</em> thing.  Last thing you want to do is stay in this decrepit human body forever.  I just found some info that says it might be happening a lot SOONER than some of us want it to happen.  That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>If it happens, it happens.  If it doesn&#39;t.  So what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone would be 100% correct in saying that there have been a lot of doomsday prophecies that haven&#39;t panned out for sure.  It&#39;s one thing to point that out, however, and quite another to attempt to bash the messenger for simply bringing up another source for people to see and be made aware of.  I&#39;ve no problem with anyone saying &quot;This might turn out to be nothing.&quot;  Hell, not only do I agree with that, but I&#39;ve already over and over said that I personally actually HOPE it&#39;s nothing.  However, there have been so many people on here that have gone really out of their way to be unnecessarily mean that one has to wonder why on Earth would they do that?</p>

Anyway, you and I both know that people come to this subreddit to make fun of stuff like this and people who believe it so that&#39;s where some of that comes from. It&#39;s also probably partially a kind of psychological self-preservation response - make fun of something that terrifies you and hope that that empty spot in your knowledge is filled with good things and not bad. I don&#39;t condone the derision necessarily, and I think some folks here legitimately don&#39;t see enough evidence to give it more credence than any other doomsday concerns from the past.

<p>Yep.  That it for the most part is.  I guess I just get tired of seeing it.  I know it comes predominately from fear, and the person doing it is more a little frightened child inside than anything else, but it can still get pretty frustrating when that person gets pretty antagonistic and hubristic.  Very frustrating.  One can only take the &quot;forgive them for they know not what they do&quot; philosophy so far before you have to start coming back with some &quot;stfu&quot; responses yourself.</p>

<p>Honestly, that is so very kind of you, and I do appreciate that greatly.  Thanks for the considerate sentiment.  Again, I certainly at least <em>try</em> to be courteous, but my fuse can suddenly be pretty short if I come across a troll.  I guess I&#39;m the type that tends to give back what I get in spades regardless of whether it&#39;s good (as is the case here), or bad (as is <em>often</em> the case on Reddit in general).  I will continue to work on that, and thank you again for the kind reminder and encouragement.</p>

<p>According to the information in the OP, there actually won&#39;t be a collision with the red dwarf star.  That&#39;ll be too far away.  It won&#39;t be the star we have to worry about.  There won&#39;t even be any collision with one of the star&#39;s seven planets.</p>

<p>According to the information, what will happen is that there will be a stellar/planetary passing between one or more of the red dwarf&#39;s planets and the Earth of sufficient proximity that it will alter and significantly effect Earth&#39;s gravitational field.  Not only will the Earth&#39;s gravitational field be significantly effected, but the Earth&#39;s waters/oceans will move and turn at different and faster rates than are currently the case - causing tsunamis that will absolutely wipe out all coastal cities bar none.</p>

<p>The speaker mentions an added haze that can be noted during sun up and sun down as one looks in the direction of the sun.

<p>There is nothing about what I said or how I described a binary star system that would preclude two stars orbiting around a common center/one another, etc.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why so?  The accompanying planets need not have enough mass to <em>immediately</em> pull the stars off their momentary orbit.  The stars could have enough momentum to orbit for a certain amount of time before their accompanying planets pull them off that orbit.  This could happen over the course of millions or billions of years though, so what I&#39;ve postulated is in no way unsound in the context of human spans of time.</p>

<p>Why would they?</p>

<p>Because the majority of us are a blight upon the planet?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do they have stopping them from being killed as well?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DUMBs - which Brassard said won&#39;t actually help them, but they&#39;re at least working very diligently at them none the less.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And how does that explain the billions of people that should be able to just look up in the sky and see this thing and CAN&#39;T?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep asking the same question, and I keep giving you the same answer.  And that is that I don&#39;t <em>have</em> &quot;all the answers&quot;.  If the interviewer/Brassard is wrong, then she&#39;s wrong.  Um...that&#39;s a <em>good</em> thing by the way, in case you didn&#39;t actually know that.</p>

<p>It seems you&#39;re trying a bit too hard to be &quot;the right one&quot; here, when the fact of the matter is that this subject is <em>so</em> beyond trying to be right or wrong one way or the other.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s just about making people aware of information.  That&#39;s it.  If it turns out to be not right, then okay.  Hey, that&#39;s <em>great</em> actually.</p>

<p>Veering too strongly to one side or the other (i.e. &quot;It&#39;s <em>definitely</em> going to happen!&quot; or &quot;There&#39;s no way it&#39;s going to happen!&quot;) seems equally stupid though, and, again, you seem to be spending <em>way</em> too much time and energy looking for ways to nit pick and show why this individual is wrong.</p>

<p>Again, if they&#39;re wrong, then good.  Your trying as hard as you are to show that she&#39;s wrong, however, speaks very strangely of you in particular and your motives.</p>

<p>Well, honestly, I actually didn&#39;t describe any specific orbit, so I&#39;m not sure exactly what you&#39;re referring to when you say &quot;the orbits you described&quot;.  I imagine that there can be a great deal of variation in orbits, so I imagine that a LOT is very, very possible and much more likely than we in our very limited understanding of the universe might suppose.</p>

<p>Yeah. It does. See, an important skill (and one which many people lack) is the ability to distinguish between sense and nonsense. Pointing out that something is nonsense is very useful for those who wouldn&#39;t have figured it out otherwise.</p>

<p>You know what is even better then jokes at helping those who haven&#39;t figured it out? Facts, Reason, and Rationality.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That is just plainly untrue, and the fact that you don&#39;t see that tells me that you have no interest in trying. There are many ways one could discredit this claim in a scientific manner including, but not limited to:</p>

<p>Analyzing telescopic images of the area of space in which this &quot;2nd sun&quot; should be, or reviewing geological data collected from the time in history in which this supposedly happened before. One could also bring validity of the claim into question by providing evidence that the statement that </p>

<p>&#39;the asteroid belt was created by the direct impact of a planet from this system with a planet of the 2nd system during one of the close passes in the past&#39;</p>

<p>was untrue. This claim made during the interview in question, which you likely have not even listened too. </p>

<p>These are just a few example off the top of my head and anyone of a rational and scientific nature could likely find hundreds if not thousands of other ways to disprove this claim (assuming it is in fact untrue) if they were to try.</p>

<p>You should probably brush up on the basics.  I get that you watched a 30 minute video and suddenly are now some type of &#39;authority&#39; on the matter but basic middle school science says otherwise.</p>

<p>You need to seek professional help, really.  It&#39;s sad that you have at your fingertips the most powerful tool ever created in the history of mankind for the exchange of knowledge and information (Internet), yet still attempt to rationalize foolish theories then spew crackpot amateur opinions on top of actually trying to defend them in some warped sense of understanding you believe you correctly possess. </p>

<p>lol.  Don&#39;t do it before the 17th though.  If the the 17th comes and goes and there is no change in the atmosphere, etc, then you might wish you would have held back on those vacation days.</p>

<p>You and me both.  I&#39;m not sure of too many people that would actually WANT something like this to happen.  I mean I imagine the elites might want a lot of us dead, but I don&#39;t know if they would prefer to have to deal with all the nuclear fallout involved in having it happen <em>this</em> way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What is?  Covering it up?  If that&#39;s what you&#39;re referring to, then I would say not really.  There are a <em>lot</em> of other even more far reaching realities that have been covered up via PTB conspiracies, so I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if this situation were successfully covered up as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It <em>would</em> suck, and I personally don&#39;t think that saying so is dismissing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spend all your time researching and trying to find the truth all for it to go up in smoke. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I wouldn&#39;t go <em>that</em> far.  We are not physical beings that occasionally have spiritual experiences.  We are spiritual beings that occasionally have physical experiences - and being human on this planet is one of those experiences.  After this life is done - whether it ends naturally and peacefully, or whether it gets engulfed in a planetary catastrophe - then the <em>physical</em> manifestation will be finished.  The energy that <em>created</em> that manifestation <em>won&#39;t</em> be finished, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding your edit (yeah, I said I was done, but then you brought in new information. I&#39;ll just respond quick and get out.):</p>

<p>From the video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...lurking at the outermost reaches of our solar system, far <em>beyond</em> the planet<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto#2006:_IAU_classification"><em>[sic]</em></a> Pluto.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think they&#39;re talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyche_%28hypothetical_planet%29">Tyche</a>. If it does in fact exist, it&#39;s estimated that it would be about 500 times further from the Sun than Neptune. In order for it to reach us within seven days, as required for it to be the same object originally discussed in the OP, it would need to travel at <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2.2e12+km+%2F+7+days">12 times the speed of light</a>. In other words, it, while interesting, is not actually relevant to this discussion in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post right here on your part is actually rather significant and indicative of possibly the whole of our conversation and the other posts you&#39;ve submitted here in that, while it does have <em>some</em> worth to it and cannot be discarded offhand, it continues to miss rather important points that heavily change the status of the conclusions which you ultimately draw.</p>

<p>That &quot;EDIT&quot; post I offered was actually put up coming on <em>two years</em> ago.  A lot of travel can take place in that time.  That fact combined with the <em>very</em> remedial level of understanding humans have about the universe in general (we are more babies than anything else where it regards what we actually know in that area) means that we should be <em>very</em> careful where it regards what information we discard offhand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read through all your comments here and I agree with you. I felt uneasy listening to this just thinking the whole time &quot;What if she&#39;s right?&quot; I would imagine that if what she was saying is true then we really should be able to see at the very least the planets it is traveling with. I also would imagine that more than one person would have the compassion for their species to try and display this info. I also think The way she tied 9/11 into it was a bit discrediting to her and almost just thrown in there...I do find it weird though that FEMA has been stock piling food and amo. I remember seeing the video about the rouge star in your edit months and months ago and immediately thought of it when I first heard the interview on the 7th. And it does seem a bit odd that the governments of the world aren&#39;t pouring every available resource into solving the Fukushima disaster...maybe they don&#39;t think it necessary considering the impending doom. It&#39;s probably going to be nothing. And like you have said that would be a GOOD thing...but there are some dots than can be connected to lend a ray of credibility to her words...even if it makes me nuts I think it&#39;s a possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well-said - all of this.  It&#39;s about having a balanced perspective.  Don&#39;t go too far one way or the other.  She might be right, as a lot of what she&#39;s said does seem to be based on sound reasoning and empirical evidence (FEMA camps, DUMBs, Fukushima, etc).  She might be wrong, however...and HOPEFULLY, she <em>is</em> wrong.  However, <em>she</em> seems to believe what she&#39;s saying, and she seems to be sound enough in how she&#39;s explaining things, so it wouldn&#39;t be wise to discard the information offhand as so many here have done.</p>

<p>Anyhoo. I don&#39;t believe or disbelieve it. The only remarkable thing about the interview-- to me-- was just how goddamn sure she was about what she was saying. It was striking.

<p>Dude.  <em>Exactly</em>.  That&#39;s what <em>I&#39;m</em> saying as well.  This is a great part of the reason why I even made this darn OP.  It&#39;s because, like I said, this lady does NOT sound like a kook, and she confidently states a <em>lot</em> of information pertaining to what she alleges.  As I said, it might all be nothing.  I, again, HOPE it&#39;s nothing.  I&#39;ll be pretty pleased if all the moronic naysayers can come back on here on the 18th and say &quot;Na na!  She was wrong!&quot;  I&#39;ll say &quot;Great!  Thank goodness!&quot;  But thus far, she sounds pretty confident and <em>not</em> like some crazy bag lady type.</p>

<p>All well-said, sir.</p>

<p>The fact that you say &quot;the guy&quot; and kept talking like that when it&#39;s actually a FEMALE and not a male in the first place almost entirely invalidates what you&#39;re saying here.

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing OP does is refer to ATS - which is a website that is absolutely <em>rife</em> with people who are simply naysayers.  Referencing that site as a source is immediate grounds for being skeptical about the claims.</p>

<p>Secondly, he then follows up by saying that Brassard is a &quot;<em>NASA</em> whistleblower&quot;.  I don&#39;t recall her ever actually saying she was in NASA.  She was in the <em>military</em> - not NASA, right?  This, again, doesn&#39;t seem to bode well for the information itself as far as it being valid or sound.</p>

<p>Regardless of these two faux pas, if what is said in the Godlike productions link that OP provided is true (yet another site that has a less than stellar reputation), then it would seem that Patti Brassard is indeed a hoax.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s true, then you have provided a pretty good service, and I definitely thank you for that.  As I said from the beginning, I <em>hope</em> this is all b.s. and wrong.</p>

<p>I also referenced your response here above in my own OP so as to hopefully clear the air regarding what this situation might be about.  Thanks again.</p>

<p>**&quot;As we predicted would occur during the 8 of 10 phase, visibility of the Planet X complex has increased. As we have explained, Planet X and the Earth assume a more side-by-side posture during the 8 of 10 phase, Planet X moving forward in its path but the Earth pulling far to the left where it is trapped within the cup. Visibility increases because the angle of bounce for sunlight reflected off the vast dust cloud that shrouds both Planet X and the Moon Swirls is more optimal. When the Planet X complex was positioned more between the Earth and Sun, the bounce most often returned sunlight to the Sun or to the side, off into space. It was the rare times when the angle was right, at sunrise or sunset, that the people of Earth saw what they thought were two suns rising or setting. Now this optimal angle is present for most of the day.</p>

<p>Video captures, by experts who adjust the hue to explore what appears under various light spectrums, have begun appearing on the Internet, asserting that a large object can be seen under the Sun or somewhat to the right or left of this position. The objects look spherical, distinct, implying they are planets rather than Moon Swirls. Are any of these objects the Planet X corpus itself? During the decade that Planet X has been in the inner solar system, slowly making its way past the Sun, Planet X has presented many faces, including the Monster Persona where it looks huge and perfectly round. This is caused by light fanning outward but then being drawn back by the gravity of Earth. Where the Monster is not the size of Planet X, the light rays originate FROM Planet X, thus documenting its current location just under the Ecliptic.</p>

<p>Some of the recent captures are of Moon Swirls, so extremely bright (as has been their characteristic) that in one case a video captured a lens flare from the Moon Swirl. Thus proving the Moon Swirl is distinct, not in and of itself a Moon Swirl. What will this increased visibility mean for the lingering cover-up, not yet dealt a death blow as of today, July 13, 2013 by Obama’s planned announcement. This visibility has created increased chatter on the Internet, a growing sense in the public that they are being lied to about the erratic weather, sudden tides, and Sun and Moon obviously out of place. After the announcement, there will be many who will claim Nibiru, aka Planet X, is a falsehood, still in denial or attempting to placate mankind so they remain on the coastlines and in their jobs. This visibility is thus a great weapon against that type of disinformation.&quot;**</p>

And even if it was, the &quot;colliding&quot; of two star systems almost never results in the actual planets colliding. Space is too damn big for that to happen. When two galaxies collide NONE of the stars hit eachother. They usually don&#39;t even come within a few lightyears. This is just some lady who was on abovetopsecret.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A binary system results of two bodies orbiting around a common center of mass. It would contradict most proven theories of binary starts to have two stars with separate bodies orbiting around each other individually. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing about what I said or how I described a binary star system that would preclude two stars orbiting around a common center/one another, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it is extremely possible for the current accepted sets of planets to orbit around this comment center of mass, it is implausible for each star to orbit around this center while having individual planets orbiting around them separately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why so?  The accompanying planets need not have enough mass to <em>immediately</em> pull the stars off their momentary orbit.  The stars could have enough momentum to orbit for a certain amount of time before their accompanying planets pull them off that orbit.  This could happen over the course of millions or billions of years though, so what I&#39;ve postulated is in no way unsound in the context of human spans of time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: look at the theory of space time and how these bodies interact, even in hand written notes of Einstein and the likes who have studied this, it&#39;s relatively implausible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a <em>lot</em> Einstein didn&#39;t understand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, why would anyone hide these sets of planets who discovered them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could see a LOT of reasons why such information would be hidden if the discovering of such other planets necessarily leads to the understanding of a coming global catastrophe for the planet Earth and the human race living on it.</p>

You&#39;re definitely right, however, that it&#39;s not just about &quot;Earth politics&quot;.  That&#39;s <em>real</em> small potatoes in comparison with what&#39;s really going on.</p>

<p>We may not be inherently assholes, but we sure do seem to fall nicely into that category and nestle into it rather well.  Just looking at some of the responses on here is rather indicative of that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t disagree with that...but I think <em>this</em> particular iteration of humanity...might just be on about its last legs.  It might be ready for a reboot.  The REAL powers that be (not the Earthly ones) might be like &quot;OK.  This version is too much of a fuck up too.  Time to start over and try another version of humanity.  This one&#39;s too stupid.&quot;</p>

<p>As would I most definitely.  It seems that there is still too great a percentage of humans that wouldn&#39;t feel this way, however, and would react negatively or violently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the notion of a galactic non-interference agreement I think that a lot of people might argue that such a contract was broken long ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  This would most certainly seem to be correct...amongst <em>some</em> species.  I think there are still some ET civilizations that are still holding fast to that agreement, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also where does one draw the line between primitive/developing and advanced/developed</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure, but I think we are somewhere in the middle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we Humans have come pretty far in the last hundred years</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through the likely help of ET beings that gave us technology we wouldn&#39;t otherwise have had.  I don&#39;t think we should take too much credit for how far we&#39;ve come, therefore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if we weren&#39;t being limited by the petty interests of politics and business I feel like we could go much further. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t disagree with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I do believe in the potential of this species, I am totally on board for reincarnating into the advanced civilization that already has this shit sorted out.</p>

<p>Oh well hell yeah.  That would be awesome.  I wouldn&#39;t want to come back to THIS species, but another, better one?  Yeah.  Sign me up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I would be worthy of reincarnating in that other class though.  Depends on the grades I get in <em>this</em> class here on this planet first.</p>
