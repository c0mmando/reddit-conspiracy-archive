        His comment
       </a>
       promotes that the surveillance that is going on right now cannot be stopped and people have to accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With his username and registration time, he seems very suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's copy of his comment
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No one will be able to stop what has been started.
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Telephone calls, record all incoming and outgoing numbers for any phone number.
        </li>
        <li>
         Data mining credit card purchasing activities
        </li>
        <li>
         Store all SMS text messages.
        </li>
        <li>
         Record actual telephone calls, convert to text for search/keyword purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
         License plate imaging systems to record vehicle locations. Red light cameras, police cars.
        </li>
        <li>
         Data mining online activities such as social platforms, facebook, blogs, ebay, amazon, google searches
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        What you end up with is a system that will track everything you are doing. It sounds like tin foil hat stuff, but it's being built right now and the eventual conclusion is an artificial intelligence system that will watch you 24hrs a day. It will keep an eye on you, and record everything you've done.
       </p>
       <p>
        At first a system like this will be used for it's original design purposes, catching bad guys trying to blow shit up. Then the system will have to be opened up for other purposes, drug trafficking, murders, child pornography, etc. Now the system will be fully operational, and hopefully doing a great job at keeping everyone safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        It wont be perfect, but this is the future. The unknown is how will people react to being monitored 24hrs a day, knowing every call they make is being stored somewhere, every email they've written has been processed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, nobody really cares or people don't really understand. Either way, the system will move forward, for better or for worst. I guess we are going to find out. I truly hope it's for the better and someone doesn't come into power and ask the following....

       I'm against surveillance because it's a recipe for dictatorship. I was born in Iraq, and I have lived through surveillance when Saddam was in the government. Every move you made and every conversation, whether it was on the phone or in a public place was recorded, so no one was able to go against the government.

       I don't think he's promoting it, he's just being realistic. The only difference is he's worried about future governments abusing it - we understand he should be just as worried about the current ones...

       Why don't you just get a tinfoil hat while you're at it? No don't get your knickers in a twist I was being ironic. The truth is we need a direct democracy in place - we have the technology all we need now is the will. These problems won't go away because you cover your mouth when you speak - they will get more and more invasive. Not to mention that our representatives are mass murdering fuck heads with their minds on their pocket.

       predict. But there is a lot of things we can do to change the path of future. However, for change to happen we need to bring a few important messages to the masses. One was supplied by him:

      <p>
       It has happened before. It can happen again. These systems are way to powerful to be trusted to any government and the public needs to understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a tough task to change the future. There is a need for legislation protecting businesses like lavabit that offer security and privacy on-line and there is a need for a change in behaviour towards more everyday use of encryption such as pgp and anonymity services like
       <a href="/r/tor">

       is a new account. That doesn't, in itself, make him wrong. You, of all people, should know that once a Government gets a new power they can and will use it to the fullest. I am inclined to agree with him. The NSA will never stop the spying and surveillance no matter what congress has to say on the matter. They just won't tell the congress.

       The people won't do anything. They are too comfortable and/or scared. In past years, yes, it might have been able to be stopped. Times have changed. Technology has changed. This time the Government can't be stopped by anything accept either internal implosion or brute force. The NSA will not reform. The CIA has been a murderous force since 1950. They killed JFK, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time it's different. The US is a dictatorship that just pays lip service to a fake Democracy. And the only reason the US Government doesn't imitate Nazi Germany directly is to keep the people from waging out right war against them.

       Very possibly. But whether it is bullshit or isn't bullshit, it would be prudent to assume that you
       <em>
        are

       being watched. This is because to assume otherwise, and be
