<p>LOL THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS WERE WRONG ALL ALONG.</p>

<p>Makes everyone feel like the narrative they&#39;ve adopted was the right choice.  Establish and reinforce comfort and compliance.</p>

<p>Show a little bit of movement, but nowhere near the appropriate amount and you can keep the &quot;fringe&quot; theorists on the fringe.  Expand the circle, but only to the degree where there&#39;s still plenty of buffer between the assumed and actual borders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I predict it will be made legal so people simply stop caring about being spied on. however instead it&#39;s simply going to wake people up and make propaganda harder to push. The cannabis issue is a no-win for the ruling class but the pressure is building on them.</p>

<p>My guess: Super weed, so powerful it can actually kill a user, then we start all over with the reefer madness bullshit and media ignores the fact that it&#39;s only happening with GMO cannabis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t do memes, but: If you&#39;re tuning into the MSM to hear the topics you want discussed, you&#39;re going to have a bad time. </p>

<p>I support their seemingly balanced coverage of MJ even though CNN doesn&#39;t get much of my viewership. The NSA &quot;scandal&quot;, like all others covered by media in recent months, has been hashed and rehashed without result aside from awareness, so they might as well start talking about hash.</p>

<p>Imagine if they were still covering the topics important to you, they&#39;d just spin them in a manner that would not be very productive and you know it, with their State TV like agendas and all. </p>

<p>&quot;Tonight, on CNN. Edward Snowden, The Leaker. Is He a Traitor, or a Hero? Also: What Must Be Done to Prevent Future Leaks? Stay Tuned As We Decide, and You Divide.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit confused by the recent pot propaganda as well. What is their end goal? However, aren&#39;t we also entering an age where our interest in what the MSM&#39;s topics and talking points are should be dwindling? It would be nice, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Oh and of course, the NSA&#39;s activities continue to remain fully unjustified and unconstitutional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I find it consistent.  The administration has been using the NSA data to catch a lot of mad bombers and a lot more innocent victims of PRISM.  But they really truly are using the domestic spying to catch real domestic bombers and there have been a few obvious examples -- particularly the guy in Portland the FBI sold bomb parts to.  It&#39;s been apparent for a while that when people search for bomb info, the FBI tracks them.</p>

<p>The administration, getting why people don&#39;t want to spied on, is trying to de-escalate.  By making the &quot;consensual crimes&quot; legal, they may be able to get us to slide on the spying in exchange for no bombs.</p>

<p>I think this may be  a side-show.  After the Boston bombing, I saw on this subreddit that the Transparent Society has begun.  It went very poorly that day, but it is upon us.  It will obviate this entire discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No a couple of those caught in Portland and Seattle have been legitimate bombers they caught.  Yes, they intercepted them and blocked the sale of real ingredients. </p>

<p>When people say &quot;the suspect bought X from the FBI&quot; that is because the FBI does that -- replaces sales clerks with trained witnesses and sells the bomb ingredients in inert form.  They already know what the plan to use the ingredient is, they don&#39;t need to provide live materiel.</p>

<p>There have been one or two cases in which I wondered if the bomber was cajoled into a little too much.  In a couple of the cases in the Pacific Northwest, I am not wondering that, just glad the bomb didn&#39;t get built with real ingredients, thanks FBI, thanks Texas Memory Systems, thanks Echelon, thanks Five Eyes, thanks NSA.  It is what it is. </p>

<p>What if scenario:  What if there <em>really were</em> some people building bombs to harm random U.S. civilians?  What should the President do?  I would say it&#39;s probably time we amend the Constitution if we want to continue this route; I&#39;ll give you that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh the Transparent Society is not really a government thing.  It&#39;s an idea from a novel by David Brin.  The idea is that the ubiquity of civilian cameras will create a new transparent society.   Everybody sill see 100% of the weed smoking and 100% of the police brutality and 100% of everything.</p>

<p>His story (I would have to dig up the title of the source here, I may get back to you) is that eventually there will be super inexpensive nanotech cameras the size of dust motes.  Anybody who so desires will watch whatever they want via this nanotech.  Privacy will be gone.  Double-standard laws will be gone.  Government secrecy; gone.</p>

<p>I think the play-out of the Boston bombing was the first real increment that I would call &quot;a step toward David Brin&#39;s vision.&quot;  And looking back on things, the video-taping of the Rodney King beating was probably the one of the first major increments.</p>

<p>But today, with cell-phone camera video so common and high-res, and store cameras so common, and webcams, and police car cams, and cam cams....  I would say we are entering some kind of Transparent Society.  Some of that is Transparent, and some of it is part of Trapwire.</p>

<p>A big memetic part of Brin&#39;s thesis is the &quot;Transparency&quot; of peer-to-peer civilian access to the cameras.  Police car cams, red light cams, bank cams, not-networked smart cams, are part of an Opaque Surveillance Society.</p>

<p>Crowd-sourced cell phone cams posted to reddit are more akin to the Transparent Society, I would say.  Not that episode one (Boston bombing pics posted on this subreddit) that I observed went particularly well, imo.</p>

<p>And the NSA hacking your smart phone and watching the man in the gabardine suit who is a spy?  That is Tom Clancy&#39;s Rainbow Six Society.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think &quot;Something Is Happening&quot; and it could turn out to be the Transparent Society.</p>

<p>Whatever it turns out to be, due to the ubiquitous surveillance, it will need to be a society wherein weed would naturally be free (b/c all the prosecutors smoke it, duh), as well as prostitution, cocaine, etc.  If not, everybody would be losing their security clearance who had one.</p>
