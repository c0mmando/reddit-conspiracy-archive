       I've been dwelling on conspiracy related things a lot and it's all incredibly depressing. How do you guys live with it? The world we live in is corrupt and self-destructive and it seems like there is no way to fix it. It feels like there is no hope. What do you do to find the strength to keep living?

       But that is the greatest of all things, you know what is. You aren't hiding, you are in the light. Shine bright, give your light to others, don't hold back, be all that you can be. Let the darkness fear you, let them see you in your entirety. Let them know your imperfections and also let them know of your struggles. Know that the darkness might get you but also know that you will always defeat it in the end. You are improving, you are being all that you can be. Nobody can take your light from you but you, only you can allow yourself to succumb to the darkness. Just knowing the things I know, keeps me alive, it keeps me invigorated. Knowledge is power, either dark, or light. You must choose how to use it and how it uses you. Lets use our light to brighten the darkness, to save those who are willing to be saved.
      </p>

       Hope, I don't believe in such a thing. Hope is just another made up word, that is apart of the human language. Instead, I have heart, a heart that sings to me, a heart that loves me, a heart that loves all things, a heart that understands all things, that is the source of the universe. The greatest power in all of the universe, is not a power that overcomes everything but instead empowers everything.

       When you finish dwelling you will self actualize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self actualization, or at leas the concept that it expresses, perhaps not under Maslow's requirements in the pyramid explanation, is the only answer to most  of lifes true dilemma's.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were able to do anything powerful enough to change the world, you will do it from your self actualized state of being.   So, that is your best shot.  Dwelling is not a part of that state of being.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, cheers, here is to the best fucking version of you that you can make in this lifetime.  I hope it is enough to really change shit!

       I personally find it all to be getting funnier and funnier.  I used to get mad but now I'm more and more amused.  Through travelling and living for several years in interesting and unusual places I have detached myself from the need to have one particular place doing super well.  I've removed myself from having lots of sympathy and pity for people who are not helping themselves.  I'm just not that concerned if they live or die really.  I'll help unworthy people if it pleases me and that is the end of it.  I have this really ugly mug of the awful Dianne Feinstein glaring at me on the right and that is not very pleasing to me.  It is funny as hell to me though that so many people think that she is great.  How can that not be funny.  She is so corrupt and ugly and they are so naive and simple.  They were made for each other and there is beauty in that.

       That seems to be my subconscious habitual response to the overstimulation. I work with this stuff for a while, and then I shut down and go do something completely different for a month or so. Then I have to catch up on what all has happened in the news. D:

       I suspect there's a more effective strategy, perhaps something listed elsewhere on this page, and i haven't yet implemented it.

       same here. taking breaks is a simple one step solution, but it is also important to work toward changing the corruption we see in the news with whatever medium suits us best, and with whatever talents we have

       Yes today I ran in the hills and I made it farther than I ever have before.  That was good.  I just went three weeks without drinking alcohol.  That was also good.  I am also now putting organic coconut oil on my face every morning and this is also good.  I can do so many good little things for myself but the chance of making this Diane Feinstein look less ugly or to be less tyrannical is very low.

       Just kidding brah. You need diversity in life and let go of problems you have no control over. Try some humor and then don't spend all the time on here. Learn to surf and hike in the wilderness. Take your time and study all the small things you pass by with a good dose of curiosity. You ever tried just following the life of one little ant? It will make you appreciate your life more because your not him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I go surfing, exercise by swimming/jog, Spear dive for my fish, and take hike of lava flows and watch how life adapts around new earth. because believe me. After watching volcanic vents spew new earth. The earth is going to go on with us or with out us until the Sun rips us apart. There is no stopping that juggernaut.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you live on the edge of life. That's when you realize that there is more to the universe after death. You begin to accept and don't worry about all the worlds problems. You take one battle at a time and do the best you can. I protest Monsato here on Big Isle Hawaii. However I pay attention to the little things in life like what my kids do or my wife wants to share.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should always learn to embrace life because it could end the next hour from a tornado,or Tsunami or basically an asshole drunk driver crossing over the center line. You have a better life than a bug, and even corrupt assholes die and can't take their bullshit with them. They are as mortal as you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words are you going to die scared like a little kitten or are you going to be like a lion when you pass on. Don't let bastards get to you. Many of the so called wealthy elitists will die scared on their death bed. Just look at Dick Cheney and his heart pump. What a pathetic way to live by the little man too scared to move on.

       You wake up from your slime tank and all you want to do is wake the slave next to you. Problem is: they don't want to be woken up. This is depressing but it passes... Do what you can to spread the truth. Eventually you will find other like-minded folks or finally free someone else and it is a good feeling.

What is happening around you. Don't rely on anyone, anything
Or any situation to bring peace, joy and freedom to you. Liberty
Is an internal reality. Learn to be your own master and not outside
Influences.

       Im very optimistic of the semi-distant future, and I'm aware that the world today is better than it ever has been (for some, many places have it worse than ever) 
Im not too optimistic of the near future however, I would be glad if utopia came overnight but I think there are still a few exits until we reach the promised land. The system isnt just a few elites in a war room, they have an entire infrastructure set in place which won't go away with a few protests, innovative ideas, or a fresh generation of people. Whatever ends up happening, I think we need to enjoy life if possible. They've already got half your paycheck, don't let them take away your smile.

       First of all, and it sounds cynical (it's not, it's realistic): stop caring. You can't have such a massive stake in it that it affects your personal life. I've been there dude, and nothing changes. None of us can do anything to make this any better right now.  Live your life in a way that is as minimally affected by this shit as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the time comes where the average person has a chance to make a difference,
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       is the time get up and start worrying about it. Until then, it's pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, remember that we're all completely unimportant. Species die off constantly, and if that's what we're destined to do, then so be it. The universe will carry on as normal and won't even notice we've been here. Just another evolutionary dead-end. Do i think we have the potential to be greater than that? Sure, but it also doesn't matter what i think. If we can make a difference and change things for the better, then great, i'll be there making the effort too, but i ain't counting on it ever happening.

       The negative exists so that we can define ourselves in contrast to it. You are here for a reason and know what you know so that you can be a part of the solution.
