    <div class="md"><p>Power is not cut. I can&#39;t count how many batteries I saw replaced because a control module wouldn&#39;t sleep. The brake system has what are essentially pressure capacitors and a very high pressure pump. We had to completely disarm the system to change the pads. If you left it pressurized and plugged in, opening up a door, or anything that woke up modules could possibly activate the brakes systems check, and sever any body parts in the way of the piston. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i&#39;ve seen quite a few ABS modules go bad in my time and keep running, eventually draining the battery. </p>

<p>then again, i&#39;d like to know what happens when you let the calipers set without a rotor, and activate the system. does it keep adding pressure until the brake cylinders pop out of the caliper or what?</p>

<p>i&#39;ve done a number of brake jobs on mercedes and never seen it work like that. but the majority of mercedes i&#39;ve done brake jobs on haven&#39;t ever been newer than a 04 or 05. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the body style of the E class changed from a 210 to the 211 chassis, the SBC brakes became standard in one of the most popular cars among the 1%. It&#39;s their disposable razor of cars. It was introduced before my time as a tech in the flagship cl. </p>

<p>I have risked doing the procedure of removing the pads without bleeding the system with the computer. We had 2 computers for 11-15 techs. I would unplug the module and tie the cable so that it couldn&#39;t fall back into place. I would pry the pads to collapse the calipers prior to unplugging the system. It&#39;s not the right way to do it, but it&#39;s often the only way to survive in that cut throat business. When you have 70k+ invested in tools and education. </p>

<p>I have never personally seen the system accidentally discharge. But if it did, the caliper piston could be popped out, but it would hit the caliper. Do not crack the lines on one of those things unless you have a suitable computer and software for the operation. I know that you can be maimed and killed by a diesel injection pop, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you could be seriously injured or killed by the pressures in the brakes. Embolism of terrible properties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so when you collapse the pistons back into the caliper, doesn&#39;t the fluid flow back the reservoir like a normal brake job?</p>

<p>i&#39;ve always done em by popping the top on the master cylinder and using a caliper tool to push the pistons back in. as a mechanic i like to be careful, especially with my hands, since they&#39;re the most irreplaceable tool i own. </p>

<p>Doing this repair by the book is the best possible way, I don&#39;t recommend that anyone try it otherwise, because the outcome is not predictable. I was younger and dumber when I did this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look, they don&#39;t really make electronic brakes. some cars use them, electric cars with regenerative braking. </p>

<p>brakes are operated by a master cylinder. pressing the pedal pushes a rod into the cylinder which then pushes brake fluid (hydraulic fluid) to the wheel cylinders in the brake caliper. </p>

<p>the reason brakes work this way is part necessity and part design. see, if it was electronic, and you lost power to your car, then you would lose brakes. that would be bad. </p>

<p>further, mercedes have a system they&#39;ve used since the early 2000&#39;s. when the brakes are pressed, power to the throttle is cut. this is so there can&#39;t be a runaway mercedes like the toyota&#39;s were allegedly doing. </p>

<p>if the government was going to kill hastings, they wouldn&#39;t have taken such a risky move as a &quot;hack the car&quot;. there&#39;s too many variables to take into account. shift the car to N, throw the keyfob out the window, etc, and their plan would fail. </p>

<p>i&#39;ve worked in collision repair and as a mechanic for some time. that was actually a pretty normal wreck for the speeds he was going. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes and?</p>

<p>both of the cars the hackers used in the demonstration feature electronic steering and electronically controlled braking. those cars are fairly popular, the Ford Escape, and the Toyota Prius. but the reason they chose those two cars, was because of the electronic steering assembly. </p>

<p>it gives them something to startle the masses with. they were in a car, with most of the dash ripped out, and a laptop plugged directly into the Onboard Diagnostic (OBD2) port. </p>

<p>when given this direct access to the car, the things they can control are, the readouts on the dash, activate steering, or braking, lights, horn, and seatbelt pretensioners. </p>

<p>it&#39;s easy to say, &quot;that car has been hacked&quot; without really understanding what needs to be present for you to control a system. most cars (like the one hasting&#39;s was driving) use a mechanical steering pump. there&#39;s no way to override that.</p>

<p>EDIT: wanted to point out that they also gained throttle control, but it was through the cruise control system, and would be deactivated by pressing the brake. so even though these dudes have DIRECT access to the car with a laptop hooked into it, they still can&#39;t do what people claim the government made hasting&#39;s car do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok i will. </p>

<p>here&#39;s some good info. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ0laKiCkfk">this is a crash test performed by the IIHS</a></p>

<p>this is very similar to the kind of wreck hastings had, a small overlap crash test. this one was conducted at 40MPH. you can imagine what twice that speed does to one. </p>

<p>they&#39;re mercedes, they&#39;re good cars, but not tanks or anything really special. they&#39;ve gotten poor crash test results for sometime now, so they&#39;re not even the safest car you could drive. honda accords and acura rl&#39;s perform much better.</p>

<p>here&#39;s my take on the hastings wreck (i try to leave my opinion out of it but i hate seeing people spread any kind of disinformation on the subject). i think the timing of his death was suspicious as all get out. i don&#39;t think the story he was working on was all that important. he already got mcchrystal kicked out. i suspect he was a unwitting tool of obama&#39;s administration. any decent general over there in iraq has been kicked out for some kind of scandal or another. i think the story hasting&#39;s was working on was probably related to him finding out he had been used. </p>

<p>he was probably right to be paranoid, but given the nature of snowden&#39;s story on the NSA and the fact that i doubt hasting&#39;s story was anywhere NEAR that important, i think he was bombing through hollywood at 3 in the morning and lost it on a uneven patch of road. </p>

<p>i see some motive to bump him off, but not a lot. honestly if i was that paranoid, i probably wouldn&#39;t have been out. i&#39;d have been holed up in some motel under a fake name. not driving a RED, TWO-DOOR, HIGH PERFORMANCE, AND NOTICEABLE CAR. that&#39;s just my two cents on it. it&#39;s the way it strikes me. not a popular opinion around here, but one that fits with most of the facts of the case. </p>

<p>time will tell if i&#39;m right or wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mercedes sensatronic brake control. SBC. Fly by wire throttle and lane departure stuff, also body attitude control systems which use ferro fluids to modify the damping of the suspension, and hydraulic systems that can change ride height... Also the seat belts have pre tensioners that can trap you in place. All of this stuff has been around for at least a decade in production Mercedes. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why people scoff at car hacking, and then start their car with their cell phone to get the climate control started before they go outside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hydraulic suspension does a lot more than adjust the ride height. Look up the Mercedes Benz rodeo test. The test is performed at a fraction of the possible speed. I used to remove the accelerometers and shake them to demonstrate that the car can jump off the ground. </p>
