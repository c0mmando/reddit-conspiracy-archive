<p>As I&#39;ve said many times before to people who have had a similar reaction or comment, anyone who is so committed to only the &quot;yes, no&quot; quantifiable information in things is pretty much missing the point entirely not only in the HH information itself, but in life in general.  One has to develop the ability to sift the veritable wheat from the chaff.  It&#39;s called being critical thinker.  Many, unfortunately, miss that boat, and much relevant information just passes right over them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is hilarious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I know right?  And what&#39;s even more hilarious is that it is also talks about a group that is powerful enough to exist above and beyond all societal constructs designed to safeguard law and order - that same law and order that you, me, and the rest of the 99% are almost entirely ruled by.  There are groups powerful enough to take your child, rape them right in front of your face, kill them, kill you, GET CAUGHT DOING IT, and <em>still</em> not be prosecuted or go to jail.</p>

<p>Hilarious isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Yeah.  My sides are splitting.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a problem if that is purely what one is doing - which I&#39;m certainly not.  One, again, has to take in the entirety of the information holistically and understand it that way as well.  Doing that to the HH information reveals a <em>lot</em> more data than one who is purely nit picking will be able to understand.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with that.  Again, however, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m doing.  Anybody who reads and understands <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">the second link I provided</a> would grasp this.</p>

<p>If, conversely, you keep yourself closed to everything <em>but</em> the quantifiable - as so many make the mistake of doing - then you do yourself an even worse disservice.</p>

<p>Or unless it is connected to the internet.</p>

<p>Washington Post - 12/06/2013:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2013/12/06/352ba174-5397-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html"><strong>FBI’s search for ‘Mo,’ suspect in bomb threats, highlights use of malware for surveillance</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mo remained elusive for months, communicating via ­e-mail, video chat and an ­Internet-based phone service without revealing his true identity or location, court documents show. <strong>So with no house to search or telephone to tap, investigators turned to a new kind of surveillance tool delivered over the Internet.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The FBI’s elite hacker team designed a piece of malicious software that was to be delivered secretly when Mo signed on to his Yahoo e-mail account, from any computer anywhere in the world, according to the documents</strong>. The goal of the software was to gather a range of information — Web sites he had visited and indicators of the location of the computer — that would allow investigators to find Mo and tie him to the bomb threats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most powerful FBI surveillance software <strong>can covertly download files, photographs and stored e-mails, or even gather real-time images by activating cameras connected to computers</strong>, say court documents and people familiar with this technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can child porn (or anything else) be planted on a computer to frame / blackmail?</p>

<p>You bet your ass it can.</p>
