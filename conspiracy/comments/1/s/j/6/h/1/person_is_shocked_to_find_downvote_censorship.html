       This is the original thread
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1siiiw/reddits_empire_is_founded_on_a_flawed_algorithm/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1siiiw/reddits_empire_is_founded_on_a_flawed_algorithm/
       </a>
       is the original thread now zooming to the top of r/ technology where it will likely be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       my response to him there is below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of who realized long ago that reddit is intended to have censorship have complained about the pergatory zone based on a small number of fast downvotes for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we figured out that was the way the owners want it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think the 7 th largest media family in the world bought s money losing website with huge political influence for any reason other the  to control that political influence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever wondered why the default landing zone is hot rather than top anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       The hot ranking was specifically introduced to keep people away from the more fairly ranked top catagory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am just amazed you got a programmer to admit this pergatory zone effect was intended in the code. We have suspected it for years !
Thanks for providng the proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now will you draw the necessary conclusions from the evidence you yourself have uncovered?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the top stories on the banned original main reddit from 6 years ago called now r/reddit.com.
      </p>
      <p>
       Full of activist political ground swells that literally changed the politics of the united states and countered huge money lobbying efforts by exposing millions of readers to these things they didn't hear about from the news media (by design)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at the front page of reddit today.
The new owners neutered reddit. As intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its so overt that now many politcal subreddits specifcally ban "calls to action".

       Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its supposed to be the readers that control it by their Upvoted and downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really have no idea  why reddit was different do you?
To you its just another silly blogging platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's so sad. And I mean that honestly.

       Its just sad.
