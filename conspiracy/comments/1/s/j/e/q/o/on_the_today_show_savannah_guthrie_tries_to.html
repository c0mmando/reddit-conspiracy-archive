        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The key aspect of this post about the video in the <a href="http://poy.time.com/2013/12/09/top-ten-finalists-for-person-of-the-year/">link here</a></p>

<p>To those who may have missed it, there have already been past suspicions of TIME tampering with polls in a previous <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rj4dp/">thread</a>.</p>

<p>So on with the SHOW!</p>

<p>Savannah Guthrie first starts out by mentioning his name as soon as she has the chance. Clearly stating that she does not want this ignored. When that little bomb is dropped, the reactions that sweep through the rest of the anchors are priceless. </p>

<p>&quot;No more chit chat&quot;, Matt Lauer thinks to himself, and pans as quickly as he can to the interview. We don&#39;t want to upset the government agents that control this broadcast. </p>

<p>TIME&#39;s editor acknowledges the Snowden comment briefly mentions that &quot;he is a good candidate&quot; and does not bring him up again. Instead she tries to bring out attention to Miley Cyrus, the odd ball off the group.</p>

<p>I can tell you right now that Miley Cyrus was not chosen by the people, at least not at first. Maybe once a few polls were skewed, people might vote for her, but I believe they put her on the list in order to distract people from Snowden. </p>

<p>She goes on to say that Obama is on it for &quot;obvious reasons.&quot; 
A president who was praised for being good with technology in TIME has been put on the list due to being a little too good with it. </p>

<p>And at the end, despite the attempt from her co-anchor to stifle our brave journalist, Savannah Guthrie says yet again that she will be voting for Snowden. </p>

<p>In general, I think our broadcasting networks are intimidated by our government, but so are the American people. Many are afraid to speak out and because of either social paranoia or cowardliness. I support speaking everyday about the injustice being done to not only the United States, but the entire world. I support saying Snowden in conversation everyday, just to get people talking. I support news reporters like Mrs. Guthrie who help the public remember what is happening to our country. </p>

<p>The truth should not be taboo. </p>
