       I'm not going to lie folks, I'm old.  Old enough to have lived through a handful of doom's day scenarios that turned out to be a crock of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please for the sake of discussion, put your preconceived "awareness" of global warming aside for 10 minutes and allow me to bake you a fluffy cake.

       The above source itself isn't a platinum level source but, you will find it contains some useful links.  I posted it here because it is a nice "short version" of what I'm cooking here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_glaciation">
        http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_glaciation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Glaciation folks,  the earth is currently 11,000 approximate years into what is known to be an interglacial period. (See link below). An interglacial period is like a mini-warming event contained within an ice age, without officially ended that ice age.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial">
        http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And that leads us to the glacial period.  Like the interglacial period we just talked about, the glacial period is a mini-event that is opposite of the former.  During a glacial period the earth cools slightly and the glaciers begin to regain territory, thus covering more of the earth...  global cooling if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_period">
        http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_period
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the interglacial, or the glacial periods mark the end or beginning of an ice age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our current ice age, yes we are currently in an interglacial period of an ice age, is called the Cenozoic era of the quarternary ice age.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       So considerable fluctuations are documented as repeatedly occurring, we know we are in a warming period that we HAVE BEEN in for 10,000 years or more AND we know that the earth has experienced higher levels of Co2 in the atmosphere in periods of elevated volcanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But some how, regardless of all of this evidence, a few hundred ppm of manmade Co2 is going to stop the next glacial period and DOOMS DAY! the world will end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry folks but I'm not saying this because I own oil stocks (I don't) or because I want to cut down the rain forest (I don't).  I don't enjoy pollution, I'm a very active outdoors type of person who teaches conservation to everyone who will listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying this because you're being sold a pile of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes yes, I know that 97% of scientists agree (if you cherry pick your statistics) and all that bull shit.  But scientists can be sold a pile of shit too.  And like I illustrated above, there is definitely a warming trend happening!
      </p>
      <p>
       With these dooms day scenarios there is always a packed house of experts who agree.  We had a whole nation of people convinced that the CCCP was going to nuke us any day now because they hate our freedom so much (just like the terrorist of today)
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't march through this world looking at only the facts that support your popular movement.  Look deeper, longer and harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       don't buy the shit they are selling you, when it comes to Democrats or Republicans. You don't buy the gun rights shit or the common core shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a disturbingly high number of people buy this man made global warming shit and 99% of them don't know the name of our current ice age.  You know because 97% of scientists agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       (97% of the 34% who took a stance, 66% of scientists think its too early to take a stance). Those statistics look a little bit different.

       Dude, its supported by Al Gore. Haven't you seen South Park and their episodes on manbearpig?
      </p>
      <p>
       Idc what anyone says. South Park does so many parallels and representations its ridiculous. The writers are actually highly intelligent and it takes an intellectual to fully admire their work in all its elements. So if you can't see it, good. I don't want you knowing about it.

       His point is that most people know it's a load of shit, as demonstrated by south park making Al Gore a character who goes around scaring everybody about an imaginary creature that's half man, half bear, and half pig, and it's called "manbearpig".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a pretty simple analogy for south park.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also directly make fun of global warming in their episode "two days before the day after tomorrow" S9E08 where the town of beaverton floods because Stan and Cartman crashed into the beaver damn in a boat, but the adults blame it on George Bush (the liberals) or Al-Qaeda (the rednecks) or FEMA (stans parents). The gov then says it's global warming and they all start blaming each other ( Chris yelling at Jimbo for driving an SUV ).

       The show in general does a really great job at showing how absurd and stupid people are, all of us.

       You are so right about South Park. It seems like most people feel like South Park is just silly toilet tumor.  I think that it's so much more entertaining and interesting when you start noticing their constant use of metaphors. It's my favorite part of the show now, honestly.

       If you don't look deeply into it, you are likely to be reading the talking points that public relations firms hired by the oil companies have prepared. Some of these are the same firms hired by the tobacco companies to cast doubt on the link between cigarettes and disease. These public relations firms are trying to fool you and they are experts at fooling people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well documented that oil, gas, and coal companies are spending millions of dollars a year on these efforts to mislead you.
      </p>
      <p>
       When scientists talk about global warming, they have to be careful in what they say, using only the best research and emphasizing the limits of what they know. The public relations firms are not limited by that. They distort the facts and send simplistic messages. So, they sound more convincing than the scientists, if you don't know their tricks.

       turns out the global warming scheme is there to get socialism going, its been that way the whole time, awfully convenient that the people who initially pushed the "global warming" meme were socialists and the "solution" to global warming just COINCIDENTALLY happened to be socialism.  What are the motherfucking chances?

       And 10,000 years ago?  Were the Koch brothers responsible for global warming then as well?  Or was it ExxonMobil?

       You see what you're doing is blaming "climate science denial" on well funded evil men, you're pretending that we are being bombarded with propaganda to make us all doubt global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality that anyone with a TV or radio will agree with, is that we are being bombarded with global warming propaganda, not denial but 97% of scientists agree that humans are responsible for it.

       If the Koch brothers factor into anything at all here, it is controlled opposition.

       This is a distinct possibility.  If I'm not mistaken much of the world has already started taxing carbon dioxide emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what are they spending the revenue on?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I don't mind taxing pollution if you spend 100% of the revenue on cleaning up pollution.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you spend even 1% of that revenue on anything other that climate clean up, conservation or restoration then the whole pollution tax idea becomes a fraud.  IMHO.

       from some small-town newspaper, you can see how carbon tax is being sold as "revenue-neutral," which means "the revenue is returned to taxpayers."

       Returned to taxpayers, though, is probably code words for redistribution.

       No, redistribution of wealth is totalitarian socialism.  We don't want that.  It doesn't work in principle--only in theory.  If this were to be implemented, then the head honchos at the UN would become the hands in whose wealth is concentrated instead of business owners, but they would be saying, "it's okay, it's okay, because we're giving money to the poor, too."

       I see your point, but have to ask: if wealth is going to condensed into a few people's hands virtually no matter what, wouldn't it be preferably for the wealth to be in the hands of people who, at least ostensibly, intend to give some to the poor?  It's not like the poor of the world have much to lose.  I suppose the UN could try to take even more wealth from the poor than is being extracted from them now, but that seems unlikely and impossible.

       It would be your wealth going to third world countries, that's the plan laid out in Agenda 21, you don't want that.  If you live in the US and you make 30,000 a year, you are in the top 5% on the EARTH.  So it will be coming from your pocket.  The ultra wealthy are the people PUSHING this idea, so don't count on it hurting them in the least.

       Pollution is bad.  Of that, I have no doubts.  But I'm not going to agree to pay another form of tax without 100% transparency that the revenue from a carbon/pollution tax won't just be absorbed into the bloated inefficient government spending nightmare we already have.

       Here is the problem:  Our technology is rapidly advancing, but it isn't "ready" yet as it isn't cost-efficient enough to use on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you end up with is the government giving their friends like Jeffery Immelt a bunch of money to put up shitty windmills all over the midwest farmland and fuck it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the kicker:  At one point, obama made a speech about how smart this type of thing was and that the windmills will "pay for themselves in just 20 years!"  Turns out the service life on those is only 12 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all just a transfer of money from the poor to the rich through more debt and taxation of the slave class.

       I don't know that I "forgot" to mention solar outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very likely that solar outputs have a direct effect on weather conditions here on earth, its counter logical that solar output wouldn't have an effect on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, there are definitely other factors.  I would speculate that there are so many factors that precise predictions of future weather on earth would be impossible to make.   Especially predictions that start talking about the year 2100 and beyond like many of the global warming people make.

       Technically yes. Every photon takes millions of years to even leave the core of the sun and be ejected into space, but that is semantics. Ice ages do not occur over a span of 2 years.

       True. Usually, when there's an issue of science that's important to public policy, the government convenes a panel of the top experts in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the first panels were convened, back in the early 1970s, the scientists said that there wasn't enough information. By the late 1970s, they had built models that said that there was going to be global warming, but the models were very simple and many of the parameters weren't known very accurately and the models assumed that the unknown factors would stay the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the early 1990s, much more was known and the panels of the top experts in the field said that the climate was warming and humans were a major part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 20 years since then, we've learned even more about the climate and the scientists keep getting the same answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you decide to ignore consensus and, instead, go by the opinions of the top experts who have been specifically tasked to study the issue, you get the same answer.

       The governments--all of them-- have been hating the answers they have been getting all along. It's a problem that is very expensive to solve and requires international cooperation to be effective. It's a nightmare. It has costs for everybody, but particularly large costs for some very powerful players. The benefits of acting are actually very large, but spread out over so many people and over such a long period of time that few people will actually perceive a benefit. There's little incentive for any politician to do the right thing. It's unlikely to win him votes or campaign contributions.

       Don't you find it the least bit suspicious that "the same PR firm" from the well known merchants of death are being used to very transparently deny global warming?  You see this as proof that oil companies are behind global warming denial.  Guess what, we still have to buy oil even after a global carbon tax is put in place.  You think the oil companies are going to foot the bill?  Lmfao!  The people, the consumer, the taxed to death poor will foot the bill!
      </p>
      <p>
       The Koch brothers and the merchants of death being involved in the "denial" is controlled opposition to further enforce the view that they want you to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       They give you 2 reasons to support a global government "world peace and the environment" then the same fuckers give you 3 reasons to hate the opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh look! How conveniently easy to debunk the opposition since they used the same PR firm that the tobacco companies used, which there also happens to be a feature length film detailing how corrupt they are"

       Please show anyone still afflicted by the CAGW delusion this article. It's short, to the point, and puts things into much needed perspective extremely vividly, even for the non scientific types. It shows all the inconvenient data the climate science establishment has been hard at working hiding in the past to bolster their..ahem..."theory".

       Thank you for this post!! I initially bought into Al Gore's global warming hoax. And until recently, I still thought that your everyday average joe contributed his or her part towards global warming. However, I've since woken up and after research have come to the conclusion that "climate change" is not some new thing nor is it something that will be stopped by this new tactic or whatever. I, too, am someone who cares for the planet, their environment, nature and I do believe in respecting the Earth...but I don't think that the car I drive is going to kill it. In fact, if anything, it's probably those damn chemtrails that are doing more damage than anything I do in my daily life!

       turns out the global warming scheme is there to get socialism going, its been that way the whole time, awfully convenient that the people who initially pushed the "global warming" meme were socialists and the "solution" to global warming just COINCIDENTALLY happened to be socialism.  What are the motherfucking chances?
