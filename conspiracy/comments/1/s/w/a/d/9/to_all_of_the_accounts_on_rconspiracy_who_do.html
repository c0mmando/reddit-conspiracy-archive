<p>The best way to respond to that would be to say <em>&quot;Yes I understand that shills exist and it is a huge issue for free speech on the internet. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rhxqd/flashback_to_2010_the_militarys_persona/">Here is a list of links that anyone can peruse</a> so that we can all agree that they exist and need to be exposed.

<p>Why don&#39;t I see you posting in r/cookies militantly defending brownies as the superior snack? It isn&#39;t like your histories are a secret. We can clearly see that all you do is tell us that every single thread in here is not a conspiracy. So when anyone even suggests that you might be a shill, because why would you have this weird obsession with r/conspiracy and not r/cookies, all of the sudden I&#39;m an idiot because I don&#39;t have absolute proof that someone is paying you. </p>

<p>Anyway, I do have proof, but I don&#39;t think most people here saw this thread: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjjj2/whatever_theyre_going_to_blame_on_osama_bin_laden/cdyng7i?context=3">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjjj2/whatever_theyre_going_to_blame_on_osama_bin_laden/cdyng7i?context=3</a></p>

<p>(And I just compared that thread with the current top thread and clicked through the histories of all the users participating there. I don&#39;t see anyone who remotely resembles the odd shit I saw in the Bill Cooper thread. Must be a coincidence.)</p>

<p>And for anyone who doesn&#39;t already know, shills exist and the government has been admitting it for years. Reddit is a huge website, therefore it has shills on it. It&#39;s not that hard to figure out: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand this sub isn&#39;t meant to be an echo-chamber.  Not everything posted is convincing so the weaker theories get weeded out thru conversation/debate.  If you are shutting out the idea of discussing anything because your mind is made up already and anybody who disagrees with you  &quot;must be a shill&quot; what is the point of even visiting a public discussion forum?  Frankly, some of the more absurd theories make the entire community look bad if people think we all believe them so it is in our best interests to stamp them out if they don&#39;t seem possible.  In the end the ideas that make the most sense or have the most evidence on their side will prevail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why do they need to be exposed?</p>

<p>My indication of a good argument IS being called a shill. When people make an airtight argument disporving a conspracy the default responce is to call them a shill and disregard their argument because they cannot poke holes in it. IF a &quot;shill&quot; is arguing for a position that is entirely false and indefensible by anyone who isn&#39;t paid then it should be trivial to debunk their arguments.</p>

<p>the persecution complex of this place is hilarious, and thats why I come here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the point: A shill is not going to be allowed to spread awareness of shills. Responding to a person who accuses you of being a shill with a post similar to mine should prove to any normal person that you are not a shill. This also helps to spread awareness of this problem <em>and</em> stops the argument dead in it&#39;s tracks. What will a person say to that? Sure, maybe 1 or 2 really stupid redditors will find a way to still call you a shill, but the majority of this problem will instantly vanish for both sides of the aisle here if we adopt this as common practice. The only people losing out would be actual shills, so we should expect a bunch of people making this excuse and that excuse about why they don&#39;t want to use the method I described. </p>

<p>The only thing that will happen is we will all build respect and trust for each other instead of bitching about who is technically a troll and who is technically a shill. This community will never amount to anything if we can&#39;t at least unite a majority of us with a common understanding. We can hash out our differences more efficiently without all of the accusations. We still have a massive problem with r/conspiratard, (Coincidentally, they directly linked to this thread) but at least this problem can be easily dealt with. You don&#39;t even have to change the wording around if you&#39;re lazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you&#39;re speaking almost entirely in fallacies. &quot;When someone makes an air tight argument&quot; - not only that is a hypothetical that you&#39;re pretending has actually happened - it has probably never happened. Maybe in r/gaming but not here. The worst part is I spend an almost unhealthy amount of time here and I can count the number of times someone has been called a shill unfairly on one hand. Yet people like you want to paint this broad brush of the place like it happens all the time - just like the people that say &quot;nothing factual is ever posted here&quot; - it&#39;s not an argument worth challenging because it&#39;s so profoundly stupid.</p>

<p>The funniest part is that <em>your</em> persecution complex is what needs to be checked.</p>

There are a bunch of credible architects and pilots and physicists who said something other than the official story happened and it should be investigated again, but then u had people popping up saying that no planes even hit the building and it was really holograms or cgi.  That sorta claim then became associated with the truth movement making it much more difficult for the general public to support.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ro8os/this_happened/cdpaums">They&#39;ve openly admitted to doing so.</a></p>

<p>I agree with you, but I don&#39;t see why they would stick to that tactic only. See the comments in the Bill Cooper thread. It always seems like Bill Cooper and 9/11 bring out the guys who militantly defend the official story and call everyone else conspiracy lunatic nutcases and then upvote each other. </p>

<p>Like I said, bloated government, huge budget, the government admits to doing it, huge amount of people here...I don&#39;t know. I think it&#39;s obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse for what, exactly? This is how I see the reality of the situation. Compartmentalization works like this: In the Manhattan Project you had over 100,000 people working on the atom bomb. They were compartmentalized, as in teams of scientists were building things like smaller detonators, containment devices, etc. If you hire actors to pretend their child died- that&#39;s not compartmentalization. Those actors would know they&#39;re part of a conspiracy to fake children&#39;s deaths. </p>

<p>You can threaten people with consequences, and people are obedient to authority- but there&#39;s no purpose. There&#39;s a shooting there are victims families to interview. There would be no point, and the people planning the conspiracy would then have to forever worry those legions of actors wouldn&#39;t have a crisis of conscience and come clean or have a deathbed confession or write a letter to be opened upon their death. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense on any level.  I assume it&#39;s in response to this, &quot;Anyone else made privvy to the details is solely a detriment,&quot; but it&#39;s not a logical response. Any other people brought into the conspiracy is a detriment to the conspiracy&#39;s possible success. You discussing this on the internet doesn&#39;t indicate you know any details of what happened. If anything, as I stated above, it indicates you&#39;re obfuscating a situation with a conspiracy theory that is completely illogical, impractical, and unnecessary. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of shady stuff surrounding the Oklahoma City Bombing. Everyone who has looked at it questions why Andreas Strassmeir, &quot;Andy the German,&quot; a former resident of Elohim City and a German with strong ties to International Intelligence agencies was involved and was allowed to flee to Germany when he was clearly one of the &quot;John Does&quot; being sought. You know what no sane conspiracy theorist questions- whether the upset people outside the blown-up building were actors or not. </p>

<p>How much insurance money and donations did they receive?  Would you also turn it down if your family was threatened implicitly?   How about if you believed in the ends so much that it justified the means for you?  </p>

<p>Also, they are re-using actors.  I&#39;ve seen them use the same ones a few times already..  enough with Posner and Rosen (anagrams no coincidence lol)  they sure like anagrams don&#39;t they.   </p>

<p>Posner and Rosen aren&#39;t anagrams. Even if they were, your theory is that they&#39;re using anagrams to tip you off? Why? </p>

<p>They&#39;re evil, so why not kill people and then not hire actors and not get caught. I didn&#39;t think you really believed this, but the talk of anagrams has me wondering. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no need for actors. They could only exponentially increase the chances of the conspiracy being unveiled. People have changes of hearts, find Jesus, write letters opened upon their death, etc, etc. </p>

<p>Like I said, it makes sense to ask questions about the OKC bombing, it makes no sense to accuse the people outside the bombed building to be actors. </p>

<p>What would convince you that the shooting happened if you think everyone you see on the news is an actor? </p>

<p>Why do you think Jewish Numerology plays into this at all? </p>

<p>This is the big question you keep dodging- what would it benefit the conspirators to hire actors (exponentially increasing the chances they&#39;ll be caught) as opposed to actually doing a shooting? </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t answer that, because I&#39;ve asked it over and over and the closest you&#39;ve come is &quot;ask them yourself&quot; when that&#39;s what you&#39;re suggesting? It&#39;s asinine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an important forum for reasonable conspiracies that can be backed by legitimate evidence which may be falsified if new facts come to light. However, there are also lots of beyond crackpot ideas thrown around which in my opinion lower the quality and integrity of actual conspiracies which warrant attention.

    <div class="md"><p>the trolls are wasting their time trolling any real believers, its the other people casually reading that are the real targets. to confuse onlookers and distract and dilute a topic.</p>

<p>the shills come in many forms, most are wet-behind-the-ears types with not much world knowledge, just a list of talking points (and FPS gaming history to boot), they tend to flee (delete account/posts) when seriously challenged, others are professional paid PR writers, sometimes with knowledge of the topics under discussion, they tend to waffle on in excruciating detail to distract and sideline a discussion.</p>

<p>the obvious question is why people who are not conspiracy types BUT hang out in r/conspiracy and talk against/about conspiracy when they claim to think/know everything is pure coincidence... they cannot answer that question truthfully.</p>

<p>a true conspiracy reader/researcher knows that not everything is tin-foil hat territory, just some of it, the interesting thing is what that something is, and who is busy defending the official story...</p>

<p>(in one thread elsewhere connected to a legit news story, one of the junior trolls admitted in passing he/she was on a police/fireman facebook page...) </p>

<p>the shills and trolls by their nature and presence, show that certain topics (even 60 year old news stories) are important to people in power and people with budgets.</p>

I read that in the early 2000s. Sometimes you have to dig harder than simply reddit searching/googling &quot;NSA spying threads&quot; The info is there, my friend. Seek it out.

<p><strong>They may actually be spying on you.</strong> After Gabby Giffords was shot, I was on Huffington Post and some asshole troll made some horrible comment about her so I offhandedly said &quot;IF Obama gets assassinated, I am going to burn down all the Republican&#39;s houses in my town&quot;.</p>

<p>Apparently that is a huge national threat, or they know Obama is going to be assassinated, because a few days later I had 3 FBI agents at my door talking to me about internet threats. They had pretty much poured through my entire facebook and I do say a lot of anti-authority/govt bullshit.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this also when the middle eastern countries were falling over facebook induced protests.</p>

<p>I took my warning seriously. I watch what I say. <strong>I assume that my computer is probably being watched. Flying may interesting. My speech is not free.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The old &quot;echo-chamber&quot; argument. Seen that around a lot lately.</p>

<p>Would you consider <a href="/r/xbox">/r/xbox</a> or <a href="/r/ps4">/r/ps4</a> &quot;echo-chambers&quot; because they enjoy their hobby? Or just sharing commonly known information among themselves? Just because there is no citations to all of the library of congress to satisfy &quot;skeptics&quot;, doesn&#39;t mean people are not in the know. Those who badger constantly for information clearly are in the wrong place if they don&#39;t even know about the topic being discussed, and militantly defend the opposite of a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Like the OP said: &quot;Why don&#39;t I see you posting in r/cookies militantly defending brownies as the superior snack?&quot;</p>

<p>Also, I may be wrong but I would really find hard to believe there is a sub called <a href="/r/cookietard">/r/cookietard</a> which&#39;s sole purpose is to debunk the delicious recipes in <a href="/r/cookies">/r/cookies</a>.</p>

<p>There goes my point, over your head.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1svc2k/this_is_how_sams_club_shipped_my_ps4_plastic/">Here is the top post</a> over in <a href="/r/ps4">/r/ps4</a> at this moment.</p>

<p>225 comments, pretty much all agree that Sam&#39;s Club, among others, are shitty retaliers. Can you hear the echo? Because I can&#39;t seem to find anyone standing up militant-style for Sam&#39;s Club, or even claiming the package was faked by OP, or told to ignore his lame attempt at ruining the store&#39;s image.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like this is kind of exclusive to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This is why:</p>

<p>Debating PS4 is not a threat to The Powers That Be, criticizing the government and theorizing about cover ups, is. That&#39;s why 50 comments saying &quot;fuck the government&quot; is an echo-chamber, and 200 comments saying &quot;Sam&#39;s Club sucks&quot; is not.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sslob/food_for_thought_shills_are_buying_old_accounts/">This is a prime example</a> of the cancer taking over this sub.</p>

<p>Getting back to my reply which you responded to, do you think I&#39;m wrong about the &quot;echo-chamber&quot; theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I think you are vaguely correct about this echo chamber theory. It pisses me off whenever someone spouts the &#39;shill&#39; line because it is lazy and detracts from the point in case, even if a dissenter is a shill you should destroy their argument through discourse, not a strawman (apologies for referencing logical fallacies, which are one of my pet hates!)</p>

<p>I do think though that people should accept that the things in this sub are by their very nature outlandish, &#39;out there&#39; or unsubstantiated and people should look at them with an open mind, rather than being belligerently brutal about them.</p>

<p>Case in point, chemtrails.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the whole chemtrails thing is total bollocks and I honestly would need some serious evidence before I gave credence to those posts. That doesn&#39;t give me the right to reply to every chemtrails thread with a simple &quot;bullshit&quot; reply though - I&#39;ll just read it and if it sounds like nonsense I won&#39;t participate. No need to downvote or call them liars or mental or anything.</p>

<p>This sub needs a bit more moderation, not as in mods doing stuff but a bit more moderation as in people should be more moderate with their views and replies and interactions, and should stop swearing at each other and calling people shills.</p>

<p>If something massive was to come out, I&#39;d want this sub to be the people to find and document and collect the evidence, but as it stands they&#39;d probably ignore the topic in hand and have a twenty page shit-show arguing with one another, which is dissapointing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my 2p as a true fan of this subreddit.</p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;m pretty skeptical of a lot of stuff on here, but I read/post here lots because I enjoy entertaining alternative ideas, I think that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is a pretty shitty sub, akin to <a href="/r/cringe">/r/cringe</a> and the like. </p>

<p>I guess you just have to remember that the internet is big and full of all flavours of people from the saintly to the common or garden dickhead/bully and people who discuss outlandish things are an easy target for people who seek to feel better about themselves by dictating  their ideas on others.</p>

<p>In all honesty, I think it&#39;s a far better tactic to just ignore them. But also to not reel out the &#39;shill&#39; response any time your ideas are questioned.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful point and well stated. Unfortunately, this is not how the majority of posts and comments look on this sub. </p>

<p>Im a scientist, first and foremost. I like to follow the scientific method to uncover something. The way it works is like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask a Question</li>
<li>Do Background Research</li>
<li>Construct a Hypothesis</li>
<li>Test Your Hypothesis by Doing an Experiment</li>
<li>Analyze Your Data and Draw a Conclusion</li>
<li>Communicate Your Results</li>
</ul>

<p>What ends up happening more often than not in this subreddit is something more like this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a blog post from someone who shares a similar anti-government bias.</li>
<li>Post this to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> </li>
<li>The majority of <a href="/r/con">/r/con</a> members then support this post because it reaffirms their own anti-government biases. </li>
<li>The information that was once an opinion then transforms into fact.</li>
<li>Anyone that then disagrees with this fact becomes a pariah. </li>
</ul>

<p>And while it&#39;s nice that the sidebar says &quot;this subreddit is a thinking ground, above all else we respect everyone&#39;s opinions and ALL religious beliefs and creeds,&quot; The reality is far less utopian.</p>

<p>I would LOVE to see more open communication about issues, but it has to be done in such a way that someone with a dissenting opinion is not ostracized over it. </p>

<p>Perhaps its just the nature of the subject matter that drives such passionate people to believe so strongly in their convictions. But its this passion that encourages others to poke fun at these individuals. A militant conspiracy theorist that refuses to use logic or reason, or disavows any solid evidence is an easy target.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell you what: In many instances -- say 9/11 -- the science to <em>prove</em> the &#39;official conspiracy theory&#39; wrong is indeed settled. Demands by the extremely obtuse to <em>lay it all out for them</em>, over and over and over again, are therefore not warranted, yet the detractors consider non satisfaction of their demands an intellectual victory, when it&#39;s merely a testament to their intellectual laziness.

    <div class="md"><p>well actually it has been refuted and discredited. but the relevant paper was written in french. there are various science-blog-type sites that criticise the paper, and the criticism raised are valid(i&#39;ll get to a few I consider important in a moment).  </p>

<p>and Jones/harrit didn&#39;t do this, and Scientists are not generally going to expend resources double checking the science of a non science paper. That would be like expecting scientists to formally refute every claim of ghosts, or aliens, or monsters in the closet.  </p>

<p>The paper itself is - from the point of view of a phd chemist (my focus is certain classes of drugs and drug delivery mechanisms) with some experience in materials analysis- poor. its not really terrible, just poor: the process as of analysis as described in the paper is simply not capable of determining if thermite (or some similar explosive/incendiary) was in the dust. (and thats if you accept that the dust samples used were from wtc7, or even from 9/11, or even from new york for that matter). and no one should simply accept that on face value). In fact: the analysis described is not capable of pinpointing any particular material/component of the dust.  </p>

<p>Its worth noting that harrit is not an expert in electron microprobe analysis (EMPA/EDX/SEM) and this was the first time that he was an author on a paper that used this particular measurement method. This - to a qualified chemist - is a big deal: having a phd in a science does not make you profiicent in all things sciencey. and harrit is far from proficient (if that paper is anything to go by).
here are some of the most glaring problems.   </p>

<p>Chemistry hats on please, but the first one is simple:  </p>

<p>-the paper simply identifies characteristics of a material found in a &#39;sample&#39; . The red/gray chips have displayed certain characteristics that are displayed by any number of other materials which you might find in any 100 year old city: paints, adhesives, rust (yes just normal steel rust!), various industrial coatings, cleaning agents...etc..etc. so the point is jones/harrits paper stopped well short of pinpointing any one particular material. and by &#39;well short&#39; I mean like saying that you walked 2 flights of stairs from the ground floor of wtc1 but telling people you reached the roof.  </p>

<p>-The Al slugs would give inhomogeneous background Al signals in the EDXA spectra. This was not considered or discussed in the paper. There could be no or little Al in the red-layer. (I never heard of a materials scientist using Al slugs as a sample holder if you want to analyze for Al!)  </p>

<p>-The carbon adhesive tape will give inhomogeneous background C signals in the EDXA spectra. This was not considered or discussed in the paper. There could be no or little C in the red-layer.  </p>

<p>-There is as much or more Si (silicon) in the EDXA results than Al in all the red-layer results and Si and Al are closely correlated in their spatial distributions (e.g., their Figure 10). No probable explanation is given for this. This is not consistent with the presence of metallic Al.  </p>

<p>-Oxygen (O) is more closely spatially correlated with Al and Si than with Fe (e.g., their Figure 10). No probable explanation is given for this. This contradicts the conclusion of the presence of metallic Al.  </p>

<p>-No effort was made to estimate the Fe:Al elemental ratio in the red-layer. Synthetic thermite or nanothermite would have a ratio of 1:1. The point is never discussed.  </p>

<p>-The exothermic peak in the DSC traces occurs at a temperature (420 C) approximately 90 C below the temperature for the thermite reaction. No explanation is proposed for this. Chemical activation energies of known reactions cannot be so sample dependent, whether nano-sized or not. This is not the thermite reaction.  </p>

<p>-In the reacted product (after heating in DSC), no Al-oxide is observed as a residue, as required by the thermite reaction. No explanation is given for this.<br/>
The obvious needed measurement of X-ray diffraction was not used to confirm the solid mineral species (oxides or metals). This is unacceptable in a materials chemistry paper. This is not considered by the authors.  </p>

<p>-Much is made of the fact that Fe-rich spheroids are present after reaction but there is no discussion of the grey-layer or of the origin of the Si-rich spheroids. Heating causes many things and there is an exothermic reaction so the conclusions about the presence of Fe-rich spheroids (which are reported to contain oxygen) as evidence for the thermite reaction is tenuous.
Now, all of that is base don the assumption that the sampels are &#39;representive of the dust from the wtc7 alone and not subject to any contaminants&#39;.  </p>

<p>But having written that is there an alternative proposal that would explain the results? i.e. if jones/harrit didnt got far enough to pinpoint the specific materials what else could possibly give such results? well: as i said before many things. To pick one for no particular reason: rust.
steel rusts. and when steel rusts in a humiid building environment it grows a crust composed of layers of diffrent Fe-oxides and Fe-oxyhydroxides: micro-layers with layers of different Fe-oxides species (wustite, maghemite, hematite, etc...etc..). In a humid atmosphere the outer layers will be Fe- oxyhydroxides (stuff like goetite, lepidocrocite and akaganeite). Teh latter 3 Fe-oxyhydroxides have the same chemical formula: FeOOH, and difer only in their crystal structures. These Fe-oxyhydroxides typically form as nanoparticles and have the same needle and nanoflake-like morphologies as observed here.  </p>

<p>When these Fe-oxyhydroxides are heated in a DSC they undergo an exothermic reaction of &#39;dehydroxlation&#39; (which jsut mean the loss of an OH) and so are transformed from FeOOH to Fe2O3 (i.e. hematite) at a temperature of approximately 400deg (C). The temperature of this transformation can vary depending on exact chemical composition, and on the crystal structure, but it is always at approximately 400deg.  </p>

<p>Steel contains Carbon and Silicon which would end up as the oxidation products, especially mas the aforementioned oxyhydroxides.  </p>

<p>In order for the papert to have passed peer review the following (at the very least) shoiuld be considered:  </p>

<p>-They should prove that metallic Al nano-flakeswere present using Xray diffractoin (or electron diffraction) -they realy should be A LOT more careful in their EDXA analyses. Its likely they would&#39;ve seen FeOOH not metallic Al. -they could also (and should also) make some nanothermite, then measure its DSC trace and look for the Al-oxide residue after reaction.  </p>

<p>TL:DR- joens/harrits paper is poor and does not describe a methodology capable of identifying a specific material. Not even nano thermite.

<p>While that has, in my opinion, already severely tarnished your e-reputation, I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you at least possess an undergraduate degree worth of knowledge of <em>physics</em>, and direct your attention to the undisputed free fall of WTC7 -- which, hopefully needless to say, would violate the laws of physics, were it not for controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Whatever means were employed to pull it off are secondary to that <em>established fact</em>. Period.</p>

<p>I do try and be a bit better than that though usually, and try and remain civil, i must admit sometimes i can be horribly snarky sometimes. You can see how people would use <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a venting post, it has nothing to do with shilling and everything to do with just being a pissed off human looking to have a pop at someone/something they consider ridiculous.</p>

<p>plus, shills arent very difficult to spot, the truth is not on their side and it shows, because it forces them to use other tactics to accomplish their goals. because in any argument where two rational people use logic and adequate evidence, the truth will ALWAYS win. the court system relies upon that fact.</p>

<p>shills tend to use shallow, generalised responses designed to incite anger and conflict to derail the discussion, and discredit their target by trolling them.</p>

<p>they have a profound love of using fallacies in their replies, resorting to strawman arguments and ad-hominem attacks, attempting to draw people into verbal fights and change the subject rather than continue discusing the &quot;sensitive issue&quot; that they are trying to suppresss. </p>

<p>This entire thing makes you sound really fanatical and radical, question authority or the accepted story should really be more about objectively examining both sides and discussing both sides, not taking an absolute opposite.  Are some things our government has done conspiracies?  Yeah, and there&#39;s evidence to show that.  Is everything they do a grand conspiracy to control the population?  No and it just sounds crazy to say that.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Would you consider <a href="/r/xbox">/r/xbox</a> or <a href="/r/ps4">/r/ps4</a> &quot;echo-chambers&quot; because they enjoy their hobby? Or just sharing commonly known information among themselves? Just because there is no citations to all of the library of congress to satisfy &quot;skeptics&quot;, doesn&#39;t mean people are not in the know. Those who badger constantly for information clearly are in the wrong place if they don&#39;t even know about the topic being discussed, and militantly defend the opposite of a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t I see people posting in r/cookies militantly defending brownies as the superior snack?&quot;</p>

<p>Also, I may be wrong but I would really find hard to believe there is a sub called <a href="/r/cookietard">/r/cookietard</a> which&#39;s sole purpose is to debunk the delicious recipes in <a href="/r/cookies">/r/cookies</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1svc2k/this_is_how_sams_club_shipped_my_ps4_plastic/">Here is the top post</a> over in <a href="/r/ps4">/r/ps4</a> at this moment.</p>

<p>234 comments, pretty much all agree that Sam&#39;s Club, among others, are shitty retaliers. Can you hear the echo? Because I can&#39;t seem to find anyone standing up militant-style for Sam&#39;s Club, or even claiming the package was faked by OP, or told to ignore his lame attempt at ruining the store&#39;s image.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like this is kind of exclusive to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This is why:</p>

<p>Debating PS4 is not a threat to The Powers That Be, criticizing the government and theorizing about cover ups, is. That&#39;s why 200 comments saying &quot;fuck the government&quot; is an echo-chamber, and 200 comments saying &quot;Sam&#39;s Club sucks&quot; is not.</p>

<p>Get it now?</p>

<p>Weird how you guys always question the theory presented, and not the &quot;official&quot; version. It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re paid government apologists!</p>

<p>Are you guys using the same script with slight modifications for each account/handler? Time to get a new one.</p>

<p>Your whole tone makes it very hard to be polite to you. You seem to be very good at attacking people without just cause. You jump to conclusions about people without no information</p>

<p>None of this is an attack just constructive criticism . Read our dialogues that we have had and you will see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I have some words for you. Your recent post has caused some real disruption and concern for us. You are panicking people who are best off clueless. My advice is to stop digging so deep. You might find things that are best left buried.&quot;</p>

<p>I find the usage of the word &#39;us&#39; to be strange since this doesn&#39;t appear to be from any admin or mod. The account that sent it was created minutes before i got the message so obviously a throwaway. </p>

<p>Also, saying that people are &#39;best off clueless&#39; alludes that there may be some truth to my post.</p>

<p>The whole thing is very suspicious. I messaged him asking who &#39;us&#39; was and a few other questions. The only reply i got was &#39;the Illuminati&#39;. Which doesn&#39;t really say much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand there are for sure shills out there. My only problem I find with this sub reddit is that people are so closed minded in the opposite way of most of the sheeple they claim to be against. EVERYTHING has to be a conspiracy nothing just happens. I agree there is definitely shady and outright illegal shit the governments of the world over do BUT there are also crazy people out there that just do CRAZY shit for the sake of them being CRAZY. There are shitty back room deals but there are also coincidences. And yet anyone who believes that something may have been a coincidence is blind or a shill. I ask questions in both directions just because something is presented to you here or through the main stream media doesn&#39;t mean you have to take it as gospel. Ask questions about everything and go into everything with your eyes open and your head on a swivel.</p>

If enough people adopted this strategy, I think this sub could at least be tolerable. It doesn&#39;t even have to be a long reply- just something akin to what I proposed. When someone calls you a shill, it feels like an insult, and that is probably why it is going to be annoying to give them a well-thought out and <em>nice</em> reply back to them.

<p>I would agree with you if it weren&#39;t for the fact that <em>that&#39;s the whole point of this subreddit.</em> To look at evidence and determine the facts. The simple fact is, a lot of conspiracies have only a small amount of evidence backing them up. That is why debate and disagreement are all but required on these topics. I believe very few conspiracies, but I post here to see if there&#39;s any evidence to change my mind on a topic, or to try to convince others with my own info.</p>

<p>To me, the instances of both of those things are very very low.  Once i saw someone saying we already knew everything Snowden said and i criticized him and I think he&#39;s wrong, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a shill, just a dude who&#39;s wrong on that issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just thinking out loud here. (I&#39;m sure you agree that shills exist and they are on Reddit. I believe I laid out a perfectly reasonable argument that supports that) Since shills exist, and all that would be necessary would be one person with 50 accounts (for this sub), if I was the &quot;shill,&quot; I would attempt to guide other people into doing part of my labor. So setting up a sub and using a few alt accounts to guide the thoughts and behavior over there, then linking to specific threads over here for vote brigades, would be an obvious route for me personally if I was tasked with the job. Or maybe just partially hijacking the direction of the sub. Perhaps r/conspiratard was legitimate, but now it&#39;s just disgusting. I saw a thread about a guy whose friend became a &quot;truther,&quot; and the top comment was &quot;keep an eye on him, you might have to report him to the authorities because he might be crazy.&quot; Then further down I saw one with a guy telling the OP to call the police on him because he&#39;s a truther and he might be dangerous. I don&#39;t see why you would even post there. </p>

<p>I have only really paid attention to this sub and conspiratard for about 2 weeks, but that doesn&#39;t make sense to me. I can imagine someone fucking with you guys just to get a rise out of you all.  Ignoretheshill comes to mind.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re probably just exaggerating and being clownish, but even if it&#39;s serious it&#39;s not horrible, just silly/stupid.  And cmon I don&#39;t judge you for commenting here, and i&#39;ve seen some really awful comments.  There&#39;s a comment from a few hours ago on a thread in this sub that says someone should kill obama, and there was a thread a week or 2 ago where someone said someone should blow up a vehicle near where i work.  Not to mention holocaust denial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am convinced that powerful people do everything in their power to ensure that the tables are tilted for their benefit. I feel this force applies in financial, legal and geo-political matters. If any of us were &quot;born in the right bed&quot; it would be almost impossible to see the world through the eyes of the 99%. </p>

<p>JFK and 9/11 were probably the root cause of hugely beneficial societal shifts for powerful people. I cannot prove these things, but the logic is on the side of the stories and evidence squelched by MSM. I also feel the Arab Spring &amp; OWS made a huge difference in the awareness levels among the general population. The fact that TPTB are attempting to lock it down is the logical response to their perceived anarchy among the proles.</p>

<p>Aliens and reptilians are much harder to have a definitive feeling about. I think there must be life forms elsewhere; however, if aliens wanted this planet or it&#39;s resources, they would just take it. The technology to travel distance in space would mean obvious military strength over us.</p>

<p>I try to be open minded and agnostic about anything on this sub. The open debate and discussion of this sub is one of it&#39;s best qualities. There are no sacred cows. I have little faith left in the people in charge. Statism is running rampant throughout the world. Religion, military action, oppression seems to be everywhere. Slavery may have just evolved to having financial shackles on a much larger group of people.</p>

<p>As a species, we are doing horrible things to each other. Perhaps we always have. The communication capabilities today make awareness of this instantly possible. I know that I have two teen aged kids and I am often fearful of their future. Things are getting worse. When they are approaching 50, this world will be vastly different. I hope it will be for the better - but, most likely it will be much worse for individuals.</p>

<p>I do not think many come to this sub to fuck things up, although some do. Those that do this are often the last to see societal shifts; they are often paradigmic thinkers. The outcome for having a closed mind has been shown time and again through history.</p>

<p>David Icke and the Info Wars blow hard make the entire sub a target. It is called &quot;contaminating the well&quot;. They may even be planted to make thinking outside the box sound silly. I really think people are looking for answers. I also think people are afraid. If you cannot support an opinion, perhaps it should be held, not posted. These are the growing pains of a unique and interesting sub.</p>

If you think that spreading information and stopping the shill namecalling dead in its tracks is a bad idea, I guess you&#39;re free to have that opinion. I never said you have to copy paste it exactly. I just think it&#39;s funny because a shill would presumably not be allowed to spread awareness of the existence of shills...Is it really that hard to do that?

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the deal op. People in this sub don&#39;t want to agree with other they want others to agree with them. A kind of superior attitude. One of the main reasons I stopped posting in here. If you read this shit and worry about all of what is said in here it will make you a hatefull mean and spitefull mother fucker that no one likes.</p>

<p>I quickly changed after the dc shutdown and the trucker strike. I was there and at the same time reading the goddamn posts in this sub. About how the police  where mistrating the protestors and how the truckers were really making a differance. Pffff was no different then the media. </p>

<p>The protesters were being fucked with cause they were next to the gate going into the white house. Yeah cops gonna fucm with you. Plus in here you woulda thought they had riot police in full fuck up citizen mode pfffffff there was 4 on horses and maybe 10 on the ground. They asked nicely and I mean real nice about 10 times to leave and dumbass people were spitting on them and shit. Yeah you won&#39;t hear that in here.</p>

<p>Plus the truckers protest was 3 semis and maybe a handfull of cars that made like 4 laps on the outterloop of the crosstown. When I saw the downright non supports but how all these mofos wanted to have change but didn&#39;t wanna get up from there keyboard I said fuck it why care if they don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Now I understand some wanted to due to lack of money  to travel. Yeah I was one of them and I found a way cause I wanted to start change. Pfffff won&#39;t happen everyone wants to bitch and moan and groan but that don&#39;t make a damn bit of differance just makes you bitter.</p>

<p>I come in here from time to time to see what is going on that I didn&#39;t hear about, but I check out how liget every story is before I start to form an opinion now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are going to have to learn that there are good cops and power tripping cops. Now cops are just people like the rest of us and gotta have a job too. I am sure protesting with others woukd get them in some kinda trouble.  </p>

<p>We all have a boss and contrary to popular belief we as citizens are not it. I have only encountered 3 dick head cops in my life and I am 34 now. I agree maybe cause I don&#39;t fuck around where I shouldn&#39;t but still. I have had the pleasure of meeting many cops.</p>

<p>We as citizens are fed up with shit and well cops enforce these bullshit laws so it is natural to blame them. Why act like a dick to a guy or woman doing there job. Do you act like that to anyone else like say firemen? Or even rescue workers? </p>

<p>How about the people that provide you with electricity? I mean it is a job just like a cop has one too. Now you wanna hold police to higher standards cause of the responsibily they have sure makes since I do to but on the flip side of the coin I relize they are human. Try to do that and it will make life easier trust me.</p>

<p>Now tsa fuck tsa I don&#39;t care about them.</p>

<p>The theory is that these are actual parents of dead kids</p>

<p>So everyone you see on the news is assumed to be an actor unless it can be proven to you that they are real people. I see. Even if you can&#39;t explain a reason why anyone, anywhere would benefit from them being an actor. Uh-huh. </p>

<p>What would convince you that the shooting happened if you think everyone you see on the news is an actor? </p>

<p>Why do you think Jewish Numerology plays into this at all? </p>

<p>This is the big question you keep dodging- what would it benefit the conspirators to hire actors (exponentially increasing the chances they&#39;ll be caught) as opposed to actually doing a shooting? </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t answer that, because I&#39;ve asked it over and over and the closest you&#39;ve come is &quot;ask them yourself&quot; when that&#39;s what you&#39;re suggesting? It&#39;s asinine. </p>

<p>My indication of a good argument IS being called a shill. When people make an airtight argument disporving a conspracy the default responce is to call them a shill and disregard their argument because they cannot poke holes in it. IF a &quot;shill&quot; is arguing for a position that is entirely false and indefensible by anyone who isn&#39;t paid then it should be trivial to debunk their arguments.</p>
