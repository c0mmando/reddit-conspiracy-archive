       This is the artifact in question:

       It was discovered deep in a cave in Ecuador.  It has an ancient writing on it's underside known as "Pre-Sanskrit."  It is the oldest known writing in the world and has appeared all over the world on numerous mysterious relics (The Bible alludes to this in the story of The Tower of Babel, built in the most ancient times when all the world spoke one language).
      </p>
      <p>
       This thing completely blows the lid off "the eye of providence" and the lie that equates the 13 steps of the dollar bill pyramid to the 13 original colonies.  The pyramid symbolism is far older than even the Egyptians!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what is mankind's oldest conspiracy?  It's our true history of course!  Most conspiracy folk are well aware of the symbolism that the "elite" or the "bloodlines" hide in Freemason architechture, the dollar bill, the Israeli supreme court building, etc.  The real mistake here is to call it "illuminati" symbolism when it is, in fact, something much older and grander.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is becoming increasingly apparent that the Sumerians were not the first civilization (even mainstream archaeology is admitting this with the discovery of Gobekli Tepe, a 12,000 year old site in Turkey).  It is also undeniable that the Alaskan land bridge hypothesis being the sole origin of Native Americans has been proven utterly false.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_contact">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_contact
       </a>
       The real nail in the coffin of that hypothesis is the fact that sweet potatoes (which were once native to South America) have been growing across Polynesia for thousands of years.  One last intriguing find is a ceremonial bowl named the "Fuente Magna" that was found in Bolivia but is unmistakenly engraved in Proto-Sumerian Cuneiform (interestingly almost identical to the Dravidians of the Indus Valley)!

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what exactly is our real history, why is this ancient knowledge so important to the elite, and why are they hiding it in plain sight?

       It was found by gold miners in 1984, along with 350 other very interesting artifacts (including

        this
       </a>
       a stone atlas of the world).  It seems like everything was purchased very quickly by private collectors (the fate of most ancient relics).  I would say the only thing that does lend itself to the authenticity of these pieces is that weird Austrian guy, Klaus Dona, is an exhibition curator for an Austrian museum and that is how he managed to get his hands on these pieces.  He'd be putting his job at risk if he was showing proven fake pieces.

       Yes I've heard numerous people have found "Golden Chains" in Scottish coal mines.  Also, they found a quarry where many of the Stonehenge blocks came from.. 260 km away in Whales. (Not implying Stonehenge is in Scotland.. just close geographically)

       I know little of the Mormon faith, but if the Jaredites represent a real race of people then I would say it is possible.  Interestingly it is speculated that if the Tower of Babel existed, it almost certainly would have been in Sumer or Babylon.  It is said god confused their language, and they abandoned the tower and split up across the World.  This coincides nicely with the Fuente Magna bowl, which is engraved with Sumerian cuneiform which is almost identical to the writing of other civilizations such as the Indus Valley people.

       Basically, Mormons believe after Jesus was raised  from the dead in the middle east, he came to a tribal people in the Americas. Beyond that, they have dietary restrictions, believe in marriage for "all time &amp; eternity", which means if a marriage is "sealed" &amp; righteous, the couple goes on to become the new Adam &amp; Eve of a planet, then become the gods that birth all souls on said planet. They also believe the sealed couples must wear specific underwear w symbols as protection.

       is Klaus Dona's entire presentation on ancient artifacts, the Ecuadoran cave bit starts around 25 minutes in.  It does drag on at points but he reveals a lot of mysterious and interesting relics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another absolutely mind-blowing recent discovery is that of "Adam's Calendar" in South Africa.  It is a grouping of stones used as an astrological star-map calendar similar to Stonehenge.  But the date the stars line up precisely to the stones.. is around 150,000 years ago.  All around the site of this calendar they have discovered
       <strong>
        millions
       </strong>
       of peculiar circular stone outcroppings.  They were initially brushed off as cattle stables for nomads, but the sheer number of them just doesn't align with the long held belief that until recently, South Africa was very sparsely populated.
