        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;ve been lurking a lot here, and I&#39;m trying to wrap my head around the timeline.  Correct me where I&#39;m wrong, but this is what I&#39;ve got so far...</p>

<p><strong>Year / Event</strong></p>

<p><strong>????:</strong> 40-100 crisis actors are hired to portray the parents and siblings of the eventual victims.</p>

<p><strong>????-2012:</strong> 20 children are selected as victims.  They are removed from their families, and custody is given to the crisis actors.  One by one, the crisis families assume new identities and move to Newtown.  They assimilate into the town, have jobs, attend school and live lives as normal families.</p>

<p><strong>2012:</strong> The shooting is staged, and the children are removed from the crisis families.  They are either given back to their original families, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1st3iw/multiple_sandy_hook_victims_seen_alive/">given to new families in Newtown and re-enrolled at Sandy Hook Elementary</a>, or sold into slavery.</p>

<p><strong>2013:</strong> Crisis families continue live out their lives in Newtown.</p>

<p>Is this the basic gist of it?  If you have any corrections, I can add those to the timeline above.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p><a href="/u/grandmacaesar">/u/grandmacaesar</a> suggests an alternate timeline in which the children already belonged to the crisis families, and were removed from those families on the date of the shooting.</p>

<p><a href="/u/ZoinksJeepster">/u/ZoinksJeepster</a> adds a theory (not his/her own) that the children still belong to the crisis families, but the younger siblings never existed in the first place.  Old photos of the older siblings were used by the families.</p>

<p>Seems to already be some fragmentation on the timeline, so this would be a good time for people to step in and set the record straight!</p>

<p>You seem to be working overtime to promote strawman bs.  Is this your job?  Because it appears to be your job.  A normal tv-worshipping person who didn&#39;t believe Sandy Hook was a hoax wouldn&#39;t be on here commenting and posting about it.

<p>Wouldn&#39;t take 40-100 families... Only one classroom worth of kids (or however many were shot?)... Say 20 or less. Everyone else would believe based on these people&#39;s accounts.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t account for the only-children, or the children that didn&#39;t have older siblings.  Where did those kids come from originally, and where did they go?</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying they&#39;re crisis actors, but they did lose their children?  I&#39;m going on the many threads in the past (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/15c40f/more_actors_from_sandy_hook_no_tears_no_grief/">1</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/154sse/more_victim_actors_in_sandy_hook_has_the_phelps/">2</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/16rmqh/tell_me_the_odds_on_this_one_4_different_actors/">3</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ccto0/more_sandy_hook_actors_beg_for_gun_control/">4</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1586op/sandy_hook_actors_not_a_single_tear_shed/">5</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1586op/sandy_hook_actors_not_a_single_tear_shed/">6</a>) about Robbie Parker and other parents being actors and having no emotions.</p>

<p>So to help me correct the timeline: the actors were either placed in, or already lived in Newtown, and they each had a child removed from their family, but that child did not die in a shooting.  Correct?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what my boss has to do with any of this.  This seems to be more tactics from the <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/05/twenty-five-rules-of-disinformation.html">25 Rules of Disinformation</a>.  I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re accusing me of working in an office where I communicate personally with you for money?  If you want to talk about my <em>actual</em> job I&#39;d be more than happy to.</p>

<p>No, I really do!  That&#39;s why I&#39;m offering you my phone number, or to video chat with me on Skype.</p>

<p>I could just name any company here, and you can say &quot;sure, likely story&quot; and move on.  If you want to Skype, I can show you employee IDs, tax stubs, and we can just generally have a nice conversation, if it can be done on good faith that you just want to know more about what I do, and you&#39;re not using the conversation to harass me on or offline, or use screenshots of the conversation to try to &quot;out&quot; me.  I&#39;m sure you can respect one&#39;s need for privacy, and understand that I&#39;ve been through the ringer with doxxing before, and I don&#39;t want to go through that again.  Does that sound like a good plan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man oh man oh man. I can&#39;t believe this.</p>

<p>Why is your conspiracy right? Why didn&#39;t it happen the way the &quot;liberal NWO media&quot; said it happened?</p>

<p>Dear lord almighty it&#39;s great to be a skeptic but do you not realize the pain people go through when losing a family member? Especially one who is shot in a school shooting? Even more so when they&#39;re constantly being hounded by every single well-known media outlet in America?</p>

<p>Oh wait, you&#39;re right, I apologize. 40-100 crisis actors hired to portray the parents and siblings of the eventual victims are paid millions to keep this quiet, right? Wow! And to believe that none of them are a whistleblower!</p>

<p>How many people are hired so far? 40-100? I can&#39;t believe that so many people spend <em>years</em> assimilating into Newtown, CT culture. Some of them were there years before, so that means that they&#39;ve been planning this for 40+ years! Nixon was REALLY worse than Hitler, obviously preparing this false flag attack.</p>

<p>Think about how many people must&#39;ve been involved! The actors! The crisis families! The people staging the shooting! All those cops! All those other children! Wow! We&#39;re not talking about 40-100 people being paid to act, we&#39;re talking about <strong>thousands of people being paid an excessive amount of money!</strong></p>

<p>Can you imagine selling the poor 20 children though, given back to their original families? Man oh man isn&#39;t it possible that one person in the world looks like another? Oh wait not an option lol someone was stupid enough to have them shown on national tv</p>

<p>I feel bad to those kids sold into slavery. It&#39;s not like black market dealers have morals and would ever think about becoming a whistleblower. </p>

<p>Anyways, OP, about your original question, no, I do not know the rest of the timeline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize your error by assuming that this sub maintains one cogent timeline/theory about the events, right? This seems to be a common misconception with various users. This is not a single body that proposes alternative, concrete details about events. It is less about postulating than it is about finding the errors in what had been &#39;officially&#39; revealed or told to the people of this country (United States), as well as others throughout the globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an undeniable fact that only one set of events actually occurred.</p>

<p>It would be irrational to continue holding in a belief of the set of circumstances that did not occur.</p>

<p>I posit that conspiracy theorists should recognise the utility in causing their theories to converge, rather than continuing to diverge, by creating additional theories. How will divergence ever lead to the single set of events which are true?</p>
