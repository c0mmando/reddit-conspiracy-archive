       Months back my friend started making and distributing orgonite to people in our school for free to spread its energy. If you've never heard of orgonite, look it up, I honestly don't know much about it. Shortly after he began making orgonite, black helicopters would pretty much hover above his house several times daily. It was definitely weird but I didn't think much of it even after he has shown me several videos and pictures. He gave me a few pieces of orgonite and I had a few outside, one in my car trunk, and one in my room. Now, the black helicopters started showing up above my house several times daily and we live several neighborhoods away, separated my a freeway. Not only did they show up above my house, they started showing up at my work. I was a lifeguard at the time at a yacht club, so I was outside everyday, and several black helicopters (always the same model, if I hadn't mentioned that) would fly above my pool several times a day, sometimes even 3 choppers at a time in a line. Not sure what's up with these choppers but looking online it seems other people  that use orgonite have had run ins with the same model helicopters. My phone only has 8gb and I had several photos of these helicopters at one point but guess I deleted them all, except this one:

       From orgonite.info: They mix metal shavings with quartz and make little pyramids out of a mold:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Simple. Easy to make. Works continuously.
Turns negative energy into positive energy.
Purifies the atmosphere, detoxifies water, ends drought.
Helps plants grow better, repel pests &amp;amp; require less water.
Mitigates harmful effects of EMF radiation.
Disarms and repels predatory forms of life.
Inspires a pleasant demeanor and balanced, happier moods.
Frequently remedies insomnia and chronic nightmares.
Helps awaken your innate psychic senses.
</code></pre>

       That doesn't even seem plausible, but to each his own I guess.

       Happy to mail you a circular disk. It is only something one can experience to truly understand. The ones we aquire are made by a Chinese medicine man who lives in a pyramid on the top of Mauna Loa. They have double copper, monatomic gold, silver, gold, Tibetan lemurian quartz, olivine from Mauna Loa, and a rare earth mineral from the sea.Sounds crazy I know. I was a sceptic too.

       You replied three weeks ago to a post about orgonite. I am mailing out disks for free to a few people who expressed interest. If you are still interested let me know please. If not I will be happy to send one to another person. Thanks.

       I don't necessarily believe the claims made by orgonite proponents (without proof), however wouldn't be opposed to seeing it for myself and giving it a fair shot, objectively.

       PM me with info on where to acquire this material. While outwardly appearing to be nothing more than quackery, it has nonetheless peaked my curiosity. Generally, I'm always open to trying something once, within reason.

       Sounds good. I like the open minded approach to life. I was a sceptic too. I now own over 6 pyramids, a square and many circular disks. I'm meeting the maker tomorrow. I will buy some circular disks to mail a few out. It'll be after the new year until I have time to do so.

       Over 6 what? I'm confused. Can you put that into context? The applications I use mine for is griding my land for radiation, using to block EMF's, purifying water, gardening, toxicity removal, healing illness, protection, disipating negativity, and composting.

       Believe it or not ebay has a lot for sale. They are not hard to make. I think of orgonite like alchemy. And the person making it has a lot to do with the energies.

       I will ask him tomorrow when I see him about buying disks so I can mail them out to all the people genuinely interested. There are a lot of "recipes" online and simple how to vids. Orgonite to me is likened to alchemy. In my experience the shape, mineral contents, place they are made and the intent all imbue it with a myriad of combinations, strengths and applications. Please  save this thread and p.m.  me after the new year. I'll have to send them out after then.

       No problem. I believe the more people working with it the better. It is such an interesting thing indeed. I mentioned before, the shape, mineral/metal content, place it is made and intention have a lot to do with it.

       I'll ask him tomorrow when I see him. What roads he's near. He's between 7000 and 8000 feet elevation above Ocean View. Sorry for my lack of an accurate description. Here we as locals, in this context,  reffer to the top of the mountain as where the last houses at high elevation are. He is not at the observatory. He lives in a silver metal pyramid not more than 16x16.

       Many applications. Here in Hawaii we grid our land for radiation. We use a circular disk attatched to our cell phones, purify water, gardening and composting. My primary application is for EMFs and radiation.  It's on the border of metaphysical with science to back it. Google it. It's very interesting. Some use it for chemtrail busting, cloudbursting, dispelling radiation and EMF, etc. Shape of the orgonite, added elements and location it is made all have huge impacts on strength and applications.

       If the government was going to watch you, they wouldn't use something as obvious as an attack helicopter, Occam's Razor people.  Also, an Apache is a terrible platform for surveillance when vans are cheap and we have whatever succeeded the SR-71.

       I live near a run way, but I don't think it's military or air force. Pretty sure NASA uses it for pilot practice. My grandfather used to pilot for NASA before he passed away so I've been there many times and have never seen these helicopters, and they have never shown up until the orgonite did.

       There's not really enough info one way or another on organite for me to say much about it one way or another, so I won't. But why would anyone be watching you because of it? Why would they use blatantly obvious helicopters? Why did you accidentally delete all the evidence of this observation?

      <p>
       Are you near an airport or military base? Was there a major news/crime story in your area recently?

       If you read the comments in here you'd get a few of those answered. Concerning the pictures I had, I didn't "accidentally" delete it. I could have taken hundreds of photos of these helicopters, literally. They were at my house and job everyday. I deleted them because I have an 8gb phone, and I like my music. So, I deleted a lot of photos and other things to make room. The helicopter photos were deleted, but if you're interested you can simply google "orgonite and black helicopters" and you will get your evidence.

       Getting some PM's. Like I said, I don't know exactly how orgon energy works. I've just been one of those who have been harassed by these black helicopters. It's actually really fucking scary having these things fly over really slow everyday. One day on the way back from school there was a jet (one with weapons attached) flying very slow and low around neighborhoods in my area. It was scary as fuck, and I actually thought something was about to go down. I live near by a military field and seeing jets flying wasn't unordinary, but I have never in my life seen a jet fly so low and slow. I wish I got video of it..

       Start to worry when you get human tails and are approached and directly "questioned".  Aircraft in the sky is normal.  As prevalent as info on the interwebs is concerning orgonite, I doubt any alphabet agency is truly that interested in you.  I could be wrong though. Start documenting it well and archiving everything you get. If it still persists, go to your friend and find out wtf he is into.

       I have worked with orgonite for years. Never seen anything like this above my house. Strange. What does your friend add to the orgonite? We have monatomic gold added to our newest pieces. Double copper coils, a blend of minerals etc.  BTW who took the video? Just a random off youtube? Are you setting them up for chembusting? Or just carrying them?

       Not sure what he was putting in them besides different minerals and copper, I think he made different kinds for different reasons. Some for chembusting and some for the energy itself. Don't know who took the video, but there's several other videos out there with these black helicopters.

       Yes I tracked down the other vids. Not a whole lot but interesting. I would ask him to give you a list of what he puts inside. There might be something intetesting in his answer. Not many know of orgone and its many uses. It could be considered effective for controversial subjects if used in proper applications.

       Kind of disappointing yet typical to see people dismiss something without even looking into it. Yeah, I don't know if orgonite actually works, but I do know that orgonite attracts somebody's attention and they try to intimidate with helicopters. There's evidence of it all over.

       i'm sorry but either orgonite is bullshit, or there is a MASSIVE effort to suppress it.
      </p>
      <p>
       and if there was a massive effort to supress it, then you can be sure that the recipies for orgonite that you can find in the top 10 google search results for "orgonite" are going to be fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       any group that can send helicopters to monitor you, are going to have the power to take down a few websites and put up a few of their own websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       and if they are running "
       <a href="http://www.orgonite.info">
        www.orgonite.info
       </a>
       " then you can be sure that by visiting it, you've infected your computer with a virus which lets them access your files and monitor your activity.

       Amazing? Dunno about that, but certainly interesting. A very eccentric inventor gave me a bag of orgonite to put next to my PC once. Did it make a difference? I don't know, but he believed in it very strongly. There's plenty of compelling evidence for Reich's original work, but I remain sceptical of some of the claims of his acolytes who are obviously just out to monetize their 'improvements' on his ideas. 
Sadly, there is no objective way of testing if these things work, so no  way of sorting the pearls from the swine shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       as an aside though.... dude, you are not being shadowed by black helicopters. You're just not, OK? You think the Pentagon is spending $10k an hour keeping you under aerial surveillance because somebody gave you a lump of orgonite? Maybe you should run a geiger counter over it in case the guy added a few ingredients of his own.

       I am not OP. Just another orgonite user. I stated in the thread I have never had helicopters above my house or anything strange. I made an offer lastnight to mail out 10 orgonite circular disks to those genuinely intetested free of charge. I have had a huge request from people. That was me. Not OP.

       I actually got to experience an orgonite wand today.  I thought it was BS and that people were just making up the "feeling."  But, when I held the wand pointed over my palm making circular movements, after about 15 seconds of making circles I started feeling a popping feeling inside my hand like there was little jolts of electricity.  I gotta say it was super weird and I don't think it's too far fetched to say these things actually posses the power to move energy.  If you ever see an orgonite wand in person, give it a try!

       So test it:
      </p>
      <p>
       Do the same thing with a similar-looking wand that's not made from orgonite. What's the result?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now gin up some kind of case you can put either of these wands in, and not be able to see which one you have. Try doing this with the cased orgonite wand. Assuming it still works, then do some random trials: have a friend flip a coin to choose putting the orgonite wand or the fake in the case while you can't see, then flip a coin again to decide whether they tell you it's orgonite or the fake. Record your results, then compare with their records of what they handed you, and what they told you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the effect in the orgonite, or in your belief in the orgonite?

      <p>
       ...actually now I kinda want to do this experiment myself.
