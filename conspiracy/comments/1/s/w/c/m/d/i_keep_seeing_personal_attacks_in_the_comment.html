    <div class="md"><p>What if it&#39;s not shills but just the way most people react to questioning the official narrative? That&#39;s a scary thought for me. Gotta remember a lot of people on reddit weren&#39;t even out of elementary school yet when 9/11 happened...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I HATE to play the shill card, like I&#39;ve deleted 10 paragraph responses before just to not accuse a person of being a shill without digging into their profile more.</p>

<p>You are not a shill, but this would be a great thing for them to say as it&#39;s genuine ( which gives it away to me as being from an actual personal account which yours very much appears to be ).</p>

<p>I must correct you though as according to the wikipedia page, the median user is male age 25-34.</p>

<p>That means that a majority of the users actually were out of elementary school, I myself was in 7th grade which is most definitely the first year of junior high, not elementary school.</p>

<p>Everybody does it differently for some insanely stupid reason, and fuck them because they&#39;re all wrong except for how it is done in my town. Preschool ( if you want to ), Kindergarten, Elementary 1-3, Middle School 4-6, Junior High 7-8, High School 9-12.</p>

<p>Trust me when I tell you that a very large number of people in the 90s generation are extremely skeptical, especially when it comes to the government.</p>

<p>I fear only of the younger children who are being intoxicated with absurdly concerted propaganda from every front, and it&#39;s insane because it&#39;s all pyramid illuminati shit. You know, the fucking yolo swag who gives a fuck about anything but themselves generation.</p>

<p>I know people have always said &quot;You damn kids&quot; but seriously this time, there is something fucking wrong with these kids.</p>

<p>I really do believe that people are just losing their minds lately, like they don&#39;t have any common sense and they don&#39;t even give a shit and the things they believe are just fucking insane, based on no logic whatsoever.</p>

<p>TL;DR - The human race is suffering, and unless we all come together to work towards bettering our world, it&#39;s just going to keep getting shittier and shittier until it turns into one of those horrifying sci-fi movies where evil people using technology make the future suck balls ( and that&#39;s already happening so we need to act fast ).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they are falling for the online deception. The shills create a false &quot;consensus&quot; online and make everyone who questions authority out to be a nutcase. When 9/11 happened, it was about 50/50 and nobody took the name calling seriously. We all laughed at O&#39;Reilly for his shitty name calling. </p>

<p>We had our debates online back then, and even though it was sometimes brutal debating, both sides took each other seriously. Now we are absolute nutjobs to the younger generation and don&#39;t even deserve the chance to speak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they love taking the top comments of a popular submit, you always know they&#39;ve done it because it will be a rubbish boring comment but for some reason will have hundreds more upvotes than all the rest, then someone else will reply to them with another pointless post which will also have many upvotes.  These people know that most people only check the first few comments, their job is to censor what real people think, or at least push it down into a harder to reach area.  </p>

<p>Once you look closer you&#39;ll see it&#39;s the same people who appear in the top comments and who are also deployed to debate you when you mention one of the words which activate the software which deploys the poster e.g. vaccines, climate change, 9/11, nwo etc</p>

What I mean is this whole Snowden business, it&#39;s a game of Chess, we (the people of the Internet) are being fed a piece, all very tempting to accept it, until you realize that if they scare 50% of the conspiracy people off the Internet since they are scared of being tracked down, we effectively lose our Queen (in Chess terms).

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1fam9n/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1fam9n/</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget about that great gem revealing how Elgin AF Base is the most addicted city.</p>

<p>I think that ever since they realized that people were starting to catch on to the fact that they are deploying shills, they started doing that temporary undisclosed nondescript no address bullshit where they pay people to come into those offices to do social media targeting work or whatever buzz word shit they want to call propaganda.</p>

<p>They also pay people to do it from home obviously as that&#39;s far more cost effective.</p>

<p>Remember, it&#39;s a game, and they have WAY more money than we do, and that&#39;s how you play the game to win, because you can use that money to make all the other players do whatever the fuck you want, like tell their friends they&#39;re crazy for thinking the government would ever hurt its&#39; own people. Cause you know, that&#39;s never happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize in advance for rustled jimmies, but the conspiracy theory community in general shares some of the blame for our reputation as raving crackpots. I even find myself constantly unsubscribing from this sub every time things get too crazy for me.</p>

<p>There are shitloads of conspiracies against us, there is evil in this world that the average person doesn&#39;t even have the slightest inkling of, but not EVERYTHING is a plot to enslave humanity.</p>

<p>I personally feel Occham&#39;s Razor needs to be applied a little more often.  Unfortunately it does lead to abandoning some of the crazier theories, but in my experience, it does justify most of the obscured truths we believe.</p>

<p>There are shills, there is also an effort to paint all conspiracy theorists as loony (so the public does the job for the shills), but let&#39;s do our best to inject some rationality into our discussion. We have just received the greatest vindication in our lifetimes with the Snowden leaks.  Let&#39;s take advantage of it and win more people over, rather than dismiss everyone who isn&#39;t quite willing to follow us from &quot;the government spies on us&quot; to &quot;reptilian overlords blew up the WTC.&quot;</p>

<p>(Apologies to those who do believe that one.  I don&#39;t.)</p>

<p>I would just like to see it become more difficult for the public to write us off as irrational nutjobs, and no one is going to do that for us but us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you have to understand, most people on reddit (and in general) are oblivious to politics and world events so they literally can&#39;t process that type of information. When they hear that the government is spying on them, the first thought that goes through their brain is &quot;cool&quot;. They then go back to call of duty, sudoku, or keeping up with the Kardashians, completely unfazed by that which they aren&#39;t interest in (in this case it is political criticism)</p>
