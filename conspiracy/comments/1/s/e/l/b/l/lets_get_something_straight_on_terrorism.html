    <div class="md"><p>Terrorism has always been nothing more than an excuse to phase in a fascist police state. Terrorism is inconsequential. Even if a few buildings got blown up, or a few planes, or a train or two, what would it matter? The effect would be marginal compared with the gross abuses of personal liberty we are now suffering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We aren&#39;t the terrorists. We are the insurgents. We are already occupied and dominated. We are not supposed to be people. We are supposed to be profit machines for the fat cats. Blindly working, buying, eating, repeating. They watch us to protect themselves. You learn to speak their jargon, you know what is meant. </p>

<p>A terrorist is anyone who is an adversary. Anyone who disagrees with the narrative. Someone who won&#39;t drool over the programming pouring out of the television. Someone who is trying to change things from the bottom. Sure there are some serious threats, there are dangerous people out there who don&#39;t care who they hurt. They can be used to make anyone look like a terrorist. </p>

<p>An Isolated incident means it is something they do, All the time. Just without talking about it. It&#39;s an isolated incident of a police shooting a dog, getting the address wrong on a raid, opening fire in a public place... It&#39;s an isolated incident of Emails and communications being read, of people being tracked via different means (credit cards, cell phone, car, cctv)</p>

<p>They would deem the founding fathers terrorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you so paranoid op? I for one have nothing to hide and personally don&#39;t give a flying fuck if I am being watched.  Yeah I know it isn&#39;t the thing to say in this sub but it is the truth. It took me some thinking after reading all the shit people say in here and one day I asked what the fuck are they gonna find?</p>

<p>Why even watch me? Hell I am more paranoid by police in larger cities then I am of the nsa, cia, or fbi. I myself am more likely to get my identity stolen buy some cyber cowboy then anyone in here is of getting tracked by the nsa.</p>

<p>All the shit they are talking about is for fear. It isn&#39;t for anything else. You know why cause fear is an excellent motivator.  Prolly the best cause you don&#39;t know what bad thing will happen if the boogy man sees you go to fast in a school zone. If he sees you flick a cig out the window. Hell you may start a forest fire and kill some poor family.</p>

<p>You think about it for a few minutes and everyone else that is gonna downvote this. What is the number one thing everyone has in common here? It is fear and makes you an even better consumer.  And money makes the world go around if you are not out there buying 6 months worth of mre&#39;s and 400 gallons of gas then what are you doing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right you are not helping them. Just have fun in life don&#39;t let this get to you all of it is bullshit. Wprry about your kids at daycare if they learned something. Go teach you dog to fetch a stick. Teach your cat to respond to their name. I build legos with my 4yo. That time is spend with him is the most valuable in the world. Even more so then seeing all the people afraid In here of the most difficult decision is to upvote or downvote cause they are to goddamn fearfull to post a reply.</p>

<p>There I said it and I ment it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have anything to hide either, but you&#39;re damn right that I&#39;m upset and fearful about what is happening.</p>

<p>And what is happening is that the agencies are running rough-shod over the Constitution. We have the 4th amendment, which guarantees our protection from unreasonable searches and seizures, our right to be secure in our persons, property, and papers.</p>

<p>You just keep on letting them progress. First it&#39;s &quot;security&quot; cameras all over the place, then it&#39;s warrantless wiretapping, then it&#39;s backdoors into corporate networks where they have unfettered access to our business with them.</p>

<p>You really want to see that progression continue? If you don&#39;t have anything to hide, citizen, you won&#39;t mind the camera in your bedroom, or in your child&#39;s bathroom, right?</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m being facetious, but where do you draw the line? When does it become unacceptable for you? </p>

<p>None of it is about whether you have anything to hide, it&#39;s all about social control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t mistake me, I don&#39;t entirely disagree with you, but we can&#39;t wait for our children to do something. By then, it will be too late.</p>

<p>Like I said, it&#39;s about social control. If you give them 10, 15 more years, without challenging them, without fighting to at least slow, if not stop, preferably reverse, this trend, there&#39;s nothing our children will be able to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See I disagree. I have faith that our kids will completely stop all this shit. I try to raise my hellion knowing right from wrong and seeing the gray area in situations. We are a family of helping those less fortunate in any ways we can. He is already practising these traits with others by helping other kids that are picked on in school and by helping elderly people do small tasks. </p>

<p>It is in your raising of children these traits shine thru adversity. I can tell you now he knows what his limits are and knows I am the end of the line when it comes to resolve in a problem. If daddy steps in there will be action so swift and heavy it can be measured on the Richter scale.</p>

<p>Not that I am a badass but I know how to get shit handled. I wish more people were like this and I am aware there isn&#39;t my only hope and may be bad to say is that they are dealt with by means that makes them a statistic.  Yeah it is harsh but these are harsh times and the only way I learned to deal with a problem is to eradicate it not talk and debate just take action and end the problem.</p>

<p>If I was causing a problem I would accept this fate there is no room for excuses anymore. Luckily I don&#39;t have to take action cause they are killing each other so fast now it is hard to keep count. </p>

<p>May have said some harsh things but I don&#39;t care you have your opinions and I have mine.</p>
