        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live in Rhode Island, in a state which has decriminalized marijuana. There was a kid (roughly 17-19) smoking a joint and two cops on bikes come up to him and slap the joint out of his hand and immediately start swearing at the kid &quot;your a fucking criminal&quot; is the first thing the first cop says to him.</p>

<p>At this point the kid is getting patted down by the other cop and he pulls the kids left shoe off which the kid then trips and the cop takes this as resisting and slams the kid into a wall bending his right arm behind his back, he&#39;s clearly in pain as he let out a yell. Now the cop starts kicking the kid&#39;s legs out from under him (like a leg sweep in mma) and slams him to the ground.</p>

<p>All the while the other cop is writing up a ticket (its a 150 dollar fine), which is the only thing they can give the kid as he only had a joint on him.</p>

<p>Now back to other cop who has now dug his knee into the kids back and has him in handcuffs. The other cop comes over and tells the kid that he&#39;ll be getting a ticket for possession of marijuana. The cop unhandcuffs him so he can sign the ticket all the while continuing on with the verbal harassment &quot;your the piece of shit that makes society worst off&quot; The kid signs the ticket and the cops ride off.</p>

<p>All of that for a fucking ticket. It&#39;s fucking bull shit. I wish I had recorded it because it was clearly police brutality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually we&#39;ve had very big crowds in the streets since 9/11.  The protests leading up to the Iraq war were pretty big.  Occupy Wallstreet had more than a few people hanging outside.  </p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t getting people into the streets, the problem is getting favorable coverage, or any coverage at all from the corporate media...who&#39;s job is to convince us that the establishment can be trusted to fix it all, we just need to vote in whichever D or R they push on us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I&#39;ve been thinking lately. After personally dealing with unnecessary police harassment, discrimination, and all those other aggressions, I feel it&#39;s time we begin blatantly letting the police forces in our areas Know that we no longer support them, whatever that means to you as an individual, and the larger community you live in. I say start calling the PD&#39;s anonymously, telling them they are no longer going to be able to get away with these atrocities, no longer in power. And when you see or have to deal with police brutality, it&#39;s time to get fearless. I advocate for violence only as a last resort, but I do feel it&#39;s time to get creative. Destroying their resources first of all, would be a good first step. People want police brutality to stop, but when it happens, do they physically intervene? How much more footage do we need to see? We get it, it&#39;s happening, every citizen knows. I want to see footage of the person who tases an officer who&#39;s brutalizing a citizen, handcuffing the officer to his own patrol car, and parking it in a ditch.</p>

<p>I understand why this fundamentally seems like the worst thing we could possibly do, believe me, I&#39;ve thought about it over and over again, and my only reconciliation is that we must fight fire with the occasional lighting bolt, but largely approach the situation that suits the unique situations of our towns, cities, and communities. Violence will happen in certain areas, I assume, obviously large cities come to mind, but I don&#39;t feel it needs to be sustained, or overly brutal. Only what&#39;s necessary to remove a viral threat to our lives. The time will come, I feel it in the air. And as much as we must be ready to do what must be done , we must be more prepared to stand together in solidarity, and more than that love, because in the end, we are together, trying to change the world for the better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many years ago in a town I lived the citizens managed to get a measure up for vote to create a policer of the police in official capacity.  The citizens voted it into law and a person was appointed.  They gave the person teeth to get into all the police records and to take action.  This in a town where complaints against the police had grown very loud and many abuses were making headlines.  The police responded by harassing the appointed person endlessly, trying to arrest her, following her around, threatening her, making internet pages against her.  It was a disgusting show of gangsterism.  She was unable to do the job and eventually the police got there way and the whole thing was given up on.  So even when something is done in an official governmental capacity it seems the police still manage to triumph.</p>

I don&#39;t click on self posts for facts and sources, theres enough of that out there that I spend my time researching as well.  When I click self posts on reddit, I make a leap of faith that not everybody who puts the effort in to come here and tell us a story that they saw or heard is lying, even if they dont have proof, and as important as facts are, you cant discount the human experience for learning about these people, bankers and politicians I assume you hate as well, since you are here.  Hell, I dont even have a camera phone still, so I personally would not have proof either.  And ive experienced and seen enough police brutality living in the US to know that even if OP is for some reason lying, cops somewhere are assuredly beating up on kids for smoking weed right now, so I dont really need proof.
