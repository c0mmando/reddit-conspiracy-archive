        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The Original Post</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>1) The first thing they did was take away r/all. </p>

<p>This took away the only tool for communicating <em>with</em> reddit <em>about</em> reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/all. Taking that away was the first step.</p>

<p>2) The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.</p>

<p>I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. </p>

<p>3) Once the subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.  </p>

<p>I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;.</p>

<p>4) The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent. </p>

<p>All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that <em>never</em> posted again.</p>

<p>5) Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed. </p>

<p>What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?</p>

<p>6) All of the proper &quot;checks and balances&quot; are now in place. </p>

<p>So now we are being fed an anti-Muslim/Islam/Russian/India smear campaign weekly. The amount of stories that demonize these groups is sickening to witness. And with minimal research you can see that most of them are hyperbole, sensationalized, and sometimes outright fiction.</p>

<p>But thats okay, when something goes against the &quot;US is good&quot; narrative, every detail is examined and the slightest inconsistency is used to dismiss the entire story. But that diligence disappears when the story is bashing somewhere else. And those who point it out are downvoted out of sight.</p>

<p>And people will say &quot;What are you talking about, people are constantly bashing the US in every thread&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes that is absolutely true. Because those people have decided to even out the score. When you have hundreds of fake accounts moving the narrative in a certain direction, then it is essential for people to come out and loudly counter-balance the propaganda.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.</p>

<p>Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. </p>

<p>And I believe this can essentially be boiled down to greed. Reddit gets billions of views. The people who run reddit are not the &quot;cool bloggers&quot; they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence. </p>

<p>And they know it. You should too.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1she85/how_reddit_was_destroyed/">This post</a> was front page of r/conspiracy at +500 upvotes and was quickly gaining momentum. Around 9am, US redditors began to wake up and upvote/add comments.</p>

<p>Then it disappeared. Not deleted. It was simply taken away. R/conspiracy mods claim to have no idea and common sense says someone higher in the reddit.com chain of command made it disappear. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sk5eu/my_top_rconspiracy_post_how_reddit_was_destroyed/">I immediately began to make a big stink about it</a> and many others supported and got involved. A few hours later, with zero explanation, the post popped into the &quot;new&quot; section of this subreddit.</p>

<p>If those who are using it are using it, it&#39;s likely because they like it. Someone who&#39;s not already using it isn;t going to notice a change in the layout, unless they start using it, which would come from a different source.</p>

<p>That different source, 9 times out of 10, is gonna be someone else who already uses it.</p>

Political comments may be removed, this one was.</p>

May I inquire as to why it was removed so that I do not make the same mistake again?</p>

it was a political comment and may be removed, thus it was removed.</p>

<p>Me</p>

Obviously, given the amount of political posts and comments on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> it would seem did an offensive comment would have to meet a certain criteria to be removed.
I&#39;m just asking for the guidelines for the criteria of political post that could be seen as offensive and need to be removed.
This way I will better understand how to use this subreddit.</p>

<p>I was referring to the typical behaviour of an anti-semitic <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> poster. Grandest-inquisitor is a good example.

<p>Reddit has been big business for a long time now, it&#39;s a powerful  influencer of opinion especially in young people rather than just and indicator of what  people think.    It&#39;s politics are strongly anti-government - whether coming from Left OR Right - and the authorities are quite simply not going to let that kind of thing go unchecked.  </p>

<p>Some of the excellent factual observations by posters here, about what sources are banned,  about Mod behaviour, about what happens to their posts, should leave us in no doubt that every major agency is here, every political party and every powerful Corporation and they are  here in great numbers using powerful technology to assert control of the message  you post and the message you read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind large corporate conglomerations compartmentalize their books.  Just because they keep reddit.com lean and &quot;barely profitable&quot; doesn&#39;t mean another agreement isn&#39;t in place that allows demographic data to be shared upstream to a corporation which can profit more handsomely from &quot;cost free&quot; information which is classified as an &quot;incidental&quot; to the operation of reddit.com on the books of Reddit, Inc.</p>

<p>On the books the sharing of data isn&#39;t even a line item.  It&#39;s in a contract somewhere.  They don&#39;t consider the data a &quot;cost&quot; so they literally don&#39;t account for it.  Their parent company gets access to the data, sells it for millions of dollars a month to advertisers, and the shareholders of Advance Publications, or whatever other corporate entity does the actual selling, see a profit and gain the benefit from the data. </p>

<p>And the whole time they can say &quot;reddit.com isn&#39;t profitable yet&quot; because it isn&#39;t.  Dole wouldn&#39;t make much money if they gave away their bananas to a parent company for free and tried to sell &quot;DOLE&quot; stickers.  Demographic data is more valuable than ad space.  Demographic data allows advertisers to constantly post images and links as native content without being called out.  And that&#39;s more profitable to whomever is selling the demographic data than any amount of ad rotation.  In fact, reddit.com limits the amount of ads in order to deceive us as to what constitutes an &quot;ad&quot;. </p>

<p>The rotating ads on the site are like the fee you pay the cable company for TV service.  They want you to think you are the <em>customer</em> when in fact your viewership is the product being sold to advertisers for millions of more dollars than your sad little $20 a month.  The product being sold isn&#39;t even sold by Reddit.com either.  The ads on the site are managed by Advance Publications.  </p>

<p>Advance Publications is selling our demographic data to those &quot;agencies and corporations&quot; you mention, while maintaining the ruse that reddit.com &quot;isn&#39;t quite yet profitable ... just buy some more Reddit Gold please&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of problems with this that I&#39;d like to correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) The first thing they did was take away r/all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>starting out with incorrect information. I think you might be referring to <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>, which has been closed for a good <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2011/10/saying-goodbye-to-old-friend-and.html">two years now</a>. That wasn&#39;t the &quot;only way&quot; to talk to the &quot;website as a whole&quot; anyway, just an all-purpose subreddit. <a href="/r/self">/r/self</a> is still there for what you want btw.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>been that way since <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2006/02/subreddit-fun.html">06.</a> that&#39;s basically <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/how-reddit-works.html">how reddit works.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> has never been one of the default subreddits</li>
<li>the purpose of <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> is to satirize reddit. during the election the general opinion of reddit was that Ron Paul was the new messiah (don&#39;t believe me? just <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=ron+paul&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">search around</a>, and <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> was making fun of them for it. </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.
All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that never posted again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>maybe all of the new accounts are actually just related to the fact that reddit is growing by the <em>millions</em> every year? maybe you&#39;re just seeing all of those &quot;shills&quot; because that&#39;s what you <em>want</em> to see?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the rest of your rant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>c&#39;mon, you don&#39;t see that reddit could actually be full of people that just have opinions different than yours? you just automatically assume that there&#39;s some kind of puppet master admin pulling all the strings or whatever? rediculous.</p>

<p>EDIT: true, there are ads, I almost exclusively browse on alien blue. however, one banner ad per sub isn&#39;t doing more than paying server fees, i guarantee you. that plus reddit gold MINUS hard costs doesn&#39;t equal much.</p>

<p>reddit.com and all posts were up and down voted by everyone and all readers got exposed to all sorts of information that the new owners didn&#39;t like. information that actually affected elections and bills in congress and businesses as say 1 million people sudden&#39;y learned of a new bill that was  horrible and all actually contacted the congress or they learned a health insurance company was screwing everyone so they got pissed or they found a new candidate they liked and all 1 million of them sent him donations and he rose to huge promenence and the establishment couldnm&#39;t get rid of him becuase he had a huge war chest (cough Kucinich cough cough)</p>

<p>so they had to subdivide the masses so the masses would not see what they already didn&#39;t want to see so the masses never learned any truth they didn&#39;t think they already knew is say r/conservative or r/progressive.</p>

<p>and then things were like they were before and the measses were kept fighting one anothe intheir walled off ignorance as they were only allowed the information the 7 th largest media family in the world who ownes reddit wanted them to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it should be more than a mere clone. How about rethinking the entire administrative structure? Quoting myself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One idea would be to implement &#39;earned&#39; privileges for users, similar to e.g. stackoverflow.com, which should incorporate account age in their privilege escalation mechanic, making shoddy sock puppetry ineffective and obsolete. Essentially, &#39;weigh&#39; accounts by their age, in part. Moderation privileges could then be obtained by regular users after a while, but every moderative action would be logged and public, so that, should a mod misbehave, there could be a &#39;motion of distrust&#39;, voted upon by the userbase -- again, according to their &#39;reputation score&#39; consisting in part of account age, which would lose the offender his account -- and all the time spent establishing it -- if successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, it&#39;d require some mechanic to weed out idle accounts set up to &#39;farm reputation&#39;, I suppose. Anyway, just throwing my thoughts out there...</p>

<p>Whatever form it takes, there needs to be a system of accountability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human nature dictates that people naturally seek attention from the group. Ignore that and your platform won&#39;t gain traction.</p>

<p>The day you get rid of cat ifIfitsIsits posts is the day the Internet dies.</p>

<p>The idea isn&#39;t to eliminate the karma whores, the idea is to limit the shills, ad company people and etc. Let people have their upvotes. Focus on a trained, reliable and trustworthy moderation team.</p>

<p>And make the actions of the moderation team open to the membership to be seen. Heck, you could even place a poll system for members to be redeemed by community vote. X members post was deleted by moderator action, but Y amount of members voted for its reinstatement.</p>

<p>Just an idea to curtail the Internet phenomenon of forum moderators becoming Little Hitlers.</p>

<p>The best way to make a group strong is by making each individual member feel committed to the overall health of the group. Involve the community in group decisions, invest each member in a way that makes them feel a part of something bigger than themselves and the community will support you back tenfold.</p>

<p>I asked sarah_connor twice yesterday</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sk5eu/my_top_rconspiracy_post_how_reddit_was_destroyed/cdypip0">1</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sk5eu/my_top_rconspiracy_post_how_reddit_was_destroyed/cdyphp0">2</a></p>

<p>and she did not respond, although she did indeed confirm the submission was in the spamfilter.</p>

<p>Earlier today I sent a PM  to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod mail asking to see the mod log for the submission. </p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>An admin did this and I gurantree the admins are threatening the mods here to stay quiet.</p>

<p>The reason for this is if it comes out reddit admins can manipulate the organic curation of content in this way the site will undergo a v4.</p>

<p>To you conspiracy mods I say; who do you fucking stand with? Them or us?</p>

<p>That&#39;d be too risky. The mods here would surely love to be mini-Snowdens and start posting any threats by the admins. </p>

<p>I used to believe in no moderation and letting people sort it out but it&#39;s too easy to corrupt a website by trolling.  Trolls need to be eliminated so people can freely discuss conspiracies, news, etc.  It should be very limited but people who only come here to hurl insults at the sub and disrupt add no value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree power corrupts and it&#39;s a legitimate issue.</p>

<p>I&#39;m torn and previously thought just letting users sort it out was best.  But the trolls are too disruptive and ruin many good discussions.</p>

<p>What site on the internet would allow people to spam comments there when they spent all their time railing against the site and mocking the users of the site at other places . . . and then when they showed up called them all stupid and derailed posts with inane comments and turned the site it into a shouting match?  It&#39;s not a thinking ground to air out different theories if you constantly have people shouting insults at you . . . I like debate and skeptical questions but this behavior is meant to disrupt and not enlighten.</p>

<p>Here are my solutions:</p>

<p>I would limit this banning/troll protection so as to limit potential abuses of power.</p>

<p>I would prefer to ban anyone that posts in <a href="/r/conpsiratard">/r/conpsiratard</a> discussing this sub.  And same for a few other similar subs, like subredditdrama, etc.  I think they should be able to appeal to the mods or users and ask to have the ban lifted if they can demonstrate good faith and promise not to troll and attack users and this sub.  </p>

<p>But maybe tagging these people with &#39;Conspiratard Troll&#39; and only allowing two posts a day would work too.  And taking away voting privileges.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re right though that any system is limited by the people running it and right now I have little faith reddit can fairly administer any of these rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve posted this a couple times now, but...</p>

<p>Because folks have a basic lack of understanding about how reddit works. I&#39;ve been moderating for a couple of years now so I&#39;m either corrupted and part of the system or I&#39;d like to think I know what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>One of two things happened:</p>

<p>1.) Admins are censoring. Blah blah blah. Doesn&#39;t show up in a log, etc.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2.) OP edited his post and the spam checker picked it up. If you don&#39;t know, the spam checker checks a post after every single edit. How do I know? Because there are some nights I&#39;d spend just repeatedly approving a single post because an OP kept editing it. Now, if you don&#39;t have anything in there to spam it, nothing will happen. But if you have something like a bit.ly link in there, it will be spammed every single time. And since this is the reddit-level spam filter, you can&#39;t turn it off or anything. I mean, you can&#39;t turn off the subreddit-level filter either, but at least you can train that one. It would explain why there is nothing in the modlog to be found. No mod took any action. Admin actions also show up in the mod log, but I guess if we&#39;re going with the conspiracy idea, we&#39;d have to assume they&#39;d use their admin powers to hide that. Why did it show up in the new queue? Because whenever you get something out of the spam queue, they put it at the top of new to give it a chance.</p>

<p>Believe whatever you&#39;d like, but there is a plausible explanation as to why this happened.</p>

<p>This is how it happens.</p>

<p>By using bots to lower the rank someone can effectively remove content without triggering any kind of alert.</p>

<p>Reddit is being gamed by bots constantly, whether it is software controlled or a meatbag driven system, it&#39;s being played.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be something I came across last night.  If you view a np link on reddit the np status stays with your browser for new tabs you open.</p>

<p>For instance here&#39;s a link I picked from the frontpage of <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>.  <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/FortWorth/comments/1skcel/2000_reward_for_lost_greater_swiss_mountain_dog/cdyp17e">link</a>.  From that page... click to go to other subreddit/posts or even your mail.  You are still stuck in the np zone.  (np = no participation so your votes and comments don&#39;t show up in the threads.)  It&#39;s like shadowbanning yourself until you log out and back in.</p>

<p>(you see np in the url - np.reddit.com as opposed to <a href="http://www.reddit.com">www.reddit.com</a>)</p>

<p>Because a post is thrown through the spam checker after every single edit. And a bit.ly link is something that would make a post get spammed. Could it have disappeared right after you added that?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me? Make your own subreddit and edit a post with a bit.ly link. I guaran-fucking-tee it will hit the spam filter every single time.</p>

<p>An easy way to figure this out is for the mods to give some voted representative of the &quot;users&quot; a temporary mod position with extremely limited permissions and let him/her comb the mod log for the where OP&#39;s post was removed. That would at least narrow it down to admin tampering or spam checker.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBanned/">http://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowBanned/</a></p>

<p>The way they do it seems really under handed to me. It feels like secret censorship and now that I know about it I can&#39;t imagine how often it happens. If you hadn&#39;t heard about shadow bans and all of a sudden people stopped responding to your posts, stopped answering your questions, or stopped commenting in any of your link posts you could start feeling pretty shitty after a while. This is their goal, to make you leave the site completely for having an opinion they don&#39;t like. That is pretty horrific if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wanted to mention, that what you describe, with various sock puppets and thread/discussion manipulation has been going on for a fairly long time. It used to be overtly obvious that a few people were manipulating mens rights usenet groups back in the mid 90s, and im sure these sorts of things happened well before that.. The sort of more political manipulation of mainstream news sites ruined a lot of mainstream news comments, and became blatantly obvious over the last few years. . It&#39;s a shame this is happening to reddit but that&#39;s the way of the internet. well, let us all know where we move to next, time to start over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to look far to see the sphere of influence and many people call it a &#39;bit or fun&#39; but it&#39;s evident when you start looking into comments made by moderators, their demeanour and just what they&#39;re in control of to see it isn&#39;t a bit of fun, it&#39;s serious. This is what happened on Digg. Liberal links and comments were silenced by big pools of power users down voting, ad hominem attacks and threats.</p>

<p>I saw what happened when the NSA stories started flooding in. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was removed as a default essentially hiding it from view to those not subscribed. <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> was censored as well and <a href="/r/syriancivilwar">/r/syriancivilwar</a> was infested with trolls calling for immediate war because of &#39;those poor people dying&#39;. It mirrors the exact same bullshit, shallow and invalid comments you get from &#39;experts&#39; on news panels. They have a clear agenda and any obstacle in its way needs to be shouted out of the conversation before the sentiments that are dangerous to them stick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been lurking around reddit for about 6 or 7 years and have also noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of thought-provoking, intellectual, interesting material. It&#39;s now all pics of cats and dogs and &quot;OMG look at this celebrity&quot;. There&#39;s nothing of substance anymore. I think this may also be part of the broader &quot;plan&quot; that&#39;s implied by aaaa222&#39;s post. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about issues that make you think citizen, here&#39;s a kitten, awwwww.&quot; </p>

<p>With that being said, does anyone have any suggestions for other sites to replace what reddit used to be? I used to come to reddit because it seemed to be a bastion of user driven content, no matter where that content came from (albeit there was a usual liberal bias). </p>

<p>Been looking for a good replacement for a while. Descent subreddits are few and far between..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It misses two key developmemnts that preceded these.</p>

<p>First the subdividing of reddit into subreddits rather than the original reddit.com which had the effect that people were no longer exposed to things they didn&#39;t already think they wanted to hear.</p>

<p>And when people resisted this subdividing and  continued to post on what become r/reddit.com becuase they didn&#39;t want to be subdivided into r/conservative or r/liberal the reddit owners actually shut r/reddit.com down to actively prevent people from coming together there. Everyone objected but they did it anyway.</p>

<p>Subdividing was huge.
Now the millions on reddit could never hear the story posted in an obscure subreddit that would have been voted up and changed their lives or the politics of the world.</p>

<p>They will just see cats.</p>

<p>at first they said &quot;don&#39;t worry!&quot; you should cross post to relevant subreddit  to spread the word but of course soon time rules stopped you from crossposting to multiple relevant political reddireddits even if they were relevant. Then the posts were auto censored if they appeared I  more than one place so you couldn&#39;t info others and let them have the chance to see if even if you did wait out the time limits.
.</p>

<p>And then of course was the introduction of moderators which of course was the opposite of what reddit was _ crowd moderated- reader self moderated by voting. That really was the icing on the cake that told us all what the real objectives were..</p>

<p>and of course the infamous shadow ban where they ban your post  but you take no notice becuase you don&#39;t know it.</p>

<p>Then they started censoring the top posts lists so even historically high posts were disappeared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are totally huge brigades of trolls that spend hours on here simply to push an agenda and mock users and conspiracies in general.

<p>It&#39;s not natural for instance that so many people have a thing for exposing anti Israel or anti Jewish bias so that they hang out here and pounce on a post or comment discussing these subjects (I have a troll that claims to be from Australia and not even know a Jewish person who is following me around and falsely claiming I&#39;m an anti-semite on posts having nothing to do with Israel/Jews).  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve discovered this first hand as I&#39;ve attracted a number of trolls that follow me around and harass me.  The mods don&#39;t seem to mind that half the people here are trolls and it&#39;s legitimate users (troll victims) that are usually banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Someone up thread complained that <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> was removed from a default sub as if reddit was censoring this viewpoint . . . but I have the opposite impression . . . these trolls/shills running reddit are pushing an atheist viewpoint and mocking religion.  And I say that as someone who leans atheist.</p>

<p>Heck, there was someone that made a post here the other day from <a href="/r/christianity">/r/christianity</a> (not a usual <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user) who asked why the mods at <a href="/r/chrisitianity">/r/chrisitianity</a> were mostly athiest and were so hostile to faith based Christians and tried to make that sub more of an academic sub than a meeting ground for believers.  </p>

<p>Most of the conspiratard trolls that haunt this sub push the atheist agenda and mock religious belief (except Judaism).</p>

<p>There are a few other subject matters where a false consensus is being pushed and manipulated as well . . . but religion and atheism is definitely on the agenda.  </p>

<p>Posts about sweet old ladies handing out flyers warning against Sharia law??

<p>They do take stuff down, for one.  And making it really difficult to find stuff is simply providing an illusion of freedom while <em>effectively</em> killing it.  They know it&#39;s more effective to hide and hobble something rather than openly killing it.</p>

<p>Plus, they do ban certain points of view.  The most recent one I can think of is blogger and other sites banning the Golden Dawn party of Greece even though they did not have any more of a &quot;hate&quot; or &quot;racist&quot; philosophy than the Republican party, and specifically disavow ties to Nazism (not that that point of view should be banned either).  I&#39;m not saying I agree with them but they should not be censored yet the media was very effective in censoring their unpopular viewpoint in this country.  </p>

<p>Other points of view are hidden behind &quot;hate speech&quot; or similar tags on youtube which you have to click through and has the effect of stigmatizing the speech.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Youtube was just an example. there are hundreds of youtubes on the web, this one is just the most popular right now.</p>

<p>Also, all it would take is a wave of angry users to flag a video or channel to get it taken down. considering how this golden dawn party is not popular at all, its not surprising. I can think of 2 nazi youtubers who have not been taken down; thus rendering your point moot.</p>

<p>Youtube is a private company with normal people in it, theyre not all &quot;in on it&quot; too.</p>

<p>Then the &quot;forces non-anonymous&quot; comment system that you mentioned previously is irreverent. No one can hide from the NSA, and just because the information is tracked, doesnt mean its stifled or limited. If TPTB want something, theyre going to get it, regardless of what it is.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, it doesn&#39;t make my point moot.  Golden Dawn represents a much bigger risk because it enjoys a lot of support in Greece and the region and it&#39;s much more important to render them useless as TPTB need to try to impose austerity on Greece.  Right and left parties risk joining forces and defeating the global financiers.  </p>

<p>Also as I said, Golden Dawn explicitly disavows ties to any neo-Nazi party so you&#39;re relying on the propaganda against them to make a point.  </p>

<p>Also, neo-Nazi parties have been controlled opposition anyway so it&#39;s actually consistent with their agenda to promote them in some ways (while also attacking them in other ways of course).</p>

<p>Furthermore, as I noted before, the American form of censorship is to not totally censor something but to diminish its impact.  They don&#39;t mind a few small neo-Nazi pages if the larger message can be controlled (e.g. look at post after post on reddit mocking neo-Nazis and making it seem like a big threat).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We actually agree on this point.  But I simply have found that there is much more subterfuge than you seem to be acknowledging.  I&#39;m mostly familiar with alternative leftist sites and have found many of them to be pushing an ulterior agenda (for e.g. Democracy Now and Al Jazeera and Noam Chomsky and Chris Hedges and Altnernet and Antiwar.com, etc.).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>For the entire 2nd portion, the Golden Dawn party has a plethora of ties to Nazism. From the hand salute, to praising other Nazis. The KKK say theyre not racists too, but we all know thats a load of hogwash. Simply because they disavow it doesnt take away from their views. Hell even Michaloliakos was a speaker to Forza Nuevo in Italy, a self proclaimed fascist party. He even hieled hitler at one point.</p>

<p>i dont follow up on Europe in as much detail as the states, and the GD could very well be distancing itsself from nazism today, but they whole heartedly embraced it in earlier years and only time would remove that stigma</p>

<p>But i digress, were not here to discuss our opinions on the golden dawn. My point is, ive seen quite a bit of racey comments, youtubers, blogs, vlogers and whatever else exists on youtube and otherwise. Some get taken down, some dont. im sure governments ask youtube to filter stuff from coming to their country, but id hardly say that Youtube is &quot;controlled&quot; as these are orders any website would follow. </p>

<p>The stifling of the media also has little effect especially on the internet. Otherwise, there wouldnt be so much political dissent. I dont know how old you are, but if you happen to know a 50+ y/o whos somewhat informed, they would be the first to tell you that political dissent in this country is higher than its ever been. That could be directly attributed to alternative media.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We actually agree on this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>im well aware of the subterfuge (good word, i like it) that goes on in its entirety, i just dont think of its as effective as you do, and that is a point i dont think either one will convince the other on. </p>

<p>Specifically speaking about leftist media (wouldnt consider Chompsky or AlJazeera alternative), they are more obvious about it. With the left and right constantly switching sides between &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot;, its now the lefts turn to push their crap, with the right being more unbiased in their reporting. The exact opposite happened when Bush was in power, where the left was being more central and the right were pushing neo-conservatism. </p>

<p>Also, just because there is propganda, doesnt mean it works. While it has worked in the past exceptionally, its grip has loosened with the growth of alternative media. My previous example of CNN only receiving much much less than a million viewers shows this pretty well. a good way to asses how effective propaganda is in an article, is to read the comments (also why many msm propaganda machines removed comments from their articles). Even on left leaning sites, people are calling out the BS. even MSNBCs forum section only has like 5 topics.</p>

<hr/>

<p>in anycase, we both agree, just at different degrees.</p>

<p>What you know about the Golden Dawn is heavily influenced by propaganda.  Do you know Americans used the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Bellamy_salute_1915.jpg">Bellamy salute</a> as well?</p>

<p>People are falsely alleging that symbols and other things show a tie to German Nazi party and it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Anyway, the Golden Dawn is anti immigrant and in that regard they my be &quot;right wing&quot; but frankly it&#39;s no different than many Republicans or the way other Europeans treat immigrants and actually Greece has suffered the most from immigration.  If there is one country that has a legitimate issue with immigration it&#39;s Greece.  </p>

<p>There has been all sorts of false propaganda.  I saw one photoshopped image trying to depict a new immigration facility as a concentration camp for instance (not only was the image photoshopped but American has some pretty nasty looking detention facilities for immigrants).</p>

<p>And like I said the most important issue in Greece is austerity and economic issues and the Golden Dawn is actually very close with many of the left as far as a solution.  </p>

<p>Also, Greece was defeated in WWII by the Italians and Germans and became a satellite government so there is going to be a lot of similarities.  Also, the stay behind NATO armies were very active in Greece engaging in false flag terrorist action . . . there&#39;s been a lot of meddling in Greece affairs and unfairly impugning the Communists and right-leaning people in order to push a pro West agenda</p>

<p>Like I noted it&#39;s done in subtle ways.  One, I bet like reddit that the voting or page views are manipulated.  Two, there are &quot;hate speech&quot; or whatever they call it, labels put on some content that are not viewable in some areas and at least stigmatize the content.  Three, using third party claims to take down content is an easy way to censor content.  New laws make it very easy to make these claims and Youtube will honor them.  I can&#39;t tell you how many 9/11 conspiracy videos have been taken down under this justification.  Four, many countries do limit what is available on youtube.  I routinely see people claim they can&#39;t see a video in their country.  </p>

<p>There is indeed the appearance of much more dissent today then there was 50 years ago . . . but in many ways we are more easily controlled. </p>

<p>yeah, in the 1800s. Golden dawn uses it <a href="http://content-mcdn.ethnos.gr/filesystem/images/20131007/engine/assets_LARGE_t_420_54047758_type12713.jpg">today</a></p>

<p>People are falsely alleging that symbols and other things show a tie to German Nazi party and it doesn&#39;t.   </p>

<p>And like I said the most important issue in Greece is austerity and economic issues and the Golden Dawn is actually very close with many of the left as far as a solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.  I guess I miss your point but oh well.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying a salute is a symbol that means different things to different people.  They live in a different culture.  It means something different to them than to us.  Propaganda effects the meaning of symbols.</p>

<p>They claim that there is no connection between Nazis and them.  So in other words you&#39;re purposely misreading a symbol for propaganda purposes . . . this is the height of intellectual dishonesty.  The fact this purposeful misinterpretation of the symbol is rampant in the West shows the prevalence of propaganda.  </p>

<p>And do you dispute that there are many on the left and right in Greece that want to join forces against international bankers?  Do you think Leftists would join Nazis?  Or maybe they view the international bankers as more like Nazis than Golden Dawn?</p>

<p>Also, people in the U.S. used the Bellamy salute well into the 1900s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what?  Yes, the propaganda campaign against Germany compelled the U.S. to make the gesture into a Nazi gesture.  Every country engages in war propaganda but at the end of the day it&#39;s just a symbol.  In our culture with our constant anti Nazi propaganda it represents evil . . . but it doesn&#39;t represent evil in other cultures.  It&#39;s not inherently evil.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be this simple of a person where you insist your propagandist caricatures represent the truth, can you?</p>

<p>An American may use a gesture that is totally harmless here . . . like showing the sole of his shoe to another person or something . . . that has a much different meaning in a different culture .  . . like an Arab culture.  There are many symbols and gestures that are offensive in one part of the world but not offensive in others.</p>

<p>You&#39;re engaging in cultural chauvinism by insisting symbols get to mean exactly what you in America claim they mean.  </p>

<p>Would you tell an Arab he has no reason to be offended by showing the sole of your shoe to them?  </p>

<p>And Greek people can try to &quot;reclaim&quot; their symbols and gestures from the NATO stay behind armies that used propaganda to enforce a victory upon them.</p>

<p>This is not a hypothetical problem. Curious to see if the code in Reddit’s public repository was what they had running in production, I found a recent post in a fairly inactive subreddit and downvoted it, bringing its total vote score negative. Sure enough, that post not only dropped off the first page (a first page which contained month-old submissions), but it was effectively banished from the “Hot” ranking entirely. I felt bad and removed my downvote, but that post never really recovered. Indeed, by manipulating the query string, you can find a strange purgatory where damned submissions slowly rot, alone in the darkness</p>

<p>Can you clarify this? I can still see it in your history, just not on conspiracy. That&#39;s exactly how a delete works, it makes it disappear from the subreddit. How is what happened different from deleting it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not really what I said, but to answer your question, not really. I understand why they exist and are used. I do think it would be better if it weren&#39;t the only type of ban, but it doesn&#39;t really bother me that it is. Especially considering how easy it is to get around the bans.</p>

<p>It just bothers me when people say stuff like &quot;secret shadow ban&quot; because shadow already means secret in this context.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like most of your complaints are general issues with mob rule. For instance jersey shore is on season 5 while firefly (and many other quality shows) don&#39;t last because they don&#39;t appeal to a mass audience. Which why jersey shore appeals to a mass audience is an entire other matter. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see number 6. Maybe I&#39;m missing it or maybe I live too much in the comments section, but I don&#39;t even feel like <a href="/r/ex">/r/ex</a>-muslim is anti-muslim. Obviously they sway people away from the religion, but many times through logical arguments that don&#39;t demonize anyone who wishes to peacefully practice. Same with <a href="/r/trueathiesm">/r/trueathiesm</a> ish it has good and bad days. </p>

<p>Then the whole accounts that post rarely.. I like to lurk, sometimes (like now) I&#39;m on the toilet and feel like replying. Many lurkers may create an account because they just had to post something, then went back to lurking. Sure many fishy accounts pop up, and many hail corporate Shit runs around, but I&#39;d like to think not everyone who posts on reddit has actively post all the time just be considered valid.. Then I&#39;d rather go back to the cesspool /b/.  </p>

<p>Oddly cesspool was already in my phone&#39;s dictionary.</p>

<p>Imho the biggest issue with reddit (crazy power tripping mods aside) is the algorithm that orders the front page. If you get downvoted by some douche browsing headlines in New your post is screwed. It&#39;s faulty, but I don&#39;t think intentional. Effective algorithms are hard m&#39;kay, but that&#39;s a problem way easier to correct than mob mentality. </p>

<p>We need more transparent modding, maybe even rotating or term limit style on bigger threads.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t even take me 10 seconds to find it through search. It&#39;s on your profile. It&#39;s in the sub backlog. You are aware that posts don&#39;t stay on the front page forever to allow new content to come up?</p>

<p>Would you bother citing sources? Just because a website has billions of views doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s making &quot;a LOT of money&quot;, quite the opposite; A popular website costs insane amounts of money to keep up and running. </p>

<p>Just because you have no goddamn clue how things work doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a great conspiracy against you.</p>

<p>And once this post disappears from the frontpage after a while, just as every other post, we&#39;ll have ourselves another &quot;hurrdurr dem meanies want to silence me&quot; post. Ungh.</p>

<p>Nobody ever denied there&#39;s a &quot;head&quot; running things. You think contributors is all it takes to have an active community? Who&#39;s managing the servers? Who is paying for them? Who keeps the code up to date and monitors the network traffic to counter dozens of attacks every day? The company Reddit Inc. and its 28 employees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you mean they took away <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>?  Why has everyone been calling it <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>?  Was there a second instance of <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a> that was called <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and then they took that away too? </p>

<p>Second, the behavior you describe is exactly the behavior of the SPAM filter.  I&#39;m not saying it was SPAM filtered, they may use similar internal functions with identical behavior for &quot;admin censored&quot; posts too.  The moderators of any subreddit can lie or be mistaken as well so it may have been in the SPAM filter and none of them noticed or would admit it at the time.  Maybe there is a higher SPAM filter that removes any grumblings about user-owned reddit. </p>

<p>By the way, they are monitoring and deriding those who bring up this information.  Even those who are allegedly only unpaid moderators are taking their time to track down and ridicule those who bring up the truth.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure why your post was blindly removed, if it was in fact done maliciously.  About two years ago the subreddit <a href="/r/theoryofreddit">/r/theoryofreddit</a> was bouncing around the idea of buying reddit.com from Condé Nast Digital and making it a user-owned cooperative.   I can&#39;t find the link, but it was the idea that killed <a href="/r/theoryofreddit">/r/theoryofreddit</a> and ushered in a new era of controlling and &quot;as long as we don&#39;t break Reddit, Inc&#39;s rules we can do whatever we want&quot; moderating.  </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JYug2GM.png">I recently brought this up</a> in <a href="/r/politicalmoderation">/r/politicalmoderation</a> and nothing was said for thee days in response.  Then, I think yesterday, a slew of comments came in all at once deriding my statements.</p>

<p>But note closely the point they chose to discredit.  As they always have in the past they completely ignore the real point they are discrediting, the user owned co-op idea, and attack me for something that they <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1h3dse/announcing_adminlevel_changes_discussion_threads/caqwwwy">present as common knowledge fact</a> (for reference <a href="/u/blackstar9000">/u/blackstar9000</a> was the moderator that sold <a href="/r/theoryofreddit">/r/theoryofreddit</a> to &quot;professional&quot; moderators shortly after the co-op idea gained steam).  They are trying, days after the fact and in a manner that makes their collusion obvious, to take control of the conversation and redirect it into an argument about paid staff <em>based on an assertion I never made</em>.  I stated rightfully that there is paid staff on the moderation team.  Not only is that verifiable by looking at the list of moderators, it has also been admitted by a former moderator.  That&#39;s pretty much the definition of a strawman argument.</p>

<p>Now, what does this have to do with your other thread?  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1she85/how_reddit_was_destroyed/cdxwnr1">This comment</a> was towards the top of the discussion thread.  What does it have in common?  The death of reddit.com.  The Dig exodus came to reddit on the collapse of integrity over there, and the same will happen when a better alternative to reddit.com shows up.  Reddit, Inc. knows this.  They have no defense.</p>

<p>They know that people with principles will eventually stop playing an unfair game.  Those without principles have no ability to discern unfairness and abuse because they have nothing to compare it to.  They want a bunch of unprincipled idiots to both moderate and participate.  It is actually more effective to annoy and harass those principled players and effect a slightly smaller yet less labor-intensive group of people to control and direct.  </p>

<p>Reddit is an environment where people voluntarily write content, and others voluntarily edit that content, and others voluntarily curate the edited content, and Reddit, Inc. pulls in revenue, and most importantly demographic data, as a result.  We have shown we are trend-setters.  That data is valuable.  Old Spice saw a 1000% increase in sales as a result of their native advertising campaign a few years ago.  Reddit.com may not be valuable to Reddit, Inc. from a profitability standpoint, but the conversations we have and the things we support/reject as a respective sample of the population are invaluable to advertisers, and I bet all that demographic data is available to the parent companies of Reddit, Inc. even if Reddit, Inc. isn&#39;t profiting directly.  After all, they need our Reddit Gold to run the site right? </p>

<p>All of the benefits of our hard effort provided for free to the &quot;community&quot; are enjoyed by a corporation.  If we move our free effort to another enterprise they lose the benefits of our labor.  It is that simple.  When we talk about moving away, they try to stop those conversations.  It does not matter if the actions of the lords of <a href="/r/theoryofreddit">/r/theoryofreddit</a> are acting on the order and compensation of their master Reddit, inc., or if they are simply protecting their position of limited authority, either way, there is an incentive to control and redirect conversations such as that one which you allege was removed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever thought as reddit becomes more popular the view changes?  I honestly think there is a shift in reddit, but I feel it&#39;s simply because as reddit grows in popularity it&#39;ll lose that minority that found appeal in it.  Maybe it won&#39;t change for the better, but to what the majority of users approve.  </p>

<p>Now as for censorship, atheism had massive rule changes that many people think was censorship, but I&#39;m happy to less posts that involve making fun of religious posts on facebook, or car crash images that were thank airbags not God.  It&#39;s not even that I&#39;m religious, I just think it&#39;s uncool to make fun of people for their beliefs.  But I simply unsubbed from them when I discovered I could.  I guess my point would be, when is censorship okay?  Is it censorship to downvote an offensive post till no one sees it?  Isn&#39;t the entire karma system just a form of censorship?  You need to get approval from the masses, and the masses are a mob of angry geese.  </p>

<p>Honestly, voting is always a flawed system.  Until we get smarter software the predicts what you like, we&#39;ll always have a censorship feeling in a system like this.  What you like, might not be what the majority likes.  That&#39;s more or less why there was subreddits, so at least the minority can go somewhere else, but as always if they become popular, the minority will get pushed out again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a false and contrived consensus.  The whole way this place is set up is to subtly push certain viewpoints or mock others.  Look at the voting system, as you point out.  If someone sees certain viewpoints get crushed on the main subs, or other subs for that matter, they will be hesitant to express that viewpoint for fear of being ostracized.  It&#39;s human nature.  So it&#39;s really easy to influence people by gaming the voting system here.  I have no doubt this is being done.  It&#39;s pushing a false consensus.</p>

<p>And the rule change to atheism was probably done to make the anti religion agenda much more effective.  It was getting so over the top that it was losing effectiveness and they needed to save it from itself.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that the Christian subs are moderated by atheists and Jews for instance (according to someone posting here in conspiracy for the first time after having a bad experience on christianity).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one should be afraid to post or have an opinion warped by internet points and ridicule, but we are setup to want approval and social interaction.  It&#39;s important that the mass accept us because we are a social and cooperative species, we exist and excel because we work together.  Being a bigot is more or less designed into us(in theory).  See the little <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRvVFW85IcU">bigot baby video here</a>.  We don&#39;t like people who aren&#39;t part of the collective.  Acceptance is something we need to teach, to the extent if a person isn&#39;t hurting you, or anyone else, it&#39;s fine.  </p>

<p>I find it odd that the Christian subs are moderated not by Christians, if that&#39;s true.  That seems like a conflict of interest.  That is supposed to be a safe haven for Christians, but at the same time I think it&#39;s valuable to have an outsider view as well.  If all the moderators aren&#39;t Christian not cool.  I have less issues with a Jewish moderator, as Judaism is more or less the father of Christianity.  They have common roots, but again all the moderators shouldn&#39;t be Jewish.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a dog in the <a href="/r/christianity">/r/christianity</a> and <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> subs so was only relying on someone who wandered over here for the first time because he was upset by the way he (a believing Christian) was treated at the christianity sub and wondered why the sub had a bias toward other religions and atheism and an academic view of the bible and why faith-based POVs like his were marginalized.</p>

<p>I am simply interested in whether those subs are being gamed to serve an agenda like many of the other subs are.</p>

<p>While outside perspectives are good it would be weird to have say a Detroit Lions fan moderating a Dallas Cowboys sub and also have a moderator that hated football (as well as moderators who were only interested in analyzing the game and not cheering the Cowboys on).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Actually, if you click through and read OP&#39;s post linked above (the deleted then reinstated post), he cites this example of censorship in his Edit.  It&#39;s the first item under &quot;DAMNING EVIDENCE.&quot;  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit convaluted to explain but a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user made a post about his experience visiting Israel and the occupied territories and described the racism and unfair treatment of Arabs he saw there.  It was a totally reasonable post if you take the time to read it.  It was upvoted to the top post at bestof.</p>

<p>But bestof not only deleted this post because it was critical of Israel but collectively punished all of <a href="/r/conpsiracy">/r/conpsiracy</a>, evidently because of alleged anti-semitism.  How ironic that bestoff uses collective punishment like Israel does to the Palestinians, eh?</p>

<p>The circle jerk subs like conspiratard and subbredditdrama went on a rampage and evidently had inside info and argued with the user who posted about his trip to Israel and told us it was becasue his post was &quot;anti semitic.&quot;  The user eventually had his account erased and has gone dark.  BipolarBear, who is a known troll and who mods many other subs was very vocal in defending this banning and has also banned other <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users from subs he mods like <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>.  BipolarBear has engaged in black propaganda by posting caricatures of Jews on this sub and then using this as &quot;evidence&quot; that this sub is &quot;racist.&quot;  </p>

<p>Anyway, the mods of this sub don&#39;t defend this sub against this harassment and instead let BipolarBear and his conspiratard friends troll this sub with impunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even folks who initially have the best of intentions can be swayed.  Not everyone, but most.</p>

<p>Reddit is here to make money, and nothing more.  I glean what I can from the site, and discard what I perceive as fuckery or shenanigans, which is a lot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not ever going to buy into the bullshit idea that buying someone (I don&#39;t care if they are effing Lord Byron eloquent) some reddit gold does anything besides make some folks who give zero shits about anything but a bottom line more validation for putting forth the false idea that this place represents some sort of high ground.  Perhaps I am jaded, but I don&#39;t think so, I just understand human nature, and let&#39;s face it, Reddit isn&#39;t like some fucking ideal, it&#39;s a carefully crafted thing to suck as many people in and get them to buy reddit gold, so we can have a place to talk about gold.  Yeah, I&#39;m down for that.</p>

<p>For you folks that thought this place did represent some grand idealistic new thing where we all communicate, I say to you that it is YOU folks who represent that ideal, and reddit is reaping the benefits (unjustly) of your good will and optimism.  I salute your good will, but I have no illusion that reddit is just like any other venture that is designed to extract the most cash from the most people possible, and the big money isn&#39;t even from reddit gold -- It&#39;s clearly from paid shilling, and paid censorship, and many of you pay proudly to be a part of this.  But hey, at least you can post about how fucking cool gold is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found this to be a very entertaining read. I may not agree with everything you say but I would like to thank you for sharing the theory. I love the premise, the reddit conspiracy. So anyway I&#39;d like to point a couple things out after reading, I hope you take this criticism positively.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look, I remember when reddit wasn&#39;t mainstream also. I remember the body of great iama threads posted by average people doing different things. The thing here is reddit got mainstream. There&#39;s really no other way to put it. Before it was a once in a month or rarer sort of thing when a celebrity would do an AMA thread (and further in the past, there were times when it never happened) but now its a daily occurance. Why? Because reddit has gone mainstream.</p>

<p>Now with that being said: Is there anything preventing you from doing an AMA thread yourself? <strong>NO. No there is not. ANYONE CAN MAKE AN AMA THREAD.</strong> I can make an AMA thread right now if I wanted to. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/submit?selftext=true">AMA submission page</a> the rules aren&#39;t that hard to follow either and given the attention reddit has gotten over the years every single one of those rules is completely understandable.</p>

<p>You are placating the assumption to people that iama is not &quot;open to anyone&quot; simply because its not as easy as it used to be to get to the front page of that sub. Well, blame all of us redditors who would much rather try and speak to a celebrity or scientist rather than a normal joe not doing anything interesting. With that said, if you are doing something interesting then by all means make a thread about it. If its interesting enough the thread will get attention. Looking at <a href="/r/IAmA">/r/IAmA</a> &#39;s frontpage right now I see a lot of ama threads being run by what you and I would both consider &quot;regular people&quot;. They&#39;ve done something cool and made a thread about it, or maybe they had an experience and made a thread about it, or used to have a cool job and made a thread about it. The list goes on.</p>

<p><del>I think I&#39;m going to end this post here.</del> I got kind of lost there explaining the AMA thing. But really, this is just one point out of many you have in your post which I find issue with. The least I can do is throw a few at you that seem wrong to me. I wont be counter arguing against all of these like the AMA one though. I don&#39;t want this to be 17 pages long. If anyone is curious why any of these make me shout &quot;lies&quot; then please quote the point and I will address it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that never posted again.</p></li>
<li><p>5) Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?</p></li>
<li><p>So now we are being fed an anti-Muslim/Islam/Russian/India smear campaign weekly. 
<em>(seriously?)</em></p></li>
<li><p>But thats okay, when something goes against the &quot;US is good&quot; narrative, every detail is examined and the slightest inconsistency is used to dismiss the entire story.</p></li>
<li><p>And people will say &quot;What are you talking about, people are constantly bashing the US in every thread&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes that is absolutely true. Because those people have decided to even out the score. When you have hundreds of fake accounts moving the narrative in a certain direction, then it is essential for people to come out and loudly counter-balance the propaganda.</p></li>
<li><p>It wasn&#39;t always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL <em>(fake now?)</em></p></li>
<li><p>And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end. <em>(we could get into what sucks about democracy here but theres no need because this is how reddit works today.)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. </p></li>
<li><p>And I believe this can essentially be boiled down to greed. Reddit gets billions of views. The people who run reddit are not the &quot;cool bloggers&quot; they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence. <em>(this one definitely deserves a writeup and I hope someone asks for it)</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>(oh how could I forget?)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>1) The first thing they did was take away r/all. This took away the only tool for communicating with reddit about reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/all. Taking that away was the first step.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been on and off of reddit for a LONG time. I would say at least 7 years now. I had an old account which I use to be able to search, but has since been deleted. Reddit has changed for me, because I use to come here and be informed, seems like I argue more now than I ever did in the past. Now the front page and over excessive amount of subreddits make this place a garbage dump. I come out of habit, but I swear I&#39;ll have a heart attack one day because of reddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a conspiracy, why would anyone who is gay

    <div class="md"><p>the story of reddit</p>

<p>in the beginning when reddit was best there was just</p>

<p>reddit.com </p>

<p>and all posts were up and down voted by everyone and all readers got exposed to all sorts of information thye had never seen before.</p>

<p>information that actually affected elections and bills in congress and businesses as say 1 million people suddenly learned of a new bill that was  horrible and they all actually contacted the congress or they learned a health insurance company was screwing everyone so they got pissed or they found a new candidate they liked and all 1 million of them sent him donations and he rose to huge prominence and the establishment couldn&#39;t get rid of him because he had a huge war chest (cough Kucinich cough cough)</p>

<p>so they had to subdivide the masses so the masses would not see what they already didn&#39;t want to see so the masses never learned any truth they didn&#39;t think they already knew in say r/conservative or r/progressive.</p>

<p>in others words none of them knew to subscribe to r/truth becuase they never saw r/truth while inside their little r/subreddits</p>

<p>and then things were like they were before and the masses were kept fighting one another in their walled off ignorance as they were only allowed the information the 7 th largest media family in the world who bought and now owns reddit wanted them to know.</p>

It just dropped off the page because it had been there for TWO ENTIRE DAYS... and suddenly that is a conspiracy against you personally from the admins? So your solution is to spam your link &quot;demanding answers&quot; and then when people repeatedly point out an explanation for your post you just spam READING = 0 over and over again. </p>

<p>So... what do you even want? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well look who is the majority of this website, its all progressive commie sympathizing libs. I am actually a minority every time I sign in, and I know that. My views as a conservative, and in Law Enforcement, are always frowned upon, and every time I share a piece of my opinion it is bashed. I don&#39;t think it is so much as a conspiracy, rather than your traditional progressive thinking takeover using slurs and name calling to diminish your views.

<p>Your entire post is literally the facts I needed to prove you are playing the victim card.  Awe, you feel so mariginalized and victimized on a website on the internet.  That&#39;s so heartbreaking.  </p>

<p>I never called you racist, capitalist, or any other hyperbole and conjecture you have used.  In fact, you provide no sources or evidence for your other claims and just spout random complaints about how you are treated so poorly on Reddit. </p>

<p>If Reddit hurts your tender feelings so much, maybe you should try another outlet for conversation that is more agreeable to you.  Does FOX news have a forum?  I&#39;m sure they will agree with you and you won&#39;t feel so victimized there.</p>

And even those  are now censored. My real top post was a top ten post of all time in Reddit a d exposed how health insurance companies canceled almost everyone once their expenses were greater than possible future revenues.</p>

<p>that post doesn&#39;t even show up in my top of all time anymore and it had something like 10,000 net Upvoted. It ranked just below &quot; obame elected president&quot;</p>

<p>and I have been banned from r/politics for about two years even though I consistently had top post s there including the second post listed In my censored top post list linked below.</p>

<p>go figure.</p>

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/97lm0/mathematician_proves_the_probability_of_having/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/97lm0/mathematician_proves_the_probability_of_having/</a>  this is my top ten link that has been censored from my all time top posts link!
Look at the over 6000 vote count!
It should be on the top of my all time top posts list! </p>

<p>Notice how even today this post should appear in the top post page of all time for ALL OF REDDIT but it does not.</p>

<p>It should rank with others who have 6000 or so net votes and it doesn&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t see how change is possible at this point. I wish it were different, and I know that I&#39;m holding a pessimistic view on the subject, but the reddit setup is simple: All powerful admins, merciless mods, and upset users. The only way that change to reddit COULD come about is to get this message <strong>out</strong> of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and to more prominent places in the site. This sub is sadly viewed by the rest of reddit as a bunch of paranoid people who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about, and they view the posts in this sub as such. The message must be spread, and I for one would love to see these changes come about due to such information as this spreading.</p>

<p>These meta subs like subredditdrama, circlejerk, and conspiratard appear to be heavily infested with trolls who are very hostile to this sub and freethinkers across reddit.</p>

<p>I think <a href="/r/NoLibsWatch">/r/NoLibsWatch</a> and TheGhostofDusty have exposed some of the shenanigans--these subs are used to form brigades to attack this sub for instance.</p>

<p>So when I hear this reddit insult &#39;circlejerk&#39; I think of this whole history of <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> being a propaganda arm to attack this sub and others like it.  </p>

<p>1) The first thing they did was take away r/all.
This took away the only tool for communicating with reddit about reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/all. Taking that away was the first step.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh? That&#39;s not a thing and never was a thing. Maybe you&#39;re referring to <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>? I mean, yes, there&#39;s <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but that&#39;s hardly what you&#39;re describing it as. And if you do mean <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>, I don&#39;t see how this took away you&#39;re ability to talk about reddit. There&#39;s a bunch of subreddits for that. <a href="/r/TheoryOfReddit">/r/TheoryOfReddit</a>, for one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So <em>that&#39;s</em> why Ron Paul didn&#39;t win the nomination. Interesting. Didn&#39;t know <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a>, or heck, <em>reddit</em>, was so influential. lol. No. Actually, reddit has a population of very LOUD libertarians who masturbate pictures of Ron Paul. The <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> thing was simply making fun of that. If you honestly feel a forum on a website prevented a nutty fuck from getting the Repub nomination, you&#39;re unwell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh... So? There&#39;s a bunch of other AMA subreddits for more specific types now. As subreddits grow, they become harder to moderate. The solution to this is to create similar subreddits with more defined rules. So now we&#39;ve got all kinds of IAMA subreddits, each with different rules and focuses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that never posted again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on your feelings. No proof of shills except that you&#39;ve got a hunch or some crap. Disagree with me? SHILLL!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5) Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.
What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have always been sites that weren&#39;t allowed. If you don&#39;t like the rules of <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, use a different news subreddit. There&#39;re a bunch. Rules ≠ Censorship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6) All of the proper &quot;checks and balances&quot; are now in place.
So now we are being fed an anti-Muslim/Islam/Russian/India smear campaign weekly. The amount of stories that demonize these groups is sickening to witness. And with minimal research you can see that most of them are hyperbole, sensationalized, and sometimes outright fiction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s cute that you&#39;re so optimistic about redditors. There&#39;s no way redditors could be racist! It must be a conspiracy! Face it dude, redditors are shit. There&#39;s no shortage of racist pieces of shit all over the place. Not hard to believe when you look at the demographics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But thats okay, when something goes against the &quot;US is good&quot; narrative, every detail is examined and the slightest inconsistency is used to dismiss the entire story. But that diligence disappears when the story is bashing somewhere else. And those who point it out are downvoted out of sight.
And people will say &quot;What are you talking about, people are constantly bashing the US in every thread&quot;.
Yes that is absolutely true. Because those people have decided to even out the score. When you have hundreds of fake accounts moving the narrative in a certain direction, then it is essential for people to come out and loudly counter-balance the propaganda.</p>

<p>HAHAHAH wait wait wait... so, a MAJOR flaw in your conspiracy theory is fixed with <em>another</em> conspiracy theory? This is gold.</p>

<p>Oh, and I found a bonus comment you made in one of your linked threads:</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t trust r/conspiracy mods, then who can you trust?</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHA. You&#39;re joking right? Why the hell would you, a conspiracy nut, ever have trusted a mod of a subreddit? I&#39;m not saying they lied to you or deleted your shit, but you came here under the presumption that you should <em>trust</em> a random person on the Internet?

<p>It&#39;s called being intentionally obtuse.  They are trolling.  That&#39;s all that sub and these conspiratard trolls do.

it was a political comment and may be removed, thus it was removed.</p>

<p>Me</p>

<p>re: Comment is being repeatedly deleted

Obviously, given the amount of political posts and comments on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> it would seem did an offensive comment would have to meet a certain criteria to be removed.
I&#39;m just asking for the guidelines for the criteria of political post that could be seen as offensive and need to be removed.
This way I will better understand how to use this subreddit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1she85/how_reddit_was_destroyed/">Here is a link to it, on page 14.</a>.

<p>I never called you racist, capitalist, or any other hyperbole and conjecture you have used.  In fact, you provide no sources or evidence for your other claims and just spout random complaints about how you are treated so poorly on Reddit. </p>
