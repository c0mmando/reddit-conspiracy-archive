       This is a text explaining a theory of individual conscious state and awareness surrounding life and how the government subliminally oppresses freedom in our everyday lives. These ideas and concepts are entirely original and theoretical.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Learned Reactions
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory revolves around the idea that at some point in your early stages of life between 7-16, your mind becomes placed in one of two conscious states. The first conscious state (C1) is best described as “Bound” and the second conscious state (C2) is best described as “Free”. First we need to understand “learned reactions”. These are repetitive reactions we make to something regularly that become ‘second nature’ to us. We can see this in a popular science experiment with dogs. You sound a bell every time you place down the food, continuing doing this over and over means the dog will eventually learn that the sound of the bell is related to food, therefore after a while, you can ring the bell without food but the dog will still come running to you as it has learned that the sound of the bell means food. The idea of humans having “learned reactions” is not an alien concept, in fact prime example are talking, walking and eating. We learn that these processes keep us alive and we are taught these things by others. This means that it is possible for you to gain various “learned reactions” from a very young age about specific things taught to you by other humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Bound or Free?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Children, through their early years, learn the basics of most of the skills and knowledge required to live normally in the world such as team working, self management and creative thinking, primarily through the education system set up by the government to allow a “safe learning environment” for children throughout the country. Here we can see the first signs of subliminal messaging through the governments punishment schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As children, we are taught that there are rules set in place that need to be respected and abided by and if we break them, we will be punished. Actions such as; raising your voice to the child, isolating the child and making an “example” of the child to others are all methods in which the educational system use to scare children and make them fear breaking the rules, further on in education when a child is placed in “detention” for breaking a rule enforced by the government, that child is being taught that doing something bad means that the ones who make the rules are allowed to lock you up and you have no choice in the matter because it’s “law”. Another example of this is the encouragement and presentation of high grades in achievements such as GCSEs, the government is teaching children that everybody should aspire to work under and for the government with their key skills being reflected by their exam grades to allow optimum profit and strongest workers in the various industry’s labour.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this vital point in a child’s life, I theorise that the consciousness of the child is placed in one of two states. C1 or “Bound” is the state in which a child succumbs to these early subliminal tactics and gains a “learned reaction” that they must not break the rules at any cost in fear of certain punishment. Respective of the name, there is a second conscious state referred to as C2 or “Free” (which in most cases is presented as a mind-set for the more intelligent and creative thinkers) in which your mind reacts towards an opposite conclusion and you in fact realise that you can do whatever you want to do and that the law of the universe is not to obey these other equal beings to you just because they pose a threat or wield more power. This vital change in your thought process and daily learning pattern is what divides us all into two specific categories with C1 being the more common conscious state much to the dismay of the human race. This unbalanced result is the outcome of years of religious impact on mentality in education through the years, with the further belief that you will burn in a fiery abyss if you do not do an almighty deity’s wish.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What could be achieved…
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are thousands of conspiracy theories pointing out all the subliminal messages the governments of the world have supposedly used on the populace but there are too many to discuss and a lot of them are fairly obvious which is why they are so perfect and seem so unlikely. But the real matter at hand is with this conscious state comes a freedom of the mind that hasn’t been achieved until recent modern day humans. Since incredibly harsh obstacles such as war, racism, terrorism and crime have rose, so has the need for intelligent humans which is why it could be theoretically stated that “C2”-state-people are becoming more common and in which case the government’s eventual fall is growing ever closer. There are unimaginable things we could achieve in a new political system in which we don’t search to oppress and control under the guise of “safe utopian laws” but rather encourage people to think outside the box, break the rules and push the boundaries, because maybe that’s all we’ve been waiting for to set us back on the track to a better future and more sustainable humanity.

       A thought provoking post. But a question, because our genetic makeup is a 99% match to the Animal Kingdom and the Animal Kingdom has a very observable social hierarchy, why is it unreasonable to think that to a degree, we are genetically coded to be leaders or subsequently followers.

       That's what he's saying. Maybe we
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       designed to be followers (or that's what was best at the time?), but not anymore. Humans, like everything else, are changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is not to have a pyramid. It shouldn't be vertical, it should be horizontal. There is no ONE animal at the top telling all the other animals what to do in their own group. Our ideas about animal hierarchies (and the survival of the "fittest") are skewed and so we think this way is a good way. This is really ALL the result of our ignorance of nature and ourselves.

       Dude, sarcasm doesn't help. We're talking about a change that would alter the course of human history and possibly save our species. There may be a reason for all this hub bub. Think about it the historical context: if this shit has been going on for thousands of years (perhaps longer, depending on who you believe) then exactly
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       is it about humanity? Are we really just stupid or is there something larger at play here?

       thought the prevalence of non-human abduction phenomena might amount to evolutionary pressure favoring people who resist hive-like control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the etiology (and hypotheses on this are many), the increase of people on the autism spectrum shows a growing subset who are largely ambivalent toward herd mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe more are perceiving at a sub- (or pre-) conscious level that the behavior supporting small group survival is less necessary and probably self-defeating in ways. Our herd impulses are manipulated to keep us distracted and consuming, locked into habits that benefit a few at the top while killing us.

       I encourage everyone to read the book "Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes" by Jacques Ellul.  It actually breaks down how they do this exact thing.

       Found a PDF of the book, enjoy!
