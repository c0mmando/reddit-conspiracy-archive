<p>Yep I was in that sticky making sure that shit didn&#39;t get implemented. Stay the fuck away from the organic curation fof content, reddit inc. Otherwise it&#39;s coffee with Kevin rose for Alexis and Erik ;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got this answer when I had a comment censored here.  When I pm&#39;ed them they responded and said it was &quot;weird&quot; that there was no moderator mark claiming responsibility.</p>

<p>There is an &quot;automoderator&quot; and TheGhostofDusty I think it was speculated posts are censored by this bot, or people assign blame to this bot so there is no responsibility.  </p>

<p>It also seems the admins have the technical ability to censor posts (and maybe even make it appear as if the automoderator is responsible), while no one would be the wiser.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Automoderator is a bot that can be set up to remove posts by certain users, or posts that contain certain keywords etc. However it is - in the eyes of the reddit system - no different than a (moderator) human user, it&#39;s actions are still logged by the moderation log.</p>

<p>Something more fishy is afoot. Or reddit just breaks a bit sometimes. I dunno.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve attracted troll attention so that I am being stalked by conspiratard people, that are commenting on my posts &quot;warning&quot; users here that I&quot;m an anti-semite (which is not true).</p>

<p>He then kept going on and on trying to change the subject to the Holocaust:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjpof/anyone_seen_this_one_of_the_images_on_the_new/cdyy15q">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sjpof/anyone_seen_this_one_of_the_images_on_the_new/cdyy15q</a></p>

<p>Anyway, since I had him and other users claiming they wanted to ban me for rule violations, I realized the mods have taken out the old rule that used to say something along the lines that disparaging the sub on other subs could result in a ban, or something similar.  I can&#39;t remember how it was phrased.  </p>

<p>Anyway, seems like these conspiratard trolls are an intended part of this sub.</p>
