       Yep I was in that sticky making sure that shit didn't get implemented. Stay the fuck away from the organic curation fof content, reddit inc. Otherwise it's coffee with Kevin rose for Alexis and Erik ;).

       That mod said the mod log didn't reflect who removed the story. This leads me to believe it was an admin. We shall see.

       I got this answer when I had a comment censored here.  When I pm'ed them they responded and said it was "weird" that there was no moderator mark claiming responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an "automoderator" and TheGhostofDusty I think it was speculated posts are censored by this bot, or people assign blame to this bot so there is no responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also seems the admins have the technical ability to censor posts (and maybe even make it appear as if the automoderator is responsible), while no one would be the wiser.

       I have my suspicions that reddit admins gave automod the power to remove comments and submissions without leaving a deleted tag for the purposes of hiding the payola going on within reddit inc and her top cabals of mods.

       Automoderator is a bot that can be set up to remove posts by certain users, or posts that contain certain keywords etc. However it is - in the eyes of the reddit system - no different than a (moderator) human user, it's actions are still logged by the moderation log.
      </p>

       Something more fishy is afoot. Or reddit just breaks a bit sometimes. I dunno.

       Yes, I've attracted troll attention so that I am being stalked by conspiratard people, that are commenting on my posts "warning" users here that I"m an anti-semite (which is not true).

       Anyway, since I had him and other users claiming they wanted to ban me for rule violations, I realized the mods have taken out the old rule that used to say something along the lines that disparaging the sub on other subs could result in a ban, or something similar.  I can't remember how it was phrased.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, seems like these conspiratard trolls are an intended part of this sub.

       reddit was built to pull in the masses and make them as dumb as possible. as complacent as possible. as lazy as possible. "here, vent your rage with a voting arrow. your opinion counts (as long as it's from your couch)."

       Out of control mods need to be the first to go.  u/newsninja101 is particularly abusive. I'm sure others here are familiar. How can we get rid of him?

       OP clearly states the post was removed but now has been reinstated.

       This kills the mojo and makes it less likely will be on the front page of the sub or the front page of reddit.

       When a submission is removed it can still be on reddit but not show up on the sub it was removed from. Or the admins can remove it from search or from reddit entirely.

       That mod said the mod log didn't reflect who removed the story. This leads me to believe it was an admin. We shall see.
