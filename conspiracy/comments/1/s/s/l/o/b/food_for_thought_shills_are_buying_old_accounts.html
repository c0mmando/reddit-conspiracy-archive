       Many people come to r/conspiracy with an ingrained viewpoint that their mainstream media conditioned "knowledge" is the truth, and the burden of proof remains on the doubters.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people ironically refer to themselves as "skeptics" but they are anything but.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be one these people. Be open-minded and hold up the mainstream view to the same burden of proof. You won't get anything out of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       ...but hostility and contempt are the hallmark traits of a brilliant mind, as everyone knows. I actually appreciate the accounts from conspiratard setting me back on the right path of truth with their name calling and nonsensical arguments.

       Yeah, I have a feeling that half of r/conspiratard must have descended to derail this particular discussion. It was like an ambush by an army of Orcs.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, the "Obama defence league" have been a serious disruptive element since this subreddit started in 2008. They deliberately derail any attempt to discuss Obama's background, education, eligibility - it's crazy.

       Are you implying that youd rather him believe in something that does not convince him, on the merit of an unknown poster or article? Its okay for someone to disagree, even to disagree the majority of the time, so long as they provide reasons for/against.

       I see where youre coming from. Now i understand why you think i was answering for him. My apologies. My question was placed there because i found it most relevant there, when you asked about the 99.9% vs the 0.1%. The intention wasnt to butt in, but rather to be placed close to the comment i was referring to.

       I actually do usually try and research the topic myself before leaving a comment. I'll admit I didn't use to research on my own before leaving comments, but realized I was wrong with some of them. So I made it a priority to make sure I do research the topic myself before making a comment of doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, I do not rely on others to spoon feed me anything. Shit, half the time the OP doesn't even read the article, and I find something that contradicts the post in the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just yesterday someone was saying an MMR vaccine was to blame over shaken baby syndrome for a babies death, even though the father said he shook the baby multiple times after it fell off a couch. People don't read half the shit they post here.

       You can keep trying to discredit me, that's fine, but it won't discredit the facts I pass along or add to the conversations on here. Ignore all you want, but truth is still truth no matter what you believe.

       Since I really don't feel like going through your comment history, I would appreciate if you cited one of your comments where you are in consensus with the OP, or maybe a post of yours with a legit conspiracy. Hopefully the latter, but either will do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You came in here on the defensive, now I need to verify that's just your nature and that you're not trying to become the very description on this post.

       How do you define theory? I mean, other than in the most colloquial definition, a theory is based on evidence. Not on baseless conjecture that stands in place of evidence until disproved.

       Hey, simmer down now. Let's stay on topic and refrain from hamfisted deflections here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        My
       </em>
       definition of theory is irrelevant here, as
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       were the one who claimed your unsubstantiated opinion was, in fact, a "theory". I simply asked you to define "theory", as it appeared to me that you were using the term in place of 'conjecture'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based off your attempted deflection, I am led to believe that perhaps you
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>
       answer so simple a question as the one that I had asked.

       I can go along with it and say i'm a paid shill if it makes you feel better, the fact is, people disagree with conspiracy theories. Trying to a lot a reason to make you feel better about it, and denying the fact that someone can disagree with that without getting paid for it is fine by me. Doesn't really matter one bit to me what you think of my comments/opinions.

       Actually I commented on someone elses reply here, then with your very first comment to me, you called me a shill. You replied to my comment first, not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you just not able to remember what you have said already?

       I called you a shill because as my comment clearly stated, I've had you tagged for a while, that's the purpose of tags, to not have to rummage through your history everytime I need to out you.

       You're contradicting yourself. Have a great day, i'm moving on to better conversations, i've said what I need to here. Not really any more reason to put up with your contradictions and shill call outs. You are not adding anything to this sub further than looking crazy.

       Well that's not what a shill is. A shill is someone who posts someone elses opinions for money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fail to see how you've determined that I'm a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some things are not so obvious to some people. There was a post the other day about a shill on /b/ and that was obvious. To me that was a great post with proof to back up its claim. That's all I ask of you, some sort of evidence of what you post about, otherwise why post at all?

       I'm not defensive and I never asked for proof on a theory let alone badgered you for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I referenced another topic as an example of how giving proof can make your topics better. You may have noticed that your topic currently has a negative vote total. I guess I'm not the only one who sees it as useless. Maybe try emulating some of the more popular posts in this forum such as the ones that provide evidence to back up their claims.
Just some advice.

       Shills will most definitely be met with hostility. It's the only language they know.

       Like the douche who commented, he wants evidence instead of using his brain. Or maybe he just wants to do a little resource burn? Or just lazy? Or maybe he's just afraid the jig is up.

       I'm giving you a theory: You have multiple accounts which you use to upvote your own stuff multiple times and pretend that there are several people who agree with your opinion. Pure sockpuppetry.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not discussing old accounts, we're discussing something that you like to call "shills". I'm not entirely certain what it is due to the numerous and contradictory explanations this sub offers, but you seem to fulfill a lot of the criteria necessary for being one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a "shill" according to you is someone who demands proof of any claim by the OP, no matter how ridiculous, and a good redditor is one who mindlessly agrees on everything said? That seems to be in direct contradiction to what I've heard about what a "shill" is. Namely, a guy who pushes an agenda and argues and downvotes against everything that's against said agenda.

       Yes, this is probably just your "upvote" account. Who knows what your other accounts karma is at. Unless you're willing to post it.

       The implication being that new accounts are not trustworthy. You are a new account ergo, by your own logic you should not be trustworthy.

       This account is just an empty one used for upvoting your main account. That's this "shilling" thing you people love to talk about.

      <p>
       From what I can discern from this account (who knows what you're upvoting on your primary accounts) you are overly concerned with a simple hand gesture that a child made and overly concerned that everyone who does not share your concern is part of an evil hive-minded corporation or government. Virtually everything in your history is either pushing a specific facet of the Sandy Hook conspiracy fantasies or whining about everyone who doesn't.

       See what I mean? You cannot take criticism so you call everyone who disagrees with you a "shill" which is a word you are finding it increasingly difficult to define as it encompasses more and more people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why don't you come clean? Your account is 15 days old. If you're not just an alt account, then why did you come here? How can you claim such a vast amount of knowledge of the inner workings of the various reddit communities in such a short time? How did you find this subreddit?

       Honestly i dont think anyone is really paid to be here and spit bullshit. At least not in the numbers that parallel the use of the term "shill" like OP tends to spew.
      </p>
      <p>
       More often than not, someone is called a shill because they dont believe in another persons claim. This brings about the "shill" exchange and then the arguing ensues. Nothing about that is productive or relevant to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very few, and i mean VERY few people on here could actually be shills. id say about 99.9% of those called shills just disagree with someone amd lack the conversational tact to do so in a constructive manner. It would behove this sub if we all followed ettiquette in debate. OP makes a claim, provides evidence or sources for such claim, then redditors get to dissect that info and provide their arguments for or against OPs claim, including evidence and sources themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we all know, this usually does not happen, because in the early stages of debate the word "shill" gets tossed around and halts all productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       While i agree that there are certainly a type of redditor that goes around trying to disprove everybody and inculcate the false idea that they are superior in knowledge and wisdom, this alone doesnt make them a shill. It just makes them douchebags.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, with all that said, OP, if you have evidence that certain accounts have been bought for the sole purpose of "shilling", please provide sources or relevant information that could be considered evidence. The onus of support for your claims is on you, as the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP, making assinine comments in reply to people asking for supporting sources of your claim is childish and counterproductive to your seeming goal of ousting "shills." Unless it is your intent to act like a douchebag, this would be a very beneficial lesson in conversational tact for you to learn.

       I didnt think you would actually provide any source. Good job. This article of a guys confession is very in depth, and very narrative. To me, it sounds more made up than anything, but i am capable of entertaining the idea that this guy was being honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       But first, i found this ironic in regards to your post and the manner of which you conducted this post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Our intent in posting this is not to spread paranoia or incite shill witch hunts
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I just wanted to point that out for your convenience, OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as your hypothesis (and again, i disbelieve your claim, but ill entertain its plausibility) that would make sense. I guess i just dont see how they would buy the older accounts without the original owner blowing the whistle about it. But, entertaining this as a possibility, i will keep my eye out for the patterns of which you described.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, the word to learn here is TACT. By offering supporting evidence or sources to your claim, you are by no means doing any thinking on the behalf of anyone else. And, it turns out, one article about one mans confession isnt enough to persuade me to thinking this is in fact true. I reserve my critical thinking abilities to myself based on evidence that is presented to me. And while i admit this is a good article, i struggle to find any credibility with that site in and of itself, much less the guy by the alias of "exshill."
      </p>
      <p>
       I will, however, keep an open mind of your hypothesis and investigate further via the patterns you described and in the contents of the article you so graciously allowed us to analyze.

       I thought about that. But, i find it hard to believe that they would pay enough to keep the massive amounts of original account holders quiet. I understand we are talking about an entity that has a shit ton of money and would certainly be able to afford such investments, but those same entites are so wealthy because they understand the term "cost effectiveness". Its just not worth paying what it would take to keep the original account owners quiet to transform said accounts into shilling accounts. Especially seeing how little shills actually affect the communities in which they attempt to disrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying its impossible, im just saying its improbable and they would invest their money on other mediums in order to garnish the influence in which they desire.

       Deductive reasoning for the sake of one individuals claim is nothing more than blind speculation. Are you familiar with how peer reviewed discussion works?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, i can see how your hypothesis could work. I just doubt it. For me to keep quiet, they would have to pay me in sums of at least five digits. For every alleged shill account being bought, this would mean millions of dollars invested to buy old accounts. While shill acounts and paying for the operators of such would cost much less for an equal amount of effect. Like i said, i doubt your hypothesis because the entities are wealthy because they understand cost effectiveness, and its just not cost effective (in my opinion) to buy out older accounts.

       I understand. I just feel that the marginal benefits gained by such great investments wouldnt be feasible to such actions. The investments would be much better utilized if placed elsewhere. Buying older accounts for more credibility in the pursuit of more efficient disinformation wouldnt (in my opinion) garner enough benefit to warrant such approach. Like i said, these entities are wealthy for a reason. They are very intelligent. If their money can go ten times farther using a different approach, versus the marginal benefits of buying older accounts, they would pursue those former investments instead of the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that money is no issue with these entities, but this all seems like such a waste of investment to me. Theyd be better off continueing to build new accounts at much reduced cost and using the money they woukdve been spending on older accounts (that would produce very little increase in credibility and therefore influence) to spend on more fruitful endeavors in the pursuit of influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats my opinion, of course. And it is certainly viable that your hypothesis could be true. Id doubt it, but its possible. Often times intelligent people do unintelligent (or at least seemingly so) things. Or maybe im downplaying the pure vastness of their wealth. Thats possible too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where we stand with the information you provided for all of us for purposes of discussion towards your hypothesis, im still firm in my doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will, however, keep these possibilities in mind as i have other discussions with other redditors in the future.

       Shills will most definitely be met with hostility. It's the only language they know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the douche who commented, he wants evidence instead of using his brain. Or maybe he just wants to do a little resource burn? Or just lazy? Or maybe he's just afraid the jig is up.

       Deductive reasoning for the sake of one individuals claim is nothing more than blind speculation. Are you familiar with how peer reviewed discussion works?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, i can see how your hypothesis could work. I just doubt it. For me to keep quiet, they would have to pay me in sums of at least five digits. For every alleged shill account being bought, this would mean millions of dollars invested to buy old accounts. While shill acounts and paying for the operators of such would cost much less for an equal amount of effect. Like i said, i doubt your hypothesis because the entities are wealthy because they understand cost effectiveness, and its just not cost effective (in my opinion) to buy out older accounts.
