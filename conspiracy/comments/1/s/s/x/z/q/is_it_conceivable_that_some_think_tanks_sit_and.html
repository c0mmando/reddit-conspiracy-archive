       The specific purpose of  all think tanks is to change public policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately all the really big money goes to conservative think tanks, the same big money who also own all the media and now the politicians as well.

       Just because something is called socialist doesn't mean it is/was.

       There is no free market,  capitalism's natural move it to monopolization, think Monsanto, the cable/telephone companies, the few big banks, etc.   Monopolization means a seller controlled market.  With Monsanto that means, buy the gmos or don't eat.

       Now tell me how a seller controlled market is different from a government controlled market?

       You can't seem to grasp that the regulations were written to permit the monopolization.  The only regulations the capitalists want ended are the ones protecting:

       Socialism: a way of organizing a society in which major industries are owned and controlled by the government rather than by individual people and companies

       Businesses and government agencies are extremely intertwined. They routinely share/swap members, campaign contributions, lobbying etc. If you want to talk about the US, it is a perfect example. Socialism for all areas of society. The businesses end up being almost indistinguishable from government, which means you should just label them "government." If the government controls the media, the media
       <em>
        is government.
       </em>
       If the government uses technology companies to spy on everyone, then those tech companies
       <em>
        are government
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Republic-&gt; Democracy (voters vote themselves government benefits)-&gt; socialism (like we have today)-&gt;communism (coming soon). The difference is I think it will be global communism instead of isolated tyranny.

       Global communism run by a technocratic elite who make decisions for everyone based on "expert" opinions.  This is why there is such an emphasis on everyone trusting "experts" nowadays.  Go over to
       <a href="/r/skeptic">
        /r/skeptic

       and tell them they are being duped by an "expert" class using fabian tactics to lure them into a certain mindset and you will be immediately banned.  It happened to me...

       Actually the real fight is for freedom and privacy. If your government is giving you neither then is it still a Democracy? We have to have a mix of collectivism and individualism otherwise we will end up a society that is lopsided in favor of one or the other and would be completely disfunctional. I think we can do that without caving to our deepest fears and being stuck in a cycle of absolute personal greed. It will take our individual efforts focused on a collective goal to do so but I think is doable. Whether or not people are smart enough to take a step back and actually look at themselves and how they behave with a microscope psychologically and socially speaking that waits to be seen.

       Dear god we as the collective we. YES people do make their own decisions but those decisions are limited by the rules WE as a collective society create. There can only be a melding of individualism and collectivism. A society entirely built for just the individual would not be a society at all while a society built entirely out of collectivism would be very oppressive. There has to be balance for society to work. Also we accept social norms and laws collectively every day without coercion and force making the whole point you think your making wrong from the start. Where are people getting this rubbish from?

       No.. mass acceptance is what keeps these rules in place. If people didn't accept them they would not exist. People don't need to be coerced into believing theft and murder is wrong. The majority of people collectively decided the laws and the consequences for breaking those laws. We also made collectively the exceptions for those rules and their various concequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example on mentally disabled man who gets behind the wheel and kills a person is placed into a mental home instead of prison where a fully functional sane man can get life in prison or the death penalty. We as a society collectively decided what was appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone decided things on an individual basis there would not be any actual law or consequences. It would be like the wild west before sheriffs moved in. If a person murdered a family member or stole something there would be only blind revenge seeking behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we decided everything on a collective basis as we are currently moving into and the Russians and Germans did in the past. We can see that we would have exteme paranoia as a result. Distrust of fellow man leads people to jump for privacy invasion as the recourse. The germans and russians both had their own form of secret police who would prevent opposing voices from ever being heard. All the while hundreds of thousands of people were being killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We as in the human race have experienced both extremes and we can see they are flawed deeply. Functional societies always have achieved balance historically. Balance between Rich and Poor, Left and Right, Conservative and Liberal, Collectivist and Individualist. Every time We as humanity get unbalanced societal collapse or disfunction occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would rather people take the lessons of history to heart and try to find balance between the extremes. The alternative is the end of civilization and the death of the human race as we have already damaged the environment.

       Yeah, no.  Its left-wing think tanks.  You obviously have never heard of the CFR, the Royal Institute for International Affairs, the UNITED NATIONS and anything affiliated with the UN.  All left-wing, all control more than any "conservative" think tank could possibly fathom.
