       The new pope is nothing but a Vatican White wash PR campaign to make you feel good about the church again. Remember when obama was the the nicecst guy on the fucking planet. It's the same shit all over again and you people keep falling for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They saw that their ratings were going too down, + werent there like major pedophile scandals all around going on in the church? Yeah, what happened there. Nevermind, look at the new and cool pope. Did you hear he sneaks out at night to feed the homeless? I mean, give me a fucking break. Ever wondered why there is like new frontpake post about the new pope like atleast twice a month. It's fucking bullshit. We are so easily programmed. Reddit isnt any more free flow of information than MSM. They make sure that you will see what you need to see to keep up with the popular opinnion, with the hivemind.

       The Pope moved an Archbishop out of his $42M mansion and turned it into a soup kitchen, ordered an audit of the church, and has spoken out against "out of control" capitalism.

       I agree, I do think the church elected this guy because he relates to the people well and can repair their image, however, I do think this pope is genuine in his work, there are stories of his character going back long before he became pope, I don't think the church realized that this guy was going to rock their boat so much like he has and I think he is in danger of pissing off the wrong people.

       I've been yelling from the rooftops about this, no one listens, its the illusion of upvote/downvote "democracy".  This is a culture/propaganda machine, just like anything else, which is why it doesn't matter if they turn a profit or not, it has a job to do.   The new pope is a change agent.

       While his discourse is noteworthy, before judging his papacy I prefer to wait for "factual" changes: arrest of pedophiles (present and past), arrest of all those involved in the "God's Banker" scandal (along with transparency into its members and co-conspirators), distribution (not meager donations) of the church's massive wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ignoring the more taboo; homosexuality, women's rights (anti-conception/STD, abortion), which changes are extremely unlikely.

       Interesting. I had that tidbit stored in my brain. It ruined my thinking of them as comical clown suits, but the history is more intriguing. Hugo Boss, of course, designed the Nazi uniforms.

       Whatever, I think any prominent world figure calling attention to the massive inequalities that corporations running wild in our economic system has produced is a good thing. The "slumping slave" you speak of would go on listening to the MSM and view any perceived "anti American" sentiment as Socialist/Marxist rhetoric because theyve been fucking brainwashed. Maybe a few of them will start to question things and maybe even fucking wake up.

       This is supposed to be the last Pope who reigns under a time of great turmoil.  Rome is destroyed at the end of his reign. : Prophesy of St Malachy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This prophesy was published around 1600.  I don't know if its true but its interesting reading.  I don't think that the trouble will start until Benedict passes away.

       Yes, I also oppose pedophilia and the way the Catholic church handled the whole scandal. I'm not even a Christian. I just think it's refreshing that the new pope has been so open about speaking on issues that many world leaders and politicians refuse to. And I think that in the past when prominent figures have done so, the end result hasn't been good. At the very least he's making people who wouldn't otherwise, question things that they should be questioning IMO.

       Yes, but if he outs the child molesters and uses their annual gross income of 4 billion dollars to help people that'd be great. Words don't fucking mean anything when you live in a castle, wearing the finest fabrics, eating like a king, and there are people in your ten mile vicinity that aren't eating e nought food.

       Given the fact the current Pope is a Jesuit, "elected" by a Vatican conclave immediately after a visit from the SMOM (Sovereign Military Order of Malta)/Order of St. John, I'd say no.
