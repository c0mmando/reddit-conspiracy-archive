I agree the building&#39;s destruction is very suspicious, and worthy of further investigation. However, we can&#39;t forget how much other evidence has been gathered beyond the Towers themselves.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/911-a-conspiracy-theory/">This video by James Corbett</a> points out the many issues with the official story on 9/11 (with sources). Here are some of the biggest ones:</p>

<p>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Danger">Able Danger</a>, the program that identified several of the hijackers prior to the attack and was covered up extensively</p>

<p>-<a href="http://antiwar.com/edmonds/?articleid=3230">Sibel Edmonds</a>, the FBI translator that was gagged by John Ashcroft at Robert Mueller&#39;s request</p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2004/3/23/the_white_house_has_played_cover">The 911 Commission Report</a>, which was spoiled by conflicts of interest and cronyism, with many important testimonies being made off-record</p>

<p>There&#39;s simply way too many to pick a &quot;favorite&quot;. However, I do think the 9/11 Commission&#39;s failure to investigate the source of the funding behind the attacks is one that is very important and seldom discussed.</p>

<p>Todd Beamer&#39;s cell phone being used well after the &quot;crash&quot;</p>

<p>Where exactly are the &quot;hijacker&#39;s&quot; bodies?  </p>

<p>What about the put options on United and American Airlines stock?</p>

<p>Hitting the Pentagon squarely in the budget office and vaporizing the plane. </p>

<p>Lisa Beamer buying a $1.9 million second home. And not attending her husband&#39;s memorial. </p>

<p>Why was the LA airport not full of panicked families on 9/11?  Everyone in California already knew their friends and family members were dead even though there was a lack of certainty regarding which flights crashed. </p>

<p>Camera footage of the pentagon. (The lack of)</p>

<p>What about the $250 billion in anonymous bearer bonds that were cashed September 12th during the fiscal emergency.</p>

<p>Did they find the missing $2.3 trillion from the defense budget?</p>

<p>How about the massive push to donate blood but then being told there weren&#39;t really many injured. I thought 50,000 people worked there. I was surprised in 2001 to learn only 3000 died when the initial estimates were 10,000-20,000 dead. </p>

<p>I sure thought they were lucky at the time</p>

<p>How only one Israeli died despite 4000 employed there. ( Israelis, not American Jews)</p>

<p>This is only a small fraction of &quot;coincidences&quot; that go along with the whole building collapses etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not much of a 9/11 conspiracy theorist, but I have never understood the dichotomy that exists in the public mind (either it was explosives or the official story is completely true). As the OP said, why do people spend so much time doing pseudo-scientific debunking on the videos of the towers if they want to find a &quot;conspiracy&quot;?</p>

<p>What about the possibility that they simply let it happen for their own benefit, or a small group of people were involved in funding the attack? After all, assuming it was the CIA, they&#39;re involved with propping up and funding disparate groups anyway, and there are extremely complicated methods of payment in the Middle East and Africa that make tracing funds very difficult, so there wouldn&#39;t be that many people to silence or cover up, because nobody would really know what was going on. Most folks in all of the agencies could think they were doing their real job without being &quot;evil&quot; in any intentional way. Hell, isn&#39;t the picture painted in the popular movie <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> that we had all the intel to kill bin Laden, and it just kinda sorta fell in a filing cabinet somewhere until someone actually went looking for it (of course, it&#39;s a movie, and who knows how much of it is true)? I think these agencies are mostly-incompetent and full of shit. How hard would it be to mislead, sideline or ignore them entirely for your own personal gain?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/the-bush-white-house-was-deaf-to-9-11-warnings.html">They had at least some evidence</a> that 9/11 was going to happen, and members of the CIA pleaded with the Bush administration to do something about it, but were apparently entirely unconcerned. This almost directly backs up my theory, and the only question is whether or not the negligence was intentional.</p>

<p>What would they gain by waging war on the Taliban? Well, for starters, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Afghanistan">Afghanistan is a literal gold mine</a> - it&#39;s full of precious minerals, natural gas and oil, which has been known since the time of Alexander the Great.</p>

<p>So, naturally, there&#39;s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Afghanistan_Pipeline">Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline</a>, which stretches from the Caspian Sea all the way to India, requiring an intersection with Afghanistan. Originally, the folks building the pipeline signed a deal with the Taliban, but after the &#39;98 embassy bombings, the Taliban moved to support Osama bin Laden, which halted the construction of the pipeline. This was a bad thing, because it allows Russia to keep a dominant hand over the flow of natural gas in several regions, including Azerbaijan, which borders on the Caspian Sea. Now, which American would be worried about dominance over natural gas near the Caspian Sea? <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/2669248/Dick-Cheney-to-take-fight-against-Russias-oil-dominance-to-Azerbaijan.html">Oh shit.</a> So, the guy associated with a company who directly profited from <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1569483">both</a> Vietnam and Iraq, which were both started on a false premise, is very concerned about the flow of natural gas in a region containing a pipeline that heads through another country that we invaded. </p>

<p>Maybe it wasn&#39;t just Cheney, or the Bush Administration in general. Who else benefited from that pipeline? Saudi Arabia. Who helped finance the 9/11 hijackers? <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/fbi-report-implicates-saudis-in-911.html">Saudi Arabia</a>. Who did Bush try to cover for after the 9/11 attacks? <a href="http://www.salon.com/2004/09/08/graham_8/">Saudi Arabia</a>. Middle Eastern royalty is just as powerful as the Rothschilds and Rockefellers - after all, it helped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_(testimony)">sell us</a> on the first Gulf War.</p>

<p>That would explain why we waste so much time trying to build up a favorable government in the region, why this war has taken so goddamned long, and further, why the first time we were amazingly close to killing bin Laden, the operation <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/the-battle-tora-bora">was handicapped</a> by refusing requests for more soldiers, by turning down every plan the ground commander had to kill bin Laden, and finally, by forcing the soldiers on the ground to work with unloyal mujaheddin. After all, if it&#39;s really about building a pipeline, you wouldn&#39;t want to just eviscerate the enemy and get it over with, right? You&#39;d want an excuse to continue waging war. I don&#39;t think the mission was ever about attacking the Taliban into oblivion for what they did on 9/11.</p>

<p>The world is a nasty, complicated place, and yet, when we look at empires in the past, we completely understand that wars for gold, resources and financial power happened - it&#39;s just that, if you try to say that <em>your</em> country might be doing it, or a current country might be doing it, you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>EDIT: This is too long for a comment, and I&#39;ll make it into a self post if that interests anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the focus on the physics of how the buildings fell has largely given cover for the larger conspiracy. Most people including myself don&#39;t feel competent as structural engineers but can see and accept the proof of foreknowledge and the peculiarities surrounding the event and the accused Hijackers. This is the reason the original &quot;Road to Tyranny&quot; documentary put out before the controlled demolition theory was my favorite for a long while. These days my favorite videos on the subject are those put out by Alien Scientist on YouTube.</p>

<p>As for some of my favorite non controlled demolition evidence.</p>

<p>The terrorists were trained at a CIA flight school Huffman Aviation.

<p>The prepositioning of troops and supplies to invade Afghanistan before the 9/11/2001</p>

<p>The resistance to investigating the attacks and then appointing Henry Kissinger to head the investigation.</p>

<p>There is so much evidence out there and I would list more but I am a little dopey coming off of being very ill for several days and after more than a decade of people unable to shift their world views enough to see the obvious am suffering 911 fatigue.</p>
