    <div class="md"><p>reverse osmosis or distillation</p>

<p>Thats the only way to remove flouride. Gravity fed water filters dont do the job of completely removing it and im not ok with 90% of fluoride gone, i want 100%.</p>

<p>If you have the dough, you can drop anywhere between 200-400 bucks to get one of those &quot;under the sink&quot; water purification systems. We have some at my job and the water is excellent and flouride free. I always take some home in a bottle since my tap water is fucking disgusting.</p>

<p>I cant post a picture of it if youre intrested, i still have 20 minutes before i dip out of work</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even more so, you can buy a badass reverse osmosis system for under your sink from Costco for around $100. Youll have to install it yourself, but it comes with instructions. Or, if you got dinero, you can buy a water system for the whole house from Costco for discounted price.</p>

<p>Costco may be a corporation, but its workers aren&#39;t treated anywhere as near as poorly as Walmart workers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See my post <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1s7wv4/the_us_government_recommends_lowering_the/">here</a> about fluoride. It has all kinds of information. None of that is garbage sourcing or blogs etc. (Please read at least some of those links. The information is all out there.)</p>

<p>Those are the facts. Now, what do you want to do with those facts? I personally just try to avoid fluoride as much as I can, but without going too crazy about it to the point where I could be getting poisoned somewhere else much worse. The first step is eat well, avoid pesticides, and get some exercise. Those 3 things are better than avoiding fluoridated water. For instance: A person might be freaking out about chemtrail aluminum, and then eat an antacid that contains around 200 milligrams of aluminum. Your daily intake is usually ~7 milligrams. </p>

<p>Now for fluoride. My post above is the long version, here is the short version: Don&#39;t drink tea (roobios and caffeinated), avoid medications that might release fluoride, and buy yourself a home distiller or reverse osmosis system. It is much cheaper than buying bottled water. Then, read up on minerals and electrolytes and adjust your water accordingly. Also be sure to check out the data tables that show the foods highest in fluoride. Just avoid the ones at the very top (or highest microgram/milligram content per serving) and avoid raisins, grape juice, wines, etc. </p>

<p>&quot;Researchers estimate that children under 6 years of age ingest an average of 0.3 mg of fluoride from toothpaste with each brushing.&quot;</p>

<p>That is definitely worth considering. That&#39;s an additional milligram a day for some people. (Don&#39;t pay attention to their food/tea consumption table. Those estimates are provably way too low. See my post I cited earlier.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Distillation removes fluoride, but it also removes all other minerals that you want in your water. 
Reverse osmosis is the way to go, but it can be pretty pricy if you want a filter at home to use. The best alternative for me was to buy drinking and cooking water in those big 20l jugs from the grocery store, it&#39;s pretty cheap and it is reverse osmosis treated water. 
Hope this helps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of irrelevant, but funny nonetheless. I have a TDS meter and tested my water before/after distillation. Before it read ~170 ppm inorganic compounds, after distillation it read 000 ppm. Then I used a brita sink filter and it did literally nothing. I let it run 10 minutes, again nothing. 30 minutes, nothing. I changed the filter, same thing- nothing. It still read around 170 ppm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the Brita claim off their website: The Brita® Pitcher Filter Systems and the Brita® Faucet Filter are both excellent water filtration products offering different filtering techniques. The best product is the one that most meets your individual needs. Both products reduce the contaminants that most commonly concern consumers — lead and chlorine (taste and odor) — and both products deliver great-tasting Brita® water. The Brita® Pitcher Systems also reduce copper and mercury — which the Brita® Faucet Filter can&#39;t do. But unlike the pitcher, the Faucet Filter removes the microbes, Cryptosporidium and Giardia, and reduces the chemicals Atrazine, Lindane, Benzene, Trichloroethylene and Asbestos.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if chlorine should be worried about, but lead is pretty high up there. There are other cheaper methods though, like using cilantro. It soaks up the lead in the water: <a href="http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2013/september/cilantro-that-favorite-salsa-ingredient-purifies-drinking-water.html">http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2013/september/cilantro-that-favorite-salsa-ingredient-purifies-drinking-water.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>theres different kinds of flouride. gravity filters simply dont &quot;catch&quot; all the fluoride. you need to distill it or use reverse osmosis.</p>

<p>Gravity fed water filters have their place though. Id certainly prefer a filter over not, but im not one of those people satisfied with 90% of toxins gone, i need the full 100.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It concentrates it in the water that&#39;s left over. Let&#39;s say you make spaghetti, the water you boil the noodles in has more concentrated fluoride. Distillation catches the steam from boiling water and collects it when it recondenses into water. All the shit that was in the water gets left behind</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do some research. I have a berkey water filter that is a gravity operated ceramic filter with additional fluoride filters attached (all sold from Berkey company). I hope this helps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the Brita claim off their website: The Brita® Pitcher Filter Systems and the Brita® Faucet Filter are both excellent water filtration products offering different filtering techniques. The best product is the one that most meets your individual needs. Both products reduce the contaminants that most commonly concern consumers — lead and chlorine (taste and odor) — and both products deliver great-tasting Brita® water. The Brita® Pitcher Systems also reduce copper and mercury — which the Brita® Faucet Filter can&#39;t do. But unlike the pitcher, the Faucet Filter removes the microbes, Cryptosporidium and Giardia, and reduces the chemicals Atrazine, Lindane, Benzene, Trichloroethylene and Asbestos.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if chlorine should be worried about, but lead is pretty high up there. There are other cheaper methods though, like using cilantro. It soaks up the lead in the water: <a href="http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2013/september/cilantro-that-favorite-salsa-ingredient-purifies-drinking-water.html">http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2013/september/cilantro-that-favorite-salsa-ingredient-purifies-drinking-water.html</a></p>
