        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com. </p>

<p>This took away the only tool for communicating <em>with</em> reddit <em>about</em> reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit.com. Taking that away was the first step.</p>

<p>2) The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.</p>

<p>I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXlWiTPn7pQ#t=12">this short doc</a> and tell me reddit wasn&#39;t added into the equation. Once again, I do not support RP, I just find this example very fascinating.</p>

<p>3) Once the subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.  </p>

<p>I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;.</p>

<p>4) The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent. </p>

<p>All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that <em>never</em> posted again.</p>

<p>5) Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed. </p>

<p>What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?</p>

<p>6) All of the proper &quot;checks and balances&quot; are now in place. </p>

<p>So now we are being fed an anti-Muslim/Islam/Russian/India smear campaign weekly. The amount of stories that demonize these groups is sickening to witness. And with minimal research you can see that most of them are hyperbole, sensationalized, and sometimes outright fiction.</p>

<p>But thats okay, when something goes against the &quot;US is good&quot; narrative, every detail is examined and the slightest inconsistency is used to dismiss the entire story. But that diligence disappears when the story is bashing somewhere else. And those who point it out are downvoted out of sight.</p>

<p>And people will say &quot;What are you talking about, people are constantly bashing the US in every thread&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes that is absolutely true. Because those people have decided to even out the score. When you have hundreds of fake accounts moving the narrative in a certain direction, then it is essential for people to come out and loudly counter-balance the propaganda.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.</p>

<p>Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. </p>

<p>And I believe this can essentially be boiled down to greed. Reddit gets billions of views. The people who run reddit are not the &quot;cool bloggers&quot; they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence. </p>

<p>And they know it. You should too.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/noteworthy">What reddit used to be compared to what it is today.</a> Notice how this site used to actually produce REAL positive changes in the REAL world. </p>

<p>This was the peak in 2011: An anonymous Redditor exposed The Elan School, an abusive boarding school in Maine, which was then shut down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a web dev and have experience as a server admin.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot of work to setup a forum like Reddit, with a lot of challenges. Just take a look at anon news and the spam problems they have.</p>

<p>That being said, we could use the existing Reddit source code (it is open source) or setup a form using any of several PHP forum systems out there.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got some server space that&#39;s decent through a Canadian provider. No matter what we do, we&#39;ll be spied on of course, but at the same time, the NSA is sucking up so much info I doubt they can actually sift through a fraction of it. I doubt they&#39;re targeting individuals so much as making graphs to see how well propaganda works. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t entirely agree with everything OP said. I want to make that clear. I think some of the moderation is clearly rules violations (e.g. wordnews with things not being world news, TIL has a strict no politics policy, and some things get through yes and it&#39;s a little subjective, but I&#39;d hardly call it conspiracy). All that being said, it is owned by a Newscorp company (or former newscorp company now spinoff? I can never keep it straight). I think it&#39;s a mix of intentional censorship and also rules violations and subjective mods. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a lot of time these days, but I&#39;d be willing to look at this. I&#39;m a yank, currently based out of the South Pacific....could probably get some server space in AU/NZ too if people would feel better about that. </p>

<p><a href="http://penguindreams.org/resume/">http://penguindreams.org/resume/</a></p>

<p>...probably have too much real information up there...plus it&#39;s way out of date.... and as you can tell by the site design, my graphics and design skills aren&#39;t all that great, so any UI help would be awesome. I&#39;m sure we could find volunteers who are good with Illustrator/Photoshop/Web too. I do have good CSS skills.  </p>

<p>What do you think the platform should be? Reddit code base, reddit clone or fourm software? Something else?</p>

<p>You can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:sumdog@battlepenguin.com">sumdog@battlepenguin.com</a> (sorry I don&#39;t have PGP keys published...on my todo list). I&#39;ve been meaning to setup a Jabber server too on that domain. I&#39;ve got a Gmail if you use GTalk with OTR encryption if you prefer that. </p>

<p>I&#39;m super tired so I&#39;m probably gonna crash early. My friends are all US/Pacific time; usually when I talk to them online at work it&#39;s like 2/3pm there. My timezone is New Zealand. </p>

<p>I also have a lot of projects on my burners (trying to get some papers published; get into graduate school and stuff--little overwhelming actually), but I&#39;ll do everything that I can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It misses two key developmemnts that preceded these.</p>

<p>First the subdividing of reddit into subreddits rather than the original reddit.com which had the effect that people were no longer exposed to things they didn&#39;t already think they wanted to hear.</p>

<p>And when people resisted this subdividing and  continued to post on what become r/reddit.com becuase they didn&#39;t want to be subdivided into r/conservative or r/liberal the reddit owners actually shut r/reddit.com down to actively prevent people from coming together there. Everyone objected but they did it anyway.</p>

<p>Subdividing was huge.
Now the millions on reddit could never hear the story posted in an obscure subreddit that would have been voted up and changed their lives or the politics of the world.</p>

<p>They will just see cats.</p>

<p>at first they said &quot;don&#39;t worry!&quot; you should cross post to relevant subreddit  to spread the word but of course soon time rules stopped you from crossposting to multiple relevant political reddireddits even if they were relevant. Then the posts were auto censored if they appeared I  more than one place so you couldn&#39;t info others and let them have the chance to see if even if you did wait out the time limits.
.</p>

<p>And then of course was the introduction of moderators which of course was the opposite of what reddit was _ crowd moderated- reader self moderated by voting. That really was the icing on the cake that told us all what the real objectives were..</p>

<p>and of course the infamous shadow ban where they ban your post  but you take no notice becuase you don&#39;t know it.</p>

<p>Then they started censoring the top posts lists so even historically high posts were disappeared.</p>

<p>They try to create a false consensus and marginalize conspiracy theories whereas my guess is the typical reddit user is more open to them.</p>

Before it got bogged down in memes, and the pursuit of karma, it was a truly original concept.<br/>
It&#39;s gone from a fringe concern that provided an alternative meeting place for alternative minds, into yet another mainstream corporate concern.<br/>
The same ethos still exists, but it&#39;s being diluted by accounts who have an investment in spreading propaganda, conformity, and disinformation.               </p>

<p>This subreddit in particular has become overrun with shills. And yes, even mentioning that word will guarantee downvotes. But downvotes in this sub either represent the truth or a troll.<br/>

<p>you are silly to think it was an original concept. Reddit is a rip off of digg. digg was a ripoff of fark with an old warez &quot;topsite&quot; ranking system thrown on, fark is a rippoff of &quot;cool links&quot; from early internet before search engines. Reddit just happened to be at the right spot when people were pissed off at all the digg 2.0 crap. Reddit will die just like everything else eventually. </p>

<p>I think a lot of the problem with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is that information became too much. It is hard to hold a lot of conspiracies as fact when actual fact is thrown back at you. So basically information is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> greatest downfall. The last holdouts here are people who are just philosophically against certain people (real or not; Jews erm Zionists, Israel, Americans, Illuminati, free masons, aliens, lizard people) and want to believe in nonsense so much it has clouded their judgement. People not of this ilk read the facts and don&#39;t get railroaded into believing everything on the internet like they used to. People are becoming smarter. Information is out there. Conspiracies are much harder to keep under foot as anyone with google can read the other side of the story.</p>

Because trust me, although they say reddit runs in the red, it is a lie, the fact that they have sold out is indication of all the dirty money they are getting on the side. 
If this was the user powered democratic site it used to be, then I could see them needing our support, and I would offer it, but as it stands I&#39;m not paying to be brainwashed with controlled propaganda.</p>

<p>It seems your gripe is with individual subs, not the Reddit site as a whole. Reddit gave the users power to own their own sub the way they want to, and that is still the function. It&#39;s not the Admin&#39;s fault that <a href="/r/Iama">/r/Iama</a> changed its rules, or that <a href="/r/todayIlearned">/r/todayIlearned</a> has a more strict auto-policy. It&#39;s true freedom to express things how the sub-owner wants.  But you&#39;re right, lets not pay the people that give <strong><em>you</em></strong> the freedom to create your own sub and put what you want in it <strong><em>FOR FREE</em></strong>.</p>

<p>IT is if the site they are using is free. Same thing with popular interviews in news articles. Free. Biased? maybe. But that&#39;s another point entirely. Remember that Reddit gets free publicity when someone famous comes here, too. Scratch my back kind of deal. </p>

<p>Reddit Admins do not control, edit, or manipulate the content in a sub. IF that was the case subs like <a href="/r/watchpeopledie">/r/watchpeopledie</a> wouldn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>It&#39;s up to the subreddit itself, which is run by the mods, which are initially subscribers. So that means people like <strong>you</strong> and <strong>I</strong> can alter the way a popular subreddit works with enough determination. I dont know about you, but I dont work for Reddit. Do I have a preference on how certain subs are run? Yes, but that&#39;s all me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It went slightly differently.</p>

<p>The Obama-shill takeover of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> came before the removal of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.  The shills were led by Karmanaut/PHOY and BritishEnglishPolice and implemented a lot of the tactics found on Democratic Underground.  One day you could find posts calling Obama a Republican.  The next day you could not.</p>

<p>It was AFTER that that <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> was silenced, because it was a possible information stream for political reality.  Imagine if people were able to communicate freely about Obama&#39;s betrayal, BP and GE/Fukushima, etc.  <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> had to go.</p>

<p>After that, they even neutered <a href="/r/occupywallstreet">/r/occupywallstreet</a>.  Same pattern... poignant pieces critical of the status quo were on the front page.  Then changes were made and now they are not.</p>

<p>Pigs fear truth.  Humans are made of truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been around reddit a few years now and mostly use it as a way to pass some time at work so I haven&#39;t been paying that close attention... but this all seems pretty accurate.</p>

<p>I never realized that the loss of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> was so important but you&#39;re totally right. It was at that point that the big subreddits started to balloon and get way too much power. They became the only game in town.</p>

<p>I also loved the fact that it was community policed. We can downvote the shitty posts... but now with all the censorship it just seems forced. If a topic has 1000&#39;s of upvotes it should not be deleted no matter what the reason. They could use those tags to let people know if something is misleading, but there is no reason to censor entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to reddit, wish I had investigated it years ago when it was apparently much better. I agree with you based on what little I have experienced on here though. If there is a negative opinion that goes against the U.S. and it&#39;s agenda of the moment, there will be an inordinate amount of posts with positive pablum or someone will takeover the thread by going completely off topic. Sadly, this has happened to most of the other websites as well. Incredible to think there are people paid with taxpayer money to troll the internet trying to shape public opinion. The notion of American Democracy isn&#39;t dying, it&#39;s been dead for awhile now.</p>

<p>That said, there&#39;s still good content in the new queue. Don&#39;t just read what&#39;s &quot;hot&quot;. The misconception that this whole site revolves around is &quot;consensus = good&quot;.</p>

<p>There are still things I like about reddit, but the whole le upvote/downvote system just amplifies that circlejerk attitude that&#39;s apparent even here. Only saving grace is the subreddit system where any opinion can have it&#39;s own forum, but that&#39;s still a bunch of isolated echo chambers rather than people having to frequently confront harsh dissent and judge things for themselves (rather than looking at a &quot;what&#39;s my opinion&quot; number to the left). And now that some mods are blatantly censoring information that doesn&#39;t fit the status quo, this is only going to get much worse.</p>

<p>Even though I joined reddit while it was still in its infancy, I stopped visiting reddit very often for all the reasons you mention, except for a handful of select subreddits that aren&#39;t yet too full of remote controlled &quot;bots&quot; as well as paid shills and the willfully ignorant who are brainwashed to spout the governments propaganda -- and yes, that includes the nationalist Israelis who believe all others are inferior and disparagingly call us &quot;Goyim&quot;.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just reading an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-village-against-the-world-by-dan-hancox-uncovers-spains-communist-utopia-2013-11#ixzz2n0Go2FDj">article about a Spanish anarchist village called &quot;Marinaleda&quot;</a>, one of the guys who lives there said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have learned that it is not enough to define utopia, nor is it enough to fight against the reactionary forces. One must build it here and now, brick by brick, patiently but steadily, until we can make the old dreams a reality: that there will be bread for all, freedom among citizens, and culture; and to be able to read with respect the word ‘peace’. We sincerely believe that there is no future that is not built in the present.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They should know. Now the source code of reddit is open source, so if someone wanted to run a copy, the only obstacle would be server costs -- which could be crowd funded, provided there was a sound concept of independence behind it. It could, for example, incorporate moderator elections, resolutions of no confidence vs mods and what have you, or even a kind of reputation system that was somehow inherently tied to the age of an account, giving senior users certain limited privileges of moderation themselves -- whoever would be found guilty of abuse would lose their account, and would have to start from square one, reputation-wise (coming to think of it, the whole stackoverflow and affiliate sites are somewhat like that).</p>

<p>Sounds like a pretty good idea to me! Of course, the whole thing would need to be pitched competently to even be acknowledged, but I imagine the general concept would sound attractive to many. Not sure about legal issues, for &quot;the law&quot; is a jungle not even the natives can navigate anymore. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reason 1 </p>

<p>Maybe, is there is no  other way to send feedback?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Reasons 2, 3, 4, 5</p>

<p>Here you have a point, and it&#39;s definitely a problem which needs to be addressed. HOWEVER, I&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s a conspiracy, it just depends on which insane control freaks got there first. reddit should defnitely address before this becomes wikipedia which is 100% paid shills posting pure publicist approved drivel like this article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michael_Bay">Micahael Bay</a> he&#39;s the dumb fuck behind the Transformers movies in case you don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>This same shit is happening here too on reddit.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="/r/television/">/r/television/</a> can you believe this bullshit is in the sidebar? :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When submitting a news story, <strong>Please do not submit</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>    Gossip or sensationalized headlines</li>
<li>    Requests for pirated or illegal content</li>
<li>    <strong>Negative posts or complaints about a show. There is enough quality TV in the world to ignore the bad stuff</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>With the amount of pure <strong>SHIT</strong> on television, I&#39;m not allowed to be &quot;negative&quot; ???</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing though, I&#39;m convinced it is at least in part paid studio shills, but it&#39;s also delusional retards. Here in Hollywood and Los Angeles, this delusional self-obsessed personality is very common, and very often they demand everyone around them conform to being &#39;positive&#39; and if you&#39;re not, they can become violently angry. </p>

<p>So I can 100% see one of these Hollywood obsessives as a moderator, probably along with paid shills running these television forums. They have taken almost every single topic about television and every subreddit is FULL of word for word STUDIO PRESS RELEASES. And as you read, if you get too &quot;negative&quot; that&#39;s not allowed, and you&#39;ll get banned by the thought police.</p>

<p>So for now, I&#39;m experimenting and started <a href="/r/tvsucks/">/r/tvsucks/</a> and see if it goes anywhere.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Reason 6. </p>

<p>Now here you&#39;re just letting your own biases get in the way. This has nothing to do with the rest of your post. There are good reasons to hate the Muslim Culture which oppresses women and treats them like dogs. I&#39;m very passionate about this, and you better believe I&#39;m going to open my big mouth about it any time someone tries to tell me how liberal and open and misunderstodd they are. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not racist, they are fully capable of changing their behavior and allowing women and gays and others to all have individual rights. Long story short, I don&#39;t buy  your anti-muslim conspiracy bullshit at the end of your post. </p>

<hr/>

<p>...but overall, I think you have a point about the invasion of corporate shills.</p>

<p>So now we are being fed an anti-Muslim/Islam/Russian/India smear campaign weekly. The amount of stories that demonize these groups is sickening to witness. And with minimal research you can see that most of them are hyperbole, sensationalized, and sometimes outright fiction.</p>

<p>But thats okay, when something goes against the &quot;US is good&quot; narrative, every detail is examined and the slightest inconsistency is used to dismiss the entire story. But that diligence disappears when the story is bashing somewhere else. And those who point it out are downvoted out of sight.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t your government. It&#39;s Americans doing this on your free time out of their own will, the same about the supposed Jewish Internet Force or supposed Military shills... they don&#39;t need to do any of that because they have the common American man doing it for them out of their own free will. And right wing Europeans. Stop thinking it&#39;s just the government, you don&#39;t realise how fucked up normal people really are. Especially suburban white American males in the 20s and 30&#39;s who are given anonymity. Reddit&#39;s prime demographic.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a conspiracy that racism, military propaganda and general right wing attitudes are prevalent all over reddit, just the harsh reality of a website that has become mainstream.</p>

<p>The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was the outcome of the plan, obviously dropping reddit.com accelerated some of the agendas of moderators who wished for more power. I&#39;m not watching the video I&#39;m just going to giggle about Rob Paul cause he was a fringe candidate the whole time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) Once the subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.</p>

<p>I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be &quot;approved&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All good things come to an end. Reddit is influential now, it got to be there through what you said, of course celebrities want to use it to promote themselves and their products. Reddit also sells them advertisements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4) The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.</p>

<p>All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere, cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. Also, around this time, &quot;feel good&quot; military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. From brand new accounts that never posted again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/r/MilitaryConspiracy">/r/MilitaryConspiracy</a> for your complaints about a military agenda to increase its media standing using reddit. Did you expect soldiers not to be human and enjoy reddit? Sure the MIC is a real problem but military families and those in it are people too. Not robots, not aliens and not only that they&#39;re probably on Facebook as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5) Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.</p>

<p>What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They still vote, moderators are responsible for keeping their subreddits how they want it. Just because a subreddit has a popular name doesn&#39;t mean it owes you or anyone else anything. You can start your own subreddit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6) All of the proper &quot;checks and balances&quot; are now in place.</p>

<p>So now we are being fed an anti-Muslim/Islam/Russian/India smear campaign weekly. The amount of stories that demonize these groups is sickening to witness. And with minimal research you can see that most of them are hyperbole, sensationalized, and sometimes outright fiction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh, reddit got popular and now it sucks. Yeah well Shit Reddit Says documents a lot of the casual comment racism, sexism and homophobia so <strong>it&#39;s nothing new</strong>. The anti-Non-American sentiment has been here for a while, some try to fight it and other will decry it only when it suits their agenda. I&#39;m talking to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excuse me the site a few years ago was still a corporate website designed to sell advertisements to self-organizing communities that would be easily sorted by the demographics they chose to identify as. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel you are looking at it wrong. Reddit has only ovolved as it has because the designers wanted it this way. If you feel the site has lost its way perhaps go make a new one. When <strong>Digg</strong> fucked up everyone came here to Reddit, now no one remembers what a Digg is. If Reddit fucks up so badly everyone leaves, maybe they will choose your website, if you haven&#39;t fucked it up by then. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I believe this can essentially be boiled down to greed. Reddit gets billions of views. The people who run reddit are not the &quot;cool bloggers&quot; they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence.</p>

<p>And they know it. You should too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, I still think they cool guys and gals, I&#39;m glad they made this big website and I&#39;m happy they have a say in how it goes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT: What reddit used to be compared to what it is today. Notice how this site used to actually produce REAL positive changes in the REAL world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet here you are complaining about how you can&#39;t do that instead of perhaps trying to make that happen. </p>

<p>You have evidence but you are trying to make it fit into a theory you have prejudged to be the correct one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a story was censored. </p>

<p>About 2 years ago there was a lot of pressure put on the U.S. from Israel to attack Iran, there was even a threat that Israel would attack on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>Then this happened <a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=31&amp;amp;Itemid=74&amp;amp;jumival=8736">120 NAM Countries Head to Iran Despite Western Pressure</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sunday, the Non-Aligned Movement is meeting in Tehran. In fact, 50 heads of state are heading to Iran for this meeting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought, wow that&#39;s relevant, so I submitted a post to r/politics which got caught in the spam filter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/f5lgx">r/Politics is for U.S. politics and news only.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, fair enough. So I submitted it to r/worldnews</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/f5ndo">Please submit from another domain instead. Thank you.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was disheartening to say the least.</p>

<p>Just a heads up, The 17th Summit of the Non Aligned Movement is to be held in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2015. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There needs to be a reddit where the system cannot be gamed so much. But, I am an optimist. There will be other sites, and as the internet evolves, there will be new ways to share information and comment on the accuracy of it. Probably what would help is when we get past a single website being used to share, and instead have the fusion of tens of thousands of websites are coming together in the browser in real time.</p>

<p>The effect of that could not be more clear.  Anyone doing anything with any outside group will be subject to removal as a user.  Note how they phrased it...&quot;any form of agreement&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I wasn&#39;t saying there aren&#39;t groups manipulating reddit.  Reddit is clearly intentionally gameable and if anything ever leaked through that wasn&#39;t supposed to, the admins would be told to shut it down.  There are certainly groups gaming reddit for purpose of censorship, intelligence and profit.</p>

<p>Between: the default frontpage, the power of mods to delete posts and sources, the filter bubble which determines that important information is relegated to specific underrepresented subs, the censorship of many websites, the rules which suggest [only] certain corporate is reliable journalism, the uneven voting mechanism which gives <a href="/r/new">/r/new</a> too much power and the imbalance between downvoting and upvoting, the inability to post an important link which has already been posted even if that link has been poorly titled or unfairly deleted/ lost in r/new.  </p>

<p>There are many factors which make reddit not ideal for a democratic source of news and knowledge.  I just don&#39;t think there is a singular nefarious entity controlling it (ie Newhouse/InQtel, whatever). Everyone has their hands in the pot and there is perhaps a less than honest reason it is run the way it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want differing opinion.  I think this adds to the discussion.</p>

<p>But these conspiratard trolls are not merely offering differing opinions or asking skeptical questions . . . they are mocking and disrupting and shutting down inquiry.</p>

<p>The above comments didn&#39;t challenge <a href="/u/aaa222">/u/aaa222</a>&#39;s theory by pointing out there was no evidence and that his theory was based on hearsay and speculation.  And they certainly didn&#39;t do so in a respectful manner.</p>

<p>Plus, <a href="/u/aaa222">/u/aaa222</a> did offer evidence.  It was circumstantial rather than direct but it was evidence.  I also didn&#39;t see any hearsay evidence referred to.  Yes, there was speculation.  But this is exactly the type of conspiracy where direct evidence is not going to be freely available so we have to rely on circumstantial evidence and speculation.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d say airing these theories is appropriate and while it&#39;s fine to note the quality of the evidence isn&#39;t iron-clad or that the speculation is based on faulty logic or unlikely, it&#39;s not appropriate to try to shut down discussion of the theory based on these grounds.</p>

<p>Problem is that people disregard that its speculation and instead it becomes fact. And once some tinfoil hat starts saying its fact, its hard to change the mind of other tinfoil hats from thinking any other way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>10 characteristics of conspiracy theorists
A useful guide by Donna Ferentes</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Arrogance. They are always fact-seekers, questioners, people who are trying to discover the truth: sceptics are always &quot;sheep&quot;, patsies for Messrs Bush and Blair etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Relentlessness. They will always go on and on about a conspiracy no matter how little evidence they have to go on or how much of what they have is simply discredited. (Moreover, as per 1. above, even if you listen to them ninety-eight times, the ninety-ninth time, when you say &quot;no thanks&quot;, you&#39;ll be called a &quot;sheep&quot; again.) Additionally, they have no capacity for precis whatsoever. They go on and on at enormous length. </p></li>
<li><p>Inability to answer questions. For people who loudly advertise their determination to the principle of questioning everything, they&#39;re pretty poor at answering direct questions from sceptics about the claims that they make. </p></li>
<li><p>Fondness for certain stock phrases. These include Cicero&#39;s &quot;cui bono?&quot; (of which it can be said that Cicero understood the importance of having evidence to back it up) and Conan Doyle&#39;s &quot;once we have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however unlikely, must be the truth&quot;. What these phrases have in common is that they are attempts to absolve themselves from any responsibility to produce positive, hard evidence themselves: you simply &quot;eliminate the impossible&quot; (i.e. say the official account can&#39;t stand scrutiny) which means that the wild allegation of your choice, based on &quot;cui bono?&quot; (which is always the government) is therefore the truth. </p></li>
<li><p>Inability to employ or understand Occam&#39;s Razor. Aided by the principle in 4. above, conspiracy theorists never notice that the small inconsistencies in the accounts which they reject are dwarfed by the enormous, gaping holes in logic, likelihood and evidence in any alternative account. </p></li>
<li><p>Inability to tell good evidence from bad. Conspiracy theorists have no place for peer-review, for scientific knowledge, for the respectability of sources. The fact that a claim has been made by anybody, anywhere, is enough for them to reproduce it and demand that the questions it raises be answered, as if intellectual enquiry were a matter of responding to every rumour. While they do this, of course, they will claim to have &quot;open minds&quot; and abuse the sceptics for apparently lacking same. </p></li>
<li><p>Inability to withdraw. It&#39;s a rare day indeed when a conspiracy theorist admits that a claim they have made has turned out to be without foundation, whether it be the overall claim itself or any of the evidence produced to support it. Moreover they have a liking (see 3. above) for the technique of avoiding discussion of their claims by &quot;swamping&quot; - piling on a whole lot more material rather than respond to the objections sceptics make to the previous lot. </p></li>
<li><p>Leaping to conclusions. Conspiracy theorists are very keen indeed to declare the &quot;official&quot; account totally discredited without having remotely enough cause so to do. Of course this enables them to wheel on the Conan Doyle quote as in 4. above. Small inconsistencies in the account of an event, small unanswered questions, small problems in timing of differences in procedure from previous events of the same kind are all more than adequate to declare the &quot;official&quot; account clearly and definitively discredited. It goes without saying that it is not necessary to prove that these inconsistencies are either relevant, or that they even definitely exist. </p></li>
<li><p>Using previous conspiracies as evidence to support their claims. This argument invokes scandals like the Birmingham Six, the Bologna station bombings, the Zinoviev letter and so on in order to try and demonstrate that their conspiracy theory should be accorded some weight (because it&#39;s “happened before”.) They do not pause to reflect that the conspiracies they are touting are almost always far more unlikely and complicated than the real-life conspiracies with which they make comparison, or that the fact that something might potentially happen does not, in and of itself, make it anything other than extremely unlikely. </p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s always a conspiracy. And it is, isn&#39;t it? No sooner has the body been discovered, the bomb gone off, than the same people are producing the same old stuff, demanding that there are questions which need to be answered, at the same unbearable length. Because the most important thing about these people is that they are people entirely lacking in discrimination. They cannot tell a good theory from a bad one, they cannot tell good evidence from bad evidence and they cannot tell a good source from a bad one. And for that reason, they always come up with the same answer when they ask the same question. </p></li>

<p>BS. we enjoy opinions. we enjoy barely trained wet-behind-the-ears PR shills doing their stuff badly.</p>

<p>its fcuking hilarious when some brave cubicle warrior that was shitting in their diapers when some ancient news story was going down, comes along and tries to rewrite known history to people that lived through the events. </p>

<p>these young PR shills have their bullet points, their links to Snopes, wikipedia etc, they try so hard to be expert.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much an ad hominem attack right there, encased in delicious conjecture. Hypocrite much?</p>

<p>If you can back that up with facts, then you can say it&#39;s <em>not</em> conjecture. I think maybe you don&#39;t know what it means.</p>

<p>Also,  I can call you worthless and you wouldn&#39;t consider that a personal attack? </p>

<p>paid is the missing word, they are PR people on a mission, and considering they spend half their time talking about playing BF4 et al, its a wonder why they suddenly find the urgent urge to talk about how Oswald shot JFK nobody else, case closed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I wasn&#39;t saying there aren&#39;t groups manipulating reddit.  Reddit is clearly intentionally gameable and if anything ever leaked through that wasn&#39;t supposed to, the admins would be told to shut it down.  There are certainly groups gaming reddit for purpose of censorship, intelligence and profit.</p>

<p>Between: the default frontpage, the power of mods to delete posts and sources, the filter bubble which determines that important information is relegated to specific underrepresented subs, the censorship of many websites, the rules which suggest [only] certain corporate is reliable journalism, the uneven voting mechanism which gives <a href="/r/new">/r/new</a> too much power and the imbalance between downvoting and upvoting, the inability to post an important link which has already been posted even if that link has been poorly titled or unfairly deleted/ lost in r/new.  </p>

<p>There are many factors which make reddit not ideal for a democratic source of news and knowledge.  I just don&#39;t think there is a singular nefarious entity controlling it (ie Newhouse/InQtel, whatever). Everyone has their hands in the pot and there is perhaps a less than honest reason it is run the way it is.</p>
