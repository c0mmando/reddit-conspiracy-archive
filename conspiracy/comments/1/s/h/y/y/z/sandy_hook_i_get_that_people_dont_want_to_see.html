       The school was also demolished and no photo of him ever entering the building. (The school had cameras). We could go down a list of things that are suspicious there, but the guy in camo pants being chased through the woods is the most suspicious.

       Well camo man was an off duty something or other (can't remember what) and the explanation was that he heard reports of shooting at the school and went out his back yard to investigate (umm… are there any houses nearby?) anyway, he saw all these cops and laid down to avoid getting shot. Sounds reasonable. Time to google map nearby houses…

       Houses? Do lodges count as houses? There is a Masonic lodge adjacent to where the school once was and in the general direction that camo man was running. Maybe the lodge is camo man's home.

       I'm a firm believer that it's all a hoax in some fashion or another. What's the general take on the "reality" of what did happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it no dead kids and a bunch of covered "bodies" while the remaining students and teachers were told, "please exit with your eyes covered!"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or was it real dead kids caused by a spec ops gunman and some drugged patsy thrown in to take the fall?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I ask is because if it's the former, what did they do with the supposed dead students? Okay, so there are no
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       dead students but
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       has to not show up the next day. You can't have a dozen dead students that no teacher or kid ever heard of... or could you? Someone would have to have missing classmates, where did they go?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt this is fishy but I am just thinking of it critically. For it to work, it would have had to been parents that could have been "bought." Meaning, "take this money, grieve on camera, and relocate so no one sees you and your child together again." It just seems like a whole lot could go wrong. So if Sandy Hook parents go disappearing, maybe that's why.

       It could also be true, that everything we've seen actually did happened. We need to keep an open mind about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I can't really see one piece of evidence that could not be explained away. I'm talking about actual photos of the crime. Why can't we see these?  Should there not be an open file for investigative reporting purposes? Is there no obligation by peace officers to reveal their evidence? If not, then someone should sue.

       I agree that is a possibility as well. However, like you said, the evidence is so weak and so many parts are suspicious.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lanza family, namely the father and the LIBOR scandal, and Adam (aka Ryan).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         MSM coverage with wrong footage (wrong school with 'happening now' overlay).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Creepy use of crisis actors like Robby Parker (so fake it's absurd).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Resistance on releasing 911 calls.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lack of surveillance footage despite a new system installed prior to the event.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       At this point, yes I want to see the footage. If I'm going to believe thus, I want to see good steady footage of the gunman entering and shooting every single one of those kids. I want to see the blood and gore on CCTV, not because I'm "sick like that," but rather so I can know it's real and remove the doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point it's necessary. Our own government has shown they can't be trusted and will do anything to push their agenda. If we're to believe this isn't their handiwork, we're going to need damn good proof. We don't even have a shred at this point.

       Cause I'd like to actually see some evidence rather than some text written 'report'.  As I posted - I get the kids POV but who cares about the physco that killed the kids?  Surly we can see some evidence he was actually in the room dead. Right?

       The media have tried to convince the public that Adam Lanza had a brother called Ryan. In fact, Adam Lanza was an only child, and he is alive and well and living under the name Ryan Lanza.  There was no body at Sandy Hook.

       I really don't think any Lanzas went shooting, and neither did any Lanzas die that day. This video makes a compelling case that "Nancy Lanza" is alive and well. She goes by the name Annie Haddad, of variants of.

       There's no way that woman in the video is Nancy. Her chin is totally different, eyes and teeth. Why on earth would the planners put her on TV? That makes no sense. Nice try though.

       We don't even need to see him in room and dead.  Seeing him in the room, alive, and with a rifle in his hands would go a long way.  There have to be shots of him in the school that don't include dead children in the picture.

       I made a comment about this same thing recently. Witnesses say the shooter was masked.  Only the authorities say it was Adam Lanza.  But who's to say they didn't put him there.  And the guy they were chasing through the woods?  The man who was on the ground in handcuffs in front of the school according to eyewitness account?  It stinks to high heaven.

       only the ET photoshopped ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       photoshopping is a hallmark of Sandy Hoax, the Pozner photo of the kid in the school lobby is definitely shopped, you can see where they cut pasted his image into the lobby background, and did lightened one side of his face to simulate the daylight coming in from windows. artifacts and straight lines on his face from the exposure adjusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       the photos look good enough when seen at their 'normal' low-res versions as seen in newspapers and magazines, websites and TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       but as with all news photographs there are high res versions out there, on archive sites and so on, plus on foreign websites, these photos tell the true story.

       Because Adam Lanza is the same person, pre-name change. Probably paid off as well, wouldn't be surprising given his father.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is not a single picture of the two brothers together. Ryan "lost contact with his brother X years ago." Ryan was initially confused with the shooter because he had his brothers old ID? The interviewed aunt hasn't seen him since he was little and refers to Ryan as Adam. The pieces all fit quite well.

       It could easily be argued the exact opposite with the same degree of confidence. There is nothing concrete to suggest that is was a hoax. There is only circumstantial evidence that I've seen.

       Houses? Do lodges count as houses? There is a Masonic lodge adjacent to where the school once was and in the general direction that camo man was running. Maybe the lodge is camo man's home.
