    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a firm believer that it&#39;s all a hoax in some fashion or another. What&#39;s the general take on the &quot;reality&quot; of what did happen?</p>

<p>Was it no dead kids and a bunch of covered &quot;bodies&quot; while the remaining students and teachers were told, &quot;please exit with your eyes covered!&quot;?</p>

<p>Or was it real dead kids caused by a spec ops gunman and some drugged patsy thrown in to take the fall?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is because if it&#39;s the former, what did they do with the supposed dead students? Okay, so there are no <em>real</em> dead students but <em>someone</em> has to not show up the next day. You can&#39;t have a dozen dead students that no teacher or kid ever heard of... or could you? Someone would have to have missing classmates, where did they go?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt this is fishy but I am just thinking of it critically. For it to work, it would have had to been parents that could have been &quot;bought.&quot; Meaning, &quot;take this money, grieve on camera, and relocate so no one sees you and your child together again.&quot; It just seems like a whole lot could go wrong. So if Sandy Hook parents go disappearing, maybe that&#39;s why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could also be true, that everything we&#39;ve seen actually did happened. We need to keep an open mind about this. </p>

<p>Edit: I can&#39;t really see one piece of evidence that could not be explained away. I&#39;m talking about actual photos of the crime. Why can&#39;t we see these?  Should there not be an open file for investigative reporting purposes? Is there no obligation by peace officers to reveal their evidence? If not, then someone should sue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that is a possibility as well. However, like you said, the evidence is so weak and so many parts are suspicious.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lanza family, namely the father and the LIBOR scandal, and Adam (aka Ryan).</p></li>
<li><p>MSM coverage with wrong footage (wrong school with &#39;happening now&#39; overlay).</p></li>
<li><p>Creepy use of crisis actors like Robby Parker (so fake it&#39;s absurd).</p></li>
<li><p>Resistance on releasing 911 calls.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of surveillance footage despite a new system installed prior to the event.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, yes I want to see the footage. If I&#39;m going to believe thus, I want to see good steady footage of the gunman entering and shooting every single one of those kids. I want to see the blood and gore on CCTV, not because I&#39;m &quot;sick like that,&quot; but rather so I can know it&#39;s real and remove the doubt.</p>

<p>At this point it&#39;s necessary. Our own government has shown they can&#39;t be trusted and will do anything to push their agenda. If we&#39;re to believe this isn&#39;t their handiwork, we&#39;re going to need damn good proof. We don&#39;t even have a shred at this point.</p>

<p>photoshopping is a hallmark of Sandy Hoax, the Pozner photo of the kid in the school lobby is definitely shopped, you can see where they cut pasted his image into the lobby background, and did lightened one side of his face to simulate the daylight coming in from windows. artifacts and straight lines on his face from the exposure adjusting.</p>

<p>the photos look good enough when seen at their &#39;normal&#39; low-res versions as seen in newspapers and magazines, websites and TV.</p>

<p>There is not a single picture of the two brothers together.

The interviewed aunt hasn&#39;t seen him since he was little and refers to Ryan as Adam. The pieces all fit quite well.</p>
