        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The stock market can&#39;t go up in perpetuity without BLS and job data reflecting economic growth as it seems to be doing now.</p>

<p>The question is &quot;how long will people continue to accept the declining economic statistics and the growing fed QE and the ZIRP free money policy which is inflating a derivatives bubble such as humanity has never seen?&quot;. How long will stock market players, FOREX traders, and dollar holders across the globe continue to accept these things before we reach a &quot;Tipping Point&quot; of panic selling across the board?</p>

<p>The amount of real economic growth it would take to equal out the amount of QE and derivatives now in the system is unquestionably impossible to achieve. Our economy would have to grow several fold overnight in real terms IE producing manufacturing etc... to maintain the current bank derivatives holdings.</p>

<p>The Current ZIRP and derivatives bubble is a catch 22. Most of the derivatives created are interest rate derivatives betting that interest rates will stay close to 0% in perpetuity. The banks therefore need to accumulate more interest rate derivatives to pay for the older ones. They purchase more derivatives by borrowing money at close to 0% from the fed.</p>

<p>As you can see if the interest rate increases by even 1% it would throw everything into the toilet. Therefore the Fed is obligated to continue its ZIRP program or else face a derivatives bubble bursting and pretty much every bank in the world failing all at once.</p>

<p>The QE program stimulates the Stock market. QE is primarily a ploy to get people to buy stocks and it doesn&#39;t even scratch the surface on the HUNDREDS OF TRILLIONS of dollars being created by ZIRP and interest rate derivatives. </p>

<p>Mathematically the QE program should be able to be tapered without causing a bank collapse, however the panic stock selling that would be caused by tapering would.</p>

<p>Therefore the Fed is in a corner. </p>

<ol>
<li>Interest rates are at zero.</li>
<li>Increasing interest rates causes a derivatives collapse.</li>
<li>Negative interest rates causes a run on treasuries.</li>
<li>QE tapering causes panic in the stock markets.</li>
<li>No QE tapering causes people to realize that the economy isn&#39;t recovering.</li>
</ol>

<p>The best plan that the FED has so far?</p>

<ol>
<li>Talk about taper so people think the economy is recovering.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t ever actually taper because it would cause panic stock selling.</li>
<li>Keep interest rates at zero.</li>
</ol>

<p>This has worked so far. It is however doomed to fail as continued QE will force people to eventually realize that the &quot;recovery&quot; it&#39;s self is very phony. </p>

<p>The problem is there is no other option.</p>

<p>The idea for profit is kind of like a pyramid scheme. The insiders will &quot;cash out&quot; before everyone else and leave everyone else holding the US dollar bag. What do they cash out to? Hard assets my friend. Any asset that you can physically touch is fair game for &quot;cashing out&quot;.</p>

<p>No more financial instruments. They will fail with the banks.</p>

<p>If you want a resolution to this matter send this message to every broker that you know.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR There is a banking collapse coming soon. This period of prolonged free FED money is simply giving time to those at the top of the pyramid to buy hard assets and get out of the US dollar. If you want to stop these people from positioning their chess pieces you should send this message to every stock broker, FOREX trader, and low level banker that you know.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your analysis makes absolute sense, thank you for sharing and informing everyone, you are doing a public service to an ungrateful public! </p>

<p>&quot;Rich&quot; people are the biggest doomsday preppers - who else can afford a refurbished missile silo, but there&#39;s a lot up for sale.  And if things keep going as they are, there will be more empty missile silos waiting for more people to ride out the apocalypse.</p>

<p>What do you think are signs that this false equilibrium you&#39;ve mentioned will be disturbed into a crash so we can all be warned?  Thanks again for sharing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Crash is a mathematical certainty. What the fed is doing right now with QE and ZIRP is the equivalent of trying to stop a supernova with sunglasses.</p>

<p>Right now the fed is pushing back on this tide of debt in order to give it&#39;s members time to exit the market into &quot;hard assets&quot;. </p>

<p>I think that if we care about regular people having any &quot;real&quot; assets in the coming collapse we need to get the word out.</p>

<p>It is true that getting the word out will cause the collapse to come sooner, but more importantly it will allow regular people to get out of the system instead of only the top level bankers. </p>

<p>I recommend that you send this open letter to any Trader, Broker, or US Dollar Holder that you know.</p>

<p>If everyone became aware that the &quot;emperor has no clothes&quot; or in this case that &quot;the recovery is very phony&quot; and the reasons behind it, the collapse could come within a couple months, rather than years. </p>

<p>The collapse is certain. The question is do we pull the band-aid off slow or quick?</p>

<p>That depends on how many people know the state of affairs.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When would you expect the collapse to happen?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>On the current track 1-2 years away. If word gets out to regular people that banking is unsafe then the collapse could be months or even weeks away. That would arguably be a good thing because it would mean that regular people are exiting the system rather than the wealthy cashing out. The wealthy insiders want another year or two to migrate all the funds they have to physical wealth. It isn&#39;t a quick thing to migrate billions of dollars of wealth into physical goods without causing a shock in the system. That is the real purpose of QE and ZIRP. It is just to buy time.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What sort of impact would this have on Australia?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on how much wealth people in Australia have in a bank. All the global banks are playing the same game, and all countries are tied to the US dollar via their need for oil. </p>

<p>Australia, therefore, might recover quicker simply because of it&#39;s isolated geography, but it will still be in the same financial boat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you would think so, but look at it.   so much QE in the last 5 years - enough to cause big inflation, a rise in interest rates should have come with it - but that would have collapsed the house of cards... so what do they do?  artificially keep interest rates low, while printing money.   devalue all currencies at once.  </p>

<p>How did they do it?  Where is the inflation?   It&#39;s voodoo economics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but the value of the dollar is in the goods and services it can be negotiated for.   these goods and services are traded with other countries.   if american dollar is devalued, but other currencies aren&#39;t, then there will be inflation in USA - hyperinflation even.  </p>

<p>but we don&#39;t see hyperinflation, therefore the rest of the world must be conspiring to devalue their own currencies in a ratcheting manner.  who&#39;s turn is next?  we&#39;ve had Japan, Canada, .. USA&#39;s turn will come again soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is inflation of the US dollar and it does not match the interest rate set by the central bank. It&#39;s higher, as should be expected.</p>

<p>Central bank rate = 0.25%</p>

<p>Current inflation = 1% ( <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi</a> )</p>

<p>Hyperinflation requires the government to print ridiculously huge quantities relative to what&#39;s in circulation. something that the US just isn&#39;t doing. It has the advantage of there already being a huge quantity of currency in circulation, so adding an extra 10% gives a large amount of QE for relatively little inflation in return.</p>

<p>prices inflate and money supply increases.. what does &#39;inflation of the dollar&#39; mean?  </p>

<p>the QE was not only applied in US, it was a global event.  and the amount of money created was equal to the entire economic output of the world.   </p>

<p>If they even hint at cutting down the supply of this money, look what happens to the markets.. spook city, everyone wants to take their money out.   they are stuck pouring money into a bottomless pit.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Inflation is very much in the real economy, normal people haven&#39;t seen it yet due to lag. Since 2008 most agricultural commodities have gone up close to 300% in production costs. Retail prices have only gone up around 70-100% because retail stores are the power holders in their supply channels. They&#39;re holding down prices and squeezing producers out of existence which will only make matters worse down the road. Add one or two layers of middlemen distributors and you can see why the lag is so effective. Medium to weak players are being wiped out.</p>

<p>Your analysis is pretty good, but I think you should enlarge its scope to include the manipulation of the gold price. Despite massive physical demand in China, India and other Asian countries, the spot price, as determined by the Comex, has plummeted. This is because enormous quantities of worthless, unbacked paper gold certificates have been sold to keep the price down. </p>

<p>If you let a few people remove trillions of dollars from the economy and pocket it you&#39;re gonna have a bad time. It&#39;s that simple. Our economy is basically inside of a few pinatas that we refuse to take a swing at. And if you think those pinatas are sitting on that money and not reinvesting it into the oppression it created you&#39;d be sadly mistaken. While we all sit here and dissect it down to mathematics the sad fact is that it doesn&#39;t matter. They stole everything and used it to buy the world. Now the world is orchestrated by them.

    <div class="md"><p>The members of the American economics profession, as [Thurman] Arnold contended, performed a vital practical role in maintaining this unique system of corporate socialism American style. It was their role to prevent the American public from achieving a correct understanding of the actual workings of the American economic system. Economists instead were assigned the task to dispense priestly blessings that would allow business to operate independent of damaging political manipulation. They accomplished this task by means of their message of “laissez faire religion, based on a conception of a society composed of competing individuals.” However false as a description of the actual U.S. economy, this vision in the mind of the American public was in practice “transferred automatically to industrial organizations with nation-wide power and dictatorial forms of government.” Even though the arguments of economists were misleading and largely fictional, the practical—and beneficial—result of their deception was to throw a “mantle of protection … over corporate government” from various forms of outside interference. Admittedly, as the economic “symbolism got farther and farther from reality, it required more and more ceremony to keep it up.” But as long as this arrangement worked and there could be maintained “the little pictures in the back of the head of the ordinary man,” the effect was salutary—“the great [corporate] organization was secure in its freedom and independence.” It was this very freedom and independence of business professionals to pursue the correct scientific answer—the efficient answer—on which the economic progress of the United States depended.
—Robert H. Nelson, REACHING FOR HEAVEN ON EARTH</p>

<p>Economics satisfied the two most basic needs of investment bankers. First, bankers wanted practical people, willing to subordinate their education to their careers. Economics seemed designed as a sifting device. Economics was practical. It got people jobs. And it did this because it demonstrated that they were among the most fervent believers in the primacy of economic life... The only inexplicable part of the process was that economic theory (which is what, after all, economics students were supposed to know) served almost no function in an investment bank.
—Michael Lewis, LIAR’S POKER</p>

<p>Economists have been carrying coal to Newcastle since Adam Smith provided English merchants with a rationalization of what they had always wanted to do: treat their fellow human beings as beasts of burden. Economists continue to perform the same function. —John Kozy</p>

<p>“Economists enamored of pure markets begin with the theory, and hang models on assumptions that cannot themselves be challenged. The characteristic grammatical usage is an unusual subjunctive—the verb form ‘must be.’ For example, if wages for manual workers are declining, it must be that their economic value is declining. If a corporate raider walks away from a deal with half a billion dollars, it must be that he added that much value to the economy. If Japan can produce better autos than Detroit, there must be some inherent locational logic, else the market would not dictate that result. If commercial advertising leads consumers to buy shoddy or harmful products, they must be ‘maximizing their utility’—because we know by assumption that consumers always maximize their utility. How do we know that? Because to do anything else would be irrational. And how do we know that individuals always behave rationally? Because that is the premise from which we begin. The truly interesting institutional questions—the disjunctures between what free-market assumptions would predict and the actual outcomes—are dismissed by the tautological and deductive form of reasoning. The fact that the real world is already far from a perfect market is ignored for the sake of theoretic convenience. The dissenter cannot challenge the theory; he can only describe the real world.”—Robert Kuttner, EVERYTHING FOR SALE</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The interest rate set by the central bank is not the absolute market interest rate (which would be the rate of devaluation relative to some imaginary currency that is always worth the same amount). It&#39;s merely the rate at which the central bank loans to commercial banks. It can have a small effect on the market interest rate, but it doesn&#39;t decide it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to create a fixed interest rate when there is a free currency market.

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not. A banking collapse would require something else of value to judge the currencies against, or a major world war. The currencies are all racing towards the bottom together, there won&#39;t be one day when suddenly &quot;people decide&quot; that &quot;they aren&#39;t going to accept dollars or yuan&quot; anymore.</p>

<p>As long as there is one power on the Earth that controls the sea lanes and satellite orbital lanes, and they can project force/power everywhere, they can force everyone to accept their currency in exchange for natural resources, and their currency will be the &quot;reserve&quot; currency for the world because it will always have the value it can bring in exchange for natural resources, whether by force or the threat of force - then this government can force all the other governments to buy treasury bonds that decline 5%-10% over terms and in this manner they can tax every other country in the world directly through the balance sheet. We are simply at a point where the US has been going at this(infinite federal credit, no rational deficit rules) that the game is switching to another one.</p>

<p>None of it EVER meant anything, gold and silver don&#39;t mean anything they&#39;re just minerals, paper doesn&#39;t mean anything, it&#39;s all a digital/mathematical game based on a means human beings use to communicate called &quot;money&quot; or financial currency - it&#39;s a much simpler way to express &quot;how much X is worth&quot; or &quot;how much this banana is worth, how long it took you to grow, how much work went into it&quot; than actually keeping track of all that stuff. Yes, the little guy gets fucked, but that will only go on for as long as &quot;the little guys&quot; keep playing along in their own damnation and they tend to do it either because they are ignorant or because</p>

<p>Stop your community from banking with JP Morgan, stop doing business with companies that do, shun every investment opportunity that does any business with them or Goldman Sachs, you can change everything and you are all complicit in your own problems. Look in the mirror, get ready for anything negative that will come, but don&#39;t be thinking that one day all of a sudden everything is going to be like a post-apocalyptic movie.</p>

<p>In the financial crisis the world will go through, people will have to come together and agree to survive and treat one another as equals/friends and do what they can for one another, or we will all die. Help one another, don&#39;t be greedy, that&#39;s what got you there in the first place. All the THINGS and assets will still exist, there will still be gasoline, oil in the ground, gold in the mines, diamonds in the hills, food on the farms, animals in the woods, fish in the sea, all the buildings and office suites will still be there.. they&#39;ll just be FOR RENT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t play much chess do you? What is happening now is much like a global game of chess. Except instead of capturing a king the game is financial domination of the world.</p>

<p>You understand that when you move a chess piece you are trying to lure your opponent into making a series of moves that to him seems like good moves, but to you they are a check mate. Chess is not so much about moving your own pieces as it is about using your pieces to move your opponents.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at this as if it were a game between two parties, I know this is a major simplification, but there are two loosely connected major forces at play. These are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Globalists - they have no country, but have been using Europe, North America, and Australia as home bases for a while. Their corporate interests are heavily tied to these countries, though the decisions they make don&#39;t necessarily benefit the denizens thereof. </p></li>
<li><p>The Anti Globalists - AKA Most of Asia, Russia, South America, The Middle East, and parts of Africa</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Just because we can see their moves ahead of the curve doesn&#39;t mean that the other side won&#39;t play their chess pieces. In-Fact (barring a global war) a USD competitor is the only move they (The Anti Globalists) have yet to play.</p>

<p>How great this is for the Globalists! They have no country alignments, and all they control for sure is the USD. So when the New Currency is set up all that is left to do is devalue the USD against it.</p>

<p>BADA BING BADA BOOM</p>

<p>One world currency. Controlled by Asia but the Globalists don&#39;t care about who controls the currency, because a global monetary union has been the goal all along.</p>

<p>There are no other moves that can be played besides world war, and that won&#39;t happen very likely (at least right away) because both major parties are satisfied.</p>

<p>Asia is satisfied because it gets to control the global reserves, and the Globalists are satisfied because they get a single point of failure monetary union.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The financial domination of the world already happened. I&#39;m talking about the evolution of our species and the tools that we use in our global civilization(mankind&#39;s, not one particular named culture), you&#39;re talking about little groups fighting amongst themselves in that global civilization, as if &quot;globalists&quot; are a special secret group of people rather than the natural progression of man, just like &quot;whole country-ists&quot; would be the natural progression of a civilization developing on the west coast of one land-mass/&quot;country&quot;. I don&#39;t play irrelevant, small-picture games of chess that include personal biases and personal dislikes and personal feelings.</p>

<p>You honestly think a &quot;one world currency&quot; isn&#39;t a normal/necessary part in human development? It&#39;s going to happen whether you like it or not, and the important part is how individual people react and whether they work within the models given to them by negative controlling interests with lots of money and self-serving goals, or whether they cooperate amongst themselves in their own communities and make things work differently.</p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about stuff that is completely irrelevant to all of us, unless you are a member of the CFR I don&#39;t see how you think all this big talk of yours is relevant in any way other than your hobby - conspiracy fluff - </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>HEY YOU, LOL, WE ALREADY HAVE ONE, GO AND READ ABOUT THE BRETTON WOODS AGREEMENT&#39;S SYSTEM OF MONETARY MANAGEMENT. There already IS a single point of failure and that&#39;s the dollar, it&#39;s what props up all the other western currencies, that&#39;s why the US has been used as what it is(military enforcer for the whole planet) because it has the ability to spend extravagantly without anyone stopping them because faith in their line of credit is <em>the only</em> game in town. Other systems like it will just play out in the same way with another country playing the role of superpower/sole creditor.</p>

<p>This is all irrelevant to all of us, what is relevant is whether we keep going in this system or do other things to help ourselves and our own communities - because that&#39;s the only way we are going to BE helped, by spreading knowledge/good will/cooperation in our local communities. &quot;The globalists&quot; have already moved all the money out of this country and they are moving forward with their own game knowing that the musical chairs can&#39;t go on forever, we have to decide whether to keep cooperating and doing business with them or not, they can&#39;t enforce their will on everyone if a majority just stops doing business with them, and this will help us prepare for when the music stops and we have to rely on ourselves for our own lives again, not a banker&#39;s signature or entrance of zeros into a computer screen.</p>

<p>The big boys with all the money/power can kill anyone globally with impunity, they aren&#39;t going to all of a sudden go against each other, we aren&#39;t living in the 1800s anymore and world wars aren&#39;t as likely as they used to be, we already ARE living in &quot;one world&quot; as a system of civilization/species, one global economy, one point-of-failure currency which is all faith-based(<strong>but guess what, everything else would be too, currency which isn&#39;t &quot;gasoline&quot; or &quot;food&quot; isn&#39;t actually worth anything but value we all give it on faith</strong>), and global military establishment. Right now the only important thing is whether the people en masse keep going along with it or start doing things that will help themselves rather than hurt themselves, all this shit you&#39;re talking that you seem to think sounds so intelligent and informed doesn&#39;t help anyone and you might as well be reading play-by-plays on ESPN.</p>

<p>All of this needs to happen, it needed to happen to create the global system of civilization that currently exists - unlimited credit from a superpower that would use it &quot;unwisely&quot; - now what needs to happen is it needs to be re-engineered into something that isn&#39;t completely insane, but it won&#39;t be as comfortable for everyone unless we collectively demand local economies be given equity to grow for all, not just for a few at the top of the current system as it is currently engineered(what currency we use as representation of the equity doesn&#39;t matter) - none of the shit you are talking about means anything to anyone - you should focus less on who is doing what and more on what you need to accomplish for yourself and your own community to move into a more successful future, not be afraid of who is doing what.</p>

<p>I know what you&#39;re saying but all of their currencies are racing to the bottom and drawing against one another as well, it&#39;s the same game on another tier, and financial systems are just a way that human beings order energy transfers and micro-communication/interaction on a macro-scale. We NEED TO find something else, some other way to do it, eventually - or we&#39;re going to be fucked.</p>

<p>We are being like children mentally on a large, global scale. We need to come to grips with what we are and where we are as a species and move forward in a mutually beneficial manner that contributes positively to the whole as that will most benefit everyone in the long-term on an individual level. Fighting with each other or buying guns for the apocalypse isn&#39;t going to help anyone, we need to evolve, and that happens on a local level in communities and spreads.</p>

<p>Hi, are you aware of Ben Rich, the director of Lockheed&#39;s advanced research projects division, or &#39;skunkworks&#39;, for almost 20 years saying &quot;the military is at least 50 years ahead of the science and technology the public is aware of&quot;?</p>

<p>Why do you think you&#39;re able to speak with authority on what the capabilities are when everyone with any ACTUAL credentials/knowledge who isn&#39;t still working under conditions of secrecy alludes to the exact opposite of what you&#39;re saying? You think it&#39;s an insane conspiracy theory to suggest that the military keeps it&#39;s actual capabilities in reserve for <em>actual use</em> instead of just announcing their developments to menace people? You know that there are people with actual bonefides who have DoD employment records/project inclusion records at places like area 51 who actually come out and say they encountered alien technology and flying saucers/unmanned space vehicle control systems/etc? That means either they&#39;re so far in advance of us that their own employees think it&#39;s alien, or they are actually dealing with aliens, or hundreds of people with absurdly vet-able credentials are just making it all up to trick everyone.</p>

<p>If you develop something that the public would demand access to, knowledge of, or control over - you&#39;re not going to fucking tell the public, but other great powers are going to be vaguely aware that you&#39;re capable of x/y/z without it being announced.</p>

<p>launches? You think we&#39;re still using 50 year old rocket technology to get places? Electro-gravitic propulsion systems were being researched in the 70s in the <em>public domain</em> at major university labs, until suddenly all the articles and research stopped being published in the major aerospace/defense journals and disappeared - hadn&#39;t even been &quot;disproved&quot; - it just went black.</p>

<p>Guy, you need to start thinking logically about this stuff. What you know is not the limit of what is happening, and what secret projects divisions with trillion dollar budgets do isn&#39;t going to be announced, we have to take all the evidence(like UFOs being sighted everywhere by millions of people including sitting US presidents/people with nuclear launch codes/missile control officers/generals/ministers of defense, etc) and decide what the most accurate answer for it is - in this context the right answer is that the world superpower has developed technology that is far beyond what any of us in the public sector dream of, and they SAY THAT THEMSELVES without giving details - and that&#39;s the cause of all of these things and the answer for all the questions.</p>

<p>Hyperinflation requires the government to print ridiculously huge quantities relative to what&#39;s in circulation. something that the US just isn&#39;t doing.
