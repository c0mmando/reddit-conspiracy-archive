       <p>
        Removing Questions
       </p>
       <p>
        Any posts that do not meet the guidelines detailed in Ask AskScience will be removed. Our top three threads are considered a separate category as they are strongly supported by the AskScience community, and so require moderator consensus to vote for removal. We pay special attention to removing reported links, and messages to the moderator to report problem threads will generally be addressed within the hour. In a perfect world, we would let all users know their post has been removed, but, due to the large volume of posts, we often cannot leave a message for each individual thread.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, we have found that not all questions perform well in the AskScience forum. Areas not well studied, e.g. dreams, or areas where controversy prevails, e.g. nutrition, present problems and may necessitate removal at moderator discretion to prevent poor-quality threads. As always, message the moderators, and we will work to try to get the best answer possible.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think that what you see is normal for a mod-deleted question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you try asking the moderators if their is a way to ask the question you want in a way that is acceptable to them? I wouldn't expect
       <em>
        friendliness
       </em>
       but they may be willing to give you the benefit of the doubt if your question can be rendered genuinely scientific.

       I put a lot of work into writing this in your CMV thread so I want you to see it in case you're not following that thread anymore...
      </p>
      <h1>
      </h1>
      <p>
       First, understand how NIST arrived at the conclusion that free fall occurred at all: they plotted the brightness of a single pixel in a low-resolution video showing one side of the building (described in Section 12.5.3 of NIST's NCSTAR 1-9 report).
      </p>
      <p>
       The overall collapse of the building was still found to be 40% of free-fall speed.  However, I have no reason to doubt that the building did fall at free-fall speed for a short time.  (The NIST report actually says it fell at
       <em>
        greater
       </em>
       than free-fall speed for a brief moment, though it could just be margin of error.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a physicist, but it makes sense to me that as long as the building supports failed in quick succession, it wouldn't matter if it was caused by a bomb or by a sudden weight shift within the structure.   The supports themselves would hardly resist a collapse, and the lower floors would be collapsing on their own as the supports failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I know, that is the scientific explanation. The NIST conclusion was that there was some kind of internal structural collapse that immediately preceded the observable building collapse.  By the time the north wall (measured in the NIST video analysis) was falling, it was being pulled in by the rest of the collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've heard an explanation
       <a href="http://skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-09-07/">
        (here)
       </a>
       that beams in the collapse were clinging to the walls as the tower fell, leveraging them down somewhat.  I take that with a grain of salt, but think about a hammer-- any sort of leverage within the structure would create a downward force that would negate the resistance of the lower floors.  You can have plenty of resistance to a "free fall" as long as there's no
       <em>
        net
       </em>
       resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the physics is complicated and I don't understand it so I like to deal with "the bigger picture." Generally when accusing someone of a crime you have to present a means, motive, and opportunity...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Means:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming the conspirators were with the U.S. government, they would have a lot of technological means, but the largest building to ever be imploded in history was the old Hudsons Department Store in Detroit, at 439 feet-- just about 60% of the height of the 741' WTC 7.    A [
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rcctmcxGwM%5D(video">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rcctmcxGwM](video
       </a>
       of that demolition) plainly demonstrates something else completely absent from WTC 7- numerous, loud explosions as the charges go off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the government really implode a building nearly twice as tall as any that had been done before, using noiseless explosives?  I guess.  But then you might as well say they just used magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Opportunity:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The record-holding Detroit demolition took 12 workers 24 days of non-stop explosive planting.  There was simply no opportunity for anyone to wire WTC 7 to implode-- it would be a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       task.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Motive:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my favorite.  WHY did the government destroy WTC 7?  Three other WTC buildings-- 4, 5, and 6-- were similarly damaged by debris, and they WERE intentionally, and routinely, demolished days later.  Why couldn't WTC 7 have been demolished at the same time?  Why did it have to be secretly demolished during one of the most photographed events in history?  Why risk exposing the entire conspiracy for something as insignificant as WTC 7?

       According to the CIA Whistleblower Susan Lindauer, the plane that went down in Shanksville was actually supposed to hit WTC 7. It was on its way to NYC when it was shot down by a fighter pilot who disobeyed a stand down order. That fighter pilot is currently serving a life sentence in Florida right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that heroic "Let's Roll" inspiration tale? Yea. It's bullshit. Both Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld admitted the plane was shot down. And Fox News reported it was shot down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheney admitting it:

       So yea. Apparently there were supposed to be 3 planes hitting 3 towers that day but the plan got a little messed up. "Office fires" seemed to suffice as an excuse anyway.

       Planes hit WTC 1 and 2 at the 93rd and 77th floors.  WTC 7 was only 47 floors tall, and it was surrounded by taller buildings, some of which were putting out massive amounts of smoke.  How was a pilot supposed to aim and hit it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And again-- what was the motive?  Even if they had meant to fly a plane into it, why couldn't they walk away from the plan once the plane was shot down?  Why was WTC 7 so important?  Nobody knew it existed before 9/11.  Why couldn't they have torn it down at the same time as WTC 4, 5, and 6?
      </p>
      <p>
       The official story might not answer everything, but it makes a lot more sense than this ridiculously elaborate plot I keep hearing about, and it doesn't involve
       <em>
        deus ex machina
       </em>
       fighter pilots disobeying orders because they're so eager to shoot down civilian aircraft.

       First of all, Cheney was clearly referring to Saddam Hussein and 9/11, he just misspoke and said OBL's name instead of Saddam's. Whoever originally removed it from its context to demonstrate a conspiracy was not doing so in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hell, let's say he did mean what he said.  Why would you trust Cheney's word, and the word of the alleged perpetrator, over the findings of 9/11 Commission?  The Commission might not have been perfect, but it was pretty carefully considered and its findings came from an official investigation.

       Sibel Edmonds was hired as a translator after 9/11.  But regardless, I wouldn't dispute that the intelligence community
       <em>
        should have known
       </em>
       the attacks were going to take place, or even that they
       <em>
        did know
       </em>
       and certain people allowed it to happen.  But that's a far cry from alleging they orchestrated the attacks, and an even further cry from any narrative involving disappearing planes, controlled demolitions, and whatnot.

Dick Cheney: "That's correct. "We had one report early on from another intelligence service that suggested that the lead hijacker, Mohamed Atta, had met with Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, Czechoslovakia. And that reporting waxed and waned where the degree of confidence in it, and so forth, has been pretty well knocked down now at this stage, that that meeting ever took place.

       That memo was passed internally at the FBI, not sent to Congress, but I get your point.  There were absolutely clear warning signs that an attack was going to take place.  Like I said, they should have known, but nobody put the pieces together.  The 9/11 Commission argued as much, and that's why all these offices were reorganized into the new Department of Homeland Security.  It also didn't help that the Bush administration was six months young when this information was surfacing, much of the intelligence infrastructure from Clinton had been turned upside down, and the new administration had relatively little interest in foreign policy.

       A lot of the NSA excesses we're talking about today come from powers they were given since 9/11.  I don't doubt they were doing sneaky stuff beforehand, but so what?  Was the Oklahoma City Bombing an inside job?  The 1993 WTC bombing?  Those also happened under the watchful ears of the NSA.

       I think if you want to argue it wasn't a plane, despite the pieces of wreckage at the scene and the testimony of air traffic controllers along the entire eastern seaboard, you have to account for the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       plane and its 64 passengers-- were they secretly landed at a secret hangar and shot, or what?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to argue that, plane or no, the government was responsible, you again need to answer motive:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did the attack on the Pentagon help sell the case for the war/Patriot Act/etc.?  I think the WTC alone could have done it.  People mention 9/11 and think of the Pentagon almost as an afterthought.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If not to underscore the case for war, why would the Pentagon target its own offices and kill its own staffers?  I've heard that "they had something to hide" because the blast destroyed offices connected to various investigations or documents of this or that.  Was there really no simpler way to eliminate some paperwork or some personnel than to fly a plane or rocket into a very specific area of the building?  Knowing that if you were seen by an errant jogger with a Handicam, the entire elaborate 9/11 conspiracy would unravel?  It just seems simpler and more likely to me that a foreign terror network with a history of attacking American targets crashed a plane into the Pentagon to protest the U.S. military.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I like to keep an open mind about conspiracies, but the more alternate explanations I hear for 9/11, the more convoluted the story becomes and the more leaps of logic I have to make.

       From my understanding, the part of the Pentagon that was hit was under construction. So that's a no go for destroying sensitive papers. I'm not looking for an explanation for a missing plane, plus passengers. The missing security camera film throughout the area and the cylindrical hole through multiple walls makes me wonder though.

       That's an excellent point I've never seen here before.

       Thanks. I'm really fond of the first couple maps on this page:

       The the collapsing towers partially collapsed all the other WTC buildings and impacted quite a lot of real estate-- the Twin Towers certainly didn't "fall into their own footprints" nearly as much as some people think.

       My gut feeling is that there's something we don't know about all of this, but that the usual US government + Israel did it conspiracy theory is just a bright shiny conspiracy object meant to distract us from whatever the real secret is.

       There are some conspiracy theories that are more grounded in reality (for example, the idea that perhaps the government knew and
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       it to happen), so it's a shame that so much effort is spent trying to convince people of things that don't stand up to a lot of scientific or logical scrutiny.

       I can see that the government dropped a ball or was co-opted. I just find it hard either the regular US government or the regular Israeli government could have really done 9-11 intentionally without massive leaking taking place. I think the only way you can tell 20 people a secret and keep the secret is if people think keeping the secret is the right thing to do.
