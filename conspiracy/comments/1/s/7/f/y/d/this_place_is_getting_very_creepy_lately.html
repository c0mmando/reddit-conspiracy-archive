    <div class="md"><p>This is a special area of topics, though. The reddit system works great for cats or jokes, but if you are criticizing powerful corporate entities, global elite, the federal government (we&#39;ll just lump them together) - then the reddit system is problematic. It can be manipulated, obviously. One can hire people to sit here all day watching for objectionable material and then eliminate it. </p>

<p>In a nutshell: <strong>anything that is REALLY important to know and watch will be buried</strong>. </p>

<p>If you want to know what you should read? Find the things that have been downvoted or argued into oblivion by persons unknown.</p>

<p>All the fluff and junk they don&#39;t care about is left alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know we should all have the right to engage in conversations anonymously online, but that option might have flown out the window. Unless you&#39;ve taken a lot of precautions to cover your trail you kind of have to assume that you&#39;re only anonymous to other citizens.</p>

<p>I&#39;m less worried about our (already compromised) anonymity than I am about the easy anonymity of possible propaganda agents. In order to get back towards an open untainted dialogue on the internet we might have to sacrifice anonymity completely, facebook style, in exchange for a version of reddit that&#39;s harder to manipulate. Just a thought.</p>

<p>Maybe there could be a Bitcoin style online ID that&#39;s both anonymous and public at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I went back through a couple of pages of your posts to see if there was anything to what you are saying. As far as I can see, a lot of your posts have 1 or 0 votes, not exctly getting &quot;shot down&quot;. The few posts that got downvoted badly were downvoted for not getting a joke and posting something serious in response. Example: someone made a joke that &quot;Weve always been at war with Hungary and Iceland&quot; and you post that that would be awful because we&#39;re already in three wars.</p>

<p>Also, the thread you started about Paul Walker was just hearsay. It was you saying you heard a rumour. Perhaps if you just started that thread as conjecture it would have gone better: &quot;Hey, who wonders if Paul Walker&#39;s manner of death is connected to Michael Hasting&#39;s in any way?&quot; But instead, you offered this rumour that was very detailed but with zero evidence.</p>

<p>Sorry, I wouldn&#39;t have dissected your posts, but you have to consider that sometimes you get downvoted because it is not a strong post. I&#39;ve had popular posts and some that I really got ripped a new asshole over. It happens. It doesn&#39;t mean there is a conspiracy about downvoting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last few weeks I haven&#39;t posted much that was lambasted(new favorite word), but you go back a month you see some credibility, what  credibility would be due to some random on the internet, that is a given. But I post the Paul Walker thing on <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, that is the kind of shit that that subreddit is about, theories that may be complete bunk, but at the same time, who knows, might have some relevance. I like to throw some shit out there and see waht sticks, I even ASKED what there fuckers had heard if anything and all I got was &#39;BLAH BLAH BLAH conspiritard, BLAH BLAH BLAH horse fuck....</p>

<p>I am not one to get my feelings hurt from trolls on reddit, I just feel when I throw a possible theory out to others, not to get that sort of response. I guess I shouldn&#39;t expect much from the internet, that is my own fault, plain and simple...</p>

<p>P.S. If you look back far enough, I had to explain to one person that I do that &#39;....&#39; as a sort of signature, and they took it literally.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very creepy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I immediately thought of <a href="/r/conspiro">/r/conspiro</a> cheerfully collating every submission and every comment made in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because I think <em>that</em> is very creepy.</p>

<p>(ELI5 ends)</p>

<p>If you click the link again you will see the bot has scraped all the comments entered in this thread. It creeped me out enough that I made a dedicated <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> account.</p>

<p>I work with databases and can see how a bot scraping everything in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> could do a lot more than what a determined doxxer or troll could do with the existing reddit UI. It&#39;s kind of like being given &quot;backdoor&quot; access to the reddit servers, except it only records what is in this sub, nothing else. Someone could, for example, generate a list of all submissions by <a href="/u/aqua7">/u/aqua7</a> containing the word &quot;ObamaCare&quot; that got more than 10 upvotes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, he&#39;s a bot that is capable of cross-posting submissions and comments from any subreddit, while providing detailed statistics on the discussions taking place. He&#39;s currently busy building a web of detailed information on the posting habits of users active in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This subreddit provides his public facing data, for meta analysis.</p>

<p>conspirobot is still in alpha stages. He still faceplants every now and again, dying a miserable death. He just needs a few bandages, some incantations, and he&#39;ll be up and running again.</p>

<p>If anybody has any interesting statistics you&#39;d like to see compiled, please share them with <a href="/u/fexfexfex">/u/fexfexfex</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why on earth would anyone want &quot;interesting statistics&quot; from the &quot;web of detailed information on the posting habits of users active in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot; ?</p>

<p>Very creepy indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/directedlight/">It seems I have wasted most of my time posting cited responses and comments to point out fallacious posts.</a> I made this account earlier in the year to promote open minded critical thinking (<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/aristotle100584.html">along the lines of Aristotle</a>) in response to a rising disturbing trend of close minded fallacious dismissals and comments.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rv28k/guidelines_update_moving_redditrelated/">Now we recently had the thought by mods to move posts pointing out reddit censorship to be obscured in a smaller subreddit.</a> Combine that with the trends pointing towards bots being used to downvote specific topics in both posts and comments. Finally, by adding in the seemingly obvious trend of shillery/trolling, it looks as if <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been co-opted.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just leave here the last part of a message I sent to the mods (about a specific user):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This will probably be my last message to the mods as it looks as if disingenuous posts are starting to fill up the comment section of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It is completely disheartening. I think it may be time for me to say goodbye to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and reddit for good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A problem is people painting with too broad a brush. I came here originally because it is a great source for the latest news on what I consider to be &quot;real&quot; conspiracies. I admit, it&#39;s a very subjective list. I devour any link pertaining to Fukushima and then follow any links in that article. I am currently absorbing every factoid I can about nuclear energy policy, General Electric Mk 1 BWR reactor design, effects of caesium and plutonium contamination, and the stranglehold the Yakusa has on the labour market in Japan.
I&#39;m also fascinated by stuff on JFK, and I&#39;m pretty convinced that WT C7 was brought down by a controlled demolition.
But, apparently I am an evil government shill because I don&#39;t believe in chemtrails and I take a bit of time shooting down the can the claims of the chemtrailers. Why do I do that, why don&#39;t I just leave them alone? It started a couple of years ago when a Facebook friend started posting hysterical claims about chemtrails, and whipped up a little circle jerk of paranoia. I was an investigative reporter and decided to investigate the claims. And you know what? I was able to find a simple explanation for every one of them – such as the &#39;secret&#39; photos of chemical tanks on board aircraft, which are actually nothing more than ballast tanks used for flight testing.
So am I a conspiracy theorist, or am I a conspiratard? I suppose that depends on whether I&#39;m agreeing with you or disagreeing.
When I post stuff here about Fukushima I&#39;m the good guy and I get upvotes. When I post about chemtrails I get this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re a disgrace to humanity. You really disgust me. It&#39;s psychos like you that cause so much pain and suffering in this world. You should really look deep inside your own heart and ask if your behavior is the kind of behavior your parents or children or loved ones would be proud of. Whether you&#39;re just really ignorant or being paid by someone to spread lies is irrelevant. You&#39;re the worst kind of person there is.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have been saying stuff like this since I first started lurking almost three years ago, and since I first started posting.</p>

<p>Every month and every year people say the same thing, even back to when <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was ~20,000 subscribers deep (I&#39;m sure there are 20,000 people who remember things from before then, but I simply wasn&#39;t here.)</p>

<p>To be honest, as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has grown, the garbage content has definitely increased, but being constructive I feel has gone up, as it&#39;s a lot less about pure paranormal and the unexplainable being posted very often, and more about actual conspiracy.</p>
