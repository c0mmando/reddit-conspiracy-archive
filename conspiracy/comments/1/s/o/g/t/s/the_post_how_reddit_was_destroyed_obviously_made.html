       I am not defending them or anything, nor do I (or really any of us) know wtf happened, but shitting on our own doorstep seems somewhat counter-productive to me.

       That said, I certainly won't impede other users if they decide to stage this quasi-protest and shall not downvote or meddle with it, merely wish them good luck in getting answers.

       Really I'm just hoping the mods will make a statement beyond "It was put in the spamfilter and we don't know who did it, but we removed it."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's happened in subs before when content was suppressed, I hope it won't negatively affect the sub and I assume this too shall pass.

       the modding of
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is pretty suspect,
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       seems pretty bad on particular topics and particular sources. Some smaller subs not so much. The defaults and front page is just bad nowadays but it has been bad for a while. Not sure how much is change or how many  shitty image macros anyone can take before feeling like they are draining iq points by even looking at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some pretty thinly veiled 'viral' posts (GoPro!) and stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some pretty bad stuff seems to have happened in specific instances (the repeated deletion of guardian snowden articles on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       was particularly blatant and shitty) but I'm not sure how endemic or sanctioned from above it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the disgruntled posters here make some good points, but I don't think that the mods of every single sub are in on anything. Certain powermods wield some hefty editorial power over some big subs though, and when they act on an agenda it really fucks the place up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally, for instance don't see much evidence of mod abuse in this sub, aside from the removal of this post originally. but
       <a href="/u/Sarah_Connor">
        /u/Sarah_Connor
       </a>
       says it's not in the modlog, so who knows?

       Because you seem ignorant about the details here's what went down. Post reached top of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . It disappeared. OP can still access it by hyper link but you can't see it in the top tab anymore. He complains to moderators. No one knows who did it. Sarah_Connor said he revived the thread but it became a one day old thread in the new section and it was impossible to gain any traction due to karma decay. No one will see it if they only visit the default conspiracy subreddit. It'll get buried no matter how many upvotes it gets. Sarah_Conor said it wasn't deleted but it was labeled as spam so there's no moderator log trace of who exactly labeled it spam. IF it was deleted, there would be a trace.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now you're left with the original dead thread that you can still "access" but was robbed of the discussion momentum and attention momentum.

       I really was ignorant about the details, I read the original one and then with all the reposts, etc, I looked for it. And since I found it, I couldn't figure out why people said it was removed. Thanks for not assuming I was being rude, and for explaining. So it's not been deleted, just being actively buried.
