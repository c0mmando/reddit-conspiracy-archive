       Do authors of History Books have strict boundaries on what they can include in their text.  As in: Do you think the government has say/control over what information is put in text books. If you think about it,  It is a way to control the peoples' way of thinking.  If you desired to search for information with your own educational methods would it change your opinion?  Do we only get taught one side of the story?  All those years of maturing, your brain matures as well, with knowledge.  It is a conspiracy I have developed for a long time.  It makes sense if you think about it.  We only are taught one side of the story.  Does anyone else have similar thoughts? Or maybe a special person can elaborate a little more.

       Dogma, propaganda, control by brainwashing children, and other closed minded tactics have existed in every single culture/civilization/religion/government in the history of humanity. This is what makes it so damn hard to convince  people to think outside the box.

       Former public school teacher here: teach what you are told to teach or you will get fired in a heartbeat.  Teachers make a fairly low wage for being college graduates that have to be specially licensed( about 600-700 dollars of licensing tests )in the range of about 25-30k in the state of AR, though anywhere you read will tell you the average is 35k - a fattened number that any teacher here will tell you is more on the high end.  When I taught, I was up at the school at least 50-60 hours a week dealing with one issue or another and stuck in long meetings that were irrelevant.  You take all the risk: every parent wants to blame you for their shithead kid getting in trouble constantly or failing because they turn in tests with answers like "fart" on every line.  You might have 3-4 students out of 200 a year who actually want to learn and pay attention, but it's extremely difficult for them because of the two kids whose parents are on the school board or police officers or politicians that the school will not do anything to.  If any harm comes to any students( a student punches another student or trips on a power cord in the corner of a room )they will do everything in their power to put the blame on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the students who are being molested or abused.  In college they teach that you absolutely must do something about this.  Report it to your higher ups and report it to national and state hotlines.  Does it do any good?  No. A student of mine's father broke his arm and his school owned trumpet, and he frequently showed up with bruises and black eyes.  I had another male student whose police officer father was molesting him and his little brother, and they were doing terrible at school because of it.  Does the school do anything about it?  No.  The state?  No.  And certainly not the police department.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to the curriculum.  Let me start by saying that when I graduated highschool, I knew very little actual history.  I wasn't completely aware of how our government worked or any kind of geography.  I excelled in math and science, but even these fields stifled any kind of structured understanding in school.  I was a straight A student.  It took severe effort in college to open my mind and learn to research everything myself, to begin self disciplined studies of various fields if you will.  Then in college I learned that teachers had a specific set of standards they had to teach to every year, thus standardized testing.  You would spend your entire year trying to cram all of this laughable disinfo( more like a candy coated simpleton version of every field likened to dipping your toe in the cold water and going home )into your students' minds.  How they do on the tests directly correlates to how much funding your school receives and whether or not you keep your job.  Students are doing poorly?  Obviously the best answer is to reduce the funding that school receives and allocate it to a school where students are performing better - that is literally what they do.  Spending all this time droning your cookie cutter curriculum, there's no time to teach any truth or inspiration to your students.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you have common core, which in the name of money and greed will make your children stupider and poorer each generation.  By the time they graduate, they will be fighting over jobs at your local McDonalds and Walmart just to barely get by.  There are numerous reasons I got out of teaching, with one of the largest being that I would not be able to proficiently raise a family on the wages I was making versus the time I was investing.  Another reason was that experience( age )is greatly valued over ability, and as you read above about watching students become husks of themselves because no one will help with their problems at home.  After viewing public school systems objectively, I can promise you I will be homeschooling my child.

       For sure. Perfect example. Ask someone in their 60s, who grew up in the South, what they learned about The Civil War in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       They called it "The War of Northern Aggression." Pretty sure I've heard Colbert use the phrase, even.
      </p>
      <p>
       They teach that we won WW2 and beat Hitler. They don't tell you that we brought over his top scientists working on rockets, mind control, biological weapons, germ warfare, etc, under Operation Paperclip. They don't tell you that those former fucking Nazis then began experimenting on innocent Americans, or that they gave them citizenship and forgave them their war crimes and set them up at American universities. They don't tell you that one of them got us to the moon- Werner Von Braun- and was one of the top ranking NASA officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say Martin Luther King was a great guy and taught us all not to be racist. They don't teach that the FBI sent him letters attempting to blackmail him into committing suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's worse though, is that this is the overt brainwashing. The kind that, if you pay attention a little bit, you pick up on. It's not disputable. There are other, far more insidious, methods of getting into the heads of a populace.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But the FBI's war on King was uglier than name-calling. Weiner writes:
       </p>
       <p>
        [William Sullivan] had a package of the King sex tapes prepared by the FBI's lab technicians, 
wrote an accompanying poison-pen letter, and sent both to King's home. His wife opened the package.
       </p>
       <p>
        "King, look into your heart," the letter read. The American people soon would "know you for what you are—an evil, abnormal beast…There is only one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation."
       </p>
       <p>
        The president [Lyndon Johnson] knew Hoover had taped King's sexual assignations. Hoover was using the information in an attempt to disgrace King at the White House, in Congress, and in his own home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Worse, it seems the FBI was trying to encourage King to kill himself.

       Thank you on the reply.  This has me thinking now.  What if the FBI approached MLK so his cause would end. The system (government) liked how things were running at the time and didn't want any riots or media attention favoring black rights.  However, citizens favored what MLK's philosophies were and respected him.  The government didn't like that.  So what happens. BANG. Same thing with Abe lincoln, Same thing with JFK, possibly his brother too, who knows!
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is crazy, and all we can say is, "What if?  We will never know the truth."  That is why reading and gaining knowledge on your own, is essential.  Gaining knowledge yourself, is the true way of finding the truth.  I never believe what I hear on the news anymore unless I do some research myself.

       Absolutely. Did you know that MLK's family won a civil suit that said his murder was a conspiracy? 
MLK was under heavy government surveillance when he was assassinated. I don't know the particulars of the trial, but they proved their case.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Last year Jowers was declared liable in King's death for having allegedly hired a Memphis police officer as part of a vast conspiracy to assassinate King. In finding that government agencies and unnamed others also were involved, the jury in the wrongful death case essentially accepted the plaintiffs' argument that James Earl Ray was innocent.

      <p>
       The RFK assassination reeks of mind control. Sirhan Sirhan has been made to go into hypnotic trance and climb the bars of his cell like a monkey. A trance like state he remembers going into before the shooting and after meeting with two handlers.

       I grew up in the American public education system. It is not really education, it is indoctrination. You are not allowed to question anything you're told, if you're opinion differs from the standard curriculum, you're seen as rebelious and most teachers punish you with lower grades, sometimes even diagnose you with ADD. I learned that the USA saved the world from the Nazis, when, in reality, the Soviet Union dealt the biggest blow to hitlers regime and almost single handedly crushed them. I learned about the Soviet involvement 5 years after graduating high school with an advanced regents diploma, I was in honors and AP classes all my life and I'd never even heard the full extent of the Soviets involvement mentioned. This is just an example of the miseducation you receive in the public school system, but there are many more examples I just won't get into. Education and school aren't necessarily synonymous.

       One just has to look at the trend towards egocentric feelings rather than facts in education.  Feelings are easily manipulated, facts not so much.  We now have a crippled generation unable to grasp the concept of critical thinking, let alone the practice of it.  These people will always be led by their nose while believing that they are actually making their own decisions.

       "The secret of American schooling is that it doesn’t teach the way children learn and it isn’t supposed to. It took seven years of reading and reflection to finally figure out that mass schooling of the young by force was a creation of the four great coal powers of the nineteenth century. Nearly one hundred years later, on April 11, 1933, Max Mason, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, announced to insiders that a comprehensive national program was underway to allow, in Mason’s words, "the control of human behavior.'"

       what if religion were a lie. I'm not saying it is just a simple What If.  It would be the greatest lie in history.  Religion is a way of control. The biggest way in fact.  Just think about it.  All that money that you donate to the church. Do you know how rich the church actually is? It's insane! No organization or country (The Vatican) Is that wealthy and having a enormous income without effort

       Religion is not the same thing as culture, it is an aspect of it while not being all of it.  It is developed unconsciously/collectively as a tool to pass information from one generation to the next.

      <p>
       A culture that believes burying bodies is a sacred duty would survive a cholera outbreak while a culture that believes a body should stay in the home with the family die out.  The culture that survives recognizes that their way of life is superior and their beliefs proliferate.

I forgot all about it when I made my post about MLK, but it's filled with things like entries from Columbus' diaries where he talks about enslaving all the Native Americans, and calling one of them over to test his knife for sharpness on them by cutting them.

       If you're expected school to cover every angle of every historical event, you're crazy. All school has time for is to prepare the child for the real world. Any alternative views/truths/theories/hypotheses are up to the parents. That's the parents' job when it comes to education: Ensure there are no gaps.

        But the FBI's war on King was uglier than name-calling. Weiner writes:
       </p>
       <p>
        [William Sullivan] had a package of the King sex tapes prepared by the FBI's lab technicians, 
wrote an accompanying poison-pen letter, and sent both to King's home. His wife opened the package.
       </p>
       <p>
        "King, look into your heart," the letter read. The American people soon would "know you for what you are—an evil, abnormal beast…There is only one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation."
       </p>
       <p>
        The president [Lyndon Johnson] knew Hoover had taped King's sexual assignations. Hoover was using the information in an attempt to disgrace King at the White House, in Congress, and in his own home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Worse, it seems the FBI was trying to encourage King to kill himself.
