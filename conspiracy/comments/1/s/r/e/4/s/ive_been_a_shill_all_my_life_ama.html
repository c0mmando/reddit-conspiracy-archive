       I'm a former NSA shill, that has recently seen the light and has turned away from the organization because of its abusive and unconstitutional behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent years spying on people like you, fitting in, and learning your ways. It took years of this before I had finally had seen enough of it to want out of that line of work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as a note, this is not even my account; it's one of my former colleague's son's account. At my former level of clearance, we were not allowed personal profiles and such on the internet.  Just a safety measure so that we and our families were not able to be identified and traced.

       Why use a "former colleague's son's account?" When you could have created a throwaway instantly...it's funny that in your "years of fitting in, and learning your ways" you didn't learn day 1 protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I call bullshit....even before reading your infantile initial responses...If you were with the NSA, I don't think anyone has anything to worry about.

       Especially when the person is saying that he's "been a shill all his life". Yeah right, all your life! As if someone would have that position their whole career and life, especially with the speed at which technology evolves, nobody does the same thing "all his life". And the fact that he's using the word shill and not the term they use. As if an ex-cop would do an AMA and title it: "i've been a pig all my life... ".

       You don't work for the NSA anymore, why not create your own new anonymous account? Why are you putting your former colleague's son in this position by using his account? Better that kid than you?

       He has no reasoning behind using that specific account. For all we know he just still is a shill and this is a test to see what kinds of questions people would ask one. Since he showed absolutely no proof of previously working for the NSA I don't know why anyone should believe him.

       Shilling is not legislative activity. It is the agencies who are making the decision to do this, and most likely without congressional oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can we do when we suspect a shill? Should we just ignore them, downvote and move on? Or is it beneficial to call them out? Or should we engage them?
Did any conversations affect your thought process? Were your posts audited by a boss? Or did you have free reign?

       I obviously still can't describe the specifics of what I did and who made me do them.
However, basically what my job with websites with forums or some type of feedback system like Reddit or Facebook was to watch for potentially dangerous suspects.  And if one was known, even attempt to provoke incriminating responses or comments.

       That's all well and good. We don't care if Shills are actually looking for people that are threatening violence. We care about the shills that try to change the conversation. There are shills that promote the current regime. There are shills acting as government propaganda machines. Am I wrong?

       There are certainly people in the organization like that(not that I'm completely innocent). However, the simple fact that we're basically spying on people to get all of our information (whether the intention is good or bad) is immoral in and of itself.  Also, I can tell you right now that in all the years that I've worked with them, I've never seen us come close to catching any real terrorists.

       It's almost completely arbitrary. If someone is known to be associated with real life or cyber organizations deemed to be of suspicious nature or dangerous, if someone has been caught making threats directed at other individuals or groups, or basically anything that the government might deem "suspicious".

       As I said, it's completely arbitrary.

       The stated goal and the real goal are rarely the same thing. What do you

       was the 'real' goal?

       You simply apply.  Requirements are basically that you must be a U.S. citizen, that you have no criminal history, and have some degree of college education(not required, but helps a lot). I was a government worker before this also.

       I never "aspired to spread disinformation", in fact I always considered myself a libertarian, but was clouded with false notions of patriotism and what it really was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not concerned about being tracked down for this.  I never leaked any real information on the organization itself(nor do I plan on it).
