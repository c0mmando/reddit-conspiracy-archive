The extraordinary claim is that there was a massacre</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No that was just the news report. The extraordinary claim is that it MUST have been faked simply because there was no footage of kids being killed.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have any objections if there was no initial claim, now the burden of proof is on you. Had Lanza been around to defend himself, this is the onus of the officials who make the claim to prosecute with evidence.. fortunately there is no defendant.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well he is dead, it tends to happen in mass shootings. The initial claim is made by you saying &quot;it must be fake because ...&quot; Unless you honestly treat every news report as a claim that must be proven with peer reviewed evidence in order to believe it.</p>

<p>You are the one who made the claim it was fake, so back it up.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The extraordinary claim is that there was a massacre</p>

<p>the claim is evidently extraordinary due to it&#39;s utter impossibility, and lack of supporting evidence.  </p>

<p>you are the one who believes it happened like the TV told you.  I wonder why, was it the credibility of Anderson Cooper (CIA) interviewing a woman on green screen that convinced you?  Maybe it was the photos of guns..   Are you a religious person?</p>

<p>There was the Newtown police officer who ran by him in the school&#39;s parking lot, carrying a boy, limp in his arms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, my argument specifically is that if it is true there exists objectively verifiable evidence that a massacre was committed by Lanza as we were told.

<p>I have no idea why you would assume this exists, and, if it did, why you would have seen it by now. It took years for video of the Columbine shootings to leak. Nobody was saying the shooters didn&#39;t exist before it did though. </p>

<p>point taken.  it is possible that I&#39;m being irrational, but the possibility is overwhelmed by the probability that what I am shown is deceptive.  </p>

<p>For example, the interviews with the kids and parents are very odd, and I get no empathic sense of emotion from their performances, as I do from victims of tragedies that I estimate to  be real.. sure different people react differently, but all these people share the same deceptive quality.  they don&#39;t evoke genuine empathy, their eyes, aren&#39;t glazed, puffy or tearful, and their words seem rehearsed and dishonest in delivery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what about those dudes running through the woods that got picked up by police? Sat in the front seat of the squad car? Say what?? Apparently lanza shot through bulletproof glass in order to gain entry (all on camera) they could have at least shown that right? What gets me, as a former military member, the fact that everyone involved in this incident ended up dead, with zero wounded, is extremely fishy to me. Usually there will be twice as many wounded vs the number dead in any gunfight. Bullets HAVE to hit vital organs or arteries to cause instant death. Otherwise, death could take hours, or not happen at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, true, but they were never interviewed, nor gave a depiction of the events. <a href="http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2013/02/07/who-where-are-the-sandy-hook-wounded/">http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2013/02/07/who-where-are-the-sandy-hook-wounded/</a> I&#39;m not one of those that thinks it never happened.... what I do think happened is, Evil men/agents show up at a political targets son&#39;s house, pump him full of drugs, kill the mother, drag him down to the school, and guided his drug riddled ass into shooting many people or helping to kill some themselves. Then killed lanza. They were caught by the police behind the school wearing camo. Mental drugs were found in lanza&#39;s system. We havent seen any of the footage yet because it would clearly show lanza was being &quot;handled.&quot; (speculation)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can say that there is no evidence to support the claim.... as the article I posted above shows that other shootings have many more wounded, and the media has no quarrels with creating a photo op out of them in the hospital. Even christian bale went to visit one. This shooting had many things very very fishy.... including kids that were part of the kill count yet are standing by obamas side helping to get guns banned. The hospital has no record of taking any wounded in that day.... so where did they go?</p>

<p>the claim is evidently extraordinary due to it&#39;s utter impossibility, and lack of supporting evidence.
you are the one who believes it happened like the TV told you. I wonder why, was it the credibility of Anderson Cooper (CIA) interviewing a woman on green screen that convinced you? Maybe it was the photos of guns.. Are you a religious person?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t someone who wants his view changed or challenged.  He&#39;s also burden shifting so he doesn&#39;t have to provide evidence that it <strong>IS</strong> a conspiracy. </p>
