       There is always talk of the powers that be who planned and implemented the 9/11 attacks. Following logic and science, it does appear that Thermite was used to bring down the buildings. But, who area the individuals that actually placed the Thermite, and were they aware of why they were being told to place them? I assume that said people are now dead.

       The jewish "art" group likely played a large part.  Couple with the multiple confirmations of elevator work on the core columns, prompting unscheduled power downs. The buildings were portrayed to contain far more tenants than were actually there.  There was much acting that day for abaolute drama. And as we've seen so many times, those of the "tribe" will remain absolutely silent.  They had very powerful dual citizens in power that day.  Its clear who was responsible.

       A security company or the people doing maintenance. What about telephone "repairmen"- well just look into whoever was seen doing any kind of work on the building prior to. Also, the B Thing "art installation" may have had something to do with it also. I wonder if the truth of this will out, in maybe 50 long years, just like the FBI admitting that McCarthy was right all this time, but no one came forward (don't mean to change subject at all but since I brought it up here's a story on it

       Yes we will hear the truth eventually, on this Earth or in Heaven, and those living many years from now will hear of it but it will most likely be a long time from now. Reason being is, the ones who it hurts the most are in charge of media companies and have creative ways of silencing the people who could say anything about it. Media is the biggest thing- if you don't read about it, how else would you know unless you are close to someone in high places?

       Foreign Jews were responsible for much of the Russian revolution. It wasn't the Russian people.  It was those in control.  The exact same with Germany.  And the same were seeing now in the US.  Dual-citizens cannot serve from ANY OTHER country for the US.  Yet, they can and do in the US without challenge.  They are unquestionably swrving one master, and that isnt the US people and Constitution.  Who has AWAYS ran the private Federal Reserve institution?  How about the criminal DHS?  Hell, the same naming was used in Nazi Germany nearly 1:1.  It was NEVER needes prior here, yet they claim it is absolutely needed here.  Even while fighting enemies far stronger, technically advanced, and with more members.  We fucked up with the Japanese internment camps without question.
      </p>
      <p>
       History is repeating.  We are being destroyed from the outside in.  The people will one day say no more, and blood will flow.  The SC has proven itself corrupt.  Their rulings have been so perfectly incorrect to anyone that has an ounce of fairness in their soul.  By simply looking to history.  Right and wrong is incredibly easy to discern.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the critical time where we stand up and fight more strongly than we ever have.  In a fashion far stronger than the 70s.  But by using similar means and methods.  We do not give up.  We do not allow them to divide us.  We've seen this is their primary MO.  The same method used to divide America for so long?  Rep/Dem are exactly the same.  They will fall all over themselves to support Israel, yet can solve NO domestic problems.  They all need to be removed.  With laws enacted.  Amendments that cannot be changed.  Based on the critical flaws that exist today.  The core objectives of all agencies clearly spelled out.  What they are charged with as core objectives, and what they can and cannot do.  In black and white, with governing independent bodies incapable of corruption.  Truly learning from our mistakes.

       In the months leading up to 9/11, large sections of the building were closed off due to construction.  Around-the-clock type construction.  You'd have electricians, plumbers, painters, tech-guys running cables, people who do floor work, et al.  The perpetrators most likely infiltrated via legitimate temporary job agencies but under fake names and identities. Once inside, and after some time learning the ropes, it'd be pretty easy for a team crafty enough to slip away on break or something and plant some advanced RF controlled Thermite charges on central support columns.  Assuming they could gain access to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I can understand the towers being pre-rigged (because a plane crash alone wouldn't collapse those towers).  But what I'd like to really understand is, why would they rig building 7 to detonate as well?

        that at the time of 9/11, AIG, the world’s largest insurance company, and subsidiaries Marsh McLennan, ACE and Kroll, were run by the Greenberg family. With Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member Maurice “Hank” Greenberg as the AIG godfather, the Familia’s tentacles curled around the heart of the tragedy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hank’s son Jeffrey, a CFR member as well, was chairman of Marsh &amp; McLennan, situated on floors throughout the North Tower of the World Trade Center as well as the top floors of the South Tower. Marsh also had ties to the CIA. Son Evan Greenberg, a CFR member, was CEO of ACE Limited, situated in Tower 7, which also contained AIG subsidiary Kroll, closely related to the CIA, also with an office in Tower 7.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tower 7 also contained offices of the FBI, Department of Defense, IRS (which contained prodigious amounts of corporate tax fraud corporate, including Enron’s), US Secret Service, Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (with more stock fraud records), and Citibank’s Salomon Smith Barney, the Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management and many other financial institutions.

       Says whom?  Thermite most certainly was.  It is very unlikely the building wasre rigged.  But in the months leading up, planting of the cutter charges were easily rigged as a non powered retro fit.  To believe no security footage still exists is unreasonable.  Basic security protocols for facilities far smaller, and having far fewer high profile tenants is always stored off site as per SOX regulations.  The fact that nothing was released was damning. Add in the refusal to test for explosive residue, and getting the evidence overseas as quickly as possible is very telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is not stupid.  They legalize propaganda, and you know damn well it was used.  The same exact reason why when found unconstitutional, an appeal was instantly filed.  Because they were using provisions that BHO claimed would never be used.  They did this so quickly because it was being used at that time.  The rule of law is a joke.  It no longer exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as others far more intelligent than I, when the masses see the government is no longer constrained by the supreme law, no longer are the people.  This will not end well.  Until the rule of law is returned fully, many bad things will happen on both sides.

       There was quite a stir over that. The group's leader said the floor space was granted to them by building management, but they never elaborate on whether that meant the lease holder or the Port Authority.

       A written account by a thermodynamics expert, something to that degree. I do agree; however, that we
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       trust a government report. What I don't get is why people have a hard time believing that a plane flying at 400+ knots into a building causes it to collapse, many physics experts have agreed that a plane flying at that speed is able to take out a building of that stature. Thanks for not freaking out at me at least like many others do. We are supposed to question theories.

       Niels Harrit is Associate Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen.  He has nothing to gain by attaching his name to this highly controversial paper.

       Conventional explosives were used.  The evidence clearly points to this.  Exotic energy weapons and nuclear tech was not used.  This is to divide those who see the truth.  A group that is growing daily, as more and more Wake up to sew how corrupt our leadership is.  Obama, like all post-coup presidents are owned.  Poppets, just like the final centuries of the HRE.  Having a public face, while the real people in power hide behind while pulling the strings.  And when it goes wrong, the puppet leader is blamed, and we're promised the next will be better.  This was believable until we all saw that regardless of the president, the course of the nation never changes.  This PROVED definitively that the president is not and has not been calling the shots.  And has NO control, short of what "they" give him.

       That is a lazy comment that reeks of antisemitism. What you should have said was "Agents of the Israeli Mossad". This is still Jewish, but specifies the

       The jewish "art" group likely played a large part.  Couple with the multiple confirmations of elevator work on the core columns, prompting unscheduled power downs. The buildings were portrayed to contain far more tenants than were actually there.  There was much acting that day for abaolute drama. And as we've seen so many times, those of the "tribe" will remain absolutely silent.  They had very powerful dual citizens in power that day.  Its clear who was responsible.
