       Oh, it was on Direct TV. A segment hosted by Chris Wallace and he had guests discussing gun control while showing clips of terrified people while asking prepared softball questions to people who support all sorts of substantial changes to gun policy in America. He also cited some statistic that claimed 90% plus Americans supported increased gun control and/or increased background checks. The 90% statistic is likely fraudulent due to statistical tomfoolery by taking a pole from a non-random sample of people who happen to favor say total gun ban.
      </p>

       I'll post a clip to something on YouTube later, if I can find the footage online.

       Didn't see that particular segment but the "90% for this and that" has been thrown around on every MSM channel at some point(s) or another. It's completely bogus for a number of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       We
       <strong>
        already have background checks
       </strong>
       as part of purchasing a firearm. Anyone who has done so and filled out a 4473 Form at a FFL knows this. Gun owners also support this, but it's
       <strong>
        already
       </strong>
       on the books. What we do not want is any additional legislation that is only going to impede law-abiding citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest problem is that gun control is a solution looking for a problem -- a problem the government continues to fuel. Gun violence is down every single year. The previous efforts such as the Clinton AWB of 1994 did nothing and was not renewed in 2004 because it was worthless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun owners are not against the discussion but the problem is most people bring emotion to the table instead of reasoning. We have a shooting that kills 20 people, everyone flips their shit about rifles which kill less than hands and feet each year. Oh but the handguns that kill thousands a year? Nah, don't give a fuck about that! Does that even make sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone blows up a building you don't blame bombs, you blame the bomber. When someone drinks and drives you don't blame the cars, you blame the irresponsible driver. Yet, when someone shoots up a school, movie theater, or military installation... it's the guns. Huh?

       Cool thanks for filling me in on the background.

       I am in no way qualified to talk about this stuff as the UK has such vastly different gun control systems than the US, and clearly that cultural bias fucks up any chance of us understanding one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW, I come from rural UK where people having guns isn't weird at all and I know lots of gun owners, even though I am a total pacifist who has no interest in shooty things, I'm glad my more err 'rugged' mates can shoot and stuff.

       the second amendment is an anachronism. gandhi and MLK proved you can succeed against tyrannical government without violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       what we really need is a right to internet access. as long as we have cell phone cameras, internet, and nonviolent civil disobedience, the 2nd amendment is completely unnecessary (and actually counterproductive by providing pretext for government militarization).

       I would promote peace if this was a perfect world.  Have you seen what happens to peaceful protesters?? They suffer from physical force which leads to mental stress.  Humans have always had the right to protect themselves because it is natural to protect yourself when something is trying to harm you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look the thing about peaceful people is they are controlled and manipulated far easier then someone who actually views their worth as a human being.

       I care for my fellow people of the world and would love to see everyone be free of tyranny however being peaceful in a system that already treats you like a terrorist is crazy in my opinion.

       well that's sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy, now isn't it?

       what makes you think that we pacifists don't value our worth as humans? i love myself, and i also love others enough to know that they aren't pure evil, and don't deserve to have holes poked through them to let their blood out. instead we need to talk, and sit-in, and convince all the middle class police and soldiers that they don't really want to put us all in camps.

       i know you do. so do i. so do billions of other people on this planet. so there is really no need at all to be afraid and arm yourself. just trust that all of us will take care of you. when the 20-something riot cops with new babies at home who can't make ends meet on their crappy salaries see us feeding and caring for each other and welcoming them with open arms, i bet you anything they won't hurt us. they ARE us. we've already won, we just need to realize that and show up in the streets.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Most people think King would be the last person to own a gun. Yet in the mid-1950s, as the civil rights movement heated up, King kept firearms for self-protection. In fact, he even applied for a permit to carry a concealed weapon.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recipient of constant death threats, King had armed supporters take turns guarding his home and family. He had good reason to fear that the Klan in Alabama was targeting him for assassination.
       </p>
       <p>
        William Worthy, a journalist who covered the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, reported that once, during a visit to King's parsonage, he went to sit down on an armchair in the living room and, to his surprise, almost sat on a loaded gun. Glenn Smiley, an adviser to King, described King's home as "an arsenal."

       Even they knew that the right to protect oneself would require the means to do so. And by having armed guards protecting his family each night I would argue that indeed MLK did use guns during his fight for civil rights. You merely didn't hear about them being used because he nor his guards ever shot anyone.

       With OIS you are dealing with a system that depends on being able to communicate in some manner with a violent person intent on harming you. That is a perfect world scenario that doesn't lend itself well to the realities of life. Mental health of some individuals or a state of drug-induced hysteria can sometimes make the best and only method of communication a swift and decisive incapacitating one. The ability of an individual of any size, stature or level of strength to respond with a higher level of force than is possible from any attacker, regardless of mental state or level of mania. A great equalizer if you will.

      <p>
       I agree with the smarter application of force technique as well. Would the world be better off if I could snap my fingers and make every gun disappear? Damn right, and I would do it in a heartbeat. But the genie is out of the bottle. You can't make guns disappear, especially with the new open-source 3D printing designs and manufacturing capabilities that technology has brought forth. They will never go away. Do you know why? Because if you make a law that says you can't have a gun then the only people who won't have guns are those that follow the laws. The ones who do not, (criminals, by definition,) would not turn in their guns. They would continue to do what criminals do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would I like to live in a perfect world where no one has a use for guns? Yes. I myself don't own a gun. (I take that back, I own a reproduction 1864 Army cap and ball revolver, but with no projectiles and no black powder in the house it is merely a mantelpiece conversation starter, art if you will.) But my problem is with rights and the freedom of an individual to make decisions about their own future. I would fight for your right to NOT own a gun. I would never say that a law had to come about that would force you to own one, that would be wrong. In the same respect I would never want a law to be made saying that no one were able to own a gun. I would never want to force one to give up that right, that too would be wrong. I never wish to take away anyone's rights, and I would in fact take up arms to fight against those who would. Like those who wish to take guns away from law abiding citizens... someone like yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's be honest, like George Orwell said in his
       <em>
        Notes on Nationalism
       </em>
       writings, "Those who ‘abjure’ violence can only do so because others are committing violence on their behalf." You and the pacifists like you exist only because others are willing to fight for your right to not do anything to protect yourself. The police officer with the sidearm on his hip, the soldier with the rifle on his shoulder and the citizen standing up to a possible future tyrannical government coming to imprison you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your perfect world doesn't exist and it never will. Until we as a society are able to take on the more pressing issue, like increasing money for research and treatment of the rampant mental health issues this country faces, until then we will still need those who are willing to fight and die so you and yours can sit at home and claim a higher morality or whatever you pacifists claim.

       we do. none of these things happen in a vacuum. that crackhead is a person with a life who lives in misery, forgotten by a selfish society who would rather kill or imprison that person than actually acknowledge their humanity and help them (thereby avoiding the hypothetical knife attack in the first place). it's very convenient to ignore the first couple decades of the criminal's suffering, and only demand a solution to a problem when it fits your ideology. build a better society, and you will benefit by not having to live in fear anymore. and who knows, maybe that crackhead is a neighbor or a relative of yours that you won't have to grieve. it's win-win!

       well i certainly don't want to misrepresent you. so since you said sometimes people need to be incapacitated, let's brainstorm some ways that society can be kept safe without resorting to murder. i'll throw out a few, just to get us going: giant nets, sticky foam, riot shields, sensory overload, kind words

       A well regulated militia consists of armed individuals that are capable of not only defending their country from attack as a group but also of defending themselves and their family as an individual.

       I do admit, they are in fact technology.

       I like your idea of big sticky nets. That sounds pretty cool! When I want to incapacitate someone I want the most effective way possible. If someone threatens my life or the lives of those I love I want the threat to go away as quickly and efficiently as possible. A firearm would do that just fine. But then, that is up to the individual, isn't it? That is their right. Your have your rights, and the rest of society has theirs! Let's allow the individual to make those decisions, not mandate specifics... that's how freedom works!

       Yes we can do anything we set our minds to. And there is a large percentage of society that do not want guns to disappear.

       All great things! I do mostly agree with you there. And all can be accomplished without taking away anyone's rights! If there were no mental health issues, poverty issues or inequality between mankind then gun crime would be an almost distant memory, for sure. But until those problems have a solution the answer is not to remove an ability to defend yourself from imminent demise while taking away rights.

      <p>
       Owning a nuke is not a self-defense option, never has been and never will be. It has never been legal to do so, no one has taken or is trying to take away a right. No problem then. I own no guns, so I don't think I'll be shooting anyone at dawn. So far there are still jurisdictions that value and uphold the constitutional right of the individual to keep and bear arms, so until the last jurisdiction to do so becomes extinct I see no reason to become violent. But using our words to fight those who are trying right now is beneficial, and letting them know where we will draw the line is also a good thing to do so there are no misunderstandings.

Take your chances elsewhere if you prefer, but it would be a shame to lose those like you who are fighting to make a better world here. Even though you have your priorities out of whack it seems... taking the guns away before you solve the problems that lead to increased violence while simultaneously opening up the chance for the innocent to be harmed by those who have the problems... that seems like a cart before the horse approach. Solve societies ills before you start taking away rights. Then I would support every word you say... until you start talking about taking away rights again.

It's also one of the more well known tactics of the anti-gun crowd to pepper their conversations with red herrings.

      <p>
       A couple of quick questions for you,
       <strong>
        doubleherpes
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       When we hear our fine, selfless leaders talking about "gun control" these days, the talk usually seems to center around certain types of firearms:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Which types of firearms are they most anxious to ban, and;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why do you suppose they would be interested in focusing on those
         <em>
          specific
         </em>
         types of weapons?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Thanks.

       depends on which "they" you're talking about i suppose. if you're referring to the post-columbine stuff, i seem to remember something about machine guns. is that what you meant?

       you'd have to ask them, but my first guess would be the danger? same reason nukes are illegal for civilians to own.
      </p>
      <p>
       do you support civilian nuke ownership? how about biological weapons?

      <p>
       Kind of.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you DO realize that no "machine gun" was used at Columbine, nor in any notable civilian homicide in the US since, right? (A "machine gun" being a FULLY AUTOMATIC weapon (one trigger squeeze = multiple shots), whereas the typical "Assault Rifle" is a SEMI-automatic weapon (one trigger squeeze = one single shot).
      </p>
      <p>
       You knew that, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Were you aware that the types of firearms ("Assault Weapons") that the likes of Obama, Holder and Feinsten urgently seek to ban were used in fewer than
       <strong>
        2.5%
       </strong>
       of all homicides committed in 2011?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/z6gy5eP.jpg">
        Have a look at the FBI stats.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       OTOH, FBI stats show that
       <strong>
        handguns
       </strong>
       were the weapon used in
       <strong>
        nearly half
       </strong>
       of all homicides committed in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the goal of these blessed and omniscient politicians is to REDUCE FIREARMS DEATHS (as they claim), why are they focusing on firearms that are rarely used in homicides ("Assault weapons"), rather than those that are used in the vast MAJORITY of homicides (handguns)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I don't want to give you a left-brain headache, so I'll tell you: So-called "Assault weapons" are relatively USELESS in common, daily, run-of-the-mill homicides - an arena in which handguns (which, while being relatively inaccurate) are far easier to conceal for surprise one-on-one attacks) are FAR more practical.
      </p>
      <p>
       So-called "Assault Weapons", OTOH, are MUCH more effective in situations where there is opposition wherein "rebel" actors are opposing  totalitarian regimes. (That is why the US has been supplying "assault weapons" rather than handguns to those opposing the likes of Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feinstein, Obama and friends have little fear of handguns, as they are all but useless in insurrection. "Assault weapons", OTOH, can be quite effective under such circumstances - which is why the would-be totalitarians FEAR them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moral of the story: The anti-gun crusaders are NOT interested in protecting citizens from "gun violence". They are interested in protecting THEIR POWER BASE.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they DEPEND on uninformed dupes like you to help them to sustain their grip on power and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make sense., or will you be needing a remedial course in logic?

       Hollywood Shootout:
       <strong>
        February 28, 1997

        April 20, 1999

      </p>

       Also, bear in mind that the firearms used in the Hollywood shootout were ALREADY ILLEGAL.

       Your momentary lapse of honesty aside, I'm sure that you're a well-intended (if incredibly naive) lad/lass, but I'm afraid that there are some serious flaws in your "logic", the primary one being your failure to realize that the problem that spawns your struggle lies not in inanimate objects (firearms and other weapons) but in HUMAN NATURE.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a good-guy, I'm a good-guy. Most people are decent. Problem is that not ALL people think like you and I. The world is contaminated with reprobate sociopaths who seek to control, dominate and spitefully use people like you and I. These asshats see people like you as "useful idiots" - tools to be exploited to further their pernicious agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stupider of these wind up dead, or in prison. The more clever of these wind up with TITLES like CEO, Congressman, Senator, Prime Minister, or Mr. President - and they have NO intention of EVER relinquishing THEIR power, only gaining MORE power, and they do so by using LYING WEASEL WORDS (you know about those, right?) at first, and then by ruthless brute force - especially effective when those they seek to oppress and subjugate have been DISARMED and can no longer resist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you dream of a world in which such soulless sociopaths do not exist? Where everyone works together for the common good in a spirit of love, compassion, empathy and unity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Me too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is that we BOTH wake up every day to the reality where they DO exist, and they will FUCK YOU OVER to the extent that they can get away with, and the ONLY thing that prevents them from totalitarian abuse is the ability of DECENT people to resist - by force, if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to pop your bubble, but that's the reality we live in, and you're not going to change a disease of the heart, soul and core nature of humanity by outlawing high-tech sticks and stones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps we'll evolve as a species?
      </p>
      <p>
       That would be cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers!

       try to have a sense of history that's longer than 2 years. OWS was just the beginning. you think if you start a civil war it will just be a decisive victory and all be done with? no months or years of massacres?

       you're confusing pacificity and passivity. there's nothing violent about shields or walls or anything else that doesn't hurt people. so build a camp, set up walls, and refuse to leave. burn shit, i don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       of course OWS will vanish when pigs sweep through their camps unresisted. contrast zuccoti park with what tahrir square was like. those people were not. fucking. leaving. and they're winning!

       that argument is not valid. first of all, that happened in 1968. there was no twitter or 24-hour news cycle in 1968. secondly, we've had several world wars in which hundreds of millions were killed or injured.

       Buddy the government can say here is your internet just let us have your guns then turn around and take the internet to guess why cause whats gonna stop them the guns now sitting in their hands? We dont need to go through what the peace protestors of then had to go through to get it fixed and even if we have the internet they can hide so much from view. You forget that guns arent just for protest. They are for hunters and hobbyist who enjoy them. Also people who live on land with bears/anything that can fuck you up need them.

       I do admit, they are in fact technology.

       I like your idea of big sticky nets. That sounds pretty cool! When I want to incapacitate someone I want the most effective way possible. If someone threatens my life or the lives of those I love I want the threat to go away as quickly and efficiently as possible. A firearm would do that just fine.

       Yes we can do anything we set our minds to. And there is a large percentage of society that do not want guns to disappear. Hunters, target shoters and recreational shooters would not want that. So they would negate the whole arguement because they would be inclined to set their minds to keeping them around. The only way you can make an object go away completely is to replace it with something better or more efficient. Better guns are on the way, don't worry!

        again, i'll start to get things going: more access to education, rehabilitative corrections systems, more equitable distribution of resources. all these things would serve to decrease gun crime without needing more guns.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       All great things! I do mostly agree with you there. And all can be accomplished without taking away anyone's rights! If there were no mental health issues, poverty issues or inequality between mankind then gun crime would be an almost distant memory, for sure. But until those problems have a solution the answer is not to remove an ability to defend yourself from imminent demise while taking away rights.

        human history is characterized by doing things one way, then figuring out a better way. the second amendment was great before we understood as a species that we're all stuck on this one finite planet, with no man having greater rights to its resources than anyone else. we've got everything we need to transcend violence as a species.

       Agreed. While at the same time respecting the individual's rights and their ability to choose how they wish to protect themselves.

        okay, well i'm barred by law from owning nuclear weapons. my right to self-defense is being violated! so are you gonna start shooting people now, or wait for dawn? what's the plan, generalissimo?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Owning a nuke is not a self-defense option, never has been and never will be. It has never been legal to do so, no one has taken or is trying to take away a right. No problem then. I own no guns, so I don't think I'll be shooting anyone at dawn. So far there are still jurisdictions that value and uphold the constitutional right of the individual to keep and bear arms, so until the last jurisdiction to do so becomes extinct I see no reason to become violent. But using our words to fight those who are trying right now is beneficial, and letting them know where we will draw the line is also a good thing to do so there are no misunderstandings.

       This makes no sense. You can now in today's society be nonviolent because cell phones and internet exist? Police and warriors are no longer needed? Do tell...

       Or a grasp of reality and learning lessons from history. Mankind has never lived peacefully and in complete harmony with one another ever in our past. Does it mean I don't want a perfect future or think we shouldn't strive for it? Hell no. But I won't hold my breath...

       That's the thing, you don't have to take your chances as long as you live in a country where others are willing to do the dirty work for you! Take your chances elsewhere if you prefer, but it would be a shame to lose those like you who are fighting to make a better world here. Even though you have your priorities out of whack it seems... taking the guns away before you solve the problems that lead to increased violence while simultaneously opening up the chance for the innocent to be harmed by those who have the problems... that seems like a cart before the horse approach. Solve societies ills before you start taking away rights. Then I would support every word you say... until you start talking about taking away rights again.

       It has been nice chatting with you so far. Glad to see a conversation that didn't devolve into mindless name-calling and silliness. Thank you for interacting about this.

       even better! you certainly don't need magic mushrooms, they just make it easy to step outside of your normal perspective. when you realize how silly and illogical the entire universe is, harming each other on this planet becomes unthinkable.
