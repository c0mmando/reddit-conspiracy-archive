<p>Quick summary: 
Turn off WiFi.
Find your IP (in &quot;settings&quot;, under &quot;more&quot; tab, in &quot;Systems manager&quot; collum at the bottom open &quot;about device&quot;, then open &quot;status&quot;. &quot;IP address&quot; will be midway down)
Take that IP and put it in one of these <a href="http://myip.ms/">http://myip.ms/</a> or <a href="http://whois.net/">http://whois.net/</a></p>

<p>When I do this, my info is being routed through the UK &quot;Dinsa, Ministry of Defence&quot;. Awesome. -_-</p>

It&#39;s slightly less bothersome to me though because it seems that the UK Ministry of Defense owns the entire 25.0.0.0 to 25.255.255.255 address block.</p>

<p>That&#39;s 16,777,216 IP addresses for those keeping score.  I assume that Virgin Mobile has leased a great number of those addresses, and is using them for phones in multiple markets - hence Canadian and US phones using those IP&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The routing technology of the day, makes this a useless process. Just because you have an IP owned by X, does not mean X is even providing you service. Besides, the fact is many of you will have the same IP address, as they are handed out from a pool of available addresses, and you are given a port on that IP for your traffic. (PNAT)</p>

<p>That was common practice almost 20 years ago. Now with RBACs and more intelligent stateful packet inspection, there&#39;s no way of knowing <em>exactly</em> where your data is going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, is there a way to know when your device might be connected to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/08/cellphone-data-spying-nsa-police/3902809/">a Stingray Device</a> like the one mentioned in the story?  Apparently police are deploying these devices, tricking phones to connecting to these adhoc networks, and then leeching or commanding the phones to send data directly to the police.</p>

<p>The fact that the OP said it was going to an IP address owned by the Ministry of Defense in the UK, seems it could be possible that a Stingray devices is at work, or no?  Would the device work properly when on these devices, and how could one know the difference between a fake and real network?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Latency would be your best guess. They would have to exchange your phone from the tower you&#39;re currently on, to the stingray device (see Mihamora? and Mitnick) It&#39;s a man in the middle attack that spoofs correct data. They&#39;ll need to make a mistake on the spoofing, to be spotted. </p>

<p>Basically though, if you think about it, the moment you&#39;re on that, you are the only node on that &quot;tower.&quot; Your phone should be hitting its data rate cap with the lowest latency you&#39;ve ever experienced.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we need crypto-phones, like the one made in Germany...oh yeah. I think they killed that guy, or at least suppressed his technology. We would&#39;ve been free from this BS in the early 00s, but TPTB don&#39;t want us to have secure, private communications.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ve done a traceroute now.</p>

<p>As I posted before, I have Virgin Mobile USA for my provider.  My phone&#39;s IP Address is in the range of 25.x.x.x.  Those whois services show that as being in the UK because that IP is owned by The Ministry of Defense.  That doesn&#39;t mean though that the data is ever actually making it to the UK - they&#39;re just showing you who owns the IP.</p>

<p>When I do a traceroot to a US website, the very first hop is to a 66.1.x.x address.  That entire address block is owned by Sprint Nextel.  Those whois tools show 6391 Sprint Parkway, Overland Park, KS, 66251-4300, US as the location, which is the headquarters of Sprint.</p>

<p>It&#39;s extremely unlikely that a data packet would make it between the UK and the US in one hop like that.  I mean you could make the argument that if they were spying on us like this, they could easily set up a private route to do it in one hop.  I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you guys are also on Virgin Mobile.  I really have to assume that I have a &quot;UK&quot; IP address because I&#39;m getting my service from a British Company.  Given that the first hop is to a US IP address, i also have to assume that the data never actually goes to the UK.  It&#39;s extremely unlikely that it goes to KS either, that&#39;s just the main location of the owner of that IP address.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ubuntu admin (and fellow VM customer) here--you are exactly correct. Virgin (based in the UK) owns that (?) class A block and in the US Sprint backhauls ALL of VMs voice and data traffic. </p>

<p>The shitty thing is that Sprint&#39;s computers &quot;prioritize&quot; their service...meaning that if I have a Sprint phone and a VM phone next to each other and run a speedtest they will be VASTLY different nearly 100% of the time. </p>

<p>Just did it right now actually. The Sprint phone (4G LTE) just gave me a download speed of 18.7 meg (faster than usual!!) and the VM phone (4G LTE) a download speed of 4.83 meg. It&#39;s bullshit, but hey...it&#39;s $35/mo. The Sprint phone is $80 plus taxes.</p>

<p>Never heard of Cellco... but that Verizon name is awfully familiar...</p>

<p>Get a terminal app and try &#39;traceroute&#39; and &#39;netstat&#39;. Might not need SU I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll try too.</p>
