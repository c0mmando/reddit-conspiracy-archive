    <div class="md"><p>Monopolies form regardless of whether there is regulation or not.  EnglishMunichFan did a pretty good job of laying that out, so I won&#39;t belabor the point.  In a regulated market, you will be absent the innovation required to defeat an entrenched monopoly.  In a regulated market, you will have government sponsored monopolies, like we have now.</p>

<p>As such, I would prefer a free market.  Monopolies may form from time to time, but a truly free market does not allow the elite to rest on their laurels, lest they no longer remain truly elite.  Someone eventually comes along with a better idea.  In our current system, that guy is probably fucked due to copywrite laws, and ridiculous regulations.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Monopolies form with the aid of regulation though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Monopolies form because of a systematic consolidation of wealth amongst the elite classes. As people die, retire, or just plain get bored, they sell their market share to people who are still invested. Mergers occur so the shareholders can make more money doing the same thing by firing half their labor force. </p>

<p>If regulation does occur allowing corporate interests to grow more powerful it&#39;s because <em>the free market system has allowed corporations to take control of the apparatus that makes the rules.</em></p>

<p>In a system when anything can be bought, don&#39;t get mad when those with money buy the government.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The power is only given to the corporations BY the government&quot; false. If there were no government tomorrow and a free market existed these corporations would still collude with each other, They also have hard assets which equates power. Allot of these corporations belong to subversive shadow groups who undermine our government. How could we curtail the power of these corporations? The only legitimate means in my eyes are to change the government and enact policies to regulate these guys. People with your &quot;free market&quot; optimism won! These are the guys who influenced politics from Regan on and this is the end result. The political system needs to be changed so that more representation is allowed, lobbyists need to be regulated and people who break the rules need to goto jail. How is this gonna happen?
Now I do agree with you that Americans live in a corporate oligarchy but the power and influence come from the corporations! If they only got their power from government, how did they get into power to begin with? So I disagree with allot of what you said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t respond in in detail at the moment but just look at the countries who regulate their banks and industry. Are they worse off then the American? No. Canada weathered the economic crisis because of regulation and strong laws on our banking sector. How about  Norway or Sweden? Now again the power streams from corporations the same things is happening in many countries. It&#39;s the infiltration of states by corporations to enact their lunatic agendas, Government is subverted by these groups. There are also many various forms of Government and ideologies within political parties. Isn&#39;t it then naive to think that they are all the same. Now when you propagate your idea&#39;s on free martket capitalism  your picturing a non existent system. &quot;In a Free-market no one is getting screwed by force&quot; Well that has yet to be proven, it&#39;s a theory with axioms within it that are not logical, in addition we don&#39;t talk about the use of manipulation. Do you think that Americans can act as rational individuals actors in an economic system that is not at all regulated? I don&#39;t, not yet anyways. How would we get to that spot? We would have to use the conventions of our society to legitimately curb power, be it political and corporate. Politicians that give power to the people with the know how and support to give them more power in our political and economic systems. What other alternatives are there revolution?

    <div class="md"><p>But the existence of a state in a free market is a paradox because it is only natural for the two to merge. It only take a few successful individuals with little moral regard to infiltrate the system and there is simply no way to prevent that. As long as we have the ability to &#39;make that merge illegal&#39; we will have the ability to &#39;make that merge legal&#39;.</p>

<p>The problem arises from the ability to make things illegal at all. I agree that a monopoly can form in a truly free market, however the difference between a state enforced monopoly and a free marker monopoly is as soon as a free market monopoly becomes oppressive, the people are free to boycott or rebel as they must without fear of breaking a law. The stateless monopoly cannot use &#39;the law&#39; to justify their motives or instil fear. If the government was just some free market monopoly on social service and defense, then we could actually leverage real change through boycott.</p>

<p>It is difficult to do that because the act of boycotting the state will land you in prison, and on a deeper level, we don&#39;t even <strong>think</strong> about doing it because we are either too blind to see that real ethics and state law are two completely different things or we are simply just afraid.</p>

<p>The existence of an institution that declares and enforces one view of legality prohibits the existence of a free society and market. You have to be allowed to opt out- as long as that is always an option, freedom is unable to be stolen</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen that having a state doesn&#39;t prevent this either. Am I right?</p>

<p>I agree with you that a handful of small elite will end up controlling the market, but there is a way to counteract that. Opt out of that market, start over with your community make your own micro economy, create your own currency or simply find ways to barter, and worst case scenario start growing your own food again. </p>

<p>This is the inevitable flushing of the toilet that I believe we must do every few decades to get rid of the economic parasites. All things in nature have a tendency to flush themselves out upon getting infected or just to simply maintain cleanliness, our bodies do it too. So it would make sense that markets do the same. The powers that be understand this, that is why we have a state- to make it illegal for <em>the people</em> to press the flush button</p>

<p>If <em>all you have</em> is a state, then it&#39;s unpreventable. The point is to have multiple spheres of power that are incapable of overwhelming one another so that if one goes mental, others can protect the populace from them. </p>

<p>In a free market system such an idea is impossible. Power attracts power naturally, and eventually any spheres of power will simply merge and become one giant corporate blob, such as the united states government has become. </p>

<p>The <em>only</em> way to prevent this is to create several spheres of power that are independent of one another, *and also independent of the &#39;free market&#39; (IE money.) </p>

<p>The United states system would actually be fairly strong if it wasn&#39;t for the obvious bribery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they don&#39;t work at Wal-Mart <em>they do not eat.</em> You seem to think that there&#39;s a plethora of jobs out there with employers begging people to work them. Unemployment is high, and rising. People are working the jobs they have to in order to eat and pay rent. If they don&#39;t work at Wal-Mart <em>they starve.</em> </p>

<p>If this isn&#39;t forced then I don&#39;t know what is. This type of wage slavery is built into the capitalist model. It&#39;s inherent in the system and it&#39;s just another form of slavery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a nice anecdotal story about one guy in one place once. How about the other homeless guy who tried the same thing and failed? Where do you think he ends back up if he wants to keep eating? </p>

<p>There&#39;s only so many tasks to be done. Once those places are filled the left over humans are discarded. This notion you have that &quot;they&#39;d be better if they tried harder&quot; is a cartoon fantasy; a dream that gets fulfilled as often as someone winning the lottery. You&#39;re entire mentality is &quot;gotta be in it to win it.&quot; </p>

<p>Not everyone gets to win the lottery. Most people get to lose the lottery. Unlike the lottery, however, when people lose this game they are discarded entirely from their society, forced to fight their way back into having the privilege of being considered a human being. </p>

<p>At least <em>attempt</em> to look at it from the side of the people who have been cast out and abandoned. At least <em>try.</em> </p>

<p>Might seem paradoxical to many, but &quot;the good of the victim&quot; must be properly and accurately determined first and foremost before any real assessment can be placed upon whether the tyranny is good or bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion, when properly utilized isn&#39;t &#39;a fantasy for people who need structure&#39;. It enables moral standards to exist which create better societies. Look at the decline of the UK in the past 30 years as they have lost touch with the church. They are nothing but trailer trash and petty criminals now. </p>

<p>You can talk all the shit you want about religion, but the alternative, which is the &#39;acceptance&#39; of &#39;alternative&#39; lifestyles isn&#39;t good for society in any way. Gays bring nothing but disease and hedonism with them. </p>

<p>Not having moral structure allows people to change their stance on issues of morality at any given moment, and that constant flux always leads to the low road being taken and corruption creeps into a society.</p>

<p>Rome went through exactly the same shit before it finally collapsed. They had &#39;accepted&#39; gays, and were throwing their pets birthday parties and all the other stupid shit you see in modern first world cultures. Eventually that kind of deviance catches up to the society allowing it and things spiral out of control. No moral structure equates to no accountability, and no accountability equates to decline. </p>

<p>Exactly. Homosexuality is nothing more than a genetic flaw that people have turned into a political movement. </p>

<p>I do hold out hope that like many other genetic flaws it will eventually be detectable with simple gene testing and curable in vitro. Humanity will be better off for it. </p>
