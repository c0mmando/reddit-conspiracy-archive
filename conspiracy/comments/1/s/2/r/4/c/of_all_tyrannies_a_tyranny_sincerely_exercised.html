       "...It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals."

       Anything forced isn't free, yet unfortunately a de-regulated market system won't aspire the elites to freely share their wealth, hence the stupidity of "trickle down economics".

       A "Free Market" system will always result in tyranny. 100% of the time. Monopolies form. You

       to respond to them with legal measures.

       The current problem is that the people who make the rules are also the people who are trying to sell you things. The merger of corporate and state has been more devastating then the merger of church and state ever was.

       Monopolies form with the aid of regulation though.  They regulate out the competition.   In a free market system the monopolies would have a harder time maintaining their monopoly status because they would be forced to compete with innovation and new ideas that are forcibly stifled by regulations that are advantageous to their business model.

       Monopolies form regardless of whether there is regulation or not.  EnglishMunichFan did a pretty good job of laying that out, so I won't belabor the point.  In a regulated market, you will be absent the innovation required to defeat an entrenched monopoly.  In a regulated market, you will have government sponsored monopolies, like we have now.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I would prefer a free market.  Monopolies may form from time to time, but a truly free market does not allow the elite to rest on their laurels, lest they no longer remain truly elite.  Someone eventually comes along with a better idea.  In our current system, that guy is probably fucked due to copywrite laws, and ridiculous regulations.

       "Elite" in this context can be defined as a small group weilding disproprotionate influence among and above a much larger one, so I would posit we would have them regardless of the system.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nope. Monopolies form because of a systematic consolidation of wealth amongst the elite classes. As people die, retire, or just plain get bored, they sell their market share to people who are still invested. Mergers occur so the shareholders can make more money doing the same thing by firing half their labor force.
      </p>
      <p>
       If regulation does occur allowing corporate interests to grow more powerful it's because
       <em>
        the free market system has allowed corporations to take control of the apparatus that makes the rules.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a system when anything can be bought, don't get mad when those with money buy the government.

       "The power is only given to the corporations BY the government" false. If there were no government tomorrow and a free market existed these corporations would still collude with each other, They also have hard assets which equates power. Allot of these corporations belong to subversive shadow groups who undermine our government. How could we curtail the power of these corporations? The only legitimate means in my eyes are to change the government and enact policies to regulate these guys. People with your "free market" optimism won! These are the guys who influenced politics from Regan on and this is the end result. The political system needs to be changed so that more representation is allowed, lobbyists need to be regulated and people who break the rules need to goto jail. How is this gonna happen?
Now I do agree with you that Americans live in a corporate oligarchy but the power and influence come from the corporations! If they only got their power from government, how did they get into power to begin with? So I disagree with allot of what you said.

       I can't respond in in detail at the moment but just look at the countries who regulate their banks and industry. Are they worse off then the American? No. Canada weathered the economic crisis because of regulation and strong laws on our banking sector. How about  Norway or Sweden? Now again the power streams from corporations the same things is happening in many countries. It's the infiltration of states by corporations to enact their lunatic agendas, Government is subverted by these groups. There are also many various forms of Government and ideologies within political parties. Isn't it then naive to think that they are all the same. Now when you propagate your idea's on free martket capitalism  your picturing a non existent system. "In a Free-market no one is getting screwed by force" Well that has yet to be proven, it's a theory with axioms within it that are not logical, in addition we don't talk about the use of manipulation. Do you think that Americans can act as rational individuals actors in an economic system that is not at all regulated? I don't, not yet anyways. How would we get to that spot? We would have to use the conventions of our society to legitimately curb power, be it political and corporate. Politicians that give power to the people with the know how and support to give them more power in our political and economic systems. What other alternatives are there revolution? 
I enjoy chatting with you your a smart dude, and i will reply later in more detail to why I think we have a dissidence in our thought.

       But the existence of a state in a free market is a paradox because it is only natural for the two to merge. It only take a few successful individuals with little moral regard to infiltrate the system and there is simply no way to prevent that. As long as we have the ability to 'make that merge illegal' we will have the ability to 'make that merge legal'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem arises from the ability to make things illegal at all. I agree that a monopoly can form in a truly free market, however the difference between a state enforced monopoly and a free marker monopoly is as soon as a free market monopoly becomes oppressive, the people are free to boycott or rebel as they must without fear of breaking a law. The stateless monopoly cannot use 'the law' to justify their motives or instil fear. If the government was just some free market monopoly on social service and defense, then we could actually leverage real change through boycott.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is difficult to do that because the act of boycotting the state will land you in prison, and on a deeper level, we don't even
       <strong>
        think
       </strong>
       about doing it because we are either too blind to see that real ethics and state law are two completely different things or we are simply just afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of an institution that declares and enforces one view of legality prohibits the existence of a free society and market. You have to be allowed to opt out- as long as that is always an option, freedom is unable to be stolen

       Wal-Mart has a law. Starbucks has a law. Just because they aren't recognized by the state doesn't make them any less a law. If you are employed by these organizations they expect you to follow their laws.

       A free market will always result in a handful of small elite controlling the market. That is the inevitable and clear result from this idea.

       We've seen that having a state doesn't prevent this either. Am I right?

       I agree with you that a handful of small elite will end up controlling the market, but there is a way to counteract that. Opt out of that market, start over with your community make your own micro economy, create your own currency or simply find ways to barter, and worst case scenario start growing your own food again.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the inevitable flushing of the toilet that I believe we must do every few decades to get rid of the economic parasites. All things in nature have a tendency to flush themselves out upon getting infected or just to simply maintain cleanliness, our bodies do it too. So it would make sense that markets do the same. The powers that be understand this, that is why we have a state- to make it illegal for
       <em>
        the people
       </em>
       to press the flush button

       If
       <em>
        all you have
       </em>
       is a state, then it's unpreventable. The point is to have multiple spheres of power that are incapable of overwhelming one another so that if one goes mental, others can protect the populace from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a free market system such an idea is impossible. Power attracts power naturally, and eventually any spheres of power will simply merge and become one giant corporate blob, such as the united states government has become.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       way to prevent this is to create several spheres of power that are independent of one another, *and also independent of the 'free market' (IE money.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The United states system would actually be fairly strong if it wasn't for the obvious bribery.

       I don't think you realize that the market and the government were created to be separate. But once businesses got big enough they were able to hijack the state. Your 'separate spheres' was already attempted and it failed. We have already proved that your model doesn't work. You have no argument here.

       You seem to think that there's a plethora of jobs out there with employers begging people to work them. Unemployment is high, and rising. People are working the jobs they have to in order to eat and pay rent. If they don't work at Wal-Mart
       <em>

       Those are options outside of wal-mart. You can mow lawns using other people's mowers, a homeless guy in my town did that and get this, HE EVENTUALLY BOUGHT A HOUSE.

       That's a nice anecdotal story about one guy in one place once. How about the other homeless guy who tried the same thing and failed? Where do you think he ends back up if he wants to keep eating?

      <p>
       There's only so many tasks to be done. Once those places are filled the left over humans are discarded. This notion you have that "they'd be better if they tried harder" is a cartoon fantasy; a dream that gets fulfilled as often as someone winning the lottery. You're entire mentality is "gotta be in it to win it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone gets to win the lottery. Most people get to lose the lottery. Unlike the lottery, however, when people lose this game they are discarded entirely from their society, forced to fight their way back into having the privilege of being considered a human being.

       This is an excellent breakdown.  People who are statists for some reason think that the state will do what
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       want as opposed to just doing what it always does.  There's like this disconnect from reality that they have where they think that because they have good intentions that it somehow transfers to the all powerful government as well, its retarded on so many levels.

Marx never wrote on the composition of the state, you can call his theories Marxist, but not Communistic. The Communistic state was derived off of his works and they used money.Their implementation of the communistic state was based off of Marx but is not Marxism verbatim.

       Hmmm.  Interesting OP quote.  I'm not sure that's entirely correct, however.  I think it might actually depend.  A tyranny sincerely exercised for the
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       of its victims I would say isn't ultimately oppressive AT ALL in the actual final analysis - especially if "the good of the victim" involves final freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might seem paradoxical to many, but "the good of the victim" must be properly and accurately determined first and foremost before any real assessment can be placed upon whether the tyranny is good or bad.

       Religion, when properly utilized isn't 'a fantasy for people who need structure'. It enables moral standards to exist which create better societies. Look at the decline of the UK in the past 30 years as they have lost touch with the church. They are nothing but trailer trash and petty criminals now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can talk all the shit you want about religion, but the alternative, which is the 'acceptance' of 'alternative' lifestyles isn't good for society in any way. Gays bring nothing but disease and hedonism with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not having moral structure allows people to change their stance on issues of morality at any given moment, and that constant flux always leads to the low road being taken and corruption creeps into a society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rome went through exactly the same shit before it finally collapsed. They had 'accepted' gays, and were throwing their pets birthday parties and all the other stupid shit you see in modern first world cultures. Eventually that kind of deviance catches up to the society allowing it and things spiral out of control. No moral structure equates to no accountability, and no accountability equates to decline.

       My morals pertain to keeping the good people and removing the rest. You're in the second category. The world always swings back around. People like you think you're creating some kind of wonderland with your deviance, but all you're doing is sowing destruction.

       Exactly. Homosexuality is nothing more than a genetic flaw that people have turned into a political movement.

       I do hold out hope that like many other genetic flaws it will eventually be detectable with simple gene testing and curable in vitro. Humanity will be better off for it.

       He doesn't like money! COMMIE!!! Well Why would you propagate an economic system that has no recognition of individuals or the planet in its systematization. If we conclude this logic to be true (which it is) then why would we progress a systematization that does not recognize mankind?
You're the guy whose a rat following a pied piper into the river!
