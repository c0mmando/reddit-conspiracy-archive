       I found out about this last night from a member of the club.
The society is still active today.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The "Diggers"
      </p>
      <p>
       Scroll and Key was established in 1841, and a third society, Spade and Grave, was formed about 1865, partially as a protest against Bones' power politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The name of the newest society was suggested by the grave scene in Hamlet, "wherein the digger tosses up the skull and bones with his spade, "and was meant to indicate the hastening day of the eventual overthrow of Skull and Bones.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new society was at first called " Bed and Broom " by outsiders, but soon was known only by the title of "Diggers." "'To give community and sweetness to the eating of sour grapes' was even more notoriously than in the case of the original Keys men, the object for which the Diggers started their society."
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>

       Another thing I noticed, it's odd that their nicknames is "Diggers" which was/is also a radical anarchist peace movement started in te Haight-Ashbury late-60s San Francisco scene:

       The person who I know who is the member is VERY altruistic. This is a major piece of the puzzle about him and really gives me hope that there are people in powerful places working for good, great battles being waged behind the scenes.

       Of course there are. I'd hazard a guess most of such people are utilitarians, though, just like most of the people doing all the horrible shit you despise. If we ever start electing moral absolutists we'll hate that shit even more.

       There's a bunch of "Senior Societies" at Yale. There are comparable groups at Harvard called "Finals Clubs," but they have their differences.

       I don't think they stand in stark contrast to "Bonesmen" and even have their own "Tomb." If anything, the rivalry would be akin to that between two extremely similar organizations, who have so much in common it's puzzling why there's any animosity at all: Crips and Bloods, Outlaws and Hells Angels, etc. These societies only accept 15 members a year, so people who felt snubbed made their own along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Diggers in San Francisco had "Free Stores" and were a vital part of the hippie culture at the time. There's no connection.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Shrouded in a mystique of anonymity, the Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers (1649-50) who had promulgated a vision of society free from private property, and all forms of buying and selling. The San Francisco Diggers evolved out of two Radical traditions that thrived in the SF Bay Area in the mid-1960s: the bohemian/underground art/theater scene, and the New Left/civil rights/peace movement.

       How can you be so sure? Just curious what you're basing your comments on. One thing, I think I may have posted the emblem for Yale's "Wolfs Head" society above instead of Spade&amp;Grave. Anybody have the official S&amp;G seal?

       Spade and Grave disbanded in the 1860s and then reformed. I don't know when or for what purpose. Looking into it more, their members seem to be more altruistic then I would've expected, if the gentleman in link below is any indicator.

       Here's a recent list of inductees. Children's book author, guy who works in finances, missionary, lots of athletes. Personally, I don't think things are very black and white. I believe the CIA does a lot of evil in the world and that they wouldn't get away with it if everyone in Skull and Bones were privvy to their secrets. They wouldn't get away with it if everyone in the CIA knew what was going on. These clubs may have different focuses- future masters of the universe, philanthropists, partying, but IMO that's about as far as it goes.

       Ask your friend in the club if they have an altruistic bend, maybe he could shed more light on it.
