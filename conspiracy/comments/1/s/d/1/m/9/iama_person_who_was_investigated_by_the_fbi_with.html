        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The below is a modified letter that I have written to the ACLU, the Senate Judiciary Committee (which oversees the FBI), my State Senators, my local congressman, all of the individuals in the 60 minutes report titled &quot;Mind Reading&quot;, and recently the Russian Foreign Ministry. My intent in doing this AMAA is to basically tap into the power of reddit&#39;s large community and do some collective brainstorming on avenues I can take to bring a lawsuit against the US Federal Government. The technology that was utilized against me needs to be made public and I am putting in place a 5 year plan to gather evidence to be utilized in the lawsuit. I also am well aware that this AMAA is most likely being monitored and will answer questions as best as I can while still protecting myself. Additionally, an unintended consequence of the tactics that were used against me was that I have become mentally hardened and no longer fear death. </p>

<p>&quot;To whom it may concern,</p>

<p>This letter pertains to some extremely sophisticated technology that was levied against me by, most likely, the FBI during an undercover investigation. This investigation stemmed from the findings of the CIA after the submittal of a resume to the CIA during a university career fair. My intent in writing this letter is to have my experiences recorded in written form and to determine the legality of the involved technology. My experience is described hereafter…</p>

<p>Back in spring of 2011 I submitted a resume to a CIA booth at my university. I am an Eritrean-American and Eritrea is located in an important geopolitical region of the world. Eritrea is located close to the Bab-el-Mandeb which is one of 7 global chokepoints for oil shipping. US interests in the region are to keep the Bab-el-Mandeb open and additionally counter-terrorism is ever prevalent in the region. My point in explaining my background is that the CIA was interested, the agents asked me to write down my foreign language experience on my resume and mentioned that they didn’t have any personnel within Eritrea. This is my first interaction with a federal government agency.</p>

<p>Over the next year I didn’t hear anything further from the CIA. I finished up my B.S. in mechanical engineering in the summer and got hired out in [redacted] as a [redacted] with a large supplier to the aerospace industry. The situation with work was initially ok, but gradually degraded. I believe I was experiencing racism and a hostile work environment. I was sending emails to the human resources at my work saying that I was experiencing difficulties. I do not really want to get into the particulars of what occurred at work, but basically 6 months into my job I was placed onto an administrative leave. The night that I was placed on administrative leave, [~2 years go], I went home and was resting on the first floor of my house when two individuals came to me and were speaking to me through the living room window from outside. This experience involved the revelation of some very sophisticated (and possibly illegal) technology and is described in the next paragraph.</p>

<p>So on [~2 years ago], the two individuals approached me and started off with saying (and I’m paraphrasing), “this one was an Air Force Academy appointee (which I was)”. “The CIA wanted him too, but then they saw what he looks at online and they turned it over to us.” “Us” I’m assuming is the FBI, though they never identified themselves as FBI agents. They then asked me questions to try to get me to recall images of videos that I had seen online. The agents had the ability to remotely view the images that I brought up in my mind on computer screens (I know this because they were reacting to things that I would think about). This is the first technology that was used.</p>

<p>The second technology they used was thought processing technology or “mind reading”. I had seen a video online that if you are ever in a legal issue you are never supposed to speak anything to law enforcement to prevent further incrimination of yourself. Now I hadn’t done anything wrong, but I thought this would still be the best practice to follow, but my thoughts were being processed by the agents. I know this because I would think something and I would get a response from the agents.</p>

<p>The third technology that was utilized against me was lie detection software. They had the ability to remotely tell if I was lying or telling the truth. It is hard for me to recall particulars about this specific technology, but I did do some research online and apparently there are companies that are supplying this technology to the FBI. One being “No Lie Mri” and the other being “Cephos”. When one lies apparently blood flows differently in the brain and these neural changes can be monitored. I have to reiterate though, the technology that was used against me was highly remote, and more advanced than what is currently in the public domain. This technology was possibly satellite based.</p>

<p>The fourth technology that was utilized against me was physiological monitoring software. This technology is along the lines of the aforementioned lie detection software, I’m assuming, in which an fMRI scanner (again I’m assuming) can monitor brain activity in certain regions of the brain. The agents that came to me that night tried to get me to recall videos that I had seen online and were simultaneously monitoring me physiological responses to the images that I recalled.</p>

<p>The fifth technology that was utilized was mind blanking software. This was used only once or possibly twice on me, and involves briefly short circuiting the brain neural networks as I can best explain so that the subject briefly blacks outs. The blackout is on the order of a second or so. </p>

<p>All of the aforementioned technology (with the exception of mind blanking) is described in a 60 minutes report that can be found by simply doing an internet search for “60 minutes Mind Reading Technology”. The difference between what I experienced and what is detailed in the 60 minutes report is that current public technology requires that the subject be physically within the fMRI scanner. What I experienced is highly remote, highly mobile technology that did not require me to be within any sort of equipment. I have also found a 1992 court case, “Akwei vs NSA”, of an NSA whistle blower that describes the above technology. In the court case, Akwei mentions that this technology stems from the CIA’s MKULTRA project (whether or not that is the case is way beyond my level). </p>

<p>Again I want to reiterate my intent of writing this letter is to have my experiences documented with higher authorities and to question the legality of such technology. Publically available research is being done on the above technologies and I bring this question to you…Are the laws currently in place to prevent the abuse and use of such technologies against the American public? I certainly feel as if my rights were violated, and there is more that had happened to me that I don’t want to get into currently. I would like to take legal action, but unfortunately since everything was done to me remotely there is not much proof. All I have is my word (as an Air Force Academy appointee), my technical experience as a mechanical engineer, and publically available research/technology. If you could look into my case, or at least have a conversation about the current/future implications of such invasive technologies it would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>My Proof: 1) <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/mind-reading-50073711/">http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/mind-reading-50073711/</a> 2) 1992 court case evidence regarding presumably NSA Whistleblower John St. Clair Akwei: <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/akwei.pdf">http://www.whale.to/b/akwei.pdf</a> 3) Carnegie Mellon Research publications regarding Neural Research: <a href="http://www.ccbi.cmu.edu/publications.html#neurosemantics">http://www.ccbi.cmu.edu/publications.html#neurosemantics</a></p>

<p>As this technology is highly remote, I do not have any personal evidence yet regarding the investigation.</p>

<p>Edit: I was hesitant to post this in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because I am not a conspiracy theorist, but thought I could get some insight from the community on the suggestion of other redditors. Overall, I&#39;ve been very disappointed with the responses. I will probably cross post this to my fellow engineers in <a href="/r/engineering">/r/engineering</a> to get some insight on the technology utilized as I have a mechanical engineering background and am not versed in bodily emf signals processing. </p>

<p>EDIT2: Since I believe in openness, I will tell you all my plan. My plan is to go to graduate school and get a degree in Biomedical Engineering. I will research the technology they revealed to me and attempt to develop it. If I do succeed in developing this technology I will use it to dismantle the system that they utilized to come after me (I hold grudges for very long periods of time). Additionally, as I am virgin, I will use this technology that I develop to get laid. I plan to go to the Russians to learn defensive (I REPEAT DEFENSIVE NOT OFFENSIVE) tactics and counterintelligence tactics. I am patient, highly intelligent, and will ultimately succeed. Wish me luck. God Speed Fellow Redditors. If you hear of the death of an Eritrean-American on the news, then they have killed me. If I can get to the Russians though they might be able to provide some sort of jamming technology to create an electronic safezone around me (If there are any Russian Officials monitoring this thread PM me please). Anyways, I&#39;m going sleep.</p>

<p>That part. It&#39;s like classic textbook paranoid, delusional persecution complex. The fact that you&#39;ve been evaluated by a doctor not once but twice only reinforces it. The fact that you seem to think the fact that you took a high school psychology course and one college psych class makes you any sort of credible authority on the subject, only moreso.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m late to the party as usual... but I&#39;m just going to toss in my two cents. </p>

<p>I need you to to realize something for me before you start reading: people talking to you through your window, for any government agency, doesn&#39;t exactly seem like normal procedure. Too much risk of being seen by a random passerby or something else going wrong.</p>

<p>Next: You ever seen the movie &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; ? Basically sounds like what you&#39;re going through.</p>

<p>First thing I&#39;m going to say before you stop listening to me: Get a Spect test done or something... there might be something wrong with the blood flow in your brain. I used to get nasty hallucinations (not quite FBI monitoring stuff, more horror movie like stuff) that seemed very real until I got some medication to reduce seizures.</p>

<p>The reason I say to have this done is because a SPECT test will show irregularities in the brain that an MRI won&#39;t... but you should probably get both just in case. SPECT shows blood flow/activity (I think?) and MRI is just shape. Fair warning: SPECT tests are expensive unless you call your insurance to get them pre-approved. And they shoot you up with about 300 MREM of radioactivity (I think, not looking this stuff up just going off memory so might be less). It&#39;s not a dangerous dosage by any means, but I&#39;m just trying to fully inform you.</p>

<p>Next: you sound like a smart cookie, just keep a level head and don&#39;t freak out. The next time you think people are communicating with you through your window grab a video recorder and see if you can get them on film (not for us on the internet, but for YOU. This is about proving whether or not these things exist for YOU, not anyone else).</p>

<p>But seriously, I&#39;ve been to the dark side of the moon and nearly lost touch with reality before. Sometimes I want to go back there just because it was fun and creative and exciting... but I know it&#39;s terrifying. It took me a few years to admit that I may actually have a brain problem and get some help.</p>

<p>Now, assuming you&#39;re not a troll or have brain problems:</p>

<p>1) That technology sounds fucking awesome I want me some of that.
2) There was a redditor a few years ago that did an AMA that said he could give girls orgasms with his mind. I use an alternate account that&#39;s pretty damn old (I guess It&#39;s called a main account) and post stories and comment actively in niche-subs where people with these claimed abilities chill out. They don&#39;t circle jerk and brag, they mostly just express it in fictional stories. If you reach out to them with a PM or you write original content that they like they&#39;ll PM you and you&#39;ll start comparing notes on techinques and stuff. Now, can you get a girl to orgasm with your mind? Well, I mean, &quot;Men Who Stare At Goats&quot; documentary or whatever... same principle but without the intent to kill (I know main purpose was for remote viewing originally but blah blah blah expanded it).</p>

<p>But I&#39;m digressing here. Where I was going with this is: Okay, let&#39;s assume you&#39;re not crazy, again... because I need to assume that twice to suggest what I need to suggest for you.</p>

<p>Because what you&#39;re claiming is that, instead of regular CIA guys, they sent some psychonaut agency guys to go check you out instead. Now, maybe they did. And maybe they&#39;ll do it again. But think about it like this: They&#39;re there to extract information on how you react to certain videos you&#39;ve viewed, right? So quit giving them a chance to extract the info.</p>

<p>Take up meditating. Think of a void or a blue ball or grab a rough wool blanket and focus on the texture of it as you rub yourself with it instead of what they&#39;re saying. Anything to keep your mind away from answering the questions. Be a brick wall. Hell, if picturing a brick wall helps, go for it. Or imagine your mind is a wall of really sharp thorns.</p>

<p>They want to go into your mind and get the info? Fuck em, give em Hell. Though, considering they&#39;ve had a lot more prep time/experience than you... I&#39;d honestly just recommend trying to catch them off-guard in a non-violent manner like on video to prove that they&#39;re real. Like think really hard about laying on the floor while actually getting up and moving to the window... for the record it might be really hard to move while this is occurring (whether it&#39;s a seizure/migraine or they&#39;re doing so psychonaut stuff... one guy focusing on extracting info, other guy focuses on sending physically enforcing mental images/words like &quot;my limbs feel like sand&quot; or stuff).</p>

<p>Finally: If you&#39;re absolutely positive you&#39;re not having brain problems then I&#39;ll share a trick with you; but if you use it you have to promise me that you&#39;ll go get a SPECT test. or an equivilent test (they&#39;re expensive so I mean take a year or two to save up for it)... if these people really are hooking up to your mind somehow, you can do this nasty little trick that&#39;s kinda like feedback... I&#39;m still working out the kinks since I haven&#39;t had a willing test subject in a while. And it&#39;s not exactly easy to walk up to a random passerby and get them to engage in these things unless you make it into a game of sorts... and then you get screwy results because they&#39;re expecting something to happen (though they don&#39;t know what most of the time).</p>

<p>If they&#39;re &quot;linking up&quot; to you to view your thoughts and they establish a connection you should be able to feel a kind of pull/direction/cable that leads to the one that&#39;s connected. If you focus on the connection and try to kind of send either an electrical impulse or a series or impulses of any sort through the connection... by focusing ON the connection itself, you can screw up the person&#39;s accuracy pretty bad.</p>

<p>Other option is overload em with random flashes of images and emotions and shit, but I really don&#39;t recommend that one in case you actually are unstable at the moment. Could cause a seizure/stroke and then I just helped someone kill himself on accident.</p>

<p>[Disclaimer: I&#39;d like to point out that it has not been made clear if this individual is being targeted by a government agency or just random nutcases that learned some mind probing tricks... or he&#39;s just crazy. I am not in any way shape or form assisting in the resistance of the gathering of intelligence or hindering the US government. The information provided is purely hypothetical conjecture.]</p>

<p>There. Just putting that in there in case it turns out you&#39;re not crazy. Good luck and God&#39;s/Devil&#39;s/Gods&#39;/Flying Spaghetti Monster&#39;s speed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watch A Beautiful Mind. That&#39;s all I&#39;m asking. Seriously. Don&#39;t care if it turns out I&#39;m just wasting my time on a troll or not, the decent chance of you not being a troll heavily outweighs the small loss of wasting my time.</p>

<p>Look. I&#39;m not asking you to check into a Psych ward. or anything nutty where you might lose your rights to say &quot;fuck it, I&#39;m out.&quot; It&#39;s a test for a physical problem, not a mental one. If the test comes back positive they put you on some anti-seizure or anti-migraine medication or something to constrict the arteries in your brain depending on what the Neurologist thinks is the problem. Then you get to continue life just barely dumbed down (not going to sugar coat it, the meds do make you less smart.) and with only rare episodic attacks.</p>

<p>Okay, so... one last try here. You&#39;re a fucking scientist. An engineer, god damn it. scientific method or something. Can you observe it? Can it be repeated? Set up a couple cameras in your house in the areas where this occurs (outside the house aiming towards where you think they&#39;re at or inside the house aimed near where you&#39;re usually at). If outside, it will capture evidence of agents or lack thereof. Cameras inside aimed at you: look for involuntary twitching/muscle spasms and/or eyes rolling... basically anything totally weird; cameras aimed at you wouldn&#39;t rule out agents causing it, but it would assist in seeing the physical effects if nothing else.</p>

<p>Confirmation bias... you gotz a bad case of it and I&#39;m not sure how to tell you of this sir. I know you&#39;re in your own little world and everything seems very real, but if you do reality checks you can survive pretty well. Bear with me (hehe bear) because I&#39;m going to go through and dissect as much as I can in order to prove to you the world you&#39;ve created has no spoon (metaphorically speaking)... meaning there are flaws in which the story doesn&#39;t hold water. Maybe it&#39;s just from a lack of detail or a mistelling of a detail, so feel free to correct me:</p>

<p>&quot;They approached me through a living room window with blinds closed so I never saw them or their technology. When they coerced me into going to a psych ward (they do this to destroy a subjects credibility), I was surrounded by undercover agents there, I was on the phone with my brother and mentioned that this technology was possibly satellite based and looked behind me really quickly and thought I heard one of the undercover agents start to say &quot;how does he know that&quot;. The images they were trying to get me to recall were images of questionable legality that I have accidently stumbled onto (again I want to reiterate this UNINTENTIONALLY stumbled onto) that they were mostly likely also recording. The two individuals had a very lighthearted, friendly, slightly arrogant attitude initially, but as the investigation drew on this attitude became much more aggressive.&quot;</p>

<p>Okay. Let&#39;s start with this one. Not going to say &quot;no evidence of people beyond window shades&quot; because that&#39;s just rude and you&#39;ve linked technology that does kinda exist in theory... though I didn&#39;t really think it was capable of reading anyone&#39;s minds, just kind of a highly-focused audio wave so you can aim it very well (referring to the God&#39;s voice/hand thing). Anyways... back to the points. Who coerced you to go to a psych ward? Government officials coerced you to go to psych ward? unless they held you at gunpoint or threw you in an unmarked car and drove you there, then it was probably concerned family... or something along those lines? Possibly work related (are they allowed to request those things?)?</p>

<p>Surrounded by undercover agents. Alright, I want to know why you get so many super-awesome secret agents stalking you. It seems like being surrounded by undercover agents would kind of blow the whole &quot;undercover&quot; part, doesn&#39;t it? &quot;I was surrounded by secret agents&quot;. I&#39;d be willing to believe that, and that might be what you meant. But then again, you might have just been seeing people doing things that looked vaguely spy-like and your brain was trying to associate their actions with actions you think secret agents would do.</p>

<p>Now, if you&#39;re going to insist you were surrounded by undercover agents still... well, you can investigate the doctors/workers/nurses that were there as well. See if their records match up to the faces you remember. If you don&#39;t remember their faces or something... but you can still verify that they are real people, you can always just find out if they were working that day (now sure, they could be told to lie about the shrink/whatever-they&#39;re-called having attended during that event... but then they would need the whole psychiatric ward in on this little secret, and that&#39;s just too sloppy for a secret agency).</p>

<p>Next: Phone call with brother, the undercover agent comment, and recalling images. Okay so you call your brother and are describing technology and a possible undercover agent says &quot;how does he know that&quot;... let&#39;s assume that wasn&#39;t an auditory hallucination. What makes that person a undercover agent and not a patient that just responded that way? And the recalling images thing. Seriously. Enough. I get that people worry about this shit and that people can psychoanalyze, but they can&#39;t psychoanalyze that well; there will always be a margin of error. And they don&#39;t care if you clicked on some jailbait images or anything of that nature (this is still in the hypothetical of &quot;what if they can read your thoughts&quot; because I&#39;m trying to show you why you&#39;ve created a false reality, not question the ability of something you believe to exist... and may very well exist for all we know); think about it. The CIA has some of the most crooked operations in history (cocaine comes to mind)... I don&#39;t think they care about such a petty thing. Especially if you would have such a great asset as being the only potential agent to be deployed in a country. They&#39;d excuse past murder for something like that (I&#39;m exaggerating... I hope I am, anyways).</p>

<p>Next: &quot;I am not psychotic, I have a very sound mind and have two had two doctors evaluate me and believe I am not schizo.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually not going to discredit anything in there. seems totally valid... though by doctors and evaluate being in same sentence I worry this means they were looking mental illness and not physical ones. Physical brain damage is usually different than being schizo... usually.</p>

<p>Next: &quot;Sure, they use the threat of physical harm/killing you try to get you to break down. I was handcuffed by police and taken to an emergency room where I thought I was going to be killed remotely (see Akwei vs NSA for his statement that there is possibly satellite based technology to remotely kill people), I made the sign of the cross and basically was prepared to die, but in hindsight this was just a bluff. They can&#39;t legally kill me because I&#39;m not a terrorist, I&#39;m 100% nonviolent, and I&#39;ve sent letters to everyone I could think of to protect myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Okay... so I&#39;m going to assume this a different time than the psych ward. If so then this sounds more like post-reality break thing than a description of an occurring reality break... you just honestly thought you were going to die, nothing crazy about that, just the way you thought you were going to be killed was and the reasoning behind it... which I&#39;d be more interested in but since you didn&#39;t disclose it that probably means you don&#39;t want to... and I&#39;m not being very nice poking small holes in your reality instead of comforting you... but this worked for me, so hopefully that works for you (but I had to do it for myself and it sucked because I had to get cameras and friends to help me out and oh my god all the work I had to do).</p>

<p>Finally: If you have a good recollection of time: can you remember if the timing of the whole &quot;they&#39;re scanning my mind&quot; occurred before or after you read/watched any articles about it. Any articles at all. Don&#39;t have to answer me on this one, you just have to think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not saying crazy, just that your brain might be wired differently/oddly. </p>

<p>Quite frankly I think the only people deserving of being called crazy are the people that don&#39;t question what&#39;s real (or don&#39;t utilize critical thinking skills once in a while. They can still be totally &quot;crazy&quot; in the conventional sense... but you kinda need to be in this world, right?)... but anyways, I believe you that you believe this is real... for me to say anything beyond that would be to put faith in something rather than making an educated guess. </p>

<p>Look on the bright side: they haven&#39;t killed ya :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, oh yeah, the plan. Ok, here we go. Let&#39;s assume OP was telling the truth and everything was true. First off, government brain magic has made OP indifferent to his own death. That&#39;s a key point. OP knows an incredible amount about the governments dastardly deads and they monitor him 24/7. Now he is suddenly rejecting the mental maelstrom and about to pull a Snowden. Obviously, the MIB&#39;s have no choice but to kill him. Luckily, OP doesn&#39;t mind. This gives us the perfect oppurtunity. The trick is OP needs to make it to where we can identify him once we see him on the news after he commits his ELF terrorist attack and gets Dornered. I was thinking a picture of his house from the street with the numbers blocked out. No way to identify that beforehand for us, but if we see it on the news afterwards we can. Or something along those lines. So true, we couldn&#39;t save OP&#39;s life this way but death means nothing to him anyway? All he cares about is getting the truth out. If it all was true this may have worked. Alas, his story was bullshit and my brilliant plan is wasted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly dude, first make sure you aren&#39;t psychotic. I say this as a person who has endured psychotic episodes in the past, and it is a scary and dangerous place. I certainly am not discrediting your experience but I firstly want you to know, that psychosis generally involves a sense of fear from authority figures.</p>

<p>That said, I personally do not believe it is possible to augment or instill or extrapolate something as abstract as thoughts or intentions from neural scanning and analysis, these things are orders of magnitude more complex than anything a snapshot of anyone&#39;s mind can be deduced from.</p>

<p>That said, be safe and be well, friend. I wish you well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lasta87,</p>

<p>This is interesting and troubling all at once. May I gently suggest you find an independent clinic that can do some screening for you. There are some in-depth tests that you could then have in your personal file. You could also go in for an over-night sleep study where they map what is happening. You could be tested for something as simple as food allergies. A stress test as well.</p>

<p>You need to gather some tangible, medical proof for yourself, in order to move this forward!</p>

<p>Please update us here as you like. Take good care!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I rape someone with a baseball bat and lubricant versus a baseball bat without lubricant does it still make the definition if rape? His post shows exactly what&#39;s wrong with this subreddit. You allow statements to be made without proof, which there was none given. Beng nice to someone who blatantly is trying to fuck with you is not a way to live your life. You can cry &quot;mental problems, seek help&quot; all you want, but if you put together everything he has put in his post, claiming his proof is documentaries and whale.to links, no evidence of a degree, his posting it in r/engineering and on another conspiracy website, you&#39;ll see that he is just trolling. Trolling should not be accepted. He should be beaten, as should all those who set out to deceive. This isn&#39;t a case of mental issues, this is a case of someone making a mockery of your and my beliefs in conspiracy and its role in daily issues. He was given opportunities to show his proof but alas, nothing at all. I would rather him make 10 shitty comments and be shit on than to have him accept questions from those who are gullible and have home submit 15 unfounded semi-taken-seriously answers. &quot;I have a mechanical engineering degree,&quot; and &quot;I worked in the navy&quot; are outright lies, and you should never accept lies with a grain of salt, its a mockery of your intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You handled your reaction to and comments towards the OP as you saw fit. You read and responded to OP as you were so inclined. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to judge OP. Personally, I directed my comment to OP.</p>

<p>You poked your nose in by using OP&#39;s words as if to cement your position and then come at me with a damned raping baseball bat! WTF?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve not impressed me as being exceptionally intelligent, self tempered, nor empathetic. I suggest you chill out and gently suggest you consider some Anger and Control issues that <em>you might be experiencing and exhibiting</em>.</p>

<p>Some here engaged OP, some prodded OP without being abject heels, a couple of us felt inclined to encourage OP towards mental health issues. You chose to do it your way and many politely objected and then went right back at you because you chose not to stop yelling.</p>

<p>eswiggle, you have your right to form and voice your opinion but I&#39;ve experienced some pretty incredible, insightful and thoughtful people in r/conspiracy. If you have trolling issues, send it to the mods. If you have power issues of controlling r/conspiracy send it to the mods.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t always get it right and I&#39;m quick to admit when I&#39;m wrong but you insulted yourself over and over in this thread! You have the temerity to point a scathing stinky finger at myself, as well as others;  take a good hard look in your own mirror next chance.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be a jerk and stop screaming when asked to stop screaming. You are not in control of anyone, nor anything but yourself. Start with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, he doesn&#39;t seem to be a conspiritard troll, as he posted this in IAMA earlier. Which means either he&#39;s lying(I guess that would still make him a troll), he&#39;s crazy, or he&#39;s telling the truth. </p>

<p>OP, you mentioned in IAMA that you could provide some proof, such as your academy stuff or some other things. Can you provide any of that for us? I understand there will not be proof of the technology and such, we can work around that I think. Also, you mentioned not fearing death. Can you explain that a little bit please?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, some people have brains and understand that death is a part of life. If you haven&#39;t accepted that, you need to start thinking more. Why be afraid? No one knows what happens when you die, so how can you be afraid of the action of death? People aren&#39;t afraid of the dark because its dark, it&#39;s that they can make up scenarios based on what they&#39;ve seen or heard throughout their lives. Death is nothing to be afraid of, because you know nothing about it, aside from it coming to a person near you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, fuck off. You started your nutbag rant before OP even had a chance to post one fucking comment. Get over yourself, you talk about how stupid everyone else is and you can&#39;t even make one comment without errors all in it. You seem like more of a troll than OP does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no need for disinformation. I believe the links you posted are real, because I can go to the websites, I can watch the 60 minutes. But you still haven&#39;t answered anything specifically. No evidence, you can literally say you are anyone. Fmri? Who cares if you will take one, you still won&#39;t do it. Just quit while you&#39;re ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely not, remember the Syrian fool who came onto reddit and did his AMA while showing his passport with no information AT ALL? That is this, except this is going to be shittier. &quot;Ask me almost anything&quot; as if he has some magical information that he can&#39;t let out since talking to these people, except you know, telling us about his experience and not giving any example. His proof is a 60 mins documentary and whale.to. These are not proofs of anything happening to him. This amaa is relative to going on pornhub and trying to contact all those female accounts that comment on how they love dick, and want one in them NOW. Farces. </p>
