<p><strong>December 16th, 2013</strong></p>

<p>Now for the sake of discussion, I just want to list the oddities with this date, on this year.</p>

<p><strong>Number one</strong></p>

<p>It all started 4 years ago, <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message948708/pg1">with a little thread on GLP</a>. The mayan calendar does not end on 2012, it ends on 2013. </p>

<p>The math behind this is <strong>sound</strong>. It&#39;s not speculation. The full completion of 13 ahau does NOT HAPPEN until there is another spin of the internal tzolkein, 360 days after the beginning of the baktun. This is the real &#39;end&#39; of the mayan long count. Just like the newyear actually did not being 1/1/00, it actually started 1/1/01. We don&#39;t have a year zero. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2091882/pg1">Mayan Calendar explanation and ISON correlation. This is very convincing, at least about the true ending of the long count</a></strong></p>

<p>Weird. Very strange. Especially because in retrospect, looking at the math and the dates, it&#39;s very obvious. 12/21/12 was hyped extremely, and it dud&#39;d.</p>

<p><strong>Number two</strong></p>

<p>ISON the &#39;comet of the century&#39; in which NASA (purposefully?) displayed this <a href="http://blog.world-mysteries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ison_3b.jpg">comet as a winged V</a> in early hubble images.  It&#39;s never happened with any other comets, so even if it&#39;s &#39;parallax&#39; it was intentionally used and shown that way. </p>

<p><a href="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/aH4Z26ABhbY/maxresdefault.jpg">ISON is going to form a perfect &#39;capstone&#39; for an Earth - Venus ^ ISON alignment</a>, on 12/16/13. Signs in the heavens. Oh, and it regained it&#39;s winged V shape after perihelion.</p>

<p><strong>Number three.</strong></p>

<p>Nelson Mandela- there are many claims that he had died earlier in the year. <a href="http://guardianlv.com/2013/12/nelson-mandela-family-finally-gives-up-charade-and-admits-mandela-dead/"><strong>Proven today</strong></a>. There is a ceremony in which 91 world leaders will be in South Africa for a 10 day funeral service. </p>

<p>Part of it will take place at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voortrekker_Monument#Architectural_purpose">Voortrekker Monument</a> in which the architecture shines a sun beam directly onto a gemstone containing 32 sun rays, making it 33- on <strong>12/16</strong>. It was inspired by Egyptian architecture. <strong>Mandela&#39;s grave will be draped with a leopard skin, remember this</strong></p>

<p>The moon will be in it&#39;s gate on 12/16, and the sun will also be in it&#39;s gate on 12/16.</p>

<p><strong>Number four, the double whammy</strong></p>

<p>Remember Denver International Airport and the New World Airport commission? Remember this mural? <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/sm/custom/q/d/c00b7fb1df.jpg">The one with a leopard coffin, quetzecoatl depicted as the Pheonix rising, and a meteor/comet impact?</a></p>

<p>This mural is literally a <a href="http://diaconspiracyfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/denver-8.jpg">freemason mural</a> depicting the return of quetzecoatl, and meteor/comet strike. The pheonix is stripped of it&#39;s mysticism and displayed in a scientific way- just like ISON is being depicted in the MSM. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, we have a true end date of 12/16/13 via the Mayan calendar. We have the sun in it&#39;s golden gate, and the moon in it&#39;s silver gate. We have ISON winged comet of the century (which resurrected after perihelion, <em>pheonix</em> style) completing a pyramid in the heavens as ISON as the capstone. We have Nelson Mandela&#39;s 10 day funeral session ending on 12/16, at an Egyptian inspired sun monument- in which he will be draped with a Leopard skin on his coffin (see mural). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can we speak of chance?

<p>They&#39;ve predicted all movement of the planets 10,000 years ahead of their time. That&#39;s how. (See: Their calendar)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, the Mayan empire stretched way into the Yucatan peninsula and therefore there are Mayans living in parts of Mexico, Honduras, and Belize as well. But the highest concentration of people who are descended from, practice the religion of, speak the languages of, and identify as, the Mayans, live in Guatemala. Forty to 50 percent of Guatemalans are of Mayan descent. And four out of thirteen million of its citizens do not speak Spanish, but rather speak only an indigenous Mayan language. </p>

<p>I JUST LAUGHED OUT LOUD AT THAT ONE</p>

<p>From the NASA article: </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some remnant of ISON did indeed make it around the sun, <strong>but it quickly dimmed and fizzled</strong> as seen with NASA&#39;s solar observatories. This does not mean scientists were disappointed, however. A worldwide collaboration ensured that observatories around the globe and in space, as well as keen amateur astronomers, gathered one of the largest sets of comet observations of all time, which will provide fodder for study for years to come.</p>

<p>On Dec. 10, 2013, researchers presented science results from the <strong>comet&#39;s last days</strong> at the 2013 Fall American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, Calif. They described how this unique comet lost mass in advance of reaching perihelion and most likely broke up during its closest approach, as well, as summarized what this means for determining what the comet was made of.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>it continues...</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When Comet ISON was first spotted in September 2012, it was relatively bright for a comet at such a great distance from the sun. Consequently, <strong>many people had high hopes it would provide a beautiful light show visible in the night sky throughout December 2013</strong>. <strong>That potential ended when Comet ISON disrupted during perihelion</strong>. However, the legacy of the comet will go on for years as scientists analyze the tremendous data set collected during ISON&#39;s journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, but i think its naive to assume the wolf doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Think about it - if you were a wolf attacking a village, and you wanted to catch everyone by surprise to ensure maximum damage and panic. What would be the best way to do that?</p>

<p>The wolf is smart, it knows that it can&#39;t cloak its self completely. It will be spotted when it makes any attempt to get within the village. It knows that it can&#39;t hide all of its tracks. So the wolf taunts the boy who&#39;s on guard. The boy cries wolf every time he sees it come near, and people react accordingly. Eventually he will start faking his approach with more frequency, causing the village to grow tiresome of the boy&#39;s constant warnings. Until one day when everyone is preoccupied and no longer trusts the boy. That is when the wolf will strike. </p>

<p>While there have been quite a few predictions in the last few decades they do seem to be occurring with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events">a lot more frequency</a>. </p>

<p>The last big one was last year and i doubt there was a person on earth who had not heard of it. What better time to through everyone for a loop than almost exactly one year later. When everyone will completely distrust it.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to become dooms day preppers every single time there is a prediction but it doesn&#39;t hurt at all to take a little extra precaution. Using the boy who cried wolf analogy again, it would be foolish to leave your goats un attended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I completely agree that we should always be prepared for any eventuality, because we never know when disaster will strike. But what you are saying is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Because of four different unrelated conditions, one of which doesn&#39;t even have anything to do with the date 12/16 and another which just sounds absolutely ridiculous, something is supposed to happen but you don&#39;t even know what that something is.</li>
</ol>

<p>And 2. You are using that analogy as if whatever that something you failed to actually give any detail or even hazard a wild guess at is somehow sentient. Lets just assume that event is a massive solar flare (I like the assassins creed series). What you are saying is that the sun has been conciously making us get worked up over solar flares and has made an active decision to influence us in such a way that we are off our guard and don&#39;t believe when a warning about the actual killer flare (for lack of a better title) comes through. Your analogy is a worse failure than your very loose assertions in the OP. And how is this a conspiracy? The world ending affects everyone and is something nobody, not even the masons or illuminati or rockefellers or whoever, can prevent or control. Thats not a conspiracy, its just shitty luck for everyone.</p>

<p>Think about it - if you were a wolf attacking a village</p>

<p>If I were a wolf I&#39;d skulk around the edges of the village under cover of darkness feeding on carrion and refuse. Requires a hell of a lot less energy than attacking a village, and provides just as much by way of sustenance. I&#39;d only do that, though, if food was really scarce elsewhere or I was cut off from my pack and its territory. Cause that shit&#39;s dangerous, and I come from a long line of wolves who were smart enough to not do it and therefore—having not gotten their asses shot off—passed down their genes to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wolf is smart, it knows that it can&#39;t cloak its self completely. It will be spotted when it makes any attempt to get within the village. It knows that it can&#39;t hide all of its tracks. So the wolf taunts the boy who&#39;s on guard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait. The village puts a boy on guard duty? By himself? At night? How is anybody okay with such blatant exploitation? Do child labor laws not apply here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The boy cries wolf every time he sees it come near, and people react accordingly. Eventually he will start faking his approach with more frequency, causing the village to grow tiresome of the boy&#39;s constant warnings. Until one day when everyone is preoccupied and no longer trusts the boy. That is when the wolf will strike.</p>

They&#39;re animals; they have no idea how human societies are structured (even ones that&#39;re stupid enough to leave a young boy standing guard on a school night). It&#39;s not as if they sit down in the snow and draw up a five-year plan.</p>

<p>Are you sure you&#39;re talking about wolves? Have you ever seen one? Maybe you meant to type something else and your spell-checker did something weird, I dunno, but this doesn&#39;t make a lick of sense.</p>

<p>Comet ISON is a very faint object when viewed from Earth right now. To get a photo that is bright enough, Hubble has to take multiple exposures.

<p>Then what does count as complete information for you, or will you just keep saying the information is incomplete unless someone agrees with you?</p>

<p>All the information about the image being a triple exposure is known. The three originals have been provided. There really isn&#39;t anything more than can be said about it.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a lack of consensus of whether it&#39;s destroyed. The low brightness after it re-emerged from it&#39;s encounter with the sun shows that it was destroyed. </p>

<p>What there is a lack of consensus on is whether the largest fragment will still be large enough to cause a &#39;great comet&#39; to appear in the sky.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like the mods even enforce any rules here anyway, they break em themselves often enough.</p>

<p>Regardless, there is a reason that &quot;Comet ison isn&#39;t 3 objects arranged in a v shape&quot; isn&#39;t published in a peer reviewed journal. It&#39;s a waste of everyone&#39;s time (and probably even mine) to have to peer review an article saying what everyone already knows: It&#39;s a triple exposure.</p>

<p>In the time it takes to debunk one mad claim, someone can make a thousand more. There is a reason that peer reviewed journals are not full of &quot;Again we have to remind crazy person X that object Y is in fact, just a star, not a UFO&quot;, and that&#39;s because it&#39;s a waste of time that would be better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s the lack of consensus. Not between destroyed or not, but between dust vs medium sized fragments, both of which count as destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry it took so long to respond. Just came home from the pub. Drunk debating is cool. I don&#39;t know if it makes me better or worse. I&#39;d like to think better since you&#39;re still trying to defend yourself and haven&#39;t been able to put me in my place yet. I gave you a chance at a win, but you insisted. Oh well.</p>

<p>Anyways. I&#39;ve had more challenging opponents in high school debate class but you make due with what you got. So, let&#39;s begin:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>After realizing appealing to authority is lame, joke it off. Bonus &quot;they break em themselves often enough&quot; = [citation needed]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a waste of everyone&#39;s time (and probably even mine) to have to peer review an article saying what everyone already knows</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does this article exist at all if it&#39;s a non-issue? Why defend a point &quot;everyone already knows&quot;? Pretty convenient to not have anyone else confirm the information presented. Imagine if only NASA had the rights to all information about space? That&#39;s not really how science works. If you care to google more sources, I won&#39;t hold that against you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s a waste of time that would be better spent elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it wasn&#39;t. You cited it yourself, after I managed to squeeze actual information from you, something the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1stggh/this_is_being_hidden_and_is_only_3_days_away/ce18v71">35 idiots</a> took at face value.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1su066/organized_trolling_of_rconspiracy_taking_place/ce1nzff">More proof people think the comet is &quot;no more&quot;</a></p>

<p>There is no consensus between dust vs medium sized fragments, but no consensus between existing and not existing. Unless &quot;no more&quot; means something else I&#39;m not aware of. Even If I cited one person, it&#39;s enough to generate a disagreement, thus, no consensus reached.</p>

<p>Uh... they counted. They identified astronomical cycles and did basic math to figure out when and how those cycles lined up. They recognized, over the centuries of their literate and astronomy-obsessed civilization, that eclipses cycle roughly every 33 years. Well before that, they must&#39;ve noticed that eclipse seasons happen every 173 days, even though they probably had no idea that this was because of the wandering inclination of the moon&#39;s orbit. </p>

<p>I mean, for fuck&#39;s sake - we&#39;re not talking about retrograde planetary motion or the rings of Saturn here. <em>The sun disappears.</em> People take note of that! When the records are literally written in stone and repetition occurs within one adult lifetime, it&#39;s not remotely surprising that a culture fixated on numbers, rituals, and the sky would figure this out. </p>

<p>And here&#39;s the important bit: anyone can figure this out now in five minutes on Wikipedia. We don&#39;t <em>need</em> to devote our lifetimes to recording the stars above... but we <em>could,</em> and it would be stupidly easy compared to the primitive pointing and staring that the Mayans did. Newtonian mechanics, one month of careful observations, and a little Javascript could tell you in minutes what they took decades to discern. </p>

<p>So please, do tell: what&#39;s more important about their calendar ending in two days than our calender ending in sixteen days?</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely - which is why they know a thousand times more about our solar system than the Mayans ever did. There is not a single celestial event which the Mayans predicted that NASA can&#39;t see coming in much higher precision than primitive native Americans ever manages. </p>

<p>Even predicting the sun&#39;s cycles 10,000 ahead?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>YES.</strong> Based on today&#39;s sunrise, I can predict when the sun will rise on every December 15th for the next billion years. Repetitious cycles aren&#39;t hard, once you have the evidence to recognize them!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many lifetimes is 10,000 years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Utterly meaningless. 33 years is well within a single lifetime, and that&#39;s long enough to recognize that eclipses are cyclical. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>None of which the Mayans had.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of which the Mayans <em>needed,</em> you imbecile. They had decades - lifetimes - <em>centuries</em> to work this out. I am saying that a rank amateur could duplicate their knowledge with a paltry fraction of the effort they spent. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their calendar is not ending, a cycle is ending.</p>

<p>In <em>exactly the same way</em> that our calender&#39;s cycle is ending. You are dense as neutronium, you trolling prat.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">14</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/d8_thc.html">d8_thc</a> 2013-12-13</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks, I was wondering why I couldn&#39;t find it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some relevant info.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeE-3BBqG58">This short video</a> </p>

<p>You will understand the following if you watch that video. </p>

<p>This explains how the inner &#39;spinners&#39; of the mayan calendar work, and why 12/16 is a jackpot. Essentially all of the &#39;spinner&#39;s are completed. This was <em>not</em> the case in 12/21.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>

<p>For the calendar to end of 4 Ahau or Dec. 21st, 2012 never made any sense to me which is why I was intrigued with Ian Lungold and Carl Calleman&#39;s theories. </p>

<p>13 Ahau is the highest form of completion in regards to the Tzolkin calendar and when you combine that with the 13th baktun, you get the highest form of calendar completion, interlocking the gears in the Mayan cycle. Thus, Dec. 16th, 2013 is 13 Baktun and 13 Ahau. The strongest possible completion you can possibly get! Maximum completion is when it reaches 13.0.1.0.0 or Dec. 16th, 2013! You can&#39;t get maximum calendar completion or the Long Count and Tzolkin calendar synchnocity when it reads 13.0.0.0.0 or Dec. 21st, 2012</p>

<p>Again, the Mayans used a 13:20 sync and this is seen in the Tzolkin calendar. The Tzolkin begins at 1 Imix, and ends on 13 Ahau and the 13:20 sync cycle is also used to figure out the katuns and baktuns as shown below:</p>

<p>20 kins equal 1 uinal or 20 days
18 uinals equal 1 tun or 360 days
20 tuns equal 1 katun or 7,200 days
20 katuns equal 1 baktun or 144,000 days</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I plugged in the numbers and calculated this. As soon below, the numbers clearly don&#39;t like when I take the end date of Dec. 16th, 2013 and work backwords using a 13:20 cycle sync. Here is the example below:</p>

<p>Dec. 16th, 2013 minus 1,872,000 days or 144,000 days x 13 baktun cycles = August 5th -3113 (13 Ahau) All 13 Batuns completed! </p>

<p>Dec. 16th, 2013 minus 93,600 days or 7,200 days x 13 cycle katuns = Sept. 9th, 1757 (13 Ahau) All 13 Katuns completed! </p>

<p>Dec. 16th, 2013 minus 4680 days or 360 days x 13 cycle tuns = Feb. 22nd, 2001 (13 Ahau) All 13 Tuns completed! </p>

<p>Dec. 16th, 2013 minus 260 days or 20 days x 13 cycle uinals = March 31st, 2013 (13 Ahau) All 13 Uinals completed! </p>

<p>You see, all the gears rotate perfectly this way. <strong>It can&#39;t be done if you compute it by Dec. 21st, 2012 because everything would fall on a 4 Ahau for the Baktun completion, the Katun completion, the Tun completion, and the Uinal completion, and we know now that this can&#39;t be the case because the end of the Tzolkin 260 day cycle is 13 Ahau, not 4 Ahau!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order for the calendar to reach maximum competion the 20 uinals, the 20 tuns, the 20 katuns, and the 20 baktuns have to be completed in the 13 cycle, all reaching 13 Ahau. Get it? </p>

<p>And as shown above with my calculations, it does! Maximum completion is shown on Dec. 16th, 2013 and again can&#39;t be done for computing the date of Dec. 21st, 2012.</p>

<p>December 16th, 2013 (13 Ahau Maximum Completion). All 13 Ahaus line up perfectly! <strong>The Long Count and the Tzolkin perfectly interlock and sync together.</strong> It is like hitting the jackpot! </p>

<p><strong>The mural absolutely depicts a mayan god returning. The native american (hopi) in the casket is absolutely holding a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Star_Kachina">Blue Star Kachina</a>. The indian girl in the back is holding a piece of a mayan calendar. This painting/mural IS about the return of the kachina/quetzecoatl (red feathery serpent...comet anyone?)</strong></p>

<p>You may argue that nothing is going to happen, but you cannot argue that this mural, the freemasons (new world airport commission) and the mayan calendar are all intricately linked for 12/16/13 here. </p>

<p>*By the way, this isn&#39;t some NEW thing, <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message976287/pg1">it was discovered 4 years ago.</a></p>

<p>If there really was an inbound object, or whatever it is, and it was part of mythos, and you didn&#39;t want the population to know, would you NOT hype an incorrect date?*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love reading stuff like this but my main question I have about this is the time difference. How do you know the Mayan Calendar equals a specific date on the Georgian Calendar? What I mean is, the calendar we use everyday is a horrible, piece of shit. For a long time, we didn&#39;t have a leap year but added it once we realized how off we become with other calenders being used. The past few decades we have even started using a leap minute to help shuffle our time around to make us feel better about its consistency and not begin crying again when we remember we made it all up to begin with. There have even been official Papal and Imperial degrees that have just outright changed the time and date to what ever was fashionable at the time. Plus, there is a good debate that a few hundred years after the fall of Rome, didnt actually happen.</p>

<p>With all that in mind, how can you be sure such and such date on the Mayan Calendar accurately correlates with any given date on our calendar, the Georgian one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What in the hell is a Georgian Calendar?  You mean Gregorian??  12 upvotes, and no redditor has made a peep over the wrong verbage?  I see so much of this, it makes me wonder if people are trolling.</p>

<p>altanon, I don&#39;t mean to be insulting or whatever, as you seem a cogent and reasonable human, which is what makes it more intriguing when I find these mistakes made by people who don&#39;t seem like they would think the Gregorian calendar is called &quot;Georgian&quot;.  It reminds me of the Georgia guidestones too, hearing that name.</p>

<p>Another thing is that you would think anyone with the internet would think to google something like the dating of ancient calendar systems to our own, yet I suppose if you&#39;re googling &quot;georgian calendar&quot; that might not work.</p>

<p>Now, to finally attempt to answer your question, good sir - which is indeed a very valid one (and I constantly question the historical dates that are provided to me)...  I&#39;m pretty sure this can be done through various means, the reliability of which could be argued and I&#39;m not an expert in such things, I&#39;ll just give you what I know.  Things like astronomical events that were historically notable and can be retroactively calculated- like for example, Columbus might have seen an eclipse one day and we might know what day he thought that was, and we might be able to know what day that would have occurred according to our calendar.  If there&#39;s a discrepancy between the dates, we would know the two calendars weren&#39;t aligned.  This could be done with more ancient records (the Mayans probably have a lot of eclipses written down or whatever).</p>

<p>A wiki article about a supposed event involving Columbus and eclipse charts.  If we were to use our own eclipse charts finding out if we&#39;re counting the same years as Columbus would be possible.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been able to find a specific citation documenting the Mayan calendar being fixed to a certain date by this method, I was a bit surprised that it wasn&#39;t easier to find such, yet there is a LOT of hits when you search anything with Mayan calendar... if I can do better with subsequent attempts at finding something better, I&#39;ll put it up!</p>

<p>My position isn&#39;t that any statements regarding the significance of the Mayan calendar might be true or anything... moreso that though they may not be widely known- I believe there are ways to try to solve questions like &quot;what year, according to OUR calendar, did historical events actually take place?&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, I thank you for your good form and respect by way of showing patience at me giving you a hard time over the whole Georgia/Gregorian thing.  I did notice that aside from 1 letter, they are anagrams of each other, and both proper nouns, and begin with the same letter.  I think I have some kind of fussiness regarding technical correctness, despite the fact that as you claim, I knew what you meant so that&#39;s good enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am intrigued by the Mayan culture and I am more curious about all this. Does the Mayan calendar mention lunar eclipses or is there some sort of famous ones in their history that we have recorded? It doesnt help that much of all this isnt understood easily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure the Mayans recorded celestial events that we should probably be able to align to our eclipse charts.  Eclipses and many astronomical events are predictable mathematically, whether predicting future ones or knowing how many years ago historical ones would have been.</p>

<p>As I said, I haven&#39;t found a reference to such yet, though :/  at least regarding the Mayan calendar</p>

<p>I know wiki isn&#39;t necessarily the solidest source, yet it references in this overview section of the Maya calendar page where scholars have estimated tie-in dates.</p>

<p>It seems to claim, from my quick reading, that the most widely accepted start date for the Mayan calendar is on August 11, 3114 BC, and is called the &quot;Goodman-Martinez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna google that right now, and see if it won&#39;t tell me how this guy figures that is the start date...</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar#Correlations_between_Western_calendars_and_the_Long_Count">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar#Correlations_between_Western_calendars_and_the_Long_Count</a></p>

<p>And I get led back to a wiki with some general references as to the evidences used to fix the correlation between the ancient and modern calendar systems.  This might not be what you&#39;re looking for, or enough of it, but I think this is the sort of thing we&#39;ve been speaking of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a great start wantsneeds! Lets say that the guy is right and that he did correlate the Mayan calendar with the date of August 11th, 3114 bc. What calendar is that too? I didnt notice one mentioned. Is it the Julian you think? That date is well before any calendar I know of that was used by the West. Maybe we would have a better chance of correlating to one of the older, Eastern calendars?</p>

<p>That date is so old, even if it was to a Western Calendar, does the Mayan calendar have large gaps in it as we do in ours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every year, the last day of the Mayan calendar year is the winter solstice.</p>

<p>Every year, the winter solstice falls on December 21st in the Gregorian calendar. </p>

<p>However, I am not sure how/whether the Mayan calendar accounts for and accounts for leap years in the past. There is also the issue of leap years not actually completely stabilizing and synchronizing the gregorian calendar (and maybe the Mayan?) to the solar year. A solar year is actually about 365.24. There&#39;s also a slight difference between the the sidereal year and the tropical year. And then there&#39;s the Chandler wobble. And then there&#39;s the fact that there was a change in the 1500s from the Julian calendar to the gregorian calendar and a few days were actually &quot;skipped&quot; so to speak. So dates before that transition actually correspond to different points in the earth&#39;s transit around the sun than they do after that transition.</p>

<p>All that aside, my point is that the Mayan calendar is not so mysterious and wishy-washy that we can&#39;t know anything for certain about it. It certainly is not as accurate as the most accurate solar calendars today, but the differences are not so huge that you can&#39;t correlate the two. Like I said, solstices can be used to correlate them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very valid point but my point is that if we are going to correlate to the day, than we do need to understand those differences and that they are huge. I could understand some sway if we are talking about a year or a decade but down to the day? I just dont buy it without some solid proof with sources cited. You know what I mean?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When people are saying &quot;OMG THE WORLD IS GOING TO END BECAUSE A BAKTUN IS ENDING ON THE MAYAN CALENDAR&quot; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable at all to claim that you know when the baktun is ending, and that it&#39;s on the winter solstice, which is December 21st.</p>

<p>In fact, despite your assertion that &quot;I have yet to see any work done towards correlating the two calendars together. Not by anyone. Not the theorist, not any University, nada, zip, nada III,&quot; there actually has been scholarly correlation of the two calendars. You can read all about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar#Correlations_between_Western_calendars_and_the_Long_Count">here</a></p>

<p>What is unreasonable, in my opinion, is that the end of the baktun being the end of the world is not something that Mayans believe/believed. I lived in Guatemala for five months last year, including during the end of the baktun, and some people said that &quot;something&quot; would be different, and some people pointed to the huge earthquake that preceded it by a few weeks to be some kind of &quot;sign.&quot; But I never heard anybody say anything the world ending. That was a stupid, ignorant claim that westerners imposed on them. Everybody said it&#39;s happened before, and so they weren&#39;t concerned. It was a huge party in the streets. Nobody was afraid of it. If you read Spanish, you can read <a href="http://mexico.cnn.com/entretenimiento/2012/12/18/rigoberta-menchu-lamenta-el-mal-uso-y-las-burlas-hacia-el-calendario-maya">Rigoberta Menchu&#39;s thoughts</a> on how irritating non-Mayan&#39;s infatuation with and jokes about the Mayan calendar are.</p>

<p>Besides being a situation of outsiders &quot;inventing&quot; prophesies in cultures they are not a part of, I also think this is dumb because I generally believe in science and astronomy more than superstition, numerology, and astrology. When scientists say the world is going to end, I&#39;ll pay attention. When new age whackballs say it&#39;s going to end, I&#39;m not going to pay attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know ISON&#39;s mass but a comet is mostly ice and rock which tend to disintegrate much faster than a meteor would.  While ISON is/was obviously very big as we could see it without the aid of telescopes most of it has been evaporated as it went around the sun though NASA has not released how much they think it lost, though it seems reasonable to assume that being that close to the Sun would take a lot off.  It is estimated to be closest to earth at a distance of .43AU of over 64 million kilometers.  The moon is only 400,000 kilometers.  That is the facts as I know them, I may be missing something.  </p>

<p>Now for my opinion I don&#39;t think ISON will hit earth anytime soon, on its next pass in 400,000 years maybe but from the info we have it doesn&#39;t line up.  Now will something else happen on the 16th?  Maybe, it could even be related to the comet but I don&#39;t think it will be an impact.  Maybe ISON is something else and we don&#39;t know due to government deceit or lack of knowledge but unless it&#39;s orbit has been greatly changed and it is not the size/composition that we think I don&#39;t see how an impact and subsequent event is possible.</p>

<p>We can tell through empirical science what it&#39;s made of - ice, iron, and a few trace chemicals. It flew too close to the sun and now, literally, we&#39;ve declared it dead since everything that differentiates it from an asteroid just boiled away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But Shoemaker-Levy was fundamentally different on several levels:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was pretty big, as far as comets go - the fragments alone measured in the scale of kilometers.</li>
<li>Jupiter, being a gas giant, has an atmosphere inherently different than our own in terms of structural mechanics</li>
<li>The &quot;light show&quot; was exactly that - a light show. All of the volatiles in the comet were boiled off at once, as opposed to over thousands of years as how comets normally die - instead of a candle, Shoemaker-Levy was a bomb.</li>
<li>The visible effects on Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere are attributable to the heat released by the fragments and the much more fluid nature of Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere being easier to disrupt and see.</li>

If one uses Stellarium to step back several months through Ison&#39;s path, there are many interesting astrological coincidences, from Earth&#39;s perspective, that almost seem to be telling a story; ig. Ison passed precisely between the pincers of both Cancer and Scorpio (what are the odds of that?). But I suspect that if anything happens this month, it will be a subtle change that will effect our reality gradually through events of 2014.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When ISON passed close to Mars they were talking about how great this chance would be to get pictures from the rovers and orbiters. But as it was approaching the government shut down and NASA was left empty. Which I don&#39;t think is entirely suspicious because shit happens from time time.</p>

<p>Then you have the perihelion that was hyped up to be a great show. But as NASA were live streaming it a couple of their planetary orbiters stopped working. Which again is a little unlucky that it happened at this precise moment but nothing completely out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>But the most suspicious part to me was that it never came back from the other side of the sun. At least not when and where we thought it would. Immediately everyone was worried that it burnt up or disintegrated. But one of the astrophysicists was completely perplexed. He said even if it did burn up or disintegrate we would still definitely be able to see something. Unless the comet was composed of something dense enough that wouldn&#39;t be evaporating. Which would definitely not line up with the ice ball theory. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much a cover-up as it is a lot of suspicious behaviour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, probably the first and most important thing you need to know is that the media heard that ISON had the <em>potential</em> to be one of the more spectacular comets in history, and of course ran with the headline-grabbing narrative.</p>

<p>But from the very start, astronomers tried to temper expectations with two warnings: first, we really wouldn&#39;t know much about its composition and resulting ability to shine brightly until it passed around the sun, and second, it might not ever survive that pass.</p>

<p>The reason it had the potential was that it&#39;s orbit brought it fantastically close to the sun, and then close to Earth, therefore making it a large, hot, bright, nearby light show.</p>

<p>That Mars flyby though wasn&#39;t covered up, or missed by NASA.  It just was pretty boring.  <a href="http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1310/07ison/#.UqybKfRDt24">http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1310/07ison/#.UqybKfRDt24</a>  Nobody really carried the story that ISON wasn&#39;t looking like it was going to live up to its potential, but I do remember some of the discussion amongst stargazers that this was a sign that ISON might turn out to be a dud.</p>

<p>It turned out to be moot anyways, as ISON was too small to fully survive is closest approach to the sun.  Check out this gif of perihelion: <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/11/29/weird_anim2.gif">http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/11/29/weird_anim2.gif</a></p>

<p>AHA!  Something survived!  Yeah, that&#39;s what we all thought at first and were very excited that we were going to get a beautiful comet in the early morning sky.</p>

<p>Well, as we watched longer and longer, the comet, and our collective hopes, faded.  You can skip to the bottom of this article if it&#39;s tl;dr <a href="http://earthsky.org/space/big-sun-diving-comet-ison-might-be-spectacular-in-2013">http://earthsky.org/space/big-sun-diving-comet-ison-might-be-spectacular-in-2013</a>  Basically, the tidal forces of the sun ripped it apart, and what we saw was a cloud of all the ISON bits.  :(</p>

<p>I do believe in many conspiracy theories, but I remain a staunch skeptic as I try to weed through the bad ones to find the good ones.  As an amateur astronomer, I feel as though I have enough background on this subject to say there&#39;s nothing fishy about ISON, and everything played out the way everyone knew could happen.</p>

(European, Indian, and any SA who stand in their way)  This is supposed to be the high cost of maintaining the peace.   The 16th of December has meaning in South Africa.  This marks the anniversary of a battle called Battle of Blood River that pitted 10k black africans against 400ish dutch troops.  Against overwhelming odds, the dutch won killing 3k natives.  This has been celebrated ever since then as a time for thanksgiving.  They call the day &quot;The Day of Reconciliation&quot;  The black population seem very displeased with this history and some say they are plotting a mass removal of everything european. </p>

<p>September 2016 is OBVIOUSLY the REAL date the Mayans predicted. Stay tuned. This time we&#39;re 100% serious this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will upvote, because I find most of these phenomina pretty interesting, but I truthfully believe it all to be BS and speculation.  Here is why I think so.</p>

<p>I started reading about ISON a month or so ago, and found it fascinating.  There were tens of videos talking about how ISON passed Mars and turned it into a satellite planet, and how a &#39;halo&#39; proved this.  People also said ISON would hit earth in November.  Again, people said earth was speculated to pass right through the debris field of ISON.  People also predicted that ISON would cause the magnetic fields of earth to flip-flop, causing a massive electrical outage and the oncoming of a new ice-age.  ISON was supposed to be the brightest thing since Hale-Bop, but I didn&#39;t see a damn thing in the sky.</p>

<p>I want something to happen, more-so than winning the lottery.  I think it would be interesting to have the world in chaos, and I think I would be good at it.  I really want to believe, but I just cant.  </p>

And what good does date prediction do, really?all you do is point to random events and make sound arguments linking symbology to ancient mythology or murals or shit like that... Thing is, ancient people believed a lot of things that weren&#39;t true (natives, Europeans, basically everyone).</p>

<p>And if/when our civilization dies, and a new one comes along and digs up artifacts of our legacy... And they see some of our abstract art, maybe traffic lights, etc, etc. they&#39;re going to do one of two things: they&#39;re going to say &quot;look at this traffic light, it must be a sign!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here is this ridiculous obsession we have with the end of all things. We are entrapped in the eschatological beliefs of last cultures we do not fully understand. We place our own modern worries and beliefs on top of a misunderstood Mayan calendar that at no point calls for the end of the world. Then the Hopi legend of the Blue Kachina is thrown on top as well. Maybe we can mix a few other prophecies in there -- the preposterous claims of BPEarthwatch&#39;s sensationalist YouTube videos perhaps should do the trick. All to anoint yet another end-of-the-world date that will come and go with no fanfare. </p>

<p>The biggest problem is this: we have real problems on this planet to contend with, cover-ups that demand our immediate attention. Chemtrails, Fukushima fallout, the erosion of our rights in the US, just to name a few. These are things that demand out energies. Things that will effect the world directly. Getting lost in the Mayan calendar and a failed comet that, sorry, won&#39;t hit Earth or cause the end of the world,... I don&#39;t know. Maybe that&#39;s just hoping for an easy out? Like wishing aliens will save us if things get bad. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like the mods are part of an evil worldwide conglomerate dead set on silencing a few redditors, and they remove all posts they don&#39;t like without a trace... except when they&#39;re on the toilet or take a nap apparently, because the posts like this get through after all. Under that assumption it actually makes sense to keep posting here, seeing all the complaints about people being silenced here. </p>

<p>Now this might blow your mind, but I&#39;ll say it anyway: If there was somebody removing posts here, there wouldn&#39;t be any complaining about it... because they&#39;d be removed!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know what to believe anymore. We live in the information age in which their is too much information for one person to learn. Combined with the fact that i have learned to trust anyone but my self, it makes it difficult to believe in anything i my self can&#39;t prove.</p>

<p>So instead of trying to independently verify everything, i focus on the patterns that seem to be present within the system.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very open to being completely wrong about this. I have nothing to prove that anything will happen on monday besides curious coincidences. That is enough for me to moderately consider it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re making up information such as the mural depicting a meteor strike even though there&#39;s no image of such a thing.

<p>What? <strong>Both ISON and Venus will be 47-48 million miles away from each other on 12/16.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The swooping tail is to create a pattern with the whale jumping out of the water. It goes whale -&gt; sky -&gt; smoke. The sky is blue. It&#39;s not a comet&#39;s tail... you&#39;re literally seeing something that isn&#39;t there. The trail you refer to even goes from the ground <strong>up</strong> for christs sake.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the arrow in the image in the OP: where he draws an arrow from the sun to ISON to Venus and to the earth. Firstly we don&#39;t live in a 2-dimensional universe the arrow wouldn&#39;t be straight, it&#39;d angle up and down when looking at Ison/Earth/Venus because they don&#39;t all lie on a perfect plane. Secondly it&#39;s not a perfect arrow because millions of miles are being reduced to a tiny image, it looks like a straight line of equal lengths but in fact it&#39;s much more warped due to the error of margin. &#39;There are no straight lines in nature&#39; apart from when you&#39;re trying to create a conspiracy.</p>

<p>All you&#39;re doing is finding bits of [incorrect] information and <strong>then</strong> making them fit into your idea. None of it stands for anything by itself because it&#39;s all insignificant but putting them all together you&#39;ve arrived at an answer that doesn&#39;t actually one piece of evidence supporting it. </p>

<p>Look forward to your posts after the 16th or whatever arbitrary date you claim will bring the end of the world or whatever it is. Oh that&#39;s right, you don&#39;t even know what it is. Well isn&#39;t that convenient?</p>

<p>Right now i just focus on noticing patterns and seeing what i can pick up from just watching behaviour. I wouldn&#39;t have posted this post at all unless i noticed something odd surrounding it. I&#39;ve seen a couple of these dec 16th prediction posts today and yesterday, but i can&#39;t seem to find them anywhere on here anymore. To me that was reason enough to try and repost it. (I just looked, there is one on the second or third page now. But i couldn&#39;t find it at the time of me posting this thread.)</p>

<p>We can tell through empirical science what it&#39;s made of - ice, iron, and a few trace chemicals. It flew too close to the sun and now, literally, we&#39;ve declared it dead since everything that differentiates it from an asteroid just boiled away. </p>

<p>The Mayan calander isn&#39;t ending</p>

<p>The cycle it&#39;s on, however, is ending. This is the important part you failed to mention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is simply 3 exposures of the same object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you elaborate?</p>

<p>Why so many upvotes for a comment that is nothing more than conjecture? I thought people here liked proof, evidence, or whathaveyou. There is nothing on your comment to corroborate what you claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I see, so now the only thing that will disprove your &quot;facts&quot; is the earth being destroyed in a fiery inferno, right?  And if that doesn&#39;t happen, I&#39;m wrong. LOL  That&#39;s pretty convenient.  </p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t expect anything like that...  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t hold your breath for any apologies.  Your &quot;proof&quot; is garbage.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original trajectory of the comet posed no threat for the Earth. But since it survived its encounter with the Sun the parameters have changed and you have to look at it as a new threat. </p>

<p>Right now we don&#39;t know if its path remains the same and out of our way, or if it broke to smaller pieces that have the possibility of spraying earth like a shotgun. </p>

<p>A wiki article about a supposed event involving Columbus and eclipse charts.  If we were to use our own eclipse charts finding out if we&#39;re counting the same years as Columbus would be possible.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been able to find a specific citation documenting the Mayan calendar being fixed to a certain date by this method, I was a bit surprised that it wasn&#39;t easier to find such, yet there is a LOT of hits when you search anything with Mayan calendar... if I can do better with subsequent attempts at finding something better, I&#39;ll put it up!</p>

<p>My position isn&#39;t that any statements regarding the significance of the Mayan calendar might be true or anything... moreso that though they may not be widely known- I believe there are ways to try to solve questions like &quot;what year, according to OUR calendar, did historical events actually take place?&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, I thank you for your good form and respect by way of showing patience at me giving you a hard time over the whole Georgia/Gregorian thing.  I did notice that aside from 1 letter, they are anagrams of each other, and both proper nouns, and begin with the same letter.  I think I have some kind of fussiness regarding technical correctness, despite the fact that as you claim, I knew what you meant so that&#39;s good enough.</p>
