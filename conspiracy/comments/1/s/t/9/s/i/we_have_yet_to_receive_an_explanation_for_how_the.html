        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No explanation has been provided and mods seem as confused as some of us.</p>

<p>The story goes that the post <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1she85/how_reddit_was_destroyed/">&quot;How reddit was destoryed&quot;</a> made it to the top of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. At 9AM EST (after the story had 586 upvotes and was top of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) the story somehow ended up in the spamfilter.</p>

<p>Mod Sarah_Connors confirms that,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sk5eu/my_top_rconspiracy_post_how_reddit_was_destroyed/cdyo1jg">...I saw it was removed and I approved it.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sk5eu/my_top_rconspiracy_post_how_reddit_was_destroyed/cdyo1jg">Not sure why it was removed as it did not at which mod may have removed it.</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="http://minus.com/my8IKAgH9fTIp">here</a> is the conversation I have had with the mods, where the possibility of the spamfilter being tripped by an edit to the OP is discussed and rejected (by me) as plausible. </p>

<p>I think the admins pulled that post and I think the mods of this sub have been conspicuously quiet about this subversion of the organic curation of content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the thing bro.  And it factored into me quitting as a mod.</p>

<p>The mods here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> really are just normal dudes trying to enforce the rules.  I checked the mod log every day, it was actually my biggest curiosity when I first became a mod.  The mod log shows exactly which mods did what.  Removed comment, approved comment, removed post, approved post, ban user, unban user, edit wiki, edit CSS. Everything.</p>

<p>Most of the time when something was removed by mistake it was automoderator and if I clicked on the post, which I could still see because I was a mod, it would say [removed] automoderator.</p>

<p>If Mr. Dong removed something it would say [removed] mrdong.</p>

<p>But every blue moon it would say [removed].  No name of who removed it, nothing.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was the admins, it seemed a fairly logical conclusion.  But then we had a post with someone&#39;s personal info in it and it was removed [removed] Bitcrunch.  It showed which admins removed it.  </p>

<p>So I never figured out who or what was removing stuff when it just said [removed] &quot;with no name attached&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe their spam filter?  Maybe some other filter.  Maybe there is a way for admins to stealth delete things.  I just don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, thanks for sharing. Was wondering why you quit.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what drew my attention to the removal of this post.</p>

<p>When Sarah_Connors reapproved the post from the spamfilter it somehow went into the new queue.</p>

<p>When mods over on <a href="/r/soccer">/r/soccer</a> used to reapprove match threards that would get shadowpulled without leaving a record in mod log those posts would be right back in the &quot;hot&quot; queue. </p>

<p>I think something new was used to pull the how reddit was destroyed post and, in general, I think the shift the admins have allowed towards shadow-deletions via automod (and other like practices) is nefarious and a sign of things to come.</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m pretty much done trying to raise awareness of what&#39;s been going down with regards to insider manipulation of reddit. Now feels like the time when we get to watch her burn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to disappoint, but it was just removed by the spam-filter when the OP edited in a bit.ly link (labeled as &quot;research point concerning the net worth of reddit.com&quot;) at the bottom of the post. All self-posts/comments containing a link from most url-shorteners (except site-specific ones like youtu.be) are auto-removed, and the spam-filter rechecks things whenever they&#39;re edited.</p>

<p>This is pretty basic knowledge about how the spam-filter works. You should probably create a subreddit and test some things out before jumping to conclusions based on incorrect assumptions. You could have easily copy-pasted that post&#39;s text into a self-post in a subreddit you&#39;re a mod of and seen it be immediately auto-removed by the spam-filter.</p>

<p>We did indeed know that was how the spamfilter worked.</p>

<p>What we didn&#39;t know was weather or nor OP did indeed edit his post before it was caught by the filter the first time. This was reflected by <a href="/u/weedtastic">/u/weedtastic</a> saying that he was only able to see &quot;edited two days ago&quot; when we researched the issue.</p>

<p>Or you know, you could have said this two days ago rather than leaving mods and users alike scratching their heads.</p>

<p>Perhaps a suggestion would be to have the spamfilter leave an entry in the modlog. </p>

<p>I would have, if anyone had asked. I just checked the <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a> modmail back through the time that that post was made, and nobody bothered to send a message actually asking what happened.</p>

<p>Probably not a bad idea, but I&#39;m not sure how simple it would be to add. I think the mod log is set up so that every action has to be associated with a user, so it might take some reworking to be able to handle that.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t fault you there I guess; but, to be fair, since the summer of 2011  I, myself, have never expected a response from that modmailm and I have a feeling many others feel similarly. </p>

<p>I would say looking over the way in which the modlog functions would be a wonderful idea if it means more accountability!</p>

<p>Assuming I understand what you&#39;re talking about, that&#39;s nothing special with AutoModerator. Any comment that&#39;s deleted or removed that doesn&#39;t have any replies to it doesn&#39;t leave a marker.</p>

<p>Automoderator cannot do that. Automod functions just like a regular mod. What you&#39;re thinking of is reddit&#39;s automatic spam filter. Read here:

    <div class="md"><p>The words that you use to talk about this stuff is important, and I think that&#39;s why you have this impression.</p>

<p>The automoderator bot can be set, either by <a href="/u/deimorz">/u/deimorz</a> or the moderators of this subreddit in the wiki, to automatically do things that a normal mod can do. Two of the things that it can are to automatically <em>remove</em> comments or submissions based on their author or specific keywords in the post, yes.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between &quot;sending commentings to the spam filter&quot; and removing them, though. When I say something is <em>caught by the spam filter</em> it means that it has been removed by something that is not controlled by the moderators. When something is caught by the spam filter it looks like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xdPFGfN.png">this.</a> No moderator is listed as removing it. When something is <em>removed by a moderator</em>, it looks like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZtQciXA.png">this.</a></p>

<p>To answer your question: yes, <a href="/u/automoderator">/u/automoderator</a> can <em>remove comments</em>, but when it does so whatever it removes would say &quot;removed by automoderator&quot; and that action would be listed in the mod log.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps because if you&#39;re not paying attention, any asshole can vindictively abuse the system and report you as a spammer, as I myself recently discovered when a moderator who banned me from <a href="/r/gay">/r/gay</a> then tried to report me to 
<a href="/r/reportthespammers">/r/reportthespammers</a> saying that I was &quot;spamming hate&quot; to make it really stand out:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/1sphbt/overview_for_silvertoof/">http://www.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/1sphbt/overview_for_silvertoof/</a></p>

<p>fortunately the moderators at <a href="/r/spam/">/r/spam/</a> are rational and able to distinguish what is really spam. However, if you are not paying attention, it is possible to fly under their radar (a dirtbag move.)</p>

<p>You must be vigilant and actively monitor your posts and/or reputation, especially if you butt heads with the resident control freaks.</p>

<p>disclaimer: I made fun of your 6+ &quot;censored&quot; posts making to the top of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in another subreddit</p>

<p>update: i updated that post with a retraction to keep myself honest</p>
