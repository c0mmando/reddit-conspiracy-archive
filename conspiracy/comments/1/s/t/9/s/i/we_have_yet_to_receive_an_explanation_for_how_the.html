       No explanation has been provided and mods seem as confused as some of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story goes that the post
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1she85/how_reddit_was_destroyed/">
        "How reddit was destoryed"
       </a>
       made it to the top of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . At 9AM EST (after the story had 586 upvotes and was top of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ) the story somehow ended up in the spamfilter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mod Sarah_Connors confirms that,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sk5eu/my_top_rconspiracy_post_how_reddit_was_destroyed/cdyo1jg">
         ...I saw it was removed and I approved it.

        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1sk5eu/my_top_rconspiracy_post_how_reddit_was_destroyed/cdyo1jg">
         Not sure why it was removed as it did not at which mod may have removed it.
        </a>
        .

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And
       <a href="http://minus.com/my8IKAgH9fTIp">
        here
       </a>
       is the conversation I have had with the mods, where the possibility of the spamfilter being tripped by an edit to the OP is discussed and rejected (by me) as plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the admins pulled that post and I think the mods of this sub have been conspicuously quiet about this subversion of the organic curation of content.

       Here is the thing bro.  And it factored into me quitting as a mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       really are just normal dudes trying to enforce the rules.  I checked the mod log every day, it was actually my biggest curiosity when I first became a mod.  The mod log shows exactly which mods did what.  Removed comment, approved comment, removed post, approved post, ban user, unban user, edit wiki, edit CSS. Everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time when something was removed by mistake it was automoderator and if I clicked on the post, which I could still see because I was a mod, it would say [removed] automoderator.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Mr. Dong removed something it would say [removed] mrdong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But every blue moon it would say [removed].  No name of who removed it, nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I thought it was the admins, it seemed a fairly logical conclusion.  But then we had a post with someone's personal info in it and it was removed [removed] Bitcrunch.  It showed which admins removed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I never figured out who or what was removing stuff when it just said [removed] "with no name attached".
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe their spam filter?  Maybe some other filter.  Maybe there is a way for admins to stealth delete things.  I just don't know.

       Interesting, thanks for sharing. Was wondering why you quit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what drew my attention to the removal of this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Sarah_Connors reapproved the post from the spamfilter it somehow went into the new queue.
      </p>
      <p>
       When mods over on
       <a href="/r/soccer">
        /r/soccer
       </a>
       used to reapprove match threards that would get shadowpulled without leaving a record in mod log those posts would be right back in the "hot" queue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think something new was used to pull the how reddit was destroyed post and, in general, I think the shift the admins have allowed towards shadow-deletions via automod (and other like practices) is nefarious and a sign of things to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I'm pretty much done trying to raise awareness of what's been going down with regards to insider manipulation of reddit. Now feels like the time when we get to watch her burn.

       Sorry to disappoint, but it was just removed by the spam-filter when the OP edited in a bit.ly link (labeled as "research point concerning the net worth of reddit.com") at the bottom of the post. All self-posts/comments containing a link from most url-shorteners (except site-specific ones like youtu.be) are auto-removed, and the spam-filter rechecks things whenever they're edited.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is pretty basic knowledge about how the spam-filter works. You should probably create a subreddit and test some things out before jumping to conclusions based on incorrect assumptions. You could have easily copy-pasted that post's text into a self-post in a subreddit you're a mod of and seen it be immediately auto-removed by the spam-filter.

       We did indeed know that was how the spamfilter worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we didn't know was weather or nor OP did indeed edit his post before it was caught by the filter the first time. This was reflected by
       <a href="/u/weedtastic">

       saying that he was only able to see "edited two days ago" when we researched the issue.

       Probably not a bad idea, but I'm not sure how simple it would be to add. I think the mod log is set up so that every action has to be associated with a user, so it might take some reworking to be able to handle that.

       Can't fault you there I guess; but, to be fair, since the summer of 2011  I, myself, have never expected a response from that modmailm and I have a feeling many others feel similarly.

       Assuming I understand what you're talking about, that's nothing special with AutoModerator. Any comment that's deleted or removed that doesn't have any replies to it doesn't leave a marker.

       It's worked like that for as long as I can remember, at least several years. Someone could probably find out if it ever didn't work that way by digging into the comment-tree code, but it's pretty difficult code to understand.

       Automoderator cannot do that. Automod functions just like a regular mod. What you're thinking of is reddit's automatic spam filter. Read here:

       The words that you use to talk about this stuff is important, and I think that's why you have this impression.
      </p>
      <p>
       The automoderator bot can be set, either by
       <a href="/u/deimorz">
        /u/deimorz
       </a>
       or the moderators of this subreddit in the wiki, to automatically do things that a normal mod can do. Two of the things that it can are to automatically
       <em>
        remove
       </em>
       comments or submissions based on their author or specific keywords in the post, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a difference between "sending commentings to the spam filter" and removing them, though. When I say something is
       <em>
        caught by the spam filter
       </em>
       it means that it has been removed by something that is not controlled by the moderators. When something is caught by the spam filter it looks like
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xdPFGfN.png">
        this.
       </a>
       No moderator is listed as removing it. When something is
       <em>
        removed by a moderator
       </em>
       , it looks like
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZtQciXA.png">
        this.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question: yes,
       <a href="/u/automoderator">
        /u/automoderator
       </a>
       can
       <em>
        remove comments
       </em>
       , but when it does so whatever it removes would say "removed by automoderator" and that action would be listed in the mod log.

       Perhaps because if you're not paying attention, any asshole can vindictively abuse the system and report you as a spammer, as I myself recently discovered when a moderator who banned me from
       <a href="/r/gay">
        /r/gay
       </a>
       then tried to report me to
       <a href="/r/reportthespammers">
        /r/reportthespammers

       saying that I was "spamming hate" to make it really stand out:

       fortunately the moderators at

       are rational and able to distinguish what is really spam. However, if you are not paying attention, it is possible to fly under their radar (a dirtbag move.)
