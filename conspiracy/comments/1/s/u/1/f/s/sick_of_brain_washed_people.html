<p>** Mr. Greenbaum
Dear Obama please ban all firearms and confiscate guns from all gun owners and if they resist put them in prison or the ground! We need to round up the guns and terrorists!!!!!**</p>

<p>Do people REALLY think taking away guns is going to stop killing???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think so. SSRIs are prescribed to &quot;correct&quot; chemical imbalances in the brain. However, no tests are done on patients to determine if a chemical imbalance actually exists. As a result, SSRIs are prescribed in a haphazard way, e.g. &quot;let&#39;s try this one&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s increase/decrease the dosage&quot;. Medication by trial and error. While those drugs definitely do help some people, I suspect they also are the cause of major problems in others.</p>

<p>Now, we aren&#39;t the only country with poverty but you at least have to admit that having a gun handy sure does make killing somebody a hell of a lot easier.  I&#39;m a member of the NRA but I&#39;m starting to think that if they fund a study tomorrow that correlates murder to the amount of coffee you drink in the morning you&#39;d sooner buy into that idea than admit that having a country full of guns is going to lead to more killing.  It&#39;s demonstrated annually but people who love their guns (I really enjoy being a gun owner) seem to be afraid to admit it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well seeing as how there were under 500,000 gun death incidents in the United States in 2011 (2012 and on not listed) and 300 million plus guns in the United States there is a low correlation of guns used for killing. I only draw this conclusion based on the word &quot;incidents&quot; which means purposeful vs accidental deaths. You being in the NRA has no addition to your invalid argument. Murder correlation to coffee?? The argument is guns vs deaths correlation, coffee is a stimulant, so its a completely different argument. United States does have a poverty line, yes. The raw story link you provided doesn&#39;t say anything in relation of murders vs gun ownership, just that 1/3 and 1/2 (roughly) of Americans own registered firearms. Murder rates with firearms have dropped 50% in the past 13 years, whole ATF estimates that 10 million guns are added to the market every year (meaning bought). So your correlation is not accurate, at all. <a href="http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states">http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/united-states</a>

    <div class="md"><p>The NRA thing was only mentioned to point out that I&#39;m not trying to support a gun ban.  I just see that there is, in fact, a correlation between the amount of guns we have in this country and the amount of murder we have in this country.  Of course not every murder is done by way of gun but access to guns makes it easy.  At this point I genuinely think we are in too deep so we couldn&#39;t possibly take guns away because too many people who would want to use them for illegal purposes already have them so people who want to use them for protection need them.  I think all responsible people should be armed because of this.  </p>

<p>On a side note as far as the 500,000 gun deaths and 300 million guns figures.. A lot of people own multiple guns (as I&#39;m sure you are aware) so  unless people are using 10 guns at a time to shoot themselves or somebody else that correlation there is going to automatically be skewed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is still a pretty high number per capita compared to the UK.  It translates to 30 times more gun murders.  The UK does have a higher violent crime rate, however, which could be attributed to criminals knowing that the person they are going to attack isn&#39;t going to be armed.  I dunno if it ends up being a matter of what we as Americans value more compared to what people of the UK value.  It seems that people over there are willing to take a beating and lose their wallet and in America we would rather defend our property to the death.  I&#39;m not saying either side is wrong but our way just results in more people dying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not being deliberately misleading.  I&#39;m being honest about what I think based on what I&#39;ve read.  I&#39;m a member of the NRA since I was 18.  My grandfather and father are both lifelong members.  I like being a gun owner but I&#39;m not above admitting that guns make killing pretty easy.  I&#39;m not opposed to background checks being mandatory.  People who are so obsessed with this idea that the government is going to come and take their guns away need to relax.  If you want to investigate a conspiracy look into how many god damn phone calls I get from the NRA asking for money to be donated to them so they can fight Obama trying to take our guns away.  Every time there is a mass shooting they ramp up their fund raising and then they make millions, gun sales skyrocket, and nobody takes away anybody&#39;s guns.  Who are the real suckers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of countries that willingly gave up their guns emotionally after a mass shooting. The US has a few ways of fighting that, which means they have to slowly ban them. Don&#39;t ignore the gun control agenda after a shooting. They always capitalize on that shit. Let me guess: you simply didn&#39;t know about that? No, you&#39;re being deliberately misleading. </p>

<p>Also banning guns won&#39;t make them go away. Let me guess: you simply didn&#39;t know about that? You said this: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never called you a shill. I&#39;m saying the chances of you being unaware that your argument is extremely easy to dismantle and entirely inaccurate and misleading is extremely low. If you are older than 15 years old, there is no excuse for spouting idiotic arguments like you&#39;re doing. You know you&#39;re being misleading. Now why are you being misleading? I don&#39;t know. Why don&#39;t you tell us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, there are any number of ways you can kill a person without a gun. But would columbine, sandy hook or virginia tech have happened if the assailants didn&#39;t have such easy access to guns and assault weapons? It&#39;s a lot harder to carry out a massacre with a samurai sword..</p>

<p>As an Australian where we have very strict gun control, I find it very difficult to comprehend the ongoing American justification of the right to own handguns and assault weapons, when it seems like there is another tragic mass shooting every week or two.</p>

<p>In Australia we haven&#39;t and a single mass shooting since we cracked down on gun ownership two decades ago.</p>

<p>Bring on the downvotes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize Australia has the population of a large U.S. state, right? Not saying you&#39;re wrong, just that it&#39;d be a little more accurate to compare Australia with, say, Florida. It&#39;s easier to pass laws like this with a smaller population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aaaaand I didn&#39;t say it did. Getting 20 million Australians on board with a gun control law is MUCH easier than 300 million Americans who literally have a civil right to own them. I was just pointing out that it&#39;s more like getting a state law passed here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way I&#39;d give up my guns is if they got rid of all the blacks in America. The black male population in America makes of 6% of the population but is accountable for 54% of crime in America. Not to mention that blacks kill around 10 people a day.

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. Take away the crime done by blacks and Hispanics, particularly illegal Hispanics, and get rid of the black, Hispanic, and Asian gang violence, and violent crime in America would drop to near zero. Whites are not the problem.</p>
