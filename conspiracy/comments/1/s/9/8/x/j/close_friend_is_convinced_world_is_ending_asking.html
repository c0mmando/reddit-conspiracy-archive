       I'm not sure if this is the right place to go but it's the only one that made sense right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend who I've known for a decade has been into conspiracies for a few years now, and its never been an issue. 
She feels strongly about the subjects involved and I never felt an issue but lately it's changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is convinced the world is going to end at the end of the month. Stopped eating and sleeping because of it, I can see her spine and ribs through her back. She feels so strongly this is fact that she renounced her therapist and any health profession.
      </p>
      <p>
       My tldr is this:
My friend thinks the world is ending within a month and it seems dangerous and is worrisome. I was wondering if there might be any basis for such ideas, she wouldn't tell me details because she felt I couldn't bear the knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything would be helpful and if this is the wrong place to ask just let me know. Thank you.

       This is called the " end times programming" that the Controllers want us to have. They are in a sense, Black Magicians, and understand the power of the mind. They are releasing information to scare us, and more importantly they are changing the "collective consciousness" to believe it. Metaphysical studies prove we partake inadvertently to what we see happening ( law of the observer). So if we see and believe The End is here, and enough of of believe it....then we are creating our reality to have that happen. 
I say the best way to defeat them is not be fearful, and stand in your own truth, be the change you want to see. Surround yourself with good friends, family, and own your humanity. They may take the World, but your soul doesn't have to die with it.
May your friend stay strong, and you as well

       Maybe she needs to smoke some pot?  I've been very depressed like that before, and nothing got me back on my feet (and eating) like smokin a bowl.  I hate meds and I don't trust doctors and I too believe the s will htf very soon, but I'm determined to just say eff it and just do what makes me happy.  Not hurting anyone, even myself, just enjoying whatever is left of life.  It would be a great dishonor to just throw it away.  And if everything stays fine for the rest of my life, then awesome, I had a good time.  I know a lot of people say drugs are bad and aren't the answer, but it was for me, whether anybody likes it not not.  Maybe for her too?  Smoke some pot, go for a little walk and enjoy nature...yeah, that sounds good.  Nice little pick me up.  Just a thought I wanted to throw out there.  Try it once, if she completely flips out, then she needs better help, and in that case, I am truly sorry.

       Thanks for the advice, but its a loss. She smoked a small amount but stayed lately it makes her behavior worse and heightens her paranoia of these issues. I use marijuana to help my anxiety occasionally so I agree it can be a help sometimes, sadly not this time. Thank you.

       No one will be able to say with absolute certainty when the "end" actually starts. It will be a slow and gradual decline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your friend sounds like she has been staring into the abyss for too long. As much as i fiend for the red pill, sometimes one has to take a heavy dose of the blue pill to keep from going insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       im currently in a rut of depression (nothing serious folks) myself , ive been immersed in this world for months straight. i plan on turning off for a few days; watch tv shows, maybe some football or hit up a bar. Anything that is usually done by the masses of sheep
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell your friend to come here. it also helps to talk it out with people, its easy to get caught up in your own head and other peoples voices help reel it back slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       also tell her the way the world ends, is not with a bang but a whimper
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       EDIT: also, keep in mind your friend may have come down with a serious mental illness. i was talking to a friend the other day who was seeing this girl, who in litterally almost overnight turned insane

       Seems like your friend is doing a self fulfilling prophecy. I would tell them go out having fun. Eat good. Hang out with people she likes. If she's right she had fun until the end. If she's wrong she's better off.

       She is already unhinged. What she needs is meds from a source she can trust, or she'll end up like someone I know: Hallucinating but learning to live with it. And then as she ages, she'll wind up driving to a different state/hurting somebody with no recollection of what happened. The brain is a VERY complicated part of us humans. If she can't regain control through diet and exercise, she'll need medicine. If she refuses that, she'll end up in a mental hospital or jail or dead.

       Not harsh at all.  I love her deeply and am stumped by the same thing you are suggesting. She refuses any medical care, at my advice and even her father who is a doctor himself. I'm quite certain she is even losing her trust In me. You're right, I wish she would even consider. I've no issues being against certain meds but I do believe they can help some. I hope she might come to this realization herself, I'm at a loss

       I'm hoping she finds another psychologist. In my experience I've had three and am on the fourth, he's extremely kind and helpful. I tried to suggest a new one but I am hoping she will at least try to find one.

       Maybe she's right and we're the ones who need help. Just tell her that every day the world can end but only the positive actions of the righteous will save us each day. Tell her that she is the hero she's been waiting for.

       As someone else recommended, she definitely needs to take a break from all of this stuff. It can get to you, obviously. I went through something similar (not as severe/intense) in which I just got overwhelmed by all of the things I was learning. Then I realized that there was no point to "waking up" if I was going to be scared shitless to do anything ever. So I took a break from looking up this type of stuff for about a week and then I felt refreshed, relaxed and at peace.

       Tell your friend to look at it this way -- how long has the world been around? Billions of years, right? Now, just from a mathematical perspective, what are the chances of the world ending during her lifetime? Billions to one, right. Because there's not only the past to consider, but the future duration of the world. It would be the wildest ill fortune for the world to end on her watch.

       It's like the people who climb up to the edge of cliffs and look out over the countryside. We know the edge of the cliffs are going to collapse. Along the coast of Dover we can see it happening. All cliffs crumble eventually. But what are the  odds of that massive rock face falling right at the hour you are standing on it? Pretty slim.

       Remind her that good does exists, and despite the grasp of evil on the world. Goodness will prevail as innocent, and pure as it is. A lot of prophecy tells how things will become remarkably bad, but if you are good in your heart through-out it, you will survive and inherit a new world of beauty and peace.

       have you tried letting her know that worrying won't change anything? this is my second time on this thread, and I'm rly starting to care. have you tried religion? I'm a Christian and I have "woken up" too. In the bible it does state the world is going to end, but nobody knows when so certainly she doesn't. And that it doesn't matter(especially her worrying) what she or anybody does. anybody left behind after the rapture will suffer. Only God can Jesus can save her when the world ends. I'm not a hardcore christian at all, just suggesting a solution.

       I had a long talk yesterday with her. She's going to have a discussion with her mother to decide what she could do in terms of coping skills. She's not as erratic as before but still anxious. Thank you for the suggestion and she's rather non theistic but it can't hurt to suggest something along those lines :) thank you

       Yes, there is a global cabal of psychopaths who wish to literally control and enslave the entire human population through a combination of war, destruction, and economic strangulation.

       Yes, they kill thousands a day and are responsible for millions of deaths.

       Hey man,
      </p>
      <p>
       Tough times come upon all of us once in a while.  Sounds like your friend is taking it to a bit of an extreme by letting it harm her health.  If you can figure out WHY she thinks the world is ending we could help provide some reasoning to help her ride it out, but I would also be on the lookout for other depression symptoms, which might be the general cause here.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of times creative people can make big stories to explain simple but hard to understand feelings of hopelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say look out for her, be in touch, and make sure she knows you're there for her, just like any friend who hits a rough patch.  No reason to call her crazy, won't help, and she'll figure it out when the world doesn't end.
      </p>

       I agree with you whole heartily. As of now she won't be specific with her fears but I've let her known I'm here. As you mentioned I plan to keep an open ear and be there, I've just never seen her react this intense to anything. But I will do as I can as a friend!

       What's her specific fear? Or depression?

      <p>
       As someone who likes to avoid pharmaceuticals, I can understand why the traditional therapy/medical approaches (and creepy psych wards) aren't always an option. But your friend sounds like she really needs some kind of daily hobby/something that can hopefully get her looking forward to the next day, and so on...

       Rest assured the world is not ending. The Earth will keep on rotating and hurdling through space just fine. The Western Empire on the other hand is about to implode as they loose Currency War 3. This is not the end, ether. A new state will take the old states place, even if there is a few months of chaos everything will continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen my friend put it this way. They won't try and kill everyone off. They may want to do so, but they won't because of their fear of the .001 percent. Yes the elite need the masses to ensure their survival and are reasonably sure that the ones to survive would be the ones that want to kill them and with no safety net, they will be sitting ducks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no there is no end of the world, life will continue to get shittier thanks to general human apathy but other than that no disastrous end. Plus even if there is so what, do you honestly want all this to keep going on?
