<p>It&#39;s not a revolution until the history books are written, but make no mistake. We already had a revolution and we lost. They just haven&#39;t told us yet. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter who you think did it - the military/industrial complex, the CIA, Israel, the bankers. The fact is they already did it and they realized it would work better if they just kept the facade going instead of announcing it. </p>

<p>I think what you mean is counter-revolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like considering that one event a &quot;revolution&quot; is oversimplifying a much more complex system of power/influence that has been manifesting over several decades (if not longer) and remains ongoing to this day. So, in my mind, it&#39;s much more of an evolution than revolution...with events like 9/11 being seized upon to further that cause in any and every way possible.</p>

<p>Similarly, I see our &quot;revolution&quot; as a gradual shift in consciousness through technology/education/communication...a gradual push towards greater transparency and accountability via the free flow of information. I&#39;m generally very cynical in my view of the way society operates, but I&#39;m very optimistic about its technological future in the hands of future, more open-minded generations.</p>

Will leave the US in some disarray, and things will have to be reordered -- the point of a revolution, isn&#39;t it? -- but will definitely end up benefiting the people, so long as the pursuit of happiness is not considered infinite war for infinite consumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to think as long as the masses of poor still get their checks from the government, there is no way a revolution will happen. If the Republican party gets there way and make serious cuts to social welfare, I think that might make for a trigger. The Federal government pays the destitute just enough to not bite the hand that feeds them and not a cent more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually don&#39;t think that it&#39;ll necessarily be a &quot;let them eat cake&quot; scenario; I think it could start with a courageous and maybe symbolic act of civil disobedience that, multiplied by the free media, catches on. Then again when Occupy tried, the riot cops were unleashed. How about this for starters, based on the following exchange said to have taken place in roman times: Some senator: &#39;Perhaps we should make the slaves wear armbands in order to identify them&#39;; &#39;nother senator:  &#39;Perhaps not for they would see how many they are and rise up agains us&#39; :</p>

<p>Create a subtle, innocent, openly wearable symbol that is used to signal one is mentally &#39;on board&#39; the revolution to (hopefully) eliminate that feeling of desolation that one tends to fall victim to in meat space. Let people&#39;s courage feed off each other, and encourage them to fraternize and start networking. How about a resistor? You know, those little electrical things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. It is easy to surround yourself with like-minded individuals these days. Even those in the surveillance industry are so surrounded by same thinking people that they think what they are doing is purely for the good of the country. In the same way, I think you are also surrounded by like-minded people that think the government has gone too far beyond its power, myself being one of them. So that you think there are a lot of people that would wear an anti-US symbol when there is not nearly enough to have a legitimate revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. I am already inspired. Every day... More specifically every day of the last two years... Everyone I have started talking too about our Big Uncle (Sam) has been in harmony with my feelings of anguish. </p>

<p>a coaster billions of souls long approaches it&#39;s peak, bound to the tracks some Foul Engineer has designed </p>

<p>Generations are born and die, ignorant of their trajectories.</p>

<p>Some of us in front hang in terror, with a glimpse of the terrible drop</p>

<p>How many millions will be sent down before the back of the train even realizes we approach the descent? </p>

<p>I dreamt that maybe we could all exit onto the emergency stairs in a nice peaceful single file line, making our way slowly to the platitudes man walked before lightbulbs or refrigeration... And bringing our most cherished possessions with us. </p>

<p>It became a nightmare. The stairs became a ladder. People were pushed, and shoved, a river of humanity, heaving and waving and splashing, to where the yawning abyss accepted any spill. The drone of the screaming and falling rises until, precious few remain on the ladder, clinging to the memories of the coaster and it&#39;s cargo as the best of his life while they make slowly for safety. </p>

<p>But that wasn&#39;t the nightmare. The nightmare was the creature whose mouth stood open, greedily ingesting a never ending wave of human souls at the bottom end of the Coaster.</p>

<p>Ours could be the generation that refuses to see our children born into slavery. My heart tells me you are right, and that what we need is a symbol of our unity and resolve. </p>

<p>Many many many of us feel that the mask of guy faux, aka V for Vendetta, sums up that struggle. V fought so valiantly against all of the corruption and vile that haunted his world, but in ours far too many associations and affiliations haunt the mask anon hides behind  (brought to you by Warner Bros)</p>

<p>Part of me worries that any symbol could be subjected to corruption from media, or retribution, or making us stand out as targets for whatever grim machine struggles to keep us divided and sleeping. </p>

<p>I am reminded spontaneously of the mocking jay in hunger games. The real drama of her reclaiming her life from the agencies who find her disposable... I suppose that is something very real in our society today. And with the third movie right around the corner, We could anticipate it and use it to our advantage.</p>

<p>(As I cackle at the irony) Hollywood is supposed to keep us asleep right? 
What if simultaneously at hundreds (thousands?) of movie theaters,real patriots stood up in movie theaters across the country (the world?) and passed out mocking jay pins to symbolize our distaste for our fascism and yada yada. Who knows what could happen. You could just happen to like hunger games a lot... Or you could be a revolutionary who thinks that&#39;s it&#39;s about time we START RESISTING EN MASSE</p>

<p>As my mind races with ideas, I thank all in this thread for the stimulation and I hope I have returned the favor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the people would do it with as minimal violence as possible. But you have to consider, the federal government&#39;s modus operandi is inflaming public tensions and igniting civil unrest and outright civil war anywhere it benefits them. Unlimited cash, weapons, and media propaganda. It wouldn&#39;t matter if the majority of people were doing things that were beneficial, cautious and in keeping with maintaining the actual safety and security of fellow citizens. All the gov would have to do is call one of their deranged kill teams and set up a mass-murder somewhere, pump it up and inflate it, and do this day in and day out until no one trusted anyone anymore. Half the fucking violence in Iraq was stoked by CIA meddling and interference and outright attacks on the right people at the right time that would elicit the preferred response as wanted by them.</p>

<p>TLDR: bloody and terrible, not as a result of the will of the people, but because of desperate and violent meddling by the real enemy of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Georgia: On April 1, 2009, the Georgia State Senate passed a resolution 43-1 that asserted the right of states to nullify federal laws under some circumstances. The resolution also asserted that if Congress, the president, or the federal judiciary took certain steps, such as establishing martial law without state consent, requiring some types of involuntary servitude, taking any action regarding religion or restricting freedom of political speech, or establishing further prohibitions of types or quantities of firearms or ammunition, the constitution establishing the United States government would be considered nullified and the union would be dissolved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s one reason why a revolution probably wont happen in the United States. It is true there are millions of American&#39;s who see through the bullshit and are not sheeple anymore. The key to keeping Americans subdued is to keep them fat and happy, and thats what we are. Now if you throw into the equation angry and HUNGRY, then you have bloodshed. But as long as we have 1 dollar burgers, there will be no formal revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re in the last stage of the subversion conspiracy against the United States when we have a chance to turn things around without a violent revolution. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gnpCqsXE8g">Watch this video about Soviet subversion techniques.</a></p>

<p>Bear in mind that it is not the Russians who have subverted the US, however -- it is the wealthy elite class within the US, made up largely of wealthy Zionist Jews and their puppets.</p>

<p>A revolution can only be avoided with strong action. The elite pulling the strings must be deprived of their power. As long as the people are unwilling to do this, we have no hope of avoiding a violent revolution.</p>

<p>And there is no sign that the general population has awakened sufficiently to be willing to take strong action against the elite. As yet, they are not even willing to put a <em>name</em> on the elite. So a revolution seems inevitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>3D printing is going to play a major role. As technology improves, more and more things will be 3D printable. Big corporations like Wal-Mart will suffer because instead of buying your kid the latest toy for Christmas, you just print it off at home or the nearest 3D print shop; which I think will start popping up everywhere, giving a lot of people jobs. You could buy a 3D printer and stay at home printing things all day to sell to people in your city or around the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say Iceland had a soft revolution. No violence, except for the banging of pots and pans. </p>

<p>We could do the same here, and possibly will, but I can&#39;t comprehend after the events of the last 13 years what it would take for people to actually protest to the point that everything stops and the media can not ignore it, the politicians are deathly afraid of it, and law enforcement is powerless to stop it. </p>

<p>What would that take? 2 million people marching on DC? 5 million? 10? That&#39;s not inconceivable in a country of 350 million people. </p>

Also I think we&#39;re about to have a repeat of the Great Depression. I think that the 4 regions will band up against each other at first and then resolve issues and come together to fight the government and their selfish ways </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. It is easy to surround yourself with like-minded individuals these days. Even those in the surveillance industry are so surrounded by same thinking people that they think what they are doing is purely for the good of the country. In the same way, I think you are also surrounded by like-minded people that think the government has gone too far beyond its power, myself being one of them. So that you think there are a lot of people that would wear an anti-US symbol when there is not nearly enough to have a legitimate revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like considering that one event a &quot;revolution&quot; is oversimplifying a much more complex system of power/influence that has been manifesting over several decades (if not longer) and remains ongoing to this day. So, in my mind, it&#39;s much more of an evolution than revolution...with events like 9/11 being seized upon to further that cause in any and every way possible.</p>

<p>Similarly, I see our &quot;revolution&quot; as a gradual shift in consciousness through technology/education/communication...a gradual push towards greater transparency and accountability via the free flow of information. I&#39;m generally very cynical in my view of the way society operates, but I&#39;m very optimistic about its technological future in the hands of future, more open-minded generations.</p>
