        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">38</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-12-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/n0xin.html">n0xin</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While interviewing David Keith regarding his book &quot;A Case for Climate Engineering&quot; on December 9th, 2013, Stephen Colbert mentions chemtrails in a serious manner. The interview centers around a concept in Keith&#39;s book where he suggests we might consider releasing tonnes of sulfuric acid vapor into the stratosphere from commercial jets in an attempt at geoengineering.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Colbert:</strong> &quot;Maybe it&#39;s happening already. You ever look at those planes up there? They have contrails behind them. Maybe all those planes with contrails; maybe they&#39;re actually spraying chemicals up in the atmosphere right now and Uncle Sam isn&#39;t telling us.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Keith:</strong> &quot;That seems extremely unlikelyâ€¦&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Colbert:</strong> &quot;That the United States is not telling something to its citizens? That seems extremely likely to me. Read a newspaper. I think they might have your idea already.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s how the interview ends. No sarcastic last word. Just that.</p>

<p>I will edit this to link to the clip when it becomes available on colbertnation.com.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/431083/december-09-2013/david-keith">Link to clip on colbertnation.com</a>. Scroll to 5:45 for the relevant section.</p>

<p>And for everyone who&#39;s saying that Colbert is just being Colbert, I understand your point of view. At the very least, it&#39;s interesting that chemtrails are being mentioned on such a popular show. Very probably this might have been the first time a lot of the people in the audience had even heard of the idea. People can make up their own minds after reviewing the material for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed there have been many tests. I don&#39;t really have any opinion on them, but I can say that most of the &quot;chemtrail&quot; guys are looking in the wrong areas for toxicity concerns.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=1076&amp;amp;tid=34">1 antacid tablet contains about 100-200 milligrams of aluminum. That is a shitload of aluminum.</a> Also baking soda, and thus many baked goods, contains aluminum as an ingredient. I personally avoid aluminum, and I would never under any circumstances consume an antacid tablet. </li>
</ul>

<p>Then you have worries that they might be chemically spraying us. Well, what about your food? I&#39;ll spare everyone the cryolite fluoride issue this time because I know it&#39;s getting old, but we can talk about other forms of pesticide: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110526152555.htm">High Risk of Parkinson&#39;s Disease for People Exposed to Pesticides Near Workplace</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-pesticides-can-cause-parkinsons">Benomyl causes parkinsons</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>So those are verified cases of aerial spraying of toxic substances. If you want to call those &quot;chemtrails,&quot; go ahead. That is basically what everyone is afraid of, correct?</p>

<p>Additionally, how many of these people paranoid of aluminum being sprayed eat an antacid every day? We should first tell them to stop eating the antacid, then they can worry about geoengineering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because its not really that they are spraying additional chemicals, its in the fuel mix. </p>

<p>I think they might be spraying through the fuel mix, I mean they stage all sort of false flag operations, they spy on everybody without any accountability, they wage unconstitutional wars, they drone innocent children and blow up weddings, CIA uses domestic propaganda even though they are strictly forbid from doing so, Medeline Albright said that half a million dead children in Iraq is worth it, they sprayed agent orange, they have set up the TSA and are constantly expanding into random check points, you name it. If its bad, evil, terrible enough they are doing it.</p>

<p>So just by the fact that they are absolute liars, that they are already engaged in all sort of criminal activity, this is proof enough for me that they probably are spraying certain chemicals in the sky.</p>
