       While interviewing David Keith regarding his book "A Case for Climate Engineering" on December 9th, 2013, Stephen Colbert mentions chemtrails in a serious manner. The interview centers around a concept in Keith's book where he suggests we might consider releasing tonnes of sulfuric acid vapor into the stratosphere from commercial jets in an attempt at geoengineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Colbert:
        </strong>
        "Maybe it's happening already. You ever look at those planes up there? They have contrails behind them. Maybe all those planes with contrails; maybe they're actually spraying chemicals up in the atmosphere right now and Uncle Sam isn't telling us."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Keith:
        </strong>
        "That seems extremely unlikelyâ€¦"
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Colbert:
        </strong>
        "That the United States is not telling something to its citizens? That seems extremely likely to me. Read a newspaper. I think they might have your idea already."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And that's how the interview ends. No sarcastic last word. Just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will edit this to link to the clip when it becomes available on colbertnation.com.

       And for everyone who's saying that Colbert is just being Colbert, I understand your point of view. At the very least, it's interesting that chemtrails are being mentioned on such a popular show. Very probably this might have been the first time a lot of the people in the audience had even heard of the idea. People can make up their own minds after reviewing the material for themselves.

       It seems to me chemicals in the air would be extremely easy to detect. If chemtrails were true no doubt someone, somewhere would have done some tests by now.

       Indeed there have been many tests. I don't really have any opinion on them, but I can say that most of the "chemtrail" guys are looking in the wrong areas for toxicity concerns.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=1076&amp;amp;tid=34">
         1 antacid tablet contains about 100-200 milligrams of aluminum. That is a shitload of aluminum.
        </a>
        Also baking soda, and thus many baked goods, contains aluminum as an ingredient. I personally avoid aluminum, and I would never under any circumstances consume an antacid tablet.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Then you have worries that they might be chemically spraying us. Well, what about your food? I'll spare everyone the cryolite fluoride issue this time because I know it's getting old, but we can talk about other forms of pesticide:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110526152555.htm">
          High Risk of Parkinson's Disease for People Exposed to Pesticides Near Workplace
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-pesticides-can-cause-parkinsons">
          Benomyl causes parkinsons
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So those are verified cases of aerial spraying of toxic substances. If you want to call those "chemtrails," go ahead. That is basically what everyone is afraid of, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, how many of these people paranoid of aluminum being sprayed eat an antacid every day? We should first tell them to stop eating the antacid, then they can worry about geoengineering.

       I'm more afraid a greedy corrupt incompetent government will kill the planet trying to play God. They will outsource the work to the lowest bidder. And execution will end up like the obamacare website. And bam, earth is dead for a couple thousand years.

       I completely agree with you, but some perspective on this issue would be nice. Maybe attempting to define "chemtrail" in a more precise manner and using another phrase to describe this issue. Also including these links in the debate would be nice:

       I predict the one comment with relevant information proving chemtrails are real will be the most downvoted. As usual.

       Because its not really that they are spraying additional chemicals, its in the fuel mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they might be spraying through the fuel mix, I mean they stage all sort of false flag operations, they spy on everybody without any accountability, they wage unconstitutional wars, they drone innocent children and blow up weddings, CIA uses domestic propaganda even though they are strictly forbid from doing so, Medeline Albright said that half a million dead children in Iraq is worth it, they sprayed agent orange, they have set up the TSA and are constantly expanding into random check points, you name it. If its bad, evil, terrible enough they are doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So just by the fact that they are absolute liars, that they are already engaged in all sort of criminal activity, this is proof enough for me that they probably are spraying certain chemicals in the sky.

       Exactly! It's always curious to me when someone understands the horrible atrocities our government has committed and the covert operations its participated in (and admitted to!) and yet can't seem to believe that the government would "do that to us" when it comes to chemtrails. It's kind of like - well, duh, of course they would.

       Indeed there have been many tests. I don't really have any opinion on them, but I can say that most of the "chemtrail" guys are looking in the wrong areas for toxicity concerns.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=1076&amp;amp;tid=34">
         1 antacid tablet contains about 100-200 milligrams of aluminum. That is a shitload of aluminum.
        </a>
        Also baking soda, and thus many baked goods, contains aluminum as an ingredient. I personally avoid aluminum, and I would never under any circumstances consume an antacid tablet.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Then you have worries that they might be chemically spraying us. Well, what about your food? I'll spare everyone the cryolite fluoride issue this time because I know it's getting old, but we can talk about other forms of pesticide:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110526152555.htm">
          High Risk of Parkinson's Disease for People Exposed to Pesticides Near Workplace
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-pesticides-can-cause-parkinsons">
          Benomyl causes parkinsons
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So those are verified cases of aerial spraying of toxic substances. If you want to call those "chemtrails," go ahead. That is basically what everyone is afraid of, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, how many of these people paranoid of aluminum being sprayed eat an antacid every day? We should first tell them to stop eating the antacid, then they can worry about geoengineering.
