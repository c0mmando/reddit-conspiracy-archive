<p>What? Every matter in the universe (the hell does this even mean?) has a tunnel through spacetime associated with it? Thats what a wormhole is. A theoretical tunnel through spacetime. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume, based on your confusion and the fact that you mentioned an increase as you approach c, that what you actually are trying to reference is time dilation being associated with everything that has mass. Which has nothing to do with your claim that a comet tunneled to another dimension and back. </p>

<p>We thought the sun destroyed the comet. We lost it. Later, we realized that the sun only <em>damaged</em> the comet, and we found it again. This doesn&#39;t mean that it ceased to exist in our dimension while we were looking for it. </p>

<p>you can&#39;t use maths in our dimension to describe itself.  that&#39;s a violation of godel&#39;s theorem.</p>

<p>So no answer on how wormhole theory and wave/particle duality theory make a baby that might explain why you think the comet traveled to another dimension?</p>

<p>Cool. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh. So you don&#39;t know. But you have some math to work on so thats something! It probably means that the comet <em>did</em> visit another dimension. I hope its bringing those hotdogs that are roasted on the sun from that other dimension where they roast hotdogs on the sun.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Does this mean that when I can no longer observe a planet, it is probable that it ceases to exist? I can send my daughter to school perfectly healthy, but she can return to my observation with a skinned knee. She must have tunneled to another dimension when I wasn&#39;t looking, and <em>now</em> look at her all scuffed up! Damn wormholes. </p>

Well it&#39;s 2pm EST, still waiting on the apocalypse. And no, you get fucked, seriously. This stupid bullshit is why most people think this sub is retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comet Ison was just another comet. </p>

<p>There are literately trillions of its brothers and sisters out there. </p>

<p>Some people, including some who probably post to this subreddit, often live their lives promoting the next doomsday. When they never come to pass they push the date back, call you a fool or troll or idiot sheep for not believing them, and find a new doomsday to promote. </p>

<p>None of them have been right, uh, well, ever. </p>

<p>Does that mean that the end will not one day come? No! I am sure many of us feel that sense that something is not right, that something wicked is coming.</p>

<p>A false internet prophet telling you what it will be is just an illusionist distracting you from the things you should really be worried about. But you are only a member of their audience so long as you allow yourself to be. </p>

<p>Accept that others on the internet do not have some special inside source that you don&#39;t, and accept that if they tell you of a coming apocalypse its because they have been fooled or are trying to fool you.</p>

<p>Not that the apocalypse is not coming.</p>

<p>All things end.</p>

<p>And the sense that the end is near is something a lot of us feel. That pressure at the back of your mind. That sense that danger lurks just outside the light. Its probably why we see the massive surge in the prepper and doomsday crowd. Other people feel it and come to places like these seeking answers.</p>

<p>No one has the answers.</p>

<p>Comet Ison is not the apocalypse or a space ship.</p>

<p>The next comet wont be either.</p>

<p>Or probably the one after that. </p>

<p>Not that there are not space ships or aliens out there. There may be. I don&#39;t pretend to know, one way or another. I do know that other folks here or on forums like this about the internet don&#39;t know either, despite what they might tell you, or themselves. </p>

<p>When the end comes it will be sudden, I think, and not predicted by some internet prophets and pocket illusionists. </p>

<p>yes, though smaller slower objects it&#39;s very slight - mainly due to the de broglie wavelength.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>, that what you actually are trying to reference is time dilation being associated with everything that has mass</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s an oversimplification - that&#39;s why I said General relativity, not special relativity.  </p>

<p>And then we said, &quot;No. Wait. There it is. Nevermind.&quot;</p>

<p>so now you concede it reappeared.. are you trolling me?</p>
