       It seemed to have been destroyed by the sun and we lost it. Then it suprised us by
       <em>
        not

       being destroyed, but was damaged enough that it is a mere ghost of itself.

       don't pretend like you know all about wormhole physics.  metastable states can form at sub light speed, it depends on the space-time vortex gradient created by the head-wake of the comet - governed by its density.  tell me you know what the density of the comet was?

       Are you just throwing words around? Metastable states sound cool but are actually quite mundane. Boiling water or supercooled water, for example.

       I would love to know what source you have that says the comet punched a momentary wormhole to another dimension and then came back because it was traveling at a fraction of c.

       The comet wormhole at fractional c is derived from first principles using general relativity.  There's no source, that's the way it is.  Don't like it?  Go somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every matter in the universe has a wormhole associated with it.  General relativity prescribes that the wormhole effect increases as you approach c.    along the way there are resonant states.  the comet disappeared from instruments momentarily and was pronounced dead.

       What? Every matter in the universe (the hell does this even mean?) has a tunnel through spacetime associated with it? Thats what a wormhole is. A theoretical tunnel through spacetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to assume, based on your confusion and the fact that you mentioned an increase as you approach c, that what you actually are trying to reference is time dilation being associated with everything that has mass. Which has nothing to do with your claim that a comet tunneled to another dimension and back.

       We thought the sun destroyed the comet. We lost it. Later, we realized that the sun only
       <em>
        damaged
       </em>
       the comet, and we found it again. This doesn't mean that it ceased to exist in our dimension while we were looking for it.

       Oh. So you don't know. But you have some math to work on so thats something! It probably means that the comet

       Does this mean that when I can no longer observe a planet, it is probable that it ceases to exist? I can send my daughter to school perfectly healthy, but she can return to my observation with a skinned knee. She must have tunneled to another dimension when I wasn't looking, and
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       look at her all scuffed up! Damn wormholes.

       This is why we lost track of it and have only been able to catch the "ghost" remnants of the comet. This is what I said.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here you say it visually blinked out of existance. Were you maybe saying that it was simply not being picked up by our instruments? Perhaps. But you then go on to ask what it brought back from another dimension, so you clearly meant that it ceased to exist in our dimension.

       You declared an assumption (that the comet left our dimension (by way of wildly goofy science)) and based your question on that. I pointed that out.

       Comet Ison was just another comet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are literately trillions of its brothers and sisters out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people, including some who probably post to this subreddit, often live their lives promoting the next doomsday. When they never come to pass they push the date back, call you a fool or troll or idiot sheep for not believing them, and find a new doomsday to promote.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of them have been right, uh, well, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that mean that the end will not one day come? No! I am sure many of us feel that sense that something is not right, that something wicked is coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       A false internet prophet telling you what it will be is just an illusionist distracting you from the things you should really be worried about. But you are only a member of their audience so long as you allow yourself to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accept that others on the internet do not have some special inside source that you don't, and accept that if they tell you of a coming apocalypse its because they have been fooled or are trying to fool you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that the apocalypse is not coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       All things end.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the sense that the end is near is something a lot of us feel. That pressure at the back of your mind. That sense that danger lurks just outside the light. Its probably why we see the massive surge in the prepper and doomsday crowd. Other people feel it and come to places like these seeking answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has the answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comet Ison is not the apocalypse or a space ship.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next comet wont be either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or probably the one after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that there are not space ships or aliens out there. There may be. I don't pretend to know, one way or another. I do know that other folks here or on forums like this about the internet don't know either, despite what they might tell you, or themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the end comes it will be sudden, I think, and not predicted by some internet prophets and pocket illusionists.
