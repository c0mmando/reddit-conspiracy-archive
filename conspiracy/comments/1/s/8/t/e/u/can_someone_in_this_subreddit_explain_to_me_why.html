        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I can think of many benefits and downsides to a universal currency, but none of those can really explain the extreme hatred I have seen for the idea here.</p>

<p>Positives:</p>

<ul>
<li>More convenient if the same money can work anywhere.</li>
<li>Exchange rates between currencies are no longer a thing, easier to perform international business.</li>
<li>Regional economic problems can be cushioned by the weight of the entire global economy</li>
<li>Experienced management from existing developing countries will mean that undeveloped countries can no longer fuck themselves over economically if an idiot dictator decides to print ridiculous quantities of money (Zimbabwe)</li>
</ul>

<p>Negatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less culturally diverse maybe?</li>
<li>An exceptionally large regional economic problem would affect everyone.</li>
<li>More difficult to customize economic policy on a regional level.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, among these negatives and positives it really seems to be quite a close call. What causes this subreddit to be so against the idea?</p>

<p>You must be new here. Power corrupts. The more power, the more corrupt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Universal currency doesn&#39;t imply that few people be given power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currencies are currently controlled by numerous nations, and different people in those nations, each with differing, sometimes opposed agendas. This reduces the likelihood of <em>all</em> of them getting together to do something stupid or nefarious to near zero.</p>

<p>If there were one currency, it would be controlled by one entity, few people, one agenda. This increases the likelihood of <em>all</em> of them getting together to do something stupid or nefarious at some point to near certainty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Universal currency doesn&#39;t even imply that people be given any power at all if some form of regulatory automation is created, such as &quot;If X happens we will always do Y&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, because the people who control currencies have the every-man&#39;s best interests in mind. /eyeroll</p>

<p>You might consider reading more about the economic system. Let&#39;s use Detroit as an example:</p>

<p>1: The wealthy loan a bunch of money out</p>

<p>2: The city fucks it all up and can&#39;t repay its debts</p>

<p>3: The city is forced by the lenders into bankruptcy</p>

<p>4: The city fucks the everyman by reducing pensions / retirement to 20% of promised value</p>

<p>5: The city sells off priceless pieces of art in its museum... to wealthy people who are the only people who can afford them</p>

<p>6: The city takes all the money it got from its art sell-off and repays the loans the wealthy gave them</p>

<p>What&#39;s the net?</p>

<p>1: &quot;Every-man&quot; is fucked - getting 20% of what they should have</p>

<p>2: Wealthy lenders break even-ish on loans</p>

<p>3: Wealthy lenders get free artwork they can admire in their homes or sell for profit</p>

<p>That&#39;s simplified, of course. But yeah, you should read more about how financial systems actually work. It&#39; isn&#39;t Utopia. It&#39;s designed to fuck everyone who&#39;s not in control of the financial system, basically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have automatically assumed that it will be used for evil. Sorry to have to say this, but the cartoon style evil super villains of the monetary system just don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Everyone from individuals to small companies to the largest companies have a reason to support their own monetary system, hence why the typical compromise tends to be whatever system screws people over the least.</p>

<p>It would be extremely easy to declare a monetary system that fucks everyone not in control of it. &quot;Everyone gives me 100% of their money per day&quot; would be the obvious example. Unsurprisingly, no country that exists has done that because it&#39;s more profitable for everyone to put exchanges on an even level to allow growth. Why would scaling this up to the world suddenly cause everyone to act like a fuckwad?</p>

What happens when regions crash and blame the system. How do you not see this as an oppression that would create war? Think of the Russian oligarchs, Cambodia, or the rulers at the fall of any empire, or fascist regime. Pick up a history book. How would you check the balance of the system in a post-modern democratic society? Look at where we are now in America, with the system becoming corrupt as the system we placed to protect us against mob rule becomes infiltrated with bought out politicians. Now it is spread out, nothing is done and no one takes accountability. Also the economics of your system don&#39;t quite work, you are aware of how foreign currencies and markets play off each other right? What would be the financial backing of this currency? Gold? Pussy? Wait, maybe just power, give a little more power as currency now because money is becoming more and more meaningless..? Cough cough, Legion of Doom. Cough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is a single currency, only the big shots that hold the majorities of the currency can call the shots. Nations would no longer control their own monetary policy.</p>

<p>Say that there is an up and coming country like Brazil. They decide that by printing up a bunch of their own money and getting it into circulation, they could lend more money to start their own small businesses. The Brazilian banks would decide how much Brazilian money is in circulation and so they have control over their economy. This is exactly what America does with the dollar.</p>

<p>But if there is a single currency for the whole world, it won&#39;t be Brazil deciding what&#39;s best for Brazil. Whoever will be lending Brazil money will be deciding what happens there. The whole point of a &quot;One World Currency&quot; and a &quot;One World Government&quot; is control. No longer is Brazil a single sovereign nation that you have to treat like a neighbor. Brazil is now debtor to you who owes you money. And if they don&#39;t pay up, they lose their line of credit and their property is yours now.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what&#39;s terrifying about Bitcoins. That&#39;s what&#39;s terrifying about the Trans Pacific Pact. That&#39;s what&#39;s terrifying about The Fed. They use debt as weapons to make you a slave. People aren&#39;t neighbors, they&#39;re capital gains.</p>

<p>Yes. That&#39;s one of the legitimate reasons that you would use a Private Bank instead of the Treasury. But you haven&#39;t answered about the creation of money. Since we are off the Gold Standard, what do you think backs our currency and gives it value?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Yes, exactly. It&#39;s the private property of all of the taxpayers. So think about this. The government says, &quot;the economy is looking sluggish, what should we do?&quot;. The Fed says, &quot;You need 1000 more dollars in your economy.&quot; &quot;Ok. Sounds great!&quot; (Quantitative Easing, TARP, etc.)</p>

<p>So the Treasury creates a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurynote.asp">Treasury Note</a> for $1000 at 10% interest. The Fed &quot;buys&quot; that Note by printing up $1000 dollars and giving it to a bank. There is now 1000 new dollars in the economy but the taxpayer owes the Fed 1100. </p>

<p>Do you see what happened there? $1000 dollars was created but we now owe them $1100. Where will that extra $100 dollars come from that we owe them? The Fed will have to print it up again. So let&#39;s have them do it, but wait, we owe them 10% more again. WTF! See how it works? We will never be able to pay off the debt and we&#39;re not supposed to. And everyone knows this. </p>

<p>So that $17 Trillion dollars (which is actually probably astronomically higher) is money that the taxpayer owes to The Fed and the collateral on that debt is all of our private property (for printing up money when the Treasury could have done it for free). A private bank owns the Lions share of this entire country as collateral on debt. Starting to understand now? But this is just scratching the surface. Add Bearer Bonds into the mix and now we&#39;ve entered the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t just take my word for it on any of this though. Do your own research. Google all of this and see for yourself. Google &quot;Bearer Bonds Scandal&quot; and see what the hell is really going on. The dollar is about to collapse and all the private bankers are trying to figure out where to jump ship to. That&#39;s why Wall St. has started singing the praises of bitcoins. The moment you hear that private banks are lending bitcoins with interest is the moment you know bitcoins are a weapon they&#39;re using against you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh look, a shill for a book.</p>

<p>/s</p>

<p>I think you accidentally made a mistake in your wording, or maybe not? You say that the treasury created the note with interest but then the Fed received that note. Shouldn&#39;t this mean that the fed owes the treasury an extra $100 in this scenario?</p>

<p>Regardless, the US being in debt to itself really doesn&#39;t have a massive effect on the economy because it&#39;s well known that if the fed actually demanded that money back they would be given the metaphorical &quot;Shut the fuck up, you work for us&quot; by the government.</p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the point here though. You are talking about a business loan. That kind of debt is necessary to the economy and it really does help businesses. But The Fed isn&#39;t giving people business loans, they are creating money. That&#39;s what makes them different from other banks.</p>

<p>So when The Fed creates money, the taxpayer owes them debt for creating the money. THEN if you want a small business loan, you owe a separate bank debt on the loan. So there is debt to create money and that is a separate kind of debt than when you say &quot;people to do things now instead of doing things later when doing things now is more important.&quot;</p>

<p>Huh? I don&#39;t understand what this means? What&#39;s there to compare? If you can print your own money and decide your own policies, why would you use money that a Private bank will charge you interest on that you can never pay back?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will try and explain some reasons why its a bad idea:</p>

<p>1) Interest rates dont work in a one-size-fits-all fashion. If one countrys economy is booming, it will be needing higher interest rates. While another country whos economy is near recession would require lower interest rates. One compromised interest rate will not work for all countries involved. Thus, an organization would be needed to decide who gets what rate. This organization would be new and global.</p>

<p>2) similar to interest rates, taxes would need to be harmonized. Thus, another global organization wouod need to be created.</p>

<p>3) the economy of each member country would not be controlled by that country. they would accrue debt, but would be unable to use inflation to help it, as the control of the currencys value would be in the hands of, yet, another organisation that would have to be new and global.</p>

<p>4) who gets to issue this money? Yet, another organisation.</p>

<p>The list can go on, but im trying to make this simple. The acceptance of one world currency implies the acceptance of a one world organization that would be needed in various departments (i.e. dept. Of taxation, dept. of printing etc.,). Now, all of these organization need to be able to work together, in collusion, for this to work. This means one global government would be needed to control these organizations. Now, the problem is, ONE government to rule all this. Centralization. The problem then is that no one will be able to vote for these people. This is legislation without representation. </p>

<p>And when you have ONE government making legislation for ALL govenments, that is the same as having a shit ton of power in the hands of a very small group of people. Consolidation of power.</p>

<p>When you have consolidation of power, you have tyranny. </p>

<p>There is no way of having one global currency without a global government. </p>

<p>I would like to invite you to research the european union and the euro, reearch the good and bad that the euro has caused, and look and see what happens when you consolidate the sovereign rights of member states into a union of unelected officials. The member states lose their ability to govern themselves, while laws and regulations are pressed upon them, even though they never had a say on the legislation.</p>

<p>Id also research why some people are making arguments for competing currencies. </p>

<p>This is a complex issue, and on the face of it seems like a good idea. And when proponents speak of it, they will no doubt make it seem too good to be true. (I only have to bring up the affordable healthcare act to illustrate what im saying here...) But when you look into it deeper, you will find evidence that this is really, a bad idea.</p>
