<p>Proof: We would record the player at the computer and record with fraps what the player was doing. Part of my job was to timestamp everything. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AspJjDRXlqGfdE1HLU9XVXVzLXdNWlVrb1liMWNqbUE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=9">This is one of those documents</a></p>

<p>Edit* <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QXRPxWp.png">Here is an e-mail from the head researcher of the project to a local gaming shop to ask if we could run the research on the participants of a magic card tournament.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies, allow me to clarify.</p>

<p>We enticed potential research subjects with the prospect of being paid $10 for one hour of their time. Obviously in a university setting this is hard to pass up. The research subjects would come into our research lab within the university. They would log onto their WoW characters and play for an hour. We recorded everything. A camera on their face to capture their body movements, facial expressions, what have you. We had frapps running on their computer to capture their actual play session. We also had a keylogger running to capture their mouse strokes. While they played we would ask them questions about their play habits. Often times we would have them play Second Life or Multiverse (a game pretty much identical to second life that was created for this purpose alone). </p>

<p>Edit: imagine if a group of people are constantly meeting up on Halo to play capture the flag and no one ever frags anyone else. The game statistics just show they meet regularly in the game. You could call that suspicious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole reason I am doing this is because I feel bad about my compliance with this program. I was younger then and was not exactly question the motives of the CIA funding this program. The whole reason I was part of the research team was for a few reasons. 1) I was the cousin of one of the main researchers. 2) I was tech savvy. 3) I had extensive experience with WoW. </p>

<p>But allow me to clarify:</p>

<p>It was a completely voluntary program that took place in our research facility within the university. The subjects would come in, we would ask them questions, such as, what is your average play time, why did you choose x character to play, if they are a male and chose a female avatar, why? Nothing about this research was illegal in the way that we received our data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t been working on this research study since 2011, and am not sure if it is even still taking place. To me it was unclear what the exact motives of this research study was. I&#39;m sure the director of the research study was privy to just exactly what this data would be used for. As for me, and why I feel comfortable speaking out about this, is that I wasn&#39;t that high up, never signed any forms that said I couldn&#39;t talk about it, I just never mentioned it because my cousin was the assistant director of this study and she had told me not to say anything. This was back in 2010. Now I feel that I shouldn&#39;t remain silent anymore, not with everything that is happening.</p>

<p>It is 100% possible and very likely that this project was going on on a larger scale. As I stated elsewhere, SFU (San Fran University) was also a large player in this study, as well as, (I believe) a University in BC and McGill in Montreal.</p>
