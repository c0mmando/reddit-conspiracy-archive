<li><p>The flight was to Beijing so it would have had enough fuel to reach North Korea (considering it must carry enough fuel for an alternate airport + emergency reserves): <a href="https://twitter.com/CAKarateDog/status/442866351686705152/photo/1">https://twitter.com/CAKarateDog/status/442866351686705152/photo/1</a></p></li>
<li><p>The plane is shown turning north-east (the direction of North Korea) just before disappearing: <a href="http://www.flightradar24.com/2014-03-07/17:20/12x/MAS370/2d81a27">http://www.flightradar24.com/2014-03-07/17:20/12x/MAS370/2d81a27</a></p></li>
<li><p>North Korea has previously hijacked an airliner and taken its passengers hostage: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_YS-11_hijacking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_YS-11_hijacking</a></p></li>
<li><p>It took just 1 day to find wreckage of Air France flight 447 in the Atlantic Ocean: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447#Search_and_recovery">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447#Search_and_recovery</a> it&#39;s been 3 days and not one single <em>confirmed</em> piece of the plane has been found.</p></li>
<li><p>Several relatives have claimed passengers phones would ring when called, shortly after the disappearance. At least one case is caught on video (I don&#39;t have a link). North Korea is one of the few places in the world with total government control over mobile networks, but you can get sketchy Chinese mobile reception near the border.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;typical air traffic radars have effective ranges of up to 180 nautical miles&quot; <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/platform/blogs/onboard/radar-and-air-traffic-control">https://www.open.ac.uk/platform/blogs/onboard/radar-and-air-traffic-control</a>, almost possible to fly from the last known location to North Korea, over water, staying at least 180nm from any coast. Where this isn&#39;t possible, the plane could fly at a lower altitude for a short amount of time</p></li>
<li><p>Authorities couldn&#39;t track the hijacked airliners on 9/11 for <em>at least part of their journey</em> and this was directly over the US, not at sea: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._military_response_during_the_September_11_attacks#Radar_tracking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._military_response_during_the_September_11_attacks#Radar_tracking</a>, it just goes to show radar is not a magic all-seeing eye that can&#39;t be escaped.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If North Korea did want to hijack an airliner it would be best-off choosing flights farther away to avoid arousing suspicion. It was a long-haul flight. The perfect place to perform the hijack would be over the sea soon after takeoff (where it was last seen). This would ensure a clean getaway with minimal radar coverage and no country chasing after you.</p>

<p>The North Korean government is bat shit crazy. There&#39;s no telling what crazy logic they might have for taking a plane. They literally have no grasp of reality and have been caught red handed kidnapping foreigners, making shit up and generally being douches.</p>

<p>North Korea has supposedly friendly relations with Malaysia including relaxed visa regulations. This might make it easier for North Koreans to freely plan and execute an operation from Malaysia.</p>

<p>What would you do with an airliner? Previously they&#39;ve used kidnapped civilians as bargaining tools. You could even feasibly imagine them putting a nuclear weapon on the plane and sending it on a suicide mission to another country.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> a new debris field has been spotted but this is <em>not yet confirmed</em> as coming from MH370 or even from an aircraft. <strong>Correction:</strong> confirmed as not from the plane.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> the oil slick is confirmed as <em>not</em> from the plane: <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1445057/missing-malaysia-airlines-flight-likely-have-disintegrated-35000-feet">http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1445057/missing-malaysia-airlines-flight-likely-have-disintegrated-35000-feet</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> since the illegal passengers were probably Iranian I don&#39;t think they would be relevant to a North Korean plot.</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:</strong> The WSJ cites anonymous sources claiming that data transmitted from the engines show the plane continuing for several hours. Based on their estimates it could have reached Pakistan (or North Korea by that measure) <a href="http://m.europe.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304914904579434653903086282?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories&amp;mobile=y">http://m.europe.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304914904579434653903086282?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories&amp;mobile=y</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think &#39;allied&#39; is too strong a term. The relationship between the two countries resembles that of two brothers, fathered by a serial killer(mao). China is the older, financially secure brother. NK is the younger, spoilt, drug addict that keeps attempting suicide. NK is most certainly not welcome in China&#39;s house, but China feels somewhat responsible for his little bro. China is giving NK a little bit of money to help him get back on his feet, but not enough to go on another bender. China is too loyal to dis NK in public, but his patience is almost up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Chinese will always support NK for two main reasons.</p>

<p>1 - If the NK regime fell, the populous would panic, they&#39;ve been brainwashed to believe that the armies of the south will exact a great vengeance upon them, the Chinese border will be instantly engulfed by millions of unskilled poor refugees.</p>

<p>2 - NK actually has a fuck ton of rare earth minerals, some reports put it at two thirds of the planets supply, china needs this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ain&#39;t saying they did, just running with the idea.  No, they&#39;d sell the tech to China (as compensation).  I&#39;m just making this up.  FWIW, it could have been diverted by somebody other than NK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the worst way to get the tech that I can think of. China would be better off just stealing it themselves. Again, North Korea giving China the tech still wouldn&#39;t make up for all the countries they&#39;s piss off (China, Malaysia, the US). All in all, it&#39;s not worth it for North Korea to try this, which probably means they didn&#39;t do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really an expert on what NK thinks is irrational, but they&#39;ve been pissing off everybody for decades with random missile launches, pirate raids, etc.  Also, wouldn&#39;t have to be NK... corporate espionage is a sick and funky business.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t think this is what happened, but second-guessing a motive doesn&#39;t really work well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue with the theory, is that it requires NK to have a <em>really</em> good motive to risk the possible effects. With the other things they do, it&#39;s more of a show of force (military drills, missile launches, nuclear tests, etc...). It would make more sense for China to have been behind it then NK, but even then, they could&#39;t risk the reactions from the US since they are huge trading partners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, motive is missing from my theory which was why I posted here (I don&#39;t know if there are any other subreddits for crazy half baked conspiracy theories). My ideas so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ~20 employees of some tech company that were on the flight were of interest</li>
<li>The plane itself was of interest (North Korea can&#39;t buy anything)</li>
<li>A suicide delivery plane for a nuclear weapon</li>
<li>A test for an even bigger hijack </li>

    <div class="md"><p>The tech company is the most likely reason, but even then, the risks far outweigh the benefits. Also, it&#39;s almost certainly not a nuke. If they use a nuke, they will be annihilated by every other nuclear state in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Due to a few reasons. Firstly, there are only so many sates that have nuclear weapons, and so that narrows it to those countries, and possibly groups working with them. Also, you don&#39;t cause a nuclear attack and then not claim responsibility, that takes away the point of the attack in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And North Korea is rational how? These people trust no-one and have no allies. China tolerates North Korea and North Korea relies on China for some aid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why do it in the first place? They gain nothing out of it. And again, they need the aid, so pissing of China is a terrible idea (it&#39;s the equivalent of South Korea pissing of the US).</p>

But the best part is, it wouldn&#39;t need to fly low the whole way - it would just need to get out of radar coverage and then it could climb back up and ships wouldn&#39;t even hear it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely not. The point would be to do this without anyone realising it was NK - otherwise they could capture a plane closer to their coast line. This flight was sufficiently far away enough that no one would have a reason to suspect North Korea.</p>

<p>Can a plane disappear? Hell yes. Once you turn off the transponder (and maybe some airline specific equipment) the plane turns into a dot on the radar. If you fly low enough then you disappear off the radar altogether.</p>

<p>On top of that, radar only goes so far out to sea, and if you move from one radar station to another as just a dot it would be perfectly reasonable to lose you amongst other traffic.</p>

<p>The plane could get to North Korea flying only over the sea and staying away from Taiwan and co.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check the map. You can get to North Korea flying only over water and far enough from the shores of those counties. The plane had enough fuel to reach Beijing + the additional fuel it must carry to reach its alternate airport + an emergency reserve.</p>

<p>To steal the plane you simply descend below radar coverage and turn off the transponder and any other airline maintenance equipment. Then you can climb back up a bit later and you&#39;ll be lost in the clutter to other radar stations along the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly if they turned off the transponder then ATC would still SEE them! there would be no mystery at all. I dont think you understand how radar works. Its not like they have a whole bunch of unidentified radar signatures on the scope, they would see it change from Mode-s reporting to just the aircraft and no numbers. You could not dive in a minute. The aircraft is not capable of descending 35,000ft per minute. The plane would rip apart. </p>
