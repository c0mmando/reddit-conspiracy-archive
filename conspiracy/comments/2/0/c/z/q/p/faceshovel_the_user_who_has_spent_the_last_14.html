       I just want to point out that there's a possibility that things can work in reverse. People have been known to create accounts specifically to submit comments that are easily debunked by another account or comments that make the community look bad.

       If you want to sway opinion it's easy to argue with yourself while adhering to your own talking points...

       He's been asked multiple times and hasn't responded. He only continues with his argument that since we can't prove the emails are fake, they must be true. Disregarding the fact that headers don't PROVE or DISPROVE an email. I'm not even saying they're fake, I'm merely saying they could be, yet he keeps going and going and going saying they ARE authentic, with no proof. Then someone else pointed out that his account was made right when the Ukrainian crisis started. Yet nobody is questioning anything.

       I can assure you, there was no witch hunt, there was no group of people waiting to downvote you, the simple fact that you said something as stupid as bringing up votes, or brigades leads to being downvoted by normal people like me.  Its a self fulfilling prophecy for both sides, the ultra conspiricy dudes, and the anti-conspiricy dudes.

       That seems a little unfair. I brought nobody over here. I made no brigade posts. Why does my thread get pulled when it actually has a good point? Many many other people in this community have taken an issue with faceshovels behavior and find his circular logic to be odd at best and straight trolling at worst. I'm submitting mod messages about all the community members here who have personally attacked me.

       And his behavior. He's acting crazier than the conspiratard who trolled this sub just a couple days ago. His logic is so bad that he must be trolling. The fact that he refuses to listen to ANYONE and keeps repeating himself over and over is another weird behavior. The date of his account creation is just one of the many weird things about him. But again, you can believe what you want. Read his posts, read his logic, make your own conclusions.

       It can sound like attacking to you, it doesn't to me. I told you my evidence. You can agree with it or not. It's not my issue whether you personally, out of this whole community, believes it. I just wanted the issue brought up since he was the main distributor of that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want me to link to multiple accounts where he was given solid information on whether emails were valid or not and came back with extremely childish remarks, I can point you to several of those. Although just perusing his account history should be enough to show you that.

       No, but a 25 day old account with 20 comments and -9 karma (meaning most of them were deemed useless by the community) says something to me. Maybe not to you, but to me it does. I don't think someone with 3000 karma has more credibility than someone with 80 karma. But like I said, that's not exactly the situation.

       I feel that Karma works a lot like money. Sometimes its a useful indicator and sometimes its value is misplaced. Karma + personal critical judgement = subjective value.

       Can be viewed as an attack. That's up to the mods. I think this is an actual question that more people should be aware of. I think considering the context this is very appropriate.
