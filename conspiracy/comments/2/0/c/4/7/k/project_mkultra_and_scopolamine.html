       Tl;dr Project MKUltra was a CIA operation with the goal of experimenting on mind control. I'm sure that most of you have heard of this project and are familiar with it's abuse of LSD. After two decades of top secret research the project becoming known to the public and it was deemed a failure. What drives me crazy about mkultra is its immediate link to lsd. But a lot of people don't realize they also experimented with the drug Scopolamine (see experiments &gt; other drugs)

      </p>
      <p>
       Scopolamine is know as the mind control drug. In high dosages it will make the victim black out and do whatever they are told for 6-8 hours, with no memory of the Black out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people believe the Dark Knight Rises shooter was under the influence of Scopolomine during the incident. You can Google that I'm at work on the toilet typing this up. Just something I wanted to bring to this community's attention, how scary it is a drug like this exists.

       I think scopalimine has been in the intelligence playbook for decades. It's likely what Sirhan Sirhan was given by

       Vice did a documentary about this.  The filmmakers ended up sorta bitching out in the end though, they got their hands on some but decided to just get rid of it rather than trying it to see the effects.

       They pussied out. I didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took 5.1mg of scopolamine in the interest of science and curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being under the influence is fucking scary, not when you're on it, but afterwards. I was completely submissive and euphoric, everything was meant to be. I made my cousin a cup of tea because she asked me to, except she was on the other side of the world. I turned around with the tea and she was gone, and it didn't even process in my mind that that was odd. I don't remember much else, so the memory inhibition is certainly real, the submissivness is real. The worst part is thinking that everything you're doing is normal, not questioning anything.

       Not really, I couldn't because I don't remember much at all. When you're on it though, there is absolutely no questioning, it seems to dissolve the sense that there is anything evil in the world. If someone asked me to kill someone, I would have done it happily while thinking that this is totally normal and I should be doing it. There is no concept of wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I can get a trip sitter and someone to do some basic (safe) experiments on my psyche, I'll be doing it again with formal documentation.

       Verify on video that the substance being ingested is indeed scopolamine in a manner that allows viewers to do the same, such as using a test kit which viewers can buy to see for themselves.

       Something doesn't have to
       <em>
        touch
       </em>
       one's eye for something to
       <em>
        get in
       </em>
       one's eye*. Assuming there are actually reports of scopalamine from a patch getting into people's eyes, it probably came about by someone handling a patch and then either consciously or unconsciously touching their eyes.

       A friend of mine told me a few stories about people doing this in Colombia where she is from. They put it in peoples drinks or blow it in their faces or find another way to drug them, then they take them to the ATM, to their house, and help them selves to what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently her father was actually a victim of this. He is an older dude and luckily he was ok after, he only emptied his account via ATM for these thief's.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is a movie we watched after she told me all the stories. A guy is drugged and looses his memory. Good movie.

       I have a pet theory that some gypsies have been able to get a hold of similar drugs with their extensive travel network.  I'd wager that there are a variety of similar chemicals available in India and Eastern Africa (the wetter parts).

       Scopolamine is currently the CIAs drug of choice for brainwashing/controlling people. People should be aware that such a thing exists.

       Ever see a movie where powder is blown in someones face and then they act like a zombie? That is a portrayal of scopolamine. It's delivery method can be done a number of ways.

       More likely they'd mix it with DMSO and load that up in a device that's pretty much a felt tip pen. DMSO goes through biological organisms like water through a sponge and can be used to carry other liquids with it. Supposedly, if you mix DMSO with lemon juice and spill it on your hand you'll taste the lemon juice in seconds. Then they would only need to "accidentally" brush up against you with said pen for the drug to take effect. This is what they did with snake venoms to kill people, according to multiple sources. Google "dmso cia felt tip pens."
