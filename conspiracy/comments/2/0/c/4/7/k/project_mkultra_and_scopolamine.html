<p>Tl;dr Project MKUltra was a CIA operation with the goal of experimenting on mind control. I&#39;m sure that most of you have heard of this project and are familiar with it&#39;s abuse of LSD. After two decades of top secret research the project becoming known to the public and it was deemed a failure. What drives me crazy about mkultra is its immediate link to lsd. But a lot of people don&#39;t realize they also experimented with the drug Scopolamine (see experiments &gt; other drugs) </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cruisebruise.com/Scopolamine.html">http://www.cruisebruise.com/Scopolamine.html</a></p>

<p>Scopolamine is know as the mind control drug. In high dosages it will make the victim black out and do whatever they are told for 6-8 hours, with no memory of the Black out. </p>

<p>Some people believe the Dark Knight Rises shooter was under the influence of Scopolomine during the incident. You can Google that I&#39;m at work on the toilet typing this up. Just something I wanted to bring to this community&#39;s attention, how scary it is a drug like this exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They pussied out. I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I took 5.1mg of scopolamine in the interest of science and curiosity.</p>

<p>Being under the influence is fucking scary, not when you&#39;re on it, but afterwards. I was completely submissive and euphoric, everything was meant to be. I made my cousin a cup of tea because she asked me to, except she was on the other side of the world. I turned around with the tea and she was gone, and it didn&#39;t even process in my mind that that was odd. I don&#39;t remember much else, so the memory inhibition is certainly real, the submissivness is real. The worst part is thinking that everything you&#39;re doing is normal, not questioning anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, I couldn&#39;t because I don&#39;t remember much at all. When you&#39;re on it though, there is absolutely no questioning, it seems to dissolve the sense that there is anything evil in the world. If someone asked me to kill someone, I would have done it happily while thinking that this is totally normal and I should be doing it. There is no concept of wrong.</p>

<p>If I can get a trip sitter and someone to do some basic (safe) experiments on my psyche, I&#39;ll be doing it again with formal documentation.</p>

<p>Something doesn&#39;t have to <em>touch</em> one&#39;s eye for something to <em>get in</em> one&#39;s eye*. Assuming there are actually reports of scopalamine from a patch getting into people&#39;s eyes, it probably came about by someone handling a patch and then either consciously or unconsciously touching their eyes.   </p>
