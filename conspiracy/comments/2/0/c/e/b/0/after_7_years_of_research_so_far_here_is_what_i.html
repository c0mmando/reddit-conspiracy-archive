        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>JFK Assassination</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple shooters assassinated JFK, not Lee Harvey Oswald</li>
<li>Lee Harvey Oswald was simply a Patsy</li>
<li>People from within the government made it happen or knew it was going to</li>
<li>He was killed because he wanted to change things like the Federal Reserve and the Vietnam War</li>
</ul>

<p>9/11</p>

<ul>
<li>All 3 WTC buildings were brought down in a controlled demolition fashion</li>
<li>The pentagon was not hit by a plane but by some kind of a missile</li>
<li>No plane crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania</li>
<li>Dick Cheney &amp; Donald Rumsfeld were an integral part of the event</li>
<li>A staged attack to get full justification for endless war</li>
</ul>

<p>Illuminati</p>

<ul>
<li>Coming from lines of royalty, now most are involved as world bank owners</li>
<li>Rothschild &amp; Morgan family are major players</li>
<li>They don&#39;t necessarily control the world but they sure are trying to in every way using the current monetary system and government influence</li>
</ul>

<p>Aliens</p>

<ul>
<li>They are real</li>
<li>They have been among us for centuries</li>
<li>There are multiple species of aliens watching us and among us</li>
<li>They have offered all kinds of technology to us over time</li>
</ul>

<p>Chemtrails/HAARP</p>

<ul>
<li>They spray all kinds of chemicals for multiple reasons, mainly weather modification</li>
<li>The goal is to be able to control, modify, and create weather patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2007, I happened to watch the movie Zietgeist and completely factual or not... it blew my mind. The possibility that 9/11 was a lie, even a little bit, opened my eyes to the realization that maybe we aren&#39;t told truth... at all.</p>

<p>Since then I have spent countless hours taking in just about every decent conspiracy related video, article and graphic... and I notice lots of things start to overlap or repeat or align... or simply make sense.</p>

<p>Does anyone else notice that the CIA seems to be involved with just about every single conspiracy since its formation? Anyway, this is what I mean... things start to repeat and you can&#39;t be innocent every single time you are accused.</p>

<p>There are a lot of smart people talking about these conspiracies and the fact is... they can&#39;t ALL be completely wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>meat_for_the_beast, I could&#39;ve written almost exactly the same post.  I also woke up to 9/11 in 2007 and it sent me scurrying down the rabbit hole (hence my user name).  I agree with all you&#39;ve written.  Once you&#39;ve gotten to aliens (took me 3 years) you&#39;re at the bottom of the rabbit hole.  They are at the top of the hierarchy to enslave the world. Keep up the good work.  </p>

<p>Oh, I&#39;ve also researched the Anthrax attacks, the Boston &quot;bombing,&quot; Sandy Hook &quot;shooting,&quot; Aurora, the Navy Yard &quot;shooting,&quot; and the assassinations of JFK, MLK, RFK, JFK Jr., Paul Wellstone as well as many faked suicides.  </p>

<p>We are up against some evil motherfuckers and pretty much everything you hear in the news is fabricated.  Not the weather report and the city council meetings, but the big stuff.  In fact I&#39;m extremely suspicious of this missing plane scenario.  Will it be used to usher in biometric id?  Increased surveillance of some kind?  Whether &quot;they&quot; are responsible or not, &quot;they&quot; will certainly make use of it. </p>

<p>Edit:  reading the comments below I am struck by how far this sub has fallen in the five years I&#39;ve been here.  Why so many ignorant comments from those who supposedly care about knowledge?  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been digging for over 20 years, and everytime I think I found the bottom, I inevitably discover it goes deeper.  </p>

<p>The last few years I&#39;ve been following a story that changed everything.  we all know there&#39;s a secret group of bad guys trying to control the world, but it turns out there&#39;s also a secret group of good guys, and for decades they&#39;ve been watching this evil Cabal with the intent of documenting their crimes and then in one giant sweep lock them all up and expose them to the world.</p>

<p>The bad guys work with some even badder aliens.  And the good guys, yup you guessed it, they&#39;ve got help from some good guys upstairs.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, start digging here: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ephesians 6 - 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. 13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. 14 Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to read anything more than the bible to understand why the world is the way it is today. Evil, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Once you accept this, it destroys all emotional constructs relating to ones denial of peoples ability to perform acts of evil.</p>

<p>People have a hard time believing 9/11 was done by other humans commiting a conspiracy which led to the death of thousands of their fellow citizens because &quot;People are naturally good&quot;. This is wrong and hinders them from the truth about 9/11 in that it is a conspiracy involving people inside and outside of our government.</p>

<p>I studied astronomy in college so of course am well aware of the immensity of the universe and the slim probability that we are alone.  </p>

<p>You could check out the Disclosure Project, the Allagash abductions, and the book The Threat.  Those three sources alone provide overwhelming evidence for aliens being here with evil intent.  </p>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t call it evil, anymore than we think how we treat cows and pigs is evil.  They see us as a lower life form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything but the aliens. UFOs are government aircrafts and the whole &quot;proof&quot; of aliens are going to play out in the holographic &quot;earth invasion&quot;. </p>

<p>More than anything, throughout modern history, religion has been defaced and defamed. &quot;They&quot; don&#39;t want us united, sharing same values and respect for each other. The push to remove &quot;morality&quot; has been so we don&#39;t respect tradition, discipline, humility, our bodies or each other. There are no gods or aliens to come enlighten us. The beliefs of our ancestors has evolved with history and civilization, each religion building on top of another as we learned to travel, trade and translate. This whole New Age, seek to be your own God bullshit is part of the programming. </p>

<p>Love yourself, love all neighbors, love the Earth. Whatever God of your understanding helps you unite your personal spiritual experiences with empathy and compassion for others, but also teaches you discernment, is right and true. Feel God in your life and you&#39;ll stop fearing their plans. They&#39;ll eventually fail anyway, the people united always revolt and start anew. Just work on your happiness and how you can magnify the good. Stop feeding the fear, it keeps you in chains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if I were to say to you that &quot;First Contact&quot; occurred millenniums ago ~ when the first explorers of consciousness took entheogens (peyote, ayahuasca, magic mushrooms, iboga etc etc)?  You don&#39;t need a space ship to speak with those from the stars.  For example, mushrooms acting as a tuner to your astral antenna/radio.  You can pick up signals/frequencies prior to ingestion that were unavailable.  Check out Terence Mckenna&#39;s &#39;Invisible Landscape&#39; or &#39;Archaic Revival&#39; for more information (or Graham Hancock&#39;s &#39;Supernatural&#39;) etc.  The whole myth that a giant space ship landing and meeting us (as you said will be most likely a holographic false flag) is bullocks or will be used against us.  If you wish to talk to those in the stars - try a little exploration within.  Check out Joseph Campbell&#39;s great book &quot;The Inner Reaches of Outer Space&quot; also for more information in these regards.</p>

<p>You can &#39;communicate&#39; with those from the stars today with a visual language if you are brave enough to ingest some plants.  Speaking from first-hand knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any drug induced &quot;contact&quot; seems contrived to me. A false reality. My deepest spiritual experiences have always been when sober, but reaching that place of awe, in an almost drug-like stupor. Yes, I have had &quot;thought breakthroughs&quot; when drunk or high, but they weren&#39;t the reason the experience happened, but a path for the mind to wander on. I can reach those altered states through various means, without drugs, like breathing, meditation or fasting. Mastering the body, not altering it, has always worked &quot;better&quot; for me. </p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t like the idea of drugs or communicating &quot;through the veil&quot; as a means of achieving knowledge. Yes, I believe in prayer and either experiencing &quot;revelations&quot; from God as they happen or interpreting why they happened as a lesson. But intentionally delving for information seems &quot;wrong/false&quot; to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I disagree with most all you are saying here.</p>

<p>If simply ingesting peyote makes you able to speak to those who supposedly live in the stars, why doesn&#39;t every person have a story about it that has done peyote?</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t every person who has taken ayahuasca tell everybody about how taking it will make you be able to communicate with beings from another realm?</p>

<p>Why do large swaths of people who take psilocybin mushrooms never speak of these things, and remain just as actively ignorant as the rest of the media coddled passively entertained braindead masses?</p>

<p>Same with Iboga, where is the call to arms in making the world aware of its&#39; &quot;extra-spiritual communicative properties&quot;?</p>

<p>What the hell is my Astral Antenna/Radio. Are you telling me that something in my body gives me the ability to communicate with other worldly beings? What is it? Why does it only work when certain substances are introduced to your body that interfere with your neurological system?</p>

<p>What is even the point of these communications, and why are these supposed star people so willing to communicate with us? What is their intent?</p>

<p>How does it help them to do it?</p>

<p>EDIT: This is why I believe in God, because it actually makes sense that the creator of the universe has the power to know my every thought. Being able to contact other worldly beings, only under the influence of certain substances, does not sound credible, just sounds like you&#39;re on drugs and everything resulting from that under the influence experience is just that, the drugs messing with your neurological system which is what causes the visions and the change in perception/perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrote a lot, lost it all by hitting back button so I&#39;ll be terse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If simply ingesting peyote makes you able to speak to those who supposedly live in the stars, why doesn&#39;t every person have a story about it that has done peyote?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;To what end/intent&quot; is the mantra of psychonauts.  We&#39;re not here to get fucked up at a music festival.  We consider these &#39;trips&#39; a monumental occasion/gift to speak with the Universe in all it&#39;s forms.  Check Erowid Vaults for over a million first-hand accounts of people on entheogens/psychedelics of every variety.  You are wrong to say that every person &quot;doesn&#39;t&quot; have a story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why doesn&#39;t every person who has taken ayahuasca tell everybody about how taking it will make you be able to communicate with beings from another realm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you actually looked or are you just talking shit?  I could give you dozens of first-hand accounts of people speaking to beings from beyond our realm.  If you want science, check out Rick Strassman&#39;s &quot;DMT: Spirit Molecule&quot; for a scientific study (first of it&#39;s kind in decades) that shows the comparisons of visual/auditory &#39;hallucinations&#39; and how similar they are of those on the substance.  They discuss aliens, visitors, beings not of this world and their communications with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do large swaths of people who take psilocybin mushrooms never speak of these things, and remain just as actively ignorant as the rest of the media coddled passively entertained braindead masses?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, you must be looking in the wrong places.  Not only myself (Erowid vaults or Terence McKenna&#39;s books previously stated etc) has had experiences they cannot explain, in which specifically, they encounter intelligence and (try to) communicate with it.  It does not happen to everyone, most aren&#39;t doing such substances to reach such lofty goals.</p>

<p>On a side note, Thomas Campbell&#39;s book &quot;My Big T.O.E. (Theory of Everything)&quot; is a fascinating read in which the founder/discoverer of O.O.B.E (Out-of-Body Experiences) initiates and teaches Thomas his techniques for reaching such states WITHOUT drugs of any sort.  Thomas takes a very scientific approach to the concepts of OOBExperiences, going on to detail that through T.M. (trans. meditation) one can &#39;leave&#39; the body and visit VAST realms beyond our &#39;sight&#39;.  They do experiments such as; two isolated people, one in each room, having a discussion while Out-of-Body in another realm.  One asks a question, the other answers and vice versa - all legit and very interesting.  Thomas Campbell&#39;s scientific rundown on what he believes is going on is a serious read with some serious conclusions.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Same with Iboga, where is the call to arms in making the world aware of its&#39; &quot;extra-spiritual communicative properties&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Graham Hancock&#39;s &quot;Supernatural&quot;, within the first few chapters, takes Iboga and relays information in regards to witnessing relatives who have passed.  He is not the only one and they are doing everything they can to make the mainstream acknowledge/see this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the hell is my Astral Antenna/Radio. Are you telling me that something in my body gives me the ability to communicate with other worldly beings? What is it? Why does it only work when certain substances are introduced to your body that interfere with your neurological system?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your astral antenna/radio is your body and more specifically, the pineal gland.  Check out &quot;DMT; Spirit Molecule&quot; for more information about how DMT not only is released naturally (during early morning, when in the womb and when dying etc), but when ingested (from external sources) causes similar effects to wide-ranges of people (from various backgrounds, cultures, races, ages etc).  These effects are, talking to intelligence not of this world.  Extra-terrestrial does not mean they&#39;re flying around in UFO&#39;s - it means, beyond/not-of this Earth/land... foreign, exotic, strange.  It&#39;s far easier to relay a message directly than to travel light-years across a galaxy in a ship.  Most our Science Fiction is really laughable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is even the point of these communications, and why are these supposed star people so willing to communicate with us? What is their intent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point is personal.  If you wish to see what has been &#39;told&#39; to others, I&#39;ve given you the resources to see more than you could ever read in your lifetime (Erowid Vaults, DMT: Spirit Molecule, Invisible Landscape, Doors of Perception etc).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does it help them to do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume you are asking &quot;How does this intercourse help the &#39;star people&#39; reach their intent/goals?&quot;  Well.. in explaining that I&#39;ll have to answer your &#39;EDIT&quot; below;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT: This is why I believe in God, because it actually makes sense that the creator of the universe has the power to know my every thought. Being able to contact other worldly beings, only under the influence of certain substances, does not sound credible, just sounds like you&#39;re on drugs and everything resulting from that under the influence experience is just that, the drugs messing with your neurological system which is what causes the visions and the change in perception/perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The War of Light and Dark rages on.  There has been no victor as of yet.  We are in the midst of a Universal, prolonged near-eternal war.  As above, so below (War on Terror).  The &#39;god&#39; of the Bible, Yahweh.. ya well, he&#39;s the Villain of the Universe.  Dark Master of counterfeit-mimicry and deception.  He is a false god ... all one needs to do is to look at his emotive actions of fear, lust, greed, wrath, envy, pride etc run rampant throughout the texts glorifying him.  He is the biggest hypocrite in the known &#39;verse.  It&#39;s all written down in the Bible for one to see.  This is not a true &#39;god&#39; by any sense of the word - beyond his stolen power.  I suggest you read the books TAKEN OUT of the Bible; The Apocrypha (specifically the Nag Hammadi codex <a href="http://gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl.html">http://gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl.html</a>).  This was the Gnostics great works (the pre-christians who got it right).  They discuss AT LENGTH that our world is a prison for light/spirit and the inmates have control, all under the tutelage and heel of the Demiurge (Yahweh).</p>

<p>So you wish to know what those beyond are trying to relay to us ~ spread light, find your bliss/calling.  Be the janitors of the prison and clean this shit up.  They usually tell you specifically what &quot;YOU&quot; can do personally - but not always.</p>

<p>Hope this clears up some of your misconceptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imprisoned here 68 million years ago... </p>

<p>These beings that will not die, but are limited in function depending on environmental conditions, were forced into a nocturnal existence, they do not and cannot reside in earthly sunlight/daylight, as a result the process of finding, taming, training, manipulating whatever chosen/found species over the course of millions of years had many, many challenges - working at night and or in the earth or other massive earthen (stone) buildings of protection was incredibly restrictive. </p>

<p>One could liken this limited and slow process to modern humans being castaway on another planet with no tools or tech and having to &quot;discover&quot; their way through the various life forms and those abilities, both extreme, chronic, acute and passive, that those life forms have that will work best for the ultimate goal of getting off the planet and  returning home - working only at night BTW.</p>

<p>We modern humans think in technological terms, mechanics, and methods of achieving massive endeavors; like returning home from across the universe - we know of no other way than via machine and tool. So imagine having to find a suitable species that you have to tweak over generations via DNA and other controls without actually having any of those tweaking tools to work with.</p>

<p>First you find something you can communicate with and that is able to learn to a certain degree. Perhaps through breeding you get closer to something that will be able to source materials that will allow for a step forward toward your goal.</p>

<p>It takes extreme amounts of time, trial and error, but we&#39;ve recently crossed an abilities paradox and now we are closer than ever to allowing for the beings to leave planet - perhaps another 50 years or so. But there is a problem, a certain group of other beings - from which these castaways come - that will not allow for them to leave this prison - our home, despite what we may want or think about it all.</p>

<p>Now, to address your request for specific event information from whom it is presented best: The concern here is that this is <strong>THE SECRET</strong> that all orders of mystery or gnosis or whatever secret order they work from, maintain, and protect - base their reason for existing. It requires researching many seemingly different esoteric orders. Crowns were made for this very reason. Popes require that this order stay hidden. Resources are managed for this reason and goal. Society is built for one goal. People are controlled with and for and because of this single goal.</p>

<p>Every major &quot;conspiracy&quot; that matters stems from this core knowledge. All religion, all myth, from every culture throughout history branches from this one understanding of the human relationship with these beings and those other beings that moved to strand these creatures here - our home. </p>

<p>The craft they were entombed in was not a technical machine like a ship or space plane, it was a giant frozen stone sarcophagus.</p>

<p>All that said: Would you like video or written research or both?</p>

<p>The fact is I chose to respond to you, which doesn&#39;t prove that my response was determined by your question, because I could have not answered it had that been what I chose to do. Me responding does not equal it having been pre-determined, that is illogical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Required History is the necessity for all known and still unknown events to have sequenced out from first-motion, on both macro and micro levels, in the exact manner that they did/have in order for this now moment to be as it is - in order for it to be true in reality. There is no &quot;could have&quot; or &quot;should have&quot; or &quot;would have;&quot; there is only what is as an absolute result of the historical sequence of all events that have come before it; amounted to the truth of the now reality moment. </p>

<p>So the now moment is based entirely on Required History on all levels.</p>

<p>That being said, the illusion of choice is the first obstacle that one must overcome in order to navigate one&#39;s understanding of reality. To turn away from belief systems, like that of free will, and become a person of knowledge based thought.  </p>

<p>There is no &quot;had I not done this, then this would have been&quot; scenario. There is only what there is - we call it true reality. Determined only by the sequence that has occurred before it, not the sequence that occurs during it or after it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of your conclusions as well.  The main thing to remember is that when there is too much conflicting evidence, eye witness accounts, threats and mysterious deaths of multiple people involved, the same people involved the likelyhood of something being &quot;wrong&quot; with the official report is quite real.  Most people would never have believed that humanity could creat the A-bomb, employ people who commited egreious crimes against humanity or plan to put concrete powder in children&#39;s milk - yet the US government did all that within just a few short decades.  </p>

<p>People don&#39;t want to believe in a conspiracy theory because often it is much scarier than the version fed to the masses.  Most people would have thought you were flat out crazy to suggest the US government was trying to use mind control or was working on time travel or weather manipluation - yet they have worked on all these ideas.  </p>

<p>JFK defnitely was a conspiracy - even congress at the time issued their own findings after the Warren commission saying that they thought it was a conspiracy.  </p>

<p>9/11 has just so much that doesn&#39;t make sense not to mention the secretcy around much of the evidence.</p>

<p>HAARP has some scary patents, not to mention some of the stories...
Chemtrails are also very suspicious.  There is quite a bit of evidence that what is being sprayed is not purely for research.  As someone who travels a lot, lots of places do not have this kind of sky contamination and also don&#39;t have the same ground pollutants which correspond with the chemicals being sprayed.  </p>

<p>So many people have their eyes closed because either they have better things to do, are too stressed or distracted by life/work/etc; or perhaps they just don&#39;t want to believe that governments can be so horrible.  That people aren&#39;t so evil.  </p>

<p>For anyone who doesn&#39;t think that the government would dare do something like load a plane with people and purposely crash that plane for its own purposes, please look into Operation Northwoods.  It was a plan given to Kennedy in order to start war with Cuba.  In this document they suggest loading a plane with &quot;college students&quot; who would be undercover agents, leave a national airport, land and then send up a different plane.  This plane would then be shot down near Cuban airspace.  The incident would be blamed on Cuba and the war could start.  These same people also suggested putting concrete powder in the milk at children&#39;s schools to discredit Castro.  Nice, huh?</p>

While traveling in 2010, I observed them in Paris, Barcelona, Rome, &amp; Brussels, but I then flew next to India and didn&#39;t see a trail the entire 4 months I was in country and I travelled all over that sub continent. It was wonderful not to see them.

<p>Youtube videos don&#39;t count as research. The sources these video&#39;s use, if credible, would be great as you aren&#39;t getting someones possibly biased interpretation of the source. If you&#39;re going to claim doing 7 years of research you better have better sources then youtube videos. They don&#39;t except that as a source in primary schools let alone universities.

    <div class="md"><p>Im not completely against it. They can have credibility. It&#39;s just a hard balancing of whats real and what isn&#39;t that the majority of people just don&#39;t seem to do. My problem with it is more it being lazy research, lazy research you shouldn&#39;t be basing major beliefs off of. If you do actually look into it more deeply, then great! But I try and refrain from saying that, because as soon as you do, every delusional who doesn&#39;t will claim they do exactly that. </p>

<p>No, I believe t.v. and news organizations do the same thing. Sometimes maybe its true, but they have there own biases, stretching truths, sometimes outright lying. Everything needs to be looked at critically is all Im getting at, and I mean from some of the things people believe that just isn&#39;t happening.</p>

<p>Here we run into the problem where people will dismiss mainstream news immediately (its not nearly as bad as some make it out to be, though it is definitely heavily bias). But they&#39;ll lose that healthy skepticism as soon as they find an article by alex jones, or on prison planet etc. Don&#39;t lose that skepticism. The news isnt always lying to you, and your alternative media isn&#39;t always telling the truth. Everybody has some kind of agenda, some more obvious then others, but it&#39;s always there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s a silly claim. You shouldn&#39;t generalize an entire form of content just because some of the articles of that content don&#39;t supply verifiable sources. There have been a lot of good documentary style videos that do supply verifiable sources.</p>

<p>Furthermore online video (including not-for-profit, privately made online video) is a large portion of what people under immense time constraints prefer to consume these days. Not every conspiracy research falls into the category of Stan Friedman, with the time to source original documents from the source and independently verify.</p>

<p>Most of those people waking up today have started their journeys and continue the same journey relying on the highly condensed, yet verifiable sourced videos online produced by those that do full-time legwork on the sources.</p>

<p>The masses are waking up and it&#39;s largely because of this highly concentrated video media that is to blame, not the fact that document 241a ref 517:b:2 exists in the US national archives to this day and Stan Friedman found it 15+ years ago.</p>

Supplys some verifiable sources, completely takes them out of context, also used b.s. sources. Zeitgeist, basicly everything I&#39;ve seen by alex jones has done this. They can have real, credible sources, but what they do is cherry pick facts that support there claim, and leave out vital information in the source that goes against there predetermined conclusions.</p>

<p>It being easily consumable should not be an arguement for how it&#39;s good. Either you&#39;re blindly watching them and taking them at face value knowing many contain false information, on the off chance its true. Or you&#39;re looking into it deeper, and discovering whether its true or not, which defeats the point of this being a quick and good way of learning as you said, people don&#39;t have time for it. </p>

<p>So really, when there is so much false-information in these videos, its not silly to generalize them as a bad source of credible information, when nobody who consumes it is looking into the actual facts, or other sides of the arguement. </p>

<p>Seriously, don&#39;t shape your worldview around easily consumable media because you don&#39;t have time to look into it deeper. You should put a little more effort into what you&#39;re basing your beliefs on, not treating something so important like funny skit, or music video, easily consumed entertainment.</p>

<p>The video is factually verifiable as all 4 ingredients used to make thermate are listed and displayed. This gives you the ability to verify it for yourself in your own experiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, peer reviewed scientific journals, science can&#39;t lie, it isn&#39;t politically charged you can&#39;t fake something using the scientific method. The person can lie yes, but if it&#39;s peer reviewed by credible scientists in the field, fact checked etc, then really thats the best we have. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a relevant source, some videos in it may use credible sources, but a lot of them stretch that credibility as much as mainstream media does. Be skeptical is the point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not biased against youtube, I&#39;m biased against people who believe anything they want to believe, whether there source is a sketchy youtube video, wall street journal, CNN, fox, alex jones. It doesn&#39;t matter. Willful ignorance of fact to further your own belief in whatever, god, a specific conspiracy theory, the lack of god, is never a good thing.</p>

<p>People gravitated to what they want to believe. If they already believe a theory, and alex jones was there source as an example, they start buying everything he says without fact checking. This is ignorant. Then instead of checking the other side of the arguement, they shut that out as misinformation (the other side does this as well, don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not just fringe conspiracists), then with dissent shut out they talk to like minded people and an echo chamber is formed. You hear what you want to hear from like minded people, and dissenting opinions are shut out. That&#39;s reasonable if the other side is just attacking, but respectful discussion of controversial ideas shouldn&#39;t be shot down so readily.</p>

This stuff shouldn&#39;t even need to be debunked.

<p>At full speed the movement is tough to spot, but frame by frame you can&#39;t miss it.  JFKs head snaps <em>forward</em> around 3 or 4 inches between frames 312 and 313, right as the bullet impacts his skull.</p>

<p>The &quot;back and to the left&quot; motion popularized by Oliver Stone doesn&#39;t start until 2 frames <em>after</em> the shot impacts his head.  It&#39;s most likely a neuromuscular reaction, in essence Kennedy is seizing up due to massive brain trauma.  Sit slightly hunched forward and then immediately tense every muscle in your body...you snap backwards.</p>

<p>The snap forward at the instant of impact proves the shot was from the <em>rear</em>, not the front.</p>

<p>Even though I think seizing up is a reasonable explanation in certain cases, we are now talking about a seize that happened at exact time of a bullet impact and GREATLY resembles a bullet strike. My eyes tell me that at least one shot came from the front.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to have to back this up with something.  How can you tell the angle the bullet hits the head at at frame 313?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we are now talking about a seize that happened at exact time of a bullet impact</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, 1/9th of a second <em>after</em> the bullet impact, the equivalent of 2 Zapruder frames.</p>

<p>The direction the head moves at the exact time of bullet impact is forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny coincidence: my little apocalypse also had its genesis in 2007.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until 2009 that it fully bloomed. I went through everything. I found <a href="http://youtu.be/x_A4fBSroiE">Bill Cooper</a> in late 2008 - maybe 2009. He was sense-making as where most of the other gurus were not sense-making. I feel as though he was the one that ushered in clear thinking for me. The anti-dote to the Debby-Downer tone of Bill Cooper is <a href="http://youtu.be/v09vvwqBmgk">Robert Anton Wilson</a>. </p>

<p>I have recently decided that the most logical explanation of the elites is <a href="http://youtu.be/Hon3AzMO6vs">psychopathy</a>.</p>

<p>These days I&#39;m interested in eroding the power structure of the self-appointed rulers and so my current line of thinking is very nuts-and-bolts; Marc Stevens. They only have power because we agree that they have power. We are the ones that police ourselves at their request. We are the ones who process their paperwork. We are the ones who open their doors, cook their food and run their machines. We are the ones with the real power. </p>

<p>Most importantly: we pay them to rule us. </p>

<p>A parasite dies when you deny it blood. </p>

<p>It has taken me years to get to this point. It&#39;s funny to look at it retrospectively.</p>

<p>Trouble is that the key to knowledge is the &quot;factual&quot; part. That, above all else, is the key to choosing whether or not to accept a claim.  Once you disregard the facts you&#39;re simply not to be taken seriously.           </p>

<p>Are all Muslims right about the truth of the Koran? All Jews about the truth of the Torah? Pick a religion you don&#39;t accept the truth claims of - how many adherents are there? Are they all stupid? According to you the can&#39;t all be wrong, right?          </p>

<p>Your post reads like a &quot;My First Conspiracy&quot; pamphlet written by a 12 year old who has been given an hour to research conspiracy theories online. No depth, no analysis, no skepticism, no rationality, no evidence.         </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice of you to share. Your &quot;theories&quot; are all well documented and mainstream. Calling it theory is JTRIG shit. I have a few comments.</p>

<p>Aliens are not real, it&#39;s the spirits cloaking up.</p>

<p>The Illuminati are rich people initiated. As it has always been. But there are no bloodlines that are thousands of years old, they can only claim a lineage around a thousand years back. The interesting ones go back to the Knights Templar&#39;s, who were burned because they fucked up the banking system with their interest rates, just like the Fed today. And they should be burned as well.</p>

<p>While there&#39;s no doubt about life on other planets (life is a function of matter, matter was designed to be conscious, so God could understand himself), please don&#39;t go with the UFO disinfo. It&#39;s the &quot;great&quot; conspiracy&#39;s need for war and death, because of stupidity and greed, that dictates that crap.</p>

<p>They also tried to introduce various diseases through Chemtrails, but my impression is, it&#39;s just a giant waste of money, with no real impact. The vaccination program is a much better attack vector.</p>

<p>Otherwise you are pretty dead on. Now go have some children.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because people blame the CIA. They bring the CIA into the situation whether they&#39;re actually involved or not. </p>

<p>And for chemtrails, what chemicals are they spraying? I&#39;ve yet to see any proof of anything detrimental to our well being. </p>

<p>Does this mean I have all the facts and the best information? of course not.

<p>What chemicals are they spraying? There are companies that will admit to spraying silver iodide, Salt, Calcium Chloride (<a href="http://weathermodification.com/resources.php">http://weathermodification.com/resources.php</a> but there is lots of research revealing they find barium, nano aluminum-coated fiberglass [known as CHAFF], radioactive thorium, cadmium, chromium, nickel, desiccated blood, mold spores, yellow fungal mycotoxins, ethylene dibromide, and polymer fibers. Who knows for sure? We may never know but one thing is for sure... you can&#39;t ask your local government representative to look into it and be taken seriously.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know chaff involved nano-particles. Seems odd, seeing as that stuff is SUPPOSED to be seen. Everything else I&#39;ve heard of, but have all be vastly disproven (or, at best, not proven true).</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, though!</p>

<p>Or, like the illuminati (existence questionable), they are very easy to blame. It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, I&#39;m pushing my sensibility on the belief of Aliens... but I tend to think about it in a &quot;numbers game&quot; mentality. It has been said that 8.8 billion habitable Earth-size planets exist in Milky Way alone... All we need is 1 of them to have life out there and we have Aliens!</p>

<p>Either we, Earthlings, are the very first creations of life in the universe or we are not and there are others ahead of us and behind us in evolution. The possibilities are endless and to think we are the only living things in this massive amount of space is basically impossible to me. We are constantly learning more and more about what is going on in space... so I honestly believe it&#39;s a matter of time before the alien races that are evolved enough to see us or be with us... will reveal their true identities when we are both worthy and capable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOLOL the assault on r/conspiracy is on full force I see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2007, I happened to watch the movie Zietgeist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that movie... that disinfo movie...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does anyone else notice that the CIA seems to be involved with just about every single conspiracy since its formation? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also the Cheka ==&gt; NKVD ==&gt; KGB, the French secret service, there was the Stasi, etc etc but hey, we can&#39;t handle multiple things all at once, we&#39;re muricans, there is good and evil and no grey area in between</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aliens</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bwahahahah.</p>

<p>Of course the trolls are full force on this, witness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The last few years I&#39;ve been following a story that changed everything. we all know there&#39;s a secret group of bad guys trying to control the world, but it turns out there&#39;s also a secret group of good guys, and for decades they&#39;ve been watching this evil Cabal with the intent of documenting their crimes and then in one giant sweep lock them all up and expose them to the world.</p>

<p>The bad guys work with some even badder aliens. And the good guys, yup you guessed it, they&#39;ve got help from some good guys upstairs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow! </p>

<p>Tell me moar!</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>The end of r/conspiracy.  Somewhat sad, yet predictable.</p>

<p>Remember that scene in &quot;Close Encounters of 3rd kind&quot; where the TV reporters are interviewing normal folks about what they saw, and then some idiot hick gets up and shouts &quot;I&#39;ve see bigfoot once!&quot;... and all cameras as if on command focus on the idiot.</p>

<p>This is similar to this thread and many other threads, upvoted to the top, maybe even stickied, in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK: Mafia was pissed about the bay of pigs that screwed up relations with cuba that then closed down their casinos. You don&#39;t screw with mafia money.</p>

<p>9/11: Energy weapons that aren&#39;t public knowledge, just military, whether state owned or private.</p>

<p>Illuminati: They are twisting the term, they are the Dark Illuminati. They want to maintain the old world order of them in power and you sucking them off. A new world order would be fantastic.</p>

<p>Aliens: You&#39;re an alien.</p>

<p>Chemtrails: Seems to make sense, though it&#39;s not for the benefit of the masses. If worse come to worst then they have their bunkers 4km underground. And when they close the door, they&#39;ll execute a number of the people who thought they were going to survive and take their rations.</p>

<p>Three Letter Organisation Connection: Imagine if you were in England or Israel or.. wherever else. You&#39;d blame your personal secret organizations for their involvement with little to no proof most of the time. Tada.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t all be wrong: Look at christianity. Millions of followers, not a single one is correct. FSM BE PRAISED!!!!</p>

<p>Time Travel: The bartender asks &quot;what&#39;ll ya have?&quot;. So, a time traveler walks into a bar…</p>

<p>Satanic stuff: Why for you no comment on this?</p>

<p>GMO: And this.</p>

<p>Teddy Ruxpin: Don&#39;t get me started on this. Soooo many stories.</p>

<p>Cats are our overlords: This isn&#39;t a conspiracy, they just wanted me to remind you.</p>

<p>Sleep well!</p>

Eminem died years ago, Paul McCartney was replaced by an impersonator, all of MK Ultra, the entire monetary system, and the large pyramids of giza are older than the smaller ones and not the other way around as is shown by the flood damage. Blanking right now and I&#39;m just gonna say that the time travel joke was referring to the manhattan project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So aliens landed on our planet, 5 billions years ago, walked around with dinasours and they spent the remaining years trying to build up a society where people are the slaves and evenetually they hope people will build the aircraft for them to return home?</p>

<p>This is the most stupid shit ive ever heard, and you decide to pull this out with your &quot;17 years of deep research&quot; some half assed rhyme scheme with cool pictures on how we are slaves cause the aliens, 4 billion years ago, just want to return home, man, they just want to return home.</p>

<p>Kinda well done, got the voice for it, decent editing, but like meh, not buying it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither I nor OP stated which videos were being watched. YouTube has literally almost every video in online existence (excluding vulgar content) on their website. I&#39;ve watched many old BBC, History Channel, CNN, etc. documentaries on YouTube and you&#39;re telling me that because these videos are on a particular website that it is to be disregarded and not considered as credible? I understand when you&#39;re talking about people making videos about whether or not a Rihanna video is sending subliminal Illuminati messages, but c&#39;mon. It&#39;s just a video platform. Videos can be credible sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked at hundreds of sources, including books, films, websites.  None have the whole truth, each contributes a piece of the puzzle, many corroborate each other.</p>

<p>I studied astronomy in college so of course am well aware of the immensity of the universe and the slim probability that we are alone.  </p>

<p>You could check out the Disclosure Project, the Allagash abductions, and the book The Threat.  Those three sources alone provide overwhelming evidence for aliens being here with evil intent.  </p>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t call it evil, anymore than we think how we treat cows and pigs is evil.  They see us as a lower life form.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they just build machines that can&#39;t question them or fight back?</p>

<p>The whole idea of humans being created as a slave race is completely ludicrous.</p>
