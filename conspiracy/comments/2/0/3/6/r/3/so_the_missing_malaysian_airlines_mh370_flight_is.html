       families have signed a joint statement saying that their family members' cell phones connected, but the calls hung up. The relatives have asked Malaysia Airlines to reveal any information they might be hiding, seeking an explanation for the eerie phone connections. The relatives have complained that the Malaysian Airlines is not responding as actively as it should."

       Interesting, but does North Korea have it's own airliners it could use for the same plan? Why would they go through all of this instead of loading up one of their own planes and executing an attack? Genuine curiosity

       wait what? I thought they had the technology to jam transmissions so why does it matter what airline they're in? They'd provoke more of a defense response flying a jet that has been missing and made world news, than they would flying an aircraft with a low safety rating......

       Well it's plausible that they could be keeping all of the passengers alive right now. If the plane is flying towards Seoul, it would obviously trigger at least a depart of some fighter jets to check the plane. If the fighter jets see the plane filled with 250 passengers, they won't just shoot it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the really have to do is get over Seoul, and it's not impossible.

       To be honest, I think this is too wacky and James Bond even for North Korea.  Also North Korea's "allies" (i.e. China) aren't terribly loyal and would definitely know about and blow the whistle on something like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hijack and turning off the transponder is a definite possibility given how quickly it happened and no wreckage has (apparently) been found.

       So can't the radar systems see that a plane disappeared?  Then they would know when it went down and then check along that planned path?  Couldn't they play back the radar tapes?  Also wouldn't they have an an exact starting location and approximate distance and angle and hence approximate location of the plane?  I don't know shit about this stuff really but it seems strange.

       you are confusing with AirFrance 447 Rio-Paris which crashed in the Atlantic in a no-radar zone. This case, there was radar (even overlapping) coverage. It just vanished from the radar. Maybe it disintegrated mid-air, or flew below the radar.

       Thermal imaging, or any imaging from space is not very high resolution by default, so you would need to be zeroed in on that specific area at the time to get enough detail to be useful. The satellites can do this when asked to, but you can duplicate the effect after the event has already happened.

       Do you really think they had the capability to find its location and haven't used that?

       that's an exaggeration.   planes take several seconds to explode, and even then there will be a bright trail of debris falling..  someone 20 minutes ahead or behind on the flight path should have seen something.

       Yes it was an exaggeration.  I'm not claiming that it definitely exploded.

       Some other critical failure, in the dark, could have sent it to the ocean without a fiery explosion.

       My point was that it is highly unlikely that there was a satellite actively monitoring this plane during its routine flight.

       they don't have perfect coverage that is high enough resolution to spot a plane, theres no reason to point a satellite towards open ocean, and even if it was captured someone would have to figure out what plane was the one that crashed from the hundreds flying over that ocean on the day.

       Um...tracking nuclear subs, warships, fighter squadrons. Lets not forget the area is know for territorial disputes. Plenty of reasons to keep satellites parked overhead. But I agree with other comments when they said if you arent pointing the camera at it you won't see it. I would imagune a thermal image would have been captured if the plane blew up...it was good weather and they would have been above the clouds. I would be supprised if satellites didn't have a broad area thermal sensor to automatically hone in on potential explosions indicating hostilities. At least thats how I would do it.

       <p>
        I do wonder, if urthecast (in conjunction with NASA) could assist here. They have a live feed on the ISS (International Space Station) and this is soon to go live to the public, however it is currently live to them only while they fine tune the systems as they are going to be broadcasting this live on TV next weekend.
       </p>

        I digress. The ISS circles the earth every 90 minutes, and this camera can scan 90% of the earth in this time. Only parts it can't get are the poles. It is 1M resolution so can zoom in very close to earth, so much that it can see vehicles moving on the streets and pedestrians walking along the pavements.
       </p>
       <p>
        If they have scanned this area (if they have this switched on), then perhaps this is data which could assist the NTSB and other SAR teams.

        OP
       </strong>
       , here is a good link to a forum post on the Professional pilots rumour network, discussing the missing plane and their professional opinions:

      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
       Everyone should go through all the posts, there is TONS of information from actual pilots that are becoming speculative.

       I'm not sure, their pretty clear on how unprofessional the co pilot was
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now this type of behaviour opens a few questions:
1. Smoking in cockpit
2. Not paying any attention to the flying (AP ALLTHEWAY)
3. Perhaps other inappropriate behavior (I hope PAX were not given a spin at the controls)
       </p>
       <p>
        So you can add one more know fact. 
The FO was an unreliable pilot.
The Captain (previous flight from the story) was a poor leader

       Also talking of cover-up
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thats the most important question: What are they covering up and on whose behest?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In addition to cover-up, why are they misleading the entire world. They knew all the time that plane is not anywhere in or near gulf of Thailand / south China Sea. Then why did they mislead?
       </p>
       <p>
        I certainly think there is some awful media relations work at foot there, but I've managed aviation SAR incidents (post Sep 11) where we could not disclose information from classified military assets that were being factored into our search plan. Some of these assets make the oft mentioned here "primary ATC radar" look like a joke.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had to be circumspect to avoid a public disclosure rabbit hole... it was also an incident that was subject to a lot of media coverage.
       </p>
       <p>
        I almost accidentally mentioned one element during a media interview, it would have created a major issue in terms of cross jurisdiction cooperation for the future. It is possible either their own military or foreign military has provided them information on the condition that the source and type of information not be disclosed, hence the skewed search area (from day 2?) with no explanation. The SOP is to say "we've received information from a variety of credible sources that has led us to move our search in this direction".
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard SAR methodology is to work from your highest probability of detection areas down. It appears they are doing that. This is usually based on imperfect information, e.g. they have a military track but it is partial and may not connect with the ATC track (and therefore identity of a/c). Or they have clues that are credible but wrong, which misdirect resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ironically we were going to be meeting soon with one of the government SAR departments involved in this search, I assume due to this incident those meetings will move out a bit. Of course I'm going to try to get the scoop on what went on (when all this is over), but it will be the very last thing I ask them in the meetings; I'm sure there will be reticence to discuss.

        Most of them are just getting more and more speculative and mostly siding with a hijacking theory

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This whole thing is starting to stink...
       </p>
       <p>
        Very few people believed it was a hijacking until the second aircraft hit the World Trade Center.

       <p>
        God forbid another aircraft goes missing in the next few weeks...

        In the meantime, while we wait for more information, may I ask my fellow colleges to be extra vigilant with cockpit entry procedures.

       Exactly. If there was foul play...the phones would be turned off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an easy test: Call the phones again. Their batteries should be dead by now, right? So this will be able to tell us if the phones' default is to just give a ringing tone even when disconnected.

       This is not always the case. Services such as Google Voice will cause the virtual "phone" to ring and go to voicemail as usual, regardless of whether the physical phone that is linked to the GV number is on or off.

       That was my thought,  or in cases where you have bad/no reception.
      </p>
      <p>
       My old phone network never worked in about 80% of my house. No calls would go through, no texts, nothing. If you went outside with it or a few spots in the house by some windows it would all the sudden tell you had a text or voicemail. My friends and family would always ask why I never picked up the phone, they said it rang several times and went to voicemail.

       My mom's is even worse. If the phone is on and she doesn't answer, it will go to voicemail. If the phone is turned off, it will ring forever. If she's in an area without reception and the phone is on, it will ring for a bit and then quit without voicemail.

       angulation implies there are three separate towers that can see the phone. With the case of this plane, there's a GSM uplink that uses satellites to connect the call. i.e. there's one tower, and the satellite has no idea where the connection is coming from in terms of a vector, only that it is.

       They absolutely can see which towers last pinged the cell phones.  This could be as the plane was going down, if the passengers phones were on.  Otherwise it would have been just as they were departing.

       It really doesn't mean that at this stage. What this entire thing is hinged on is the families' definition of connected. While roaming cell phones do not act as they would while in their home country. While off the caller will get the ringing sound in most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Connecting a call to a handset that was known to be roaming is a process that takes time, the more time - the more rings and the eventual hangup signal when the home network realises that the roaming network is no longer connected to the phone.

       But in the case of Flight 447 Rio-Paris that crashed in the Atlantic, the plane went missing for 3 days (until the first debris were found) and
       <em>
        only one
       </em>
       person claimed to have been able to call and get a calling signal, possibly explained by the passenger having forgotten their telephone somewhere before the flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not dismissing you, but I'm also trying to think of reasonally justifying 19 families having such claim when in a similar accident, only one did; maybe mass-hysteria, numbers (subconsiously) dialed incorrectly, difference in roaming service between Asia and the Atlantic, or the phones are afloat on top of some debris.

       This cell phone stuff is dumb as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they're seeing is either lag time on the VM redirection or the system "hunting" for the phone and getting stuck. Normally it instantly goes to voice mail, but the system isn't perfect since there is some slack given so that we try to get your your call in a low signal situation when your phone might be momentary offline. This slack can either bug out or reset for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it would be extremely easy for the cell phone companies to tell what towers saw the momentary association of the phone to a tower during the periods that the family reports the rings.... They'll find there wasn't any.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, this plane crashed. For whatever reason, there was a "violent disassembly." This is completely wrong to be leading these families on and wasting their time with this false-hope phone stuff.

       Now this is complete bullshit, the call process is highly adept - it only rings once a proper connection is established.  If the connection is disrupted you would hear the

       No it's not. These were most-likely international calls. The delays on international calls are masked by the familiar ring tones so the caller doesn't hear dead-air and think that the call failed. My use of "bugs" is a laymans term for when the latency you see before the call gets connected lasts longer than usual, which can happen on nearly any call, but it's more noticeable when you have to deal with international anyways.

        Telecoms expert Alan Spencer told [source] that if the phones are really ringing, they can categorically not be under the sea. He added that the phones will only be ringing if they are ‘switched on, not in water, the battery is charged, and [they are] near a mobile cell site.’This means that if the phones are genuinely ringing, the plane needs to have landed on land – not in the sea – and be in a location where there is cell service, rather than landing in the middle of a jungle, for example.

       We stay. They see us exposing their tactics and adapt, rinse, repeat. This way we can build a mental database of what they do and then link it back to them to show this is a well-known disinfo/derail technique. Most common now is attacking the messenger (source) and "gish gallop". It's funny actually.

       I agree with you on the cellphone stuff, though I am personally not sure what has happened to the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ringing people hear when dialing out is generated by the network, not a response from the mobile handset. Ringing only means that the network is trying to connect you, it does not mean  the mobile handset is even communicating with the network. These are also international phone systems, with likely international calls going through them, meaning there are likely many different systems the call has to traverse before being connected. This adds lag time which the network fills in with clicks, tones or ringing sounds, and not all systems follow a convention of sending you directly to voicemail if the mobile handset is off.

        The ringing people hear when dialing out is generated by the network, not a response from the mobile handset. Ringing only means that the network is trying to connect you, it does not mean the mobile handset is even communicating with the network.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes.  Here in the UK you'll often hear at least two ringing tones over the earpiece before the target phone even lights up and starts notifying you of an incoming call, and this is easily demonstrable by simply having two phones next to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with mobile voicemail set up the phone can still ring normally before diverting, it's not as if the divert is instant every single time.

       Okay... here's a stab at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To 86 something means to "be out of something" in slang, and we're quite obviously missing a plane, so it has been "86-ed".
      </p>
      <p>
       4560 (days after sept. 11, 2001) - wtf, but okay let's go with it!
      </p>
      <p>
       86 = 8, 6
      </p>
      <p>
       4560 / 8 = 570
      </p>
      <p>
       4560 / 6 = 760
      </p>
      <p>
       86 + 239 (number of passengers) = 325
      </p>
      <p>
       570 + 760 + 325 = 1655
      </p>
      <p>
       4560 / 1655 = 2.7522 (approx)
      </p>
      <p>
       Put that number into mapquest to give a location on the Earth's surface and...

       Interesting theory from another pilot
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The terror organisations recognise that the sure way to win the current war they're waging against the West is to use the Ronald Reagan ploy of making the war simply too expensive for the other side to wage. If this turns out to be a terroist attack, it's clever, particularly if it can be repeated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Someone, be it a terrorist who forced his way into the cockpit or a pilot who has been recruited or forced to co-operate with the terrorists, had to have enough knowledge of the 777 to know which nav and comm. functions to disable - and in a very short time - to cause it to disappear (in an electronic sense) in a matter of seconds. After that, it's just a question of getting the aircraft a long way away from the commonsense search area before ditching it or flying it deliberately into the sea to destroy it. (When your foot soldiers are willing to die for the cause, the possibilities that can be employed are endless.)
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of two or three similar disappearances will be huge. The incredible expense, both to governments and airlines, in just trying to find the missing hull, will eventually become crippling; the drop off in passengers, as airline travel becomes something less than 100% safe in the public's perception, will hurt the airlines' bottom line; the increased security measures will make airline travel an even more painful experience than it has become since 2001.
       </p>
       <p>
        All will end up making travel very, very expensive, which means the bad guys will have won, for without easy and cheap air travel, Western society will not be what it has become over the last fifty years.

        <strong>
         Facts and Conclusions
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        If you take the point in time where transponders shut off as t=0, or corresponding location as origin point, a few results can be arrived at:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          Lack of debris on sea surface in the immediate vicinity of origin point lead us to believe that the aircraft did not structurally disintegrate, either due to aerodynamic forces or through explosives .
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Lack of IR signature confirmation by US SBIRS (Infra red spotting satellite system) also lends credence to the result that the aircraft did not explode in air at origin point.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Suicide theory can also be laid to rest because a pilot intent on committing suicide will not linger around in air and in fact will try to head down right away after turning off transponders leading to debris field around origin point.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          However, since we know as a fact that the aircraft eventually crashed, it leads us to believe that the aircraft was severely impaired at t=0, even if it was structurally intact. Whatever happened around t=0 was catastrophic enough to eventually bring the aircraft down. It not only took out communication ability of the pilots but a lot more than that.
         </p>
        </li>

          A set of pilots finding themselves in a catastrophic situation are highly likely to look for a landing strip ASAP. Given that they have likely lost their navigational ability as well (most likely), at night, they are going to head for nearest land, wherever they might think it is.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          If we take it as a fact from Malaysian authorities that the aircraft tried to turn around, it could be an indication that the pilots were in trouble and wanted to find land in haste.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Malaysian authorities claimed in the beginning (perhaps even now) that they lost radar contact at 2:40AM, more than an hour after t=0, if that is true then they were tracking an aircraft in huge trouble looking to land somewhere or anywhere. But it provides a radius of around one hour flying time from origin point to search for.

          Regarding US SBIRS lack of IR signature, it could depend on what their system is optimized to detect. A missile launch is sustained bright fire, an aircraft crashing in a fireball is short term quick burning fire. SBIRS probably accurately confirm that the aircraft did not explode in air, however, will it also accurately confirm that it did not burn under jungle canopy for a short time?.

        Suicide theory can also be laid to rest because a pilot intent on committing suicide will not linger around in air and in fact will try to head down right away after turning off transponders leading to debris field around origin point.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I strongly disagree. If one of the pilots had an insurance policy they hoped to leave to they family then it is in there interests for the aircraft never to be found. Switch off the transponders, drop altitude to avoid radar as best as possible, and head in the direction people aren't likely to look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most pilots probably know that air accident investigators are good at their job, and will want to make it as difficult as possible to find any evidence. If it was proved to be a suicide then no insurance payment.

       .  I have trouble believing this is sufficient evidence of a plane crash when we can see the evidence being tampered with.  Also, eye witness accounts aren't the most reliable thing in the world.  There are many instances of eyewitness accounts claiming the planes that had hit the towers were spiraling or on fire before they struck.

        The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:
Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity

       This is all a ploy from the Scientology community. The more I read about this, the more it leads back to Tom Cruise. In a time where Top Gun 2 rumors are running rampant, Maverick collaborates with Xenu to shed some much needed light onto his fading career and fictitious religious beliefs.

       Or maybe just maybe he had call forwarding on...or left the phone in his hotel room..or the bag got put on a different flight... The plane blew up or crashed. things just don't disappear off radar. people leave their phones all the time.

       Yeah but there was reported around 19 families that called the phones and they rang.
       <br/>
       With what you said one maybe, two is a long shot, but that many? Extremely unlikely imo, this day in age especially while flying your phone becomes a top priority for things to remember.

       reported by who? do you have a list of names? reports get stuff wrong all the time. maybe they are talking to two people in the same family without realizing it. maybe they are counting someone from another source which they don't know is the one they already know about. you can't go by reports this soon because they are still finding stuff out.

       Solid illogical fallacy, lets not believe any of them then.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is such a small chance that all 19 of those people forgot their phones or left them on call forward, that I would say it's impossible. Especially given the circumstances. How often do you honestly think people leave phones behind for flights? I would wager not every 19 out of 200 something people.

       tracing a cell phone is instantaneous, there is no "countdown" like you see in the movies. this guy probably left it somewhere or something. if the plane landed somewhere you would think a lot more then 4 or so cell phones would be ringing. I have google voice on my cell phone. if you call it and my phone is blown up it will just ring my office phone instead

       I think it has more to do with the phone switch than anything.  I've had to call phones before and they all take different times to connect.  I think the system is just trying to find the phone and rather have there be silence it just starts ringing then goes to voicemail real quick.

       It was possible to do this in 2001 with cell phones. The phones and the network have changed since to use denser cell tower infrastructure that requires less transmit power.

       The situation is largely pretty calm now in L'viv and I've heard third hand that Kiev is pretty calm now but that the barracades were still up.  In L'viv I'm seeing them really pimp the martyrs in the center of the square and they seem to just keep looping on the indignation of people dying.  One woman whom I spoke with was aware that snipers were shooting both sides but then she just looped on people dying.  This is some really big national thing for them and I don't quite get it but then again I don't quite get the gut feeling that so many people had about 3000 people dying on 9/11 to the point of maybe crying months later like they had lost their own family.  I just don't have that national big tribal identity thing so it doesn't tug on me the same way.  I'm not really convinced that Western Ukrainians will make the right decisions to move themselves forward through this political situation.

       I still think the stolen passports are irrelevant.  Just two random low-end criminals who were tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time... they even booked connecting flights out of China to Amsterdam (thus avoiding Chinese visa checks).

       I think that they are going to try to make this about enhancing the world wide computer integration with Interpol and other system to stop this from ever ......, so you see people died and they had fake passports so that can't be good.

       Then again I'm a programmer who rolls out software so I see how they play every opportunity to role out the next awful centralized computer system.  I'm sure that they have other terrible plans as well so don't let me derail your ideas.

       Big deal man.  I'm not getting paid for this and you can't be sure if I'm writing from bed before taking my first piss or at the end of the night after some beers.  Also you can't be sure if the person is a native English speaker or is currently living in another country and confusing their mind with learning another language.  Probably it would be easier for everyone if you just dropped your pet peave.  Chillax.

       I'm not sure what to make of that at the moment but I really wouldn't put it past people to organise a false flag and blame it on Iran. It makes no sense for Iran to sponsor a terror attack when relations are getting better between them and other countries but again, there is people that would do this.

       They were two Iranians that had tickets from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam via Beijing. They bought the stolen passports so they could seek asylum.

       Great post from Professional Pilots Rumour Network (PPRuNe):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I am not a professional pilot, so I will not be trying to add anything to that side of the thread, although I have read all the comments with interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am a retired police detective inspector, serving in the UK and HKG, leading serious crime squads and intel units, who moved into AVSEC after my police service. I spent several years managing airport security ops for a number of airlines at a couple of 'hot' Asian airports.
       </p>
       <p>
        Therefore, I will restrict my comments to the case-solving and AVSEC side of these events concerning MH370. First up, common sense and logic invariably worm best when trying to figure out these cases. Somebody, somewhere, knows a lot more than they are letting on for public consumption and I'd wager that various nations and agencies are not sharing what they know with the others involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         A large object, such as a B777 cannot simply disappear without somebody having some knowledge of its last known whereabouts. Failure to plot it on military radar seems highly unlikely. Failure to share that information seems rather more likely. In a busy shipping area it also seems highly unlikely that somebody wouldn't have seen something.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        It seems highly unlikely that it could have evaded detection and landed somewhere after a highjacking. First, it would need a considerable runway to accommodate it and, second, it would have had to overfly a hefty chunk of land and somebody would most likely have seen something.
       </p>
       <p>
        It seems much more likely, unfortunately, that it has gone down somewhere and the fact that nothing at all of it has been found strongly indicates that the search is not being conducted in the right area.
       </p>
       <p>
        That brings back round the loop to the failure of parties to share what they know of its whereabouts from various military and government services who track even the smallest of aircraft flying in airspace around their nations' borders.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there is pretty much no other logical conclusion that they are looking in the wrong places.

       I wonder what the deal is with KE672 at the time of MH370 disappearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That plane is approaching Kuala Lumpur, turns around, and speeds off at stupendous speeds. It then proceeds to disappear just before MH370. The flight path is strange as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this some sort of malfunction of the radar system?

       I would not trust the Flightradar too much. I have seen strange behavior there on air planes during landing at altitude 0 while I visually have seen an airplane on the runway. As far as I have seen, there is a delay between actual position and the showed. This may confuse the display. It is for consumer, not for aviation.

       "Curious distraction?" Aviation disasters don't happen frequently anymore. And to live in such an information intensive age and not have answers -- something governments and media outlets pride themselves on -- is rather frightening. What gall you must have. You don't have to follow this story but at least have a bit of perspective.

       just my 2cents as an aircraft maintenance engineer
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        probable theory for MH370: right wing structural failure?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3fj3qZ8.png">
        aircraft course changed from 25° track to 40° track
       </a>
       during its last moments on radar and its speed reduced from 474knots to 471knots. (something severely uncontrollable happened in seconds)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        case: right wing broken and aircraft spun to its right, giving no time to respond
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        case ruled out: engine failure gives few minutes to pilots to call for Mayday
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why only the right wing:
       <a href="http://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/wing-tip-damaged-in-2012-but-plane-safe-to-fly-again-1.505057">
        the right-wingtip damage from 2012
       </a>
       might have weakened the right wing structure at its base where it attaches to the fuselage.. as the wing also hosts an engine, a base structural damage will be catastrophic to the balance of aircraft and might start spinng downwards in no time.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I insist on wing damage due to its right wingtip repair history and its turn rightwards moments before missing.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       why will it turn right?: when the right wing is broken it loses lift, now there is more lift on left wing and immediately causes flight to turn/bend towards its right,
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3fj3qZ8.png">
        thats what you may observe in picture

       I like this theory since it matches a lot of reports that we have so far. Only problem about this is given the wing came off mid air at where it's located, the torque exerted onto the fuselage would be tremendous and probably tear a hole in the plane, if not apart. If it did happen then a explosive decompression should follow and we would expect random pieces of items from within the plane (magazines, pillows, airline safety cards) to be scattered from almost 35000 feet. They have been searching for that area for 5 days, it's quite unlikely they would have missed any vital piece of information like that. So I have a feeling MH370 actually flew past that area.

       I hate to say it, but a phone is probably a lot more likely to survive a plane crash than a human being. If that phone is in a pocket or backpack lined with clothing doubly so. They should just keep calling, Im guessing that either as the batteries die, or the phones get wet, they'll shut off one by one. Also if the phones are on cant they be tracked through GPS?

       The question is if any of the phones, be them android or apple have data network access too
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely some company phones would have admin access to check?

       Potentially attracting downvotes for this, but hear me out:
      </p>
      <p>
       A few assumptions will be made to facilitate.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Plane wasn't flying in inclement weather. Weather is ruled out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the plane suffered structural failure, it would ultimately end up 
a. disintegrating, assuming: 
i. the point at which it suffered this failure was at its last contact point; 
ii. the last known working altitude was 35,000 feet 
b. flying towards Beijing and maintaining a holding position, assuming: 
i. autopilot is engaged upon reaching cruise altitude of FL350, considering flight data is keyed in even before the engines are started and minimal input is required from pilots to maintain flight path towards destination (landing is another concern by itself)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The disappearance of the plane was only reported more than an hour into its flight. Upon leaving the range of an active base station a commercial pilot is required to maintain communication over a certain frequency with ATC. The fact that the plane went more than an hour into flight with no communication leads to question.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the plane was hit by a missile or had exploded in air, 
a. there would be debris;
b. there would have been a registered heat signal by military trackers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Explaining the phone calls and connections and yet no sign of telecommunications companies making an effort to track down the estimate locations of these numbers, even if it was just an effort to debunk conspiracy theories like these.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Please correct me if I am wrong, and if anything else has been thoroughly debunked, please add on. Speculation might be futile at this stage, but, well, here we are.

       If I remember well also in that Rio-Paris AirFrance flight that crashed someone's cell was connected after the crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       But while the AirFrance plane crashed in a no-radar area in the middle of the Atlantic, the Malaysian flight simply disappeared, and in an area much smaller than the Atlantic ocean.

       If someone important enough to a government was on board that plane, they could make it go missing.

       There's maybe a half dozen countries that have the tech to do this and leave everyone alive.

       The first I heard of this story with a plan going completely missing, I thought... "Huh, must've crashed in the water, somewhere."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I learned that they can't find a signal or ping from the black box.
Then I learned that the phones of these people are still connecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm changing my thinking to government sponsored hacking. A stealth drone goes up, then relays signals to the planes computer to hijack it and reroute it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plane goes effectively missing, and phones stay in tact.

       This is a large thread so forgive me if this question has already been answered. Why don't all planes - or at least all planes that fly over large bodies of water - carry tracking devices in case they go missing? Like lojack for cars, but for airplanes.

      <p>
       From what I gathered, I pieced together these theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) MH370 did not disintegrate mid air. If the plane disintegrated mid air at 35000ft, it would have caused an explosive decompression and threw large amount of cabin items scattering onto the sea where it's location was last reported. However there's been 5 days of search if there's any debris (magazines, safety cards, pillows) then it's quite likely the search team would have encountered some, but it's yet to be found.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) The plane probably glided afar from the location of incident. Following the point above, given that the plane did not disintegrate mid-air, a sudden loss of total communication would indicate something catastrophic happened, or deliberate. Since modern plane runs on multiple systems, losing one system such as hydraulics would not easily compromise other systems such as transponder or ADS-B, which is used by flightradar24 to gather the location details. This would suggest the failure was induced deliberately, such as by tripping a circuit breaking or simply switching off the transponder.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) This is likely an intentional act. Due to the lack of debris to be found in the area of incident, the plane is likely to have been intact since it disappeared off radar. Pilots should have access to flight charts showing airspaces and radar information. It would be possible for pilots to deliberately avoid radar detection (either by flying out of range into the sea or flying low, which would not be feasible for commercial jets). It was over the sea when this happened, and it is between airspace handovers, although I could not find any information about airspace boundaries in Malaysia and Vietnam, but it could easily be a blind spot for ATCs.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) There's not likely any survivors. There's been suggested the plane could have landed somewhere, but with 200+ passengers onboard if they all landed it would be an operational nightmare to keep them hostage, a logistics horror to keep them fed, and impossible to keep them quiet, especially when everyone is carrying a phone. It could be argued not everyone on earth has GSM coverage, but if they can find an airport that's going to land a fully loaded 777, it's probably not in a village with nobody in. It also does not make sense for anyone to keep 200+ people hostage without coming out with demands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gathering the observations I've made so far, my conspiracy would be this being a deliberate act with only people onboard involved. A person on the flight could likely be involved with switching off communication with the outside world, steering the plane out of ATC radar'd airspace, reaching the ocean and very likely plunging the plane 90º vertically into the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was done over the sea it would create a small debris zone, and extremely likely the debris would have sank into the sea immediately. The passengers might not even be aware of this happened while the flight was deliberately flown off course until the rapid descent at the end, which would take less than a minute from cruising altitude to reach the surface of the sea, if anyone were to try and get help with a phone, this would be almost impossible even with phone reception.

       It's now being reported that the plane had another 7 hours of flight time on it's fuel. Is it possible the plane didn't take a sharp left turn (or did for a little bit) and then headed to Russia to land on a secret airstrip (an Area 51 kind of airstrip) if it's not in water somewhere? Maybe?

       The Australian government says it knows the names of the six citizens believed to be on board and admitted it "fears the worst".
      </p>
      <p>
       Consular officials are in contact with family members.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement: "The Australian government fears the worst for those aboard missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia’s parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs, Brett Mason, said the families of the missing passengers "must be desperately concerned".
      </p>
      <p>
       He told reporters: "The thoughts of the Australian government and I'm sure all Australians go out to them at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There's a lot of speculation [about what might have occurred] and I don't want to add to that speculation."

        Military radar trace shows MH370 turn-back, but no distress signal
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MH370 could have made a turn-around midway through its flight to Beijing.
       </p>
       <p>
        there was possible indication that the aircraft did a turn-back (ATB / equipment failure).... "However, there was no such distress signal or call made by the pilot about an ATB. We are equally puzzled by this."
       </p>
       <p>
        Malaysia Airlines said that the plane took off at 12.41am Malaysian time and that it disappeared from air traffic control radar in Subang at 2.40am.... But Fredrik Lindahl, the chief executive of Flightradar24, an online aircraft tracking service, had said that the last radar contact had been at 1.19am, less than 40 minutes after the flight began.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So from the official version the flight disappeared over the South Sea of China, now they are offering the possibility that this is false, and the plane
       <a href="http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BV376_MALCRA_G_20140309010223.jpg">

       Just how likely is it for the plane to have gone down just when it disappeared from the radar and NO debris be seen? The fact that any debris under the predicted flightpath is yet to be found, means that the plane diverted off-course for a considerable distance?

       Fairly likely considering the size of an ocean  vs. A plane. Plus it didn't necessarily crash exactly where they lost contact and currents can carry debris.

       Terrorism and catastrophic engine failure leave miles of debris &amp; you’d have to gently land on water to disappear &amp; if you can gently land on water you can signal for help. Also why does the blackbox not have a depth sensing escape pod buoy? i could make this kids in shop class can make a depth sensor and escape pod for BlackBox in case of sinking its 2014 why does Boeing have such an inexcusably crappy blackbox?
 on top of that the TV is streaming terrorism and Iran most Americans don’t even know we made al-Qaida to fight Russia in Afghanistan Ronald Reagan’s Mujahidin most don’t remember the gulf of Tonkin resolution that sent us to Vietnam war over an attack that never happened now they say 2 passports from Iran and hint at Wahhabi al-Qaida being equal to Shia Iran when all Wahhabi hate Shia and all al-Qaida hate Iran for being Shia and not Sunni we also funded Haya Amadau Sanogo Alqaeda leader of the Mali coup we trained him with CIA in USArmy in the USA. We make monsters and break them for the war tax and get shocked and awed into believing we should go die fighting the monsters we make never admitting to the watchers we make the monsters we fight and admiting to the readers we made them schizophrenic external policy. Most are so ignorant to factual on the record American military history it's been made easy to be the bad guy because you think you’re the good guy USArmy 3rd ID 45K

       What if this is a false-flag operation by whatever agency(CIA, mossad and the usual guys)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we should take a close look on how the media handles the passport question during the following months or whatever. With all the weird things going on about the stolen passports etc this will give a spark in the campaign of getting biometric(or even worse) passports - which means we will be tracked even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might be wrong but compare to 9/11. Before that it was relatively easy to fly but now it's a pain in the ass(especially in the US with all their TSA and stuff). Even though 9/11 wasn't planned by anyone else than Al-Qaida this might just be the next step in even more "security", control and surveillance.

       at 9/11 , they used their own passports. So wrong passports is just a thing. The explanation of illegal immigrants could be sufficient. Remember, they asked for the cheapest routing to Europe when booking - not for a flight with MH. And they had connection flights booked as well.

       Actually, here's my conspiracy theory: Ukraine is the centre of attention, then a plane goes missing. While the drums of war are beating in the Ukraine, mysterious reports are showing up at the Malaysian airlines; stolen passports and phantom phone calls. Then the 2 persons with stolen passports are Iranian, and then the CIA is not ruling out terrorism. Finally, without the actual whereabouts of the plane (or even if they did), they say that they have found explosive evidence and blame it on Iran. Then, they will use this as an excuse to invade Iran, hence the nuclear deal is a gone-case and that Iran and Russia were on the list anyways. But starting with Iran is the best choice because Russia will at least retaliate with enough force to do some huge amount of damage.

       Anybody mention methane bubbles and clouds released from the ocean floor? Was there any siesmic activity? Not only could it jam jet engines,  it could cause a plane that successfully landed on water to sink without damage. Far fatched but better that aliens or the a wormhole into another dimension like the series "the event".

       My first thought on Saturday morning and I was in Malaysia , heard the first reports on TV was : there is something ongoing, not intended to go public. They just have a problem now, it cannot be hidden today -they can just create foggy and fuzzy statements.

       Here is what popped into my well medicated head:
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a government organization had reason to not want the plane to reach China. Maybe there was a Chinese agent on the plane with sensitive stolen information that China wanted. Once they discover that the info or item is in route, only way to stop that is to stop the plane. This wound cause the sort of reaction we are seeing from all parties. Chinese agent does not mean Chinese.

       another theory: maybe they convinced the people on board that any cell phone would detonate a bomb, so everyone has given up their phone, and they found a way to knock out the pilots and have taken everyone hostage. But wouldn't the plane emit its own signals, independent of human use? The hijackers would have had to have a lot of training and precision to pull this off. Of course this is the best possible scenario :/

Maybe Russia has something to do with this. You know, trying to divert the media attention from Ukraine while preparing for something big. Also not giving a closure to the mystery just yet, so that the media stays hooked.

       It was possible to do this in 2001 with cell phones. The phones and the network have changed since to use denser cell tower infrastructure that requires less transmit power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Current phones can't be used to call from 30 k feet, but in 2001 the phones had stronger signal.

       wait what? I thought they had the technology to jam transmissions so why does it matter what airline they're in? They'd provoke more of a defense response flying a jet that has been missing and made world news, than they would flying an aircraft with a low safety rating......

       Okay... here's a stab at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To 86 something means to "be out of something" in slang, and we're quite obviously missing a plane, so it has been "86-ed".
      </p>
      <p>
       4560 (days after sept. 11, 2001) - wtf, but okay let's go with it!
      </p>
      <p>
       86 = 8, 6
      </p>
      <p>
       4560 / 8 = 570
      </p>
      <p>
       4560 / 6 = 760
      </p>
      <p>
       86 + 239 (number of passengers) = 325
      </p>
      <p>
       570 + 760 + 325 = 1655
      </p>
      <p>
       4560 / 1655 = 2.7522 (approx)
      </p>
      <p>
       Put that number into mapquest to give a location on the Earth's surface and...

       The location is near Kuala Lumpar, the capital of.... Malaysia! Quite the co-inky-dink!
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane is probably parked there or something. /s

       Ha! Perhaps I should quite my job and charge people for this sort of nonsense? ;-)

       Big deal man.  I'm not getting paid for this and you can't be sure if I'm writing from bed before taking my first piss or at the end of the night after some beers.  Also you can't be sure if the person is a native English speaker or is currently living in another country and confusing their mind with learning another language.  Probably it would be easier for everyone if you just dropped your pet peave.  Chillax.

       They're allowed into the EU if they use certain, more modern aircraft in their fleet.  However I don't think they've come as far as here.

       Now you are arguing with NIST's official version.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:
Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity

       The question is if any of the phones, be them android or apple have data network access too
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely some company phones would have admin access to check?
