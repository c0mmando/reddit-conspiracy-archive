       The daily mail, not the best of sources but it is what it is, reported:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Astronomers are expected to announce they have found 'primordial gravitational waves' - an echo of the big bang in which the universe came into existence 14bn years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Described as 'like a message from the dawn of time', if confirmed it  it would be a groundbreaking discovery that would change the face of physics and give scientists their first glimpse of how the universe was born.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gravitational waves, the last untested prediction of Albert Einsteinâ€™s General Theory of Relativity,  are minuscule ripples in the fabric of the universe that carry energy across space - rather like the waves than travel across an ocean.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The team of scientists have only said they will unveil a 'major discovery' in the field of astrophysics on Monday (March 17) in a presentation at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).

       Most stuff on the electric universe theory I've seen don't say that gravity doesn't exist or play a part in the universe, just that the influence of electromagnetism might be stronger than expected. They're usually also quick to say that the research needs to be done before it's developed into a proper theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       But meh, if a flawed theory needs to die to accommodate the truth, no biggie.

       I think gravity waves specifically go against EU theory because it is tied in with the theory of relativity.  Which I think is at odds with the EU theory.
       <br/>
       Talking about the smaller scale like star formation, I think the EU theory is pretty solid and getting better everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       but when talking about redshift and the big bang, EU is getting weaker.

       so it does look like there really is a major announcement coming tomorrow, and it does seem legitimately believed that the announcement is what you posted. Whether that is what was discovered or not is another matter, but it's what is expected that it is. That article also has a link to a Guardian article about it as well. Sounds like the researchers involved can expect a Nobel Prize out of it, should be pretty exciting.

       Just spitballing here - one of the few science related things that get suppressed are aether discoveries. Something proving some kind of aether could have huge commercial ramifications, which is why it is suppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also commercial fusion, something which makes oil obsolete, a new way to make oil, anything commercial. The question is WHY it's being deleted.

It looks like it would make for a good reason we are trying to invade Iran. It appears this guy has working experiments. Don't get your hopes up though. This could be all crap. You never know though.

       looks like his only post, you can grab a bit torrent of everything. It's too much stuff to link and put out here. It's definitely above my pay grade though. Patents, videos, pics, it's all in there. Apparently our government might want him dead for some reason/s. I have just started to go through it all. There is a lot of work into this, it would be hard to imagine someone doing all this if it weren't going to go anywhere. You can supposedly do an experiment with a plastic bottle. So that sounds easy enough to disprove it.

       Exactly, believing the garbage they spew on r/science, then over the last year we have apparently cured aids, cured cancer, discovered the worst disease known to mankind, and found "evidence" that the universe could be a holographic simulation.

       People are stupid. They think science is any different than politics these days. All you have to do is put the words "Higgs Boson" is a title and 3/4 of reddit jizz their pants. Even though less than 10% of that final 1/4 could even tell you what it means.

       So, all I can speculate on is that, they may have made a great discovery on gravitational lensing, or something to that effect. That's all I have for you sorry it's not more.
