<p>So the next time you think something is offensive or you want to be honest and you realize it could cost you your job, stop and realize thats the choke chain you should worry about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your title is on to something, but it has nothing to do with racism, and much more with political speech.  Racisim is fueled by hatred, which can be used to control people.  Think about when Bush said &#39;they hate our freedom&#39;.  He might as well have said &#39;those fucking Muslim terrorists hate our freedom&#39;.  At this point, he was able to target a group for &#39;human-rights suspension&#39;, expanding his own political power.</p>

<p>There is lots of propaganda out there, but it is designed to control a populations perception of political events.  Usually, by providing lots of information that doesn&#39;t fit the truth, so when an individual is actually exposed to the truth, they dismiss it cause it doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>When controlling culture, it comes down to training people to dismiss critical thinking/analysis as &#39;conspiracies&#39;, and training them to look for the convenient propagandized stories that tie up all the loose ends.</p>

<p>There are a lot of conspiracies out there that are wrong, but if you can convince a populous that anything contradicted by government-provided evidence (or even just official denial) is a conspiracy theory, then it is trivial to hide government activity.  That is, until a few people catch on, and somebody shows up with proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying absolutely. Free speech was the number 1 concern in America and most people can&#39;t stand behind their own (because they have nothing significant to say).</p>

<p>This situation with the open NSA is absolute death, but no one cares, no one gives a shit, and it&#39;s all become a joke at this point.</p>

<p>Very insightful, we feel powerful expressing opinions between masses of people we may never meet, but still isolated &amp; therefore impotent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny thing I noticed on Facebook. Two old friends of mine (who are die-hard neo-con Fox guys) are always posting memes about the blacks, islam &amp; gays. They then post about how they aren&#39;t racist or xenophobic for saying the things they do. Whenever anyone challenges them they hide behind the bible or don&#39;t even reply. The lefties get all riled up and try to decimate them with their intellectual superiority.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all bullshit to divide us and keep us distracted from the extraction of wealth currently being undertaken by the elites running the world.</p>

<p>This is the one place I know of on the internet that rarely goes into identity politics and focuses rather on the underlying issues.</p>
