       We're all trying to make this into something. Hell, I thought it was hijacked by North Korea. But the most likely cause is simply incompetence.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         What if a dozen nations searching for the plane are so uncoordinated they're searching the same wrong locations?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What if a pilot did
         <em>
          not
         </em>
         make contact with the plane shortly after it disappeared but instead made contact with some stoned fisherman?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What if the mobile phones were not active and the ringing could be explained by some network feature (like call-waiting makes a ringing sound)?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What if no-one spotted "low flying lights" or they were just some other aircraft?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What if the email from a New Zealand oil worker was bullshit and that's why no news agency has found and interviewed him?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What if the Malaysian authorities appoint people based on reasons other than competence, and these people really just don't know how to find plane crashes?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What if everyone is embarrassed about the passports and just hopes a missing plane will overshadow that fuck up?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What if they didn't expand the search area fast enough and the currents have taken most of the wreckage out to sea?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What if the plane crashed for some normal mundane plane-crashing reason (like a bomb, or fault) and it simply just
         <em>
          does
         </em>
         take time to find the wreckage but the media is so caught up in turning this into a giant twilight zone that they've worked everyone into a frenzy?

       AND it was 2am pitch dark. A Catastrophic electrical failure and inexperience of pilots means analog instrumentation was useless and trying to land at your destination while playing MS flight sim X with the monitor off gives you some idea of the hell those poor pilots tried to land with.

       That makes zero sense in reference to my post. The captain even talks about how of it did sink, that passengers could get off in time before it went under. Why would the captain say that, yet claim it is unsinkable?

       My claim is still true, that it was never advertised as unsinkable.

       Just to play this game...  Does the word 'advertise' only apply to those who own/work for/on the ship when they speak of it? I feel as if you are saying, speaking of a item without holding a stake in it (i.e captain, ship owner) is something other than advertising it.  I would argue that the papers saying such is a form of advertising, albeit by a third party.

       Therefor making your claim in fact false.

       You mean, like the captain of the Titanic saying the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Capt. Smith maintained that shipbuilding was such a perfect art nowadays that absolute disaster, involving the passengers on a great modern liner, was quite unthinkable. Whatever happened, he contended, there would be time before the vessel sank to save the lives of every person on board.
       </p>
       <p>
        "I will go a bit further," he said. "I will say that I cannot imagine any condition which could cause a ship to founder. I cannot conceive of any vital disaster happening to this vessel. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that."
       </p>

       One doesn't trip a fuse and lose all instrumentation.  They are on completely separate redundant systems.  Those who would fight this clear truth have obvious alterior motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       They refuse to discuss the in flight internet, that would allow for FULL tracking.  The flight could not have been lost.  We were served a fresh distraction.  Likely to cover for something absolutely horrible Israel is doing.

       Do you actually understand how redundancy works?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an honest question, because this comment tree began with one person not understanding that analog equipment is used as one part of a significant failsafe system (the whole "playing Flight Sim X with the monitor off" was just icing on the cake of ignorance), then another guy who appears ignorant of the relevant field of engineering. Honestly, your comment amused me the most: the combination of ignorance and arrogance when someone implied a level of sophistication in aircraft engineering was priceless. (It's almost like you
       <em>
        actually think
       </em>
       you're being clever.) It's not like aerospace and aeronautical engineers study basically
       <a href="http://www.ae.utexas.edu/attachments/article/322/2014-2016DegreePlanFlowChart.pdf">
        the same university curriculum

       Eh you're right. I am coming from a place of ignorance. I know about the computer-hardware side of redundancy but not much else. A comment saying "Airplanes are like spacecraft. Nothing can go wrong" was more what I was saying. No system can be perfect no matter what you throw in it was more what I was trying to get across.

       30 seconds with a search engine will show you the obvious safety mechanisms engineered into the new airplane.  The "leading" theory that the cabin slowly depressurized is also a lie.  Alarms would have been whining if the cabin air pressure dropped even 1 PPI.

       Using my google account I can find out the exact location of my phone (as long as it is connected to the internet). Hard to believe something like a state of the art plane does not have some sort of GPS tracking device attached somewhere to it. Heck, most rental car companies have it fixed in their vehicles.
