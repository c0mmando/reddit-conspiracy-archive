<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In the 1950&#39;s and early 1960&#39;s, the agency gave mind-altering drugs to hundreds of unsuspecting Americans in an effort to explore the possibilities of controlling human consciousness. Many of the human guinea pigs were mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts and prostitutes -- &#39;&#39;people who could not fight back,&#39;&#39; as one agency officer put it. In one case, a mental patient in Kentucky was dosed with LSD continuously for 174 days.” - New York Times1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MK-ULTRA is the codename given to a CIA research operation into biological behavioral engineering, also known as mind control. Many people are familiar with the operation but incorrectly assume that it was limited to LSD research. While there were plenty of resources devoted to LSD research, it was only one area of a vast field of mind control operations. MK-ULTRA researcher Ike Feldman said himself that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The LSD... that was just the tip of the iceberg... Espionage. Assassinations. Dirty tricks. Drug experiments. Sexual encounters and the study of prostitutes for clandestine use. That is what I was doing when I worked for George White and the CIA.”2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MK-ULTRA had several precursors. There was Project Chatter in 1947, which tested drugs such as the infamous Scopalmine during interrogations.3 There was Project Bluebird in 1949, which began studies into hypnosis.4 The document describing the initiation of Project Bluebird outlines these special problems, among many others, that they were hoping to address:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can we in a matter of an hour, two hours, one day, etc., induce an hypnotic condition in an unwilling subject to such an extent that he will perform an act for our benefit? </p>

<p>Can we create by post-hypnotic control an action contrary to an individual&#39;s basic moral principles? </p>

<p>Can we guarantee total amnesia under any and all conditions? </p>

<p>Can we &quot;alter&quot; a person&#39;s personality? How long will it </p>

<p>Can we devise a system for making unwilling subjects into willing agents and then transfer that control to untrained agency agents in the field by use of codes or identifying signs or credentials?5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Project Artichoke began in 1951, with a scope of ... “Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?”6 All of the above projects were shuttled into MK-ULTRA in 1953, under the Technical Services Division, combining over 150 sub-projects7, undertaken at over 80 institutions8 such as universities, hospitals, prisons and pharmaceutical companies. Many of the projects were covertly ran through front organizations without the knowledge of the institution that hosted them. </p>

<p>The experiments and operations under MK-ULTRA have been shrouded in extreme secrecy. When it was enacted, then-CIA Director Allen Dulles exempted the program from normal financial controls, allowed the Technical Services Staff to begin experiments without contracts or written agreements with leadership, and ordered the financial office to pay any cost blindly on the signature of Sidney Gottlieb.9 CIA Document 17748 states that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There are just two individuals in TSD who have full substantial knowledge of the program and most of that knowledge is unrecorded. Both are highly skilled, highly motivated, professionally competent individuals. Part of their competence lies in their command of intelligence tradecraft. In protecting the sensitive nature of the American intelligence capability to manipulate human behavior, they apply “need to know” doctrine to their professional associates and their clerical assistants to a maximum degree...</p>

<p>TSD has pursued a policy of minimum documentation in keeping with the high sensitivity of some of the projects... The lack of consistent records precludes use of routine inspection procedures and raised a variety of questions regarding management and fiscal controls.”10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The two individuals the document refers to are likely Sidney Gottleib, the director of MK-ULTRA, and Richard Helms, the Deputy Director of the CIA. In 1973, when Richard Helms became the Director of the CIA, he ordered all of the available MK-ULTRA files to be destroyed.11 Thanks to a clerical error, about 20,000 files survived the destruction order. However, not only were most of the files destroyed, but many experiments were so sensitive that they were never recorded in the first place, so we must understand that as brutal and astonishing as the recorded experimentation is, we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. </p>

<p>Another file, MK-ULTRA document 87624, states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“6% of the projects are of such an ultra-sensitive nature that they cannot and should not be handled by means of contracts which would associate CIA or the Government with the work in question. This 6% of the current research effort now lies entirely within two well-defined fields of endeavor... As present this results in ridiculous contracts, often with cut-outs, which do not spell out the scope or intent of the work.”12</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first &#39;well-defined field of endeavor&#39; described by the document is developing the capability of biological and chemical weapons for the purpose of mind control. The second field of endeavor is entirely redacted from the document.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Ewan Cameron</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Ewan Cameron was a Scottish-born Psychiatrist who worked in the United States since World War II and subsequently accepted an invitation to contract for the CIA. He would commute to the McGill University system in Canada to conduct experiments on brainwashing, &#39;psychic driving&#39; and other forms of psychological torture. Cameron had a theory that a person with a psychological illness such as schizophrenia would benefit from having their brain essentially wiped clean, presuming the patient would redevelop their cognitive functions without the disorder. The CIA felt that brainwashing had obvious intelligence applications.13</p>

<p>Dr. Cameron had a &#39;depattering&#39; program he used to erase the minds of his patients that began with 15 – 30 days of &#39;sleep therapy&#39; (sometimes lasting as long as 65 days), where the patient would sleep all day and night, with the exception of three brief periods where a sleep-inducing drug cocktail and electroshock therapy would be administered. Cameron&#39;s electroshock therapy has been documented to be between 20 – 40 times more intense than the professional standard at the time. Instead of 110 volts at a fraction of a second, Cameron used 150 volts for an initial shock lasting 1 full second, and then between 5 and 9 additional shocks during the convulsions of the patient, using a muscle relaxant to prevent permanent damage. The next step was to play taped messages to a patient 16 hours a day for multiple months in an attempt to program the desired behavior.14</p>

<p>Over half of his patients have suffered permanent amnesia of their lives before their &#39;depattering&#39;. They were not told that they would be participating in experiments prior to their admittance. A large group of Cameron&#39;s victims brought a lawsuit against the CIA in 1988 which was settled out of court, so the agency would not have to admit any official wrongdoing. </p>

<p>Why the interest in electroshock? CIA Document 190885 reveals that the CIA was interested in the “guaranteed amnesia” that electric shock often resulted in.15</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>&#39;Front&#39; Organizations</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The C.I.A. used a front organization called the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology to help pay for the work of Dr. Cameron, a psychiatrist who directed the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal. Dr. Cameron died in 1967.</p>

<p>The money was provided to Dr. Cameron as part of the C.I.A.&#39;s effort in the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s to develop drugs or techniques that could control human behavior. </p>

<p>Patients of Dr. Cameron were subjected to a regimen that included heavy doses of LSD and barbiturates, the application of powerful electric shocks two or three times a day, and prolonged periods of drug-induced sleep. According to Government records, the patients and their relatives were not told they were taking part in experiments.</p>

<p>Joseph Rauh, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, said many of Dr. Cameron&#39;s patients &#39;were very greatly damaged by the experiments.&#39;” - New York Times16</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The use of &#39;fronts&#39;, meaning a private enterprise secretly owned by the CIA to conceal affiliations with the agency, is standard practice and widespread through MK-ULTRA. The Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology was nominally associated with Stanford and considered to be relatively prestigious in the field. It would often award &#39;cover grants&#39; to conceal that the bulk of its research had military intelligence applications.17</p>

<p>3 hours on LSD can feel like an eternity in hell... I just can&#39;t wrap my head around 174 days. It is without exaggeration some of the worst mental torture ever unleashed on man.</p>

<p>All of this began less than a decade after the Nuremberg trials, which stated never again shall science be performed on patients without their willing consent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also if you can use the experience to move further into yourself working towards experiencing love and compassion and move away from fear based mental structures you can theoretically make the experience how you want it.
But you need to have extreme control over you mind and under circumstances like that im sure it would be difficult, but not impossible. All LSD does is force open the mind to its full potential. You usually dont want to be forcing it open like that, but if you dont have a choice the only thing you can do is move further into yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is true, however all you have to do it double the dose and bam! your tripping again. same is true for mushrooms. I just cannot imagine 174 days of LSD. I have had a couple bad trips in my day and it felt like an eternity in hell. Every negetive emotion simultaneously running through me. visions of a white robed, white bearded man walking with a gandalf like cane turning into demons and staring right at me. horrible visions and hallucinations. i honestly thought that i was never going to be sane again. 6 months of continuos tripping is torture. plain and simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) That is in rabbits.</p>

<p>2) They are inferring desensitization by the number of &quot;head bobs&quot;, they weren&#39;t actually measuring brain activity, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>3) They administered another drug, DOI, after the LSD in order to elicit the head bobs. Might there be some interaction between the two drugs that could explain any change in behavior? It is also seems to me to be quite presumptuous to assume &#39;head bobs&#39; is an objective metric for tracking sensitivity at the 5-HT2A receptors just because activity there tends to increase head bobs. </p>

<p>4) I was responding to guy who claimed you &quot;run out of transmitters&quot; which is both untrue, and impossible. You would die if you actually &quot;[ran] out of transmitters&quot;</p>

<p>It seriously boggles my mind how people don&#39;t understand that every drug, literally every single drug, effects each individual differently, when it comes to tolerance, absorption and the breakdown of the drug.</p>

<p>Overall I really wouldn&#39;t knock behavioral observation as a way of qualitatively measuring receptor desensitization in a known pathway, ask anyone who&#39;s dropped acid!</p>

<p>You&#39;re correct about the running out of transmitters part though, that&#39;s a common urban legend. There are drugs that produce lasting deficits of actual neurotransmitters though, such as serotonin for several days after taking MDMA (and some related SSRAs).</p>

<p>About LSD. Yes. I had to. It was a hard choice for me, because it DOES fuck you up, but I was aching for the experience and enjoyed it. I was studying comparative religion and needed a spiritual experience. I don&#39;t resort to simple tricks like that anymore. But it honestly helped me to transcend the first couple of times.

<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://www.levity.com/aciddreams/samples/bz.html">According to Dr. Solomon Snyder, a leading psychopharmacologist at Johns Hopkins University, which conducted drug research for the Chemical Corps, &quot;The army&#39;s testing of LSD was just a sideshow compared to its use of BZ.&quot; Clinical studies with EA-2277 (the code number for BZ) were initiated at Edgewood Arsenal in 1959 and continued until 1975. During this period an estimated twenty-eight hundred soldiers were exposed to the superhallucinogen. A number of military personnel have since come forward claiming that they were never the same after their encounter with BZ.</a></em></p>

<p>By this time the superhallucinogen was ready for deployment in a grenade, a 750-pound cluster bomb, and at least one other large-scale bomb. In addition the army tested a number of other advanced BZ munitions, including mortar, artillery, and missile warheads. The superhallucinogen was later employed by American troops as a counterinsurgency weapon in Vietnam, and according to CIA documents there may be contingency plans to use the drug in the event of a major civilian insurrection. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cameron served as President of the Canadian, American and World Psychiatric Associations, the American Psychopathological Association and the Society of Biological Psychiatry during the 1950s. Notwithstanding a career of honors, and leadership in early 1950s psychiatric circles, he has been heavily criticized in some circles for his administration without patient consent of disproportionately-intense electroshock therapy and experimental drugs, including LSD, which caused some patients to become permanently comatose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was head of the World Psychiatric Association at one time, I believe.  One of the unethical incidences that I read about which involved a patient of his was one where the patient was involuntarily dosed fatally with mescaline by way of injection.  Something like a fatal dose by many factors, whereby the patient essentially hallucinated to death by heart attack.</p>

<p>As I said- unethical.  If someone can be helped by psychiatry that&#39;s swell, yet I think it is very important for people to understand the history of this field of soft science which is involved in so many peoples&#39; lives with such important repercussions.</p>

<p>To sum up, as I understand it, the man was given a world-class medical approval at the time, yet was essentially conducting illegal psychological warfare research on non-consenting Canadian patients, and being paid to do so by the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not relevant at all. Scopolamine is largely incapable of &#39;brainwashing&#39; someone. While it can break down their will to a certain extent, the success of it is unpredictable because of the vivid and terrifying hallucinations that can complicate the process. Also, the individuals are so incapacitated that they believe they are somewhere else. They are rendered incapable of operating basic machinery.</p>

<p>Vice drastically overplayed the drug and its exaggerated local reputation without looking into the background of its pharmacology and the actuality of its effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another great and well sourced post. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to add something which is an opinion only so make of if what you will. I believe that taking away the ethical practices of medical and psychological research which has been embedded for a while could possibly garner results that can not be seen due to the limited nature of applied morality. These experiments were way more extreme than would be allowed because of the obvious implications for the subject. </p>

<p>Is it possible that the intense courses of drugs coupled with other techniques got results that remain a secret?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Electrical Stimulation of the brain was also a big part of MKUltra. Read here some of what Dr. Delgado discovered using brain electrodes that he called &quot;Stimoceivers.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Delgado, a neurosurgeon and professor at Yale, [57][58][59][60][61][62] received funding for brain electrode research on children and adults. He did research in monkeys and cats, and in one paper describes the cats as &quot;mechanical toys.&quot; He was able to control the movements of his animal and human subjects by pushing buttons on a remote transmitter box. In 1966, Delgado asserted that his experiments &quot;support the distasteful conclusion that motion, emotion and behavior can be directed by electrical forces. Humans can be controlled like robots by push buttons.&quot; [63] BB 88, 89, MC 147</p>

<p>An 11-year old boy underwent a partial change of identity upon remote stimulation of his brain electrode: &quot;Electrical stimulation of the superior temporal convolution induced confusion about his sexual identity. These effects were specific, reliable, and statistically significant. For example, the patient said, &#39;I was thinking whether I was a boy or a girl,&#39; and &#39;I&#39;d like to be a girl.&#39;&quot; After one of the stimulations the patient suddenly began to discuss his desire to marry the male interviewer. Temporal-lobe stimulation produced in another patient open manifestations and declarations of pleasure, accompanied by giggles and joking with the therapist. In two adult female patients stimulation of the same region was followed by discussion of marriage and expression of a wish to marry the therapist. [64] BB 88, 89</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mindcontrol10pg">http://www.wanttoknow.info/mindcontrol10pg</a></p>

<p>Perhaps more interesting is Dr. Delgado said repeatedly that he reached a point in his research wherein he discovered he didn&#39;t need the stimoceivers at all, and was able to get the same results using only &quot;shaped and pulsed EM waves.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We take up Delgado&#39;s research on electromagnetic fields and their effect on people. &quot;I could later do with electro-magnetic radiation what I did with the stimoceiver. It&#39;s much better because there&#39;s no need for surgery,&quot; he explains. &quot;I could make apes go to sleep. But I stopped that line of research fifteen years ago. But I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve done a lot more research on this in both the US and Russia.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/psychcivilization.php">http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/psychcivilization.php</a></p>

<p>Delgado&#39;s also interviewed by CNN on their special on Radio Frequency Weapons:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMNa4RcmKqA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMNa4RcmKqA</a></p>

<p>Also worth noting that MKUltra subprojects included &quot;techniques of activation of the human organism by remote electronic means.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At least one subproject of the MK Ultra project was about the electronic control of human behaviour (subproject 119). Subproject 119[40] had the purpose to provide funds for a study to make a critical review of the literature and scientific developments related to the recording, analysis and interpretation of bio-electric signals from the human organism, and activation of the human behaviour by remote means. The survey encompassed five main areas: techniques of activation of the human organism by remote electronic means, bio-electric sensors, recording, analysis and standardization of data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard that said before, yet there are also engineers who seem to have different views on this. For instance, in the CNN report I linked to an electrical engineer builds an &quot;RF mind interference device&quot; based off Russian schematics. He seems confident in his assertion that: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In three weeks, I could put together a weapon that would take care of a whole town.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>by building a weapon that would</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Induce, basically, what would be considered hallucinations in people. Direct them to do things against their so-called better judgment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prototype he built was demonstrated successfully transmitting images into a CNN reporter&#39;s mind. </p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly possible the military is working with technology that the general public isn&#39;t privy to. Also worth noting is that Delgado wasn&#39;t working with TMS at all, but implants which he later found were, themselves, antiquated. </p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that the capabilities of RF interaction with the human body isn&#39;t a subject well-known to many civilian scientists. There are even reports of RF being bounced off the ionosphere still being capable of having biological effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another RF weapon that was ready for use back in 1978 was developed under the guise of Operation PIQUE. Developed by the CIA, the plan was to bounce high powered radio signals off the ionosphere to affect the mental functions of people in selected areas, including Eastern European nuclear installations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d agree with the three weeks part, I&#39;m actually <a href="http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/68518-rtms-for-temporary-induction-of-savant-abilities/">building an rTMS machine currently</a>, and easily could have finished it in three weeks had I been doing it full time.</p>

<p>The problem is doing it remotely.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t targeting the entire brain, you&#39;re targeting very specific regions. In my case, I&#39;m using low frequency to temporarily inhibit the left anterior temporal cortex to induce savant abilities (<a href="http://centreforthemind.com/publications/SavantNumerosity.pdf">source</a>). Low frequency rTMS on the left auditory cortex has been used to reduce hallucinations in schizphrenics (<a href="http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=101613">source</a>).</p>

<p>Now if you switch over to high frequency rTMS, that excites brain activity instead of inhibiting it (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322300010659">source</a>), you can plausibly target the left auditory cortex and <em>induce</em> hallucinations.</p>

<p>The neuroscience in this is sound. The issue though is the physics, disregarding the enormous amount of power required to generate 1-3 tesla magnetic fields, you still run into the problem that there is no way to discern between what parts of the brain you are hitting with your magnetic field at great distance.</p>

<p>Even if such a device as ultra low frequency <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maser">MASER</a> did exist, you&#39;d still need to be constantly aiming it at the exact brain region in each person you are targeting.</p>

<p>Just shooting a bunch of radiation into the ionosphere hoping to achieve mind control is like firing birdshot at a TV remote 200 yards away to change the channel.</p>

<p>The only way you can get this to work is invasive <em>implantation</em> of hardware that can be remotely activated, like the experiment with the bull. That, or having your target wear the electrodes!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting and I hope you&#39;ll update us with your progress. Of course there&#39;s likely a large difference between an &quot;RF mind interference device&quot; as demonstrated by the build based on Soviet schematics and traditional rTMS devices. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Delgado is the man that conducted the experiments with the bull and is the same Yale neuroscientist who discovered that he could get the same results without implants at all. Delgado also utilized invasive implantation of hardware in humans brains, with the results I quoted above, but later lamented he didn&#39;t know what he does know now so that he could have controlled Franco, remotely, with shaped and pulsed EM waves at a distance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Delgado responds &quot;But who could have put the electrodes into the dictator? With electromagnetic radiation we could have controlled the dictator from a distance. We did some experiments at Yale where we influenced the brain from up to 30 meters away.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/psychcivilization.php">http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/psychcivilization.php</a></p>

<p>I see no reason to believe he&#39;s lying about this. It&#39;s certain he knows more about electronic stimulation of the brain than you or I. </p>

<p>It would be interesting to know exactly what he meant by &quot;not needing implants and achieving the same results with shaped and pulsed EM waves&quot; or what, exactly, was entailed in the experiments &quot;he conducted at Yale&quot; wherein &quot;they influenced the brain from up to 30 meters away.&quot;  </p>

<p>It&#39;s my understanding that rTMS doesn&#39;t function based on radio frequency, while the device illustrated does. Therefore, it&#39;s kind of comparing apples and oranges when discussing how long it will take to build an rTMS, the power densities needed to power an RF Mind Interference Device, etc. I&#39;m not a physicist and don&#39;t know how well radio waves bounced off the ionosphere can be refocused to the earth, but if the waves have the potential for biological interaction then using them in that manner seems feasible to me- and, apparently, to others in the government as well. We certainly know that waves can be bounced off the ionosphere with some measure of accuracy due to Over The Horizon radar systems. </p>

<p>I have no reason to believe Delgado or the engineer featured on CNN are simply making these claims up. Delgado pioneered the work in this field, so simply saying &quot;It can&#39;t be done&quot; doesn&#39;t convince me he&#39;s deluded in his statements to the contrary. As to the power densities needed, CNN said the device was transmitting at only &quot;one one-thousandth of the Earth&#39;s magnetic field strength,&quot; while successfully, inducing visual hallucinations in the CNN reporter&#39;s brain. This was demonstrated and reviewed by Dr. Robert Becker, a two-time Nobel nominee for his work in the biological effects of electromagnetism.</p>

<p>From the video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Robert Becker: This is a very significant experiment because it carries our understanding of how vision is actually performed a step further into the mystery.</p>

<p>DeCaro: He said he thought the machine caused a disturbance in the brain&#39;s interpretation of vision. And as such, could be used as a weapon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to come up with something that works for your &quot;style&quot; or &quot;preference&quot;, I would like to draw your attention to a very specific type of markdown supported by reddit: definition links.</p>

<p>It allows you to put a your citations in, as you write the article; then, add the links at the bottom (hidden from view).</p>

<p>These kinds of links actually work extremely well with superscript. (you will need to &quot;view source&quot; in order to see what I&#39;ve actually done here)</p>

<p>So, you can cite, complete with hyperlink, this way.<sup><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="source: daringfireball.net">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In the above example, I&#39;ve used the numeral &quot;1&quot; as the viewable link citation. And, in order to illustrate the syntax, I&#39;ve used the letter &quot;a&quot; as the definition reference. But, it could even more easily have been done by using the numeral &quot;1&quot; for <em>both</em> portions - to allow you to keep track of your links. As in this instance.<sup><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="also from daringfireball.net">2</a></sup></p>

<p>When you see the actual source for this (click the source link below this comment), you&#39;ll notice that the link definitions are NOT cluttering up the text of this comment. Instead, they are listed (invisibly in the viewed comment) at the bottom. They could be anywhere, in fact. I could have placed them at the top... or at the end of each paragraph where they occurred (this would make it easy to remove links to paragraphs you might delete).</p>

<p>tl;dr: this style of linking/citing is very useful for this kind of &quot;research&quot; type presentation because of its flexibility (as in the case of the last paragraph above when you might want to remove a citation <em>and</em> its link, without having to dig around in  separate areas of the document).</p>

<p>p.s. This was a PSA comment. Nothing more, nothing less. I wasn&#39;t trying to imply that you needed instruction for how to link. I was simply offering info for the public about an alternative to the straightforward [linked text](<a href="http://fully.qualified.url">http://fully.qualified.url</a> &quot;hovertext&quot;) method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i wonder if MK-ULTRA is still being used, from what i&#39;ve read, it wasn&#39;t only LSD used, children were sexually 
abused to create multiple personality disorder, so that they could be &quot;controlled&quot; using code names/numbers/music, 
TRANCE-Formation of America by Cathy O&#39;Brien,
also Thanks for the Memories, the memoirs of Bob Hope&#39;s and Henry Kissinger&#39;s mind-controll slave by Brice Taylor</p>

<p>horror stories of CIA mind control. </p>

<p>this should should have been stopped, the torture of ppl to gain info for personal and/or political gain is disgusting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ty for update - in my haste to respond to this thread i failed to mention that the books about MK-ULTRA SHOULD NOT BE READ BY:</p>

<p>ANYONE that is/ws a victim that has not been deprogrammed
ANYONE that is not of age (obviously this is not for children to read)</p>

<p>realizing this is still going on brings tears to my eyes, it is so evil.</p>

<p>This is a really interesting response, I have been doing research in mind control for awhile now on a work I am writing and havent been able to find anything that could counter mind control. Maybe Im not thinking it through as well as I should be, but why does the three pillars of Morality, Principles, and ethics allow you to resist being influenced with mind control technologies?</p>
