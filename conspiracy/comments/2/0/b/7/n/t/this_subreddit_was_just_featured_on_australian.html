<p>One big problem with believability for Sept. 2001 was the lack of plane wreckage, especially in Shanksville and at the Pentagon.. No black boxes were recovered in NY either..  so it would be an improvement to have a real plane... just no corpses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But we are interested. Many of us have, to quote a phrase, done our own research about these topics. But we have used good sources. You people don&#39;t trust &#39;good sources&#39; because they are all paid shills, or brainwashed, or whatever, despite zero whistle-blowers. The economics of that don&#39;t really add up but the estimated net worth of Alex Jones is $8million. No wonder he is so passionate. I know not every conspiracy-head loves AJ but it&#39;s an example. It&#39;s a growing industry and it is where the real brainwashing, exploitation and fear-mongering are going on if you ask me. Wake up sheeple. Anyway, who said bullying was bad? But seriously I&#39;m not really here to laugh at you any more than I would laugh at myself. I used to kinda believe in a lot of conspiracies, after being shown hours and hours of footage on the subject but when I did my own thinking and my own research, with good sources, I realised it was all BS. Sure there are lots of conspiracies, and at the highest levels no doubt. Politics, war, oil, these are murky trades. But the chances of us guessing the details of an ongoing conspiracy are basically zero. It&#39;s kinda defined in the word, conspiracy. We don&#39;t know about it. Peace out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you never used good sources and never saw good sources doesn&#39;t mean good sources were never used to prove a conspiracy. And &#39;you people&#39; is a collective term which has no credibility in being applied to all the people here. There is shit posted here but there&#39;s also scientific papers and academic papers posted proving conspiracies and proving what people have been researching here long before it ever went truly mainstream.</p>

<p>What&#39;s worse is your position in mocking people calling them &#39;tards&#39; for asking difficult questions which sometimes they get wrong. You&#39;re part of a very toxic sub with an underlying agenda which you don&#39;t seem to have a clue about. I wouldn&#39;t want to be part of that place at all even if I did find conspiracy theorists whacky in totality.</p>

<p>People who deal in absolutes like on that sub need to be questioned just the same as people who deal in absolutes here. Both &quot;everything is a conspiracy&quot; and &quot;there isn&#39;t any conspiracies&quot; coupled with complete denial and support for sick and evil conspirators is much worse in my opinion than hypothesising on theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sub is just mocking the crazy conspiriacies out there like chemtrails and lizardmen. There&#39;s no need to get your knickers in a twist over just a bit of banter. It&#39;s basically <a href="/r/circlejerk">/r/circlejerk</a> but aimed at conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. Sorry for late reply. Yeah I just see this &#39;underlying agenda&#39; business as another paranoid theory. &#39;Toxic sub&#39;? What does that even mean? I would say we are mostly just having a laugh, call it a circle jerk if you like. Euw but fine. Also there is an attempt to stem the tide of bullshit generally, some might see this as somewhat of an obligation to the human race. So sometimes one of us &#39;tarders attempts to engage in a rational debate with someone from this sub and that is surely a good thing? I am sure such things as trolling do happen but hey, that&#39;s the internet. 
I have no problem with &#39;asking difficult question&#39; but I don&#39;t like inventing wacky answers, especially when it leads to, for example, people shunning proper healthcare for their children (vaccine BS) or innocent and even grieving people being harrassed (Sandy Hook deniers). It stops being fun then.
Anyhoo, you seem to be saying that conspiracies have been &#39;broken&#39; on this sub before going &#39;mainstream&#39;. Sources please! I propose that this sub has never got anything right, as reported on Australian television.</p>

<p>It&#39;s being called Optic Nerve and why don&#39;t you search and tell me the percentage of pornographic material that has been scraped - and that&#39;s only for Yahoo.  You think it&#39;s only Yahoo and GCHQ in the UK?  Really?  I&#39;m incredulous.</p>
