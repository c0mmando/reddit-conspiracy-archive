        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Has anyone been reading about this Paul Weeks guy and flight 370? His wife calls the media for an interview. Then she reports that he gave her his watch and wedding ring before he took off on the plane, instructing her to give these to their young sons if anything happens. He even was specific as to which son should get what. THEN..it gets worse....turns out, he used to be an engineer with Boeing and was working on 777&#39;s. His resume is on Linkedin and the wife said in the interviews at one point that they had moved there from Washington. His resume specifically says he works on this type of plane. Oh, and he used to be a soldier. Then, go over the the other news reports and they are saying this had to have been done by someone who was experienced specifically with the 777. AND, someone who has military training. I did not know what subreddit to put this post in, so sorry if I picked the wrong subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It says he was working for a Mongolian company and was just starting there. But, his wife failed to say in the interviews that he had worked for Boeing. That was on his linkedin page..which I have looked over several articles and that linkedin page definitely seems to be him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The linkedin page is for a different Paul Weeks. The guy on linkedin completed his degree in 2011 and all his past employment is in WA. He has only a few years work experience so is pretty young. Paul Weeks on the flight was 39 and is from Christchurch, NZ. He was living in Perth, AUS when he left for his new job. Both Pauls are mechanical engineers and I think that&#39;s only a coincidence.</p>

<p>Not trying to shoot anything down, There is a lot of strangeness around this whole thing and speculations are running wild. I&#39;m just trying to keep everything I read somewhat organised.</p>

<p>edit: this is the correct Paul Weeks on linkedin. nothing in his profile is related to boeing or aircraft at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know what this message board is from..other than I googled Paul Weeks because the stories about him were already odd. Then..I found this which referenced the linkedin page. So..I have not read anything else on that site. I only went there because I was already researching this guy and other articles about him.</p>
