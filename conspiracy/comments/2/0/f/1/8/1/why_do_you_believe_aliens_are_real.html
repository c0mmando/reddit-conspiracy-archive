<p>I look this stuff up a lot, but I would imagine y&#39;all have a lot of great info here.</p>

<p>I personally think it&#39;s clearly not possible we are alone in this universe, it&#39;s simply too large, and filled with too much stuff for us to be alone.</p>

<p>I have seen lots of stuff on here that helps me believe other things. 9/11 was definitely something more than what our media made of it, and both the Colorado shooting and sandy hook where what I think to be desperate attempts at gun control ( these both took place as people where trying to push very hard for it)</p>

<p>Our government is full of bullshit, and I can easily see them hiding other forms of life from us no problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I always cite for there being life out there. </p>

<p>My only beef is two things, why havent we seen any radio waves in our galaxy? Developing cultures must run into radio at some point... Unless they diverged technologically dramatically. The other is related, if we have ships that can move even a fraction of the speed of light like .1% C it would <em>only</em> take 250 million years to spread to the entire galaxy. At 1% C it would only take 25 million years, 10%C 2.5 million Those are all reasonable time frames for a 14 billion year old galaxy. </p>

<p>So considering the drake equation tells us there should be multiple intelligent species operating in the galaxy at any given time how come they haven&#39;t colonized all of it?</p>

<p>More importantly how did they find us? We have only been producing radio signals for ~100 years, so we effectively have a bubble 100 lightyears around us where we could be detected. Its possible that they found this planet eventually noticed life and kept an eye on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have researched UFOs for a decade. Besides just logic stating that the universe is far too large and complex for their not to be aliens... there&#39;s also what is in our history.</p>

<p>Before Ancient Aliens came out there were a lot more people willing to admit that something strange happened in our past as a species. We believe our ancestors to be intelligent enough to produce advanced math, whole languages, understand astronomy, create metals, cities and the like... but not intelligent enough to recognize <em>advanced beings</em>? Or what could be arguably &quot;magic&quot;, even in our age?</p>

<p>These people saw things. They interacted with them and had stories to tell. </p>

<p>Nowadays, there is just shit flying around in the sky.</p>

<p>People are being abducted. There are objects left in folks, people with radiation signals, information they didn&#39;t have before etc</p>

<p>There&#39;s <em>plenty</em> of evidence to support the idea that ET beings have been messing with us and still are. People just don&#39;t want to believe that. Little humans, don&#39;t you know, these tricks are for everyone?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen a few UFOs but unfortunately haven&#39;t had the pleasure of meeting any ET beings. I believe they can be interplanetary or interdimensional. I&#39;ve tried to contact some with no results, but if anyone has clues, I&#39;m up for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not think biologically a species can travel the distance, or be subject to all the different gravitational effects of other worlds.  Evolution works over millions of years and is designed for a certain amount of gravity.  Also all evidence so far says with more and more technology we explore inward not outward.  </p>

<p>If there are UFOs from other worlds, there is no biological being on board. </p>

<p>i.e. build the internet, build AI, download brian to internet.  Within that internet create another inward download and so on and so on.  Pretty much what Terrence Mckenna says. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of those topics where it&#39;s each to their own. A lot of people will simply disregard the possibility (much easier to deal with). Usually a believer of aliens has a personal experience that they can not explain and they are left with only one possibility...</p>

<p>anyway, I really enjoyed the <a href="http://www.siriusdisclosure.com">http://www.siriusdisclosure.com</a>. This movie got a lot of debunkers and what not... but there are some key facts that are VERY interesting such as ~9% &quot;unmatched&quot; DNA ... so yeah 91% of it is human DNA but that 9% they can&#39;t really account for, other than it could be insufficient data in the process of determining the DNA. To me, this is where the fun part kicks in and much much more testing and research needs to be done on this little entity. I bring this point up because humans are only 3% different DNA wise from the Chimpanzee... so the 9% unknown DNA is a big deal IMO.</p>
