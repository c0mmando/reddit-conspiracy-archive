    You would think after the general character and activities of our beloved three letter agencies have been revealed, people would read into current events a little more and compare them with history. Then again, no one knows their history. Hah we are so fucked. </p>

<p>But sersiously, why do you think the incident was a &quot;Red Herring&quot;? Initiated by whom? And why? To make you look the other way while there is a war starting?</p>

<p>At least in Germany Ukraine is still the biggest issue in the news and I don´t think a (somehow mysterious) plane crash could really distract anybody.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh... I said that they <em>sometimes</em> work, which is what the article said. Are you in middle school or something?</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard any better suggestions than sanctions. What are your ideas? Or should be just let Russia annex parts of neighboring countries?</p>

<p>By the way, the initial sanctions will affect only a few dozen people. They will be banned from traveling to countries that implement the sanctions and may have their foreign assets frozen.</p>

<p>So those sanctions are not going to hurt the common folk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hardly going to be a free vote. Russian troops are occupying the region and suppressing any dissent. They are rushing a vote so that there can&#39;t be any discussion of the issue, even if they allowed opponents to speak.</p>

<p>There are dozens, maybe hundreds, of places around the world where there are little enclaves of one ethnic group who are  just across the border from a country where they are in control. It would lead to many wars if we let each country invade the other and let each little region get picked off one by one.</p>

<p>What if Mexico, in a couple of decades, decides that the counties in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico that are majority Hispanic need to be protected from the Anglos. Should they invade and set up fake votes so that they can annex them to Mexico? After all, some of them were part of Mexico back in the 19th century. What would the reaction of people in other parts of the US be? Probably they would start rioting and try to force Mexicans out of their states. Then Mexico would have to protect their citizens in other parts of the US.</p>

<p>These kinds of wars happened frequently in the 19th and 20th centuries. We, collectively, made the decision when we established the United Nations, that one country just can&#39;t annex part of another country, and have held to that with very few exceptions. What Russia is doing is upsetting this international conventions which have prevented another world war over the last 70 years.</p>
