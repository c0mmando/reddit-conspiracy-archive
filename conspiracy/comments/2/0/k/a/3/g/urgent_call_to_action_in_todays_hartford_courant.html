      <p>
       Below is my summary of the 2 part article called  “Secrecy, Funding Hobble Newtown Panel” from today's paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the main points and what I believe needs to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       A member of Governor Dannel Malloy’s Sandy Hook Advisory Commission – Dr. Harold I. Schwartz- is disappointed that the Commission does not have access to anything more than what the general public does, still. Schwartz is the psychiatrist in chief at the Institute of Living and the vice president of Behavioral Health at Hartford Hospital voiced his concerns on the radio – NPR- and to phone calls to the Hartford Courant. The Commission was put together by Malloy 14 months ago to explore the ‘why’ of what happened. Using the Virginia Tech shooting as an example, this report would include details about Adam Lanza’s life, his psychiatric and medical files, reports from school, any other information which would help build a biography as well as motive theories- the Virginia Tech Commission interviewed classmates, and teachers, school and medical records and created a bio, a sort of “Profile of the killer”, in the same way that the Behavioral Sciences Unit of the FBI does while seeking a perpetrator, so too are we supposed to do so after a crime of this magnitude occurs so that researchers, doctors, the government, counselors and others can learn from the event, and find ways to take appropriate preventative measures in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is happening with Sandy Hook is criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schwartz stated “We have no budget.” There is no significant staff to sort through information, and assist in the writing, and actually no content from which to write in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schwartz is using the Virginia Tech shooting’s commission as a benchmark; an example of what this commission needs to get the job done. That commission got $400,000 and unredacted versions of all reports. Not an unreasonable request.
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission on Sandy Hook has no money. The only reports they have are the redacted ones that the public has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorneys for the Freedom of Information state that there has been an “overreaction to fears by Newtown victim’s families that crime scene photos would be posted on the Internet” if they were turned over to the investigations commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Malloy’s camp gives for not giving the Sandy Hook Commission money to do their job?
      </p>
      <p>
       They haven’t requested any.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sandy Hook Commission lacks subpoena power. It is Attorney Sedansky who can release these documents, and subpoena what is needed. He has failed to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is Sedansky hindering this investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       To date, the only report issued whose purpose was to explain the motive behind the Sandy Hook Shooting was Danbury State’s Attorney Stephen J. Sedensky’s 44 page report from November 25, 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       His report was “inadequate and incomplete” says the Courant, and the state police released their redacted documents without writing an overall report. This is an unprecedented action- not just an oversight, but a huge act of judicial failure- in a criminal case, especially one of this magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Schwartz criticized the report issued by Sedensky because it is opinion; conjecture made with no facts to back it up. Sedensky describes Lanza as having “significant mental health issues” and states that he was given the diagnosis of “Asperger’s syndrome”.  There are no medical reports to support it, there have been no quotes, interviews or attached records to indicate where those opinions and subsequent diagnosis came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctor asked “Where did these descriptions come from? Who assessed Lanza, at what points in his life?”
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sandy Hook Advisory Commission has stated that if they were to try to issue a report with what they have now- the documents that the general public does, and a prosecutor who refuses to hand over the original copies of anything- if they were to attempt to write a report like the thorough one issued after Virginia Tech’s shooting, it would be “embarrassing.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Commission is not getting anywhere by requesting directly of the State’s attorney’s office that they provide the information, of the Governor’s people say they have not been asked for funds by the Commission, then I think it is time that the public take action, and demand that a just and proper investigation is completed, and that the Sandy Hook Commission be given the funds and documents it needs to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people have to hold Malloy's team and Attorney Sedensky accountable for their failure to provide the funding and documents to the Commission to do its job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, WE as redditors have access to the same exact facts that the State-appointed commission on Sandy Hook has. That should be extremely concerning to anyone reading this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I demand a call to action, and seek feedback from any of you here. Please feel free to PM me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the link to the Advisory Commission Members, as well as links to meeting minutes:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.governor.ct.gov/malloy/cwp/view.asp?a=3997&amp;q=516496">
        http://www.governor.ct.gov/malloy/cwp/view.asp?a=3997&amp;q=516496
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the people who are supposed to tell us what happened, and why, only have THE SAME EXACT DOCUMENTS that WE do right now, and we've seen those reports. Hundreds of pages either blank, or completely blacked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I have reached out to the Commission for answers, and if/when I receive a response I will update Reddit with its reply. I feel the Commission's constituents are owed a window into the types of conspiratorial theorizing and storm of public backlash being unleashed upon the State of Connecticut for failure to provide the public with answers. The longer it takes for a report to be issued that can provide acceptable answers to these questions, the more disenchanted the public is becoming with the judicial process. I highly doubt that any of the members of the Newtown panel frequent Reddit or
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       like forums to see the large number of people upset by this, or to read the derision that is stirred by the lack of answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2:  I misspelled "SEDENSKY" as "Sedansky"..  Updated for proper spelling. Apologies.

       After what went down with the removal of the sandyhookjustice sub, followed by the tards preemptively posting a Streisand here only to then reveal it as a troll so we would be prevented from discussing what happened to sandyhookjustice, I am extremely worried about the lengths that certain groups have gone to prevent any outside investigations of this incident.

       I would agree, except instead of "worried" I would use the word "intrigued".

       Some of these 'trolls' as they're called may be doing it just to be an online bully and have no clue what they're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after what I found today, now that I am seeing some of the names, of who did what, I actually am starting to think there are  few who are probably genuinely scared especially because they did a surprisingly poor job with hiding their actual identities.

       Streisand refers to the

       In this case, someone knew the Sandyhookjustice sub being censored was going to get reported on in this sub, so a tard
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/205itt/reddit_has_now_banned_rsandyhookjustice_without/">
        made the post which pointed out the censorship
       </a>
       of sandyhookjustice, but once that post got to the top here he edited the text of the OP pointing out he was trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       This forced us to remove the Stresisand post (even though his "troll" was putting a spotlight on reddit inc manipulating the free flow of information), which means whoever pulled the plug on the sandyhookjustice subreddit knew that they'd face backlash here and tried to preempt it.

       Great question, with a several part answer. I think very few members of the media are ever "in on" something. (I'm talking local journalists, the newspapers and Channel 3 evening news, not these massive PR houses with political and financial ties CLOSE to them) think they report all too often based in loosely pieced together stories, during moments of racing to be the one to break the story, or break new updates. I think the game of "telephone" that's changes and waters down the truth is at play. I also think that the members of the media feel the ties that bind their hands too. They have editors and bosses, and people who pay them, and they have to balance truth with a brand of subversive political journalism; a media that claims to stick to the hard hitting facts, but is usually just remixing the same story with some different titles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The errors on the media's part will be nothing compared to the massive manipulation of the system that will eventually be allowed to emerge. It does scare me though, bc like the woman who says she was sexually assaulted and people look at her history, the way she acted and dressed, to somehow justify the aggressor's actions, so too will many people look at the media's transgressions and blame their small (by comparison) errors/lies, rather than focusing on the perpetrators of this egregious failure of our justice system.

       I know one too many things about the players here to simply 'trust' that everything is above board.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of transparency should be stirring a louder outcry from the public, and the fact that it isn't saddens me for what that means about the level of either blind trust, or more likely, apathetic complacency, that has permeated society right now.
      </p>

       Anyone questioning the official story has been vilified and labeled a "hoaxer" or "truther", which doesn't help the cause of asking for answers.

       The rights of the many are being denied by the secrets of the few right now.

       When people post on blogs or on reddit, they feel something like a relief and that makes their initial concern not so troublesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concern loses it's urgency if you will.

       Nothing to do with actual facts or the truth of the events.

       Thank you. I'm glad to be able to say it. I realized many years ago in college after some good advice from my grandfather, that when you want something done, just ask. Pick up the phone. No one is going to INVITE you to do it. He would tell me, "Go get the White pages." Now, there is the internet. Which is great, but as someone here pointed out, it can be bad because it gives one the false sense of having taken action. Thank God I don't get that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Letters, phone calls, emails (kind of) are a good place to start. These individuals have meetings which are open to the public, and I am a resident of Connecticut. As such, my voice allegedly matters and since I feel strongly about my stance, I am not afraid to work within the system to try to change it. When I go to the next meeting and hear back from some of the individuals I've reached out to on this I will update here, if anyone is interested.

       the liars that made the hoax that is Sandy Hook, the MSM accomplices, govt officials who lied to cover up, they and their gofundme collecting scamsters are facing decades in prison for their lies and criminal actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       its most likely that a very large proportion of their collected sympathy money comes from TLA sources, ie money laundering to pay them for their services, but members of the public also paid out of sorrow, those people are going to be very pissed when the truth comes out.

       Absolutely nothing. Most people have moved on. They will hear the news, shrug their heads and go back to the current media circus. Simmilar reactions will occur when the mystery of the missing Malaysian plane is solved in a few years. Some people will care, most won't. Those that care will try and spread the word. no one will listen to them, they will be labeled as mentally unstable and heavily medicated. The populace is stuck in lalala land, hypnotized by their talking boxes and junk food. There will be no uprising. The good times are behind us.

       I understand your cynicism, and shared it, until I realized how widespread this corruption is, so when it is opened and shared, it won't just make local news. I think this may shake things up more than us usual cynics would think. Trust me.

       I actually don't believe that any of the "theories" are correct, and the theorists accidentally discredit the idea that the official story is false by demanding that they are right, without having evidence of their claims.

       its a fcuking govt town, a TLA WPP type place, or a grand large scale training center, Sandy Hook school was not a school post 2006, their website was dead (no traffic or updates) in 2007 according to archive.org, only revived in 2010 for the 2012 scam.
