       There is always a lot of talk on here but I don't recall seeing a post saying "Here I am at XXXXX protesting XXXXX". That's what we need. Now is the time for action.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many of you are spreading the word with your workmates, families and friends? There are now mountains of verifiable evidence out there covering major issues which seem to continue to go unchallenged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself am participating in a major rally at my nations capital later today. (
       <a href="http://marchinmarch.com.au/canberra/">
        http://marchinmarch.com.au/canberra/
       </a>
       ) Hopefully I will be able to attend more events such as this but I already spread the word at my workplace, with my friends and family. I can say from personal experience people are starting to wake up on a wide scale here. People from multiple walks of life are starting to see the world for what it has become. I no longer get dismissed as crazy for my views and the people I speak with are genuinely concerned/angry.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you doing to help the fight against these shadow agendas outside the digital world?
      </p>
      <p>
       “Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning; they want the ocean without the roar of its many waters. The struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, or it may be both. But it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.”
      </p>

       I'm personally in NE WA.  Cascadia is a bioregion, the borders are open to interpretation.  I sometimes see it extending as far as northern idaho and northern cali.  Normally WA, OR and BC though

       I'm trying to get a group together in eastern washington right now.  Not the easiest thing since this area is religious/conservative for the most part and still brainwashed patriotic.  Rallies and awareness are step 1 to the long term goal of breaking the fuck away from this failed concept of a country unified under a federal gov't that doesn't represent anything except the interests of big business anymore.

       I have zero 'corporate' footprint and a minimal 'ecological' footprint.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am an expat but I am trying to do everything I can to raise awareness via the internet, most recently I wrote a book and released it for free, so anyone reading this please pm me if you are interested. Its about historical conspiracies, psychopathy, and mind control.
      </p>

       I believe that the internet is the biggest tool to wake people up but unfortunately its being largely underutilized.

       I appreciate your posts, however I just wasn't sure what you meant by zero 'corporate' footprint? Is it referring to zero purchases of corporate items? Just wondering because I believe the ecological footprint is critical, so an additional lessening of a particular footprint is advantageous as well.

       Most people have succumbed to Bernays propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will reject any and all information that is against their induced programming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernays postulated that the everage peoson never thinks much if at all about the world situation and could be fooled very easily by the repetition of any information that the government or corporate interests want to implant in them by the simple technique of having 'experts' repeat propaganda to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way around this programming is education about Edward Bernays propaganda and PR techniques and their effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have soilicited the help of
       <a href="/r/psychology">
        /r/psychology
       </a>
       in this regard and been soundly rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need their help to spread the information and the reason the population rejects " conspiracy theories" which is itself a propaganda term.

       Origin of the term Conspiracy Theory.

       Planting the seed of curiosity is far more important than feeling better about activism. In the words of Dorothy Parker
       <em>
        "The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity."
       </em>
       If you encourage critical thinking in others it will be far more beneficial.

       Protesting against our leaders is useless. Much like voting, it is flawed.

       We must separate ourselves from the current system if we want to accomplish anything. Which would include starting our own farm co-ops, credit unions, banks, schools, and currency.

       It is good for communication and trading ideas but it will never replace in your face, physical activism. How can we expect to change the world when we do not go out and take part in it? The internet may help spread the change but it will never be the change we need to see. (especially when it is so easily manipulated)

       Physical activism is an old way that the powers that be are well-accustomed to handling. There are ancient ways to handle a group of rowdy people and "they" know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, It allows for the police to instigate violence and discredit the protesters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some CoIntelPro carries over into the internet but The internet is a new frontier for activism that hasnt been totally mastered yet.
