       Not sure what happened, but this thread was deleted, reposting to see what happens. Maybe signing a petition isnt so bad of an idea if this thread is being suppressed, or maybe the OP deleted it. anybody know what happened?

       Even the Scooby Doo Detective Agency didn't waste 5 days following Red Herring. Focus. Now is the time to voice your opposition, if you are in fact opposed. If you do not dissent, you have consented. The US government always acts with your consent, implicit or implied. At a minimum tell the people of the region that you do not support the actions of our imperial war machine on behalf of special corporate and non-profit interest.

       I stand with people who do not seek to have their homeland bombed into oblivion and for their right to not give birth to deformed children for 50 years and their right to not enslave their children to pay a debt they were tricked into taking on.
      </p>
      <p>
       These fuckers have even dusted off their Dick Cheney war propaganda doll to talk with Bilderberger Charlie Rose. I hope the descendants of their victims suck the marrow from both their bones and make soup from their genitals some day.

       I think the big deal with MH370 is how irregular the situation is. Usually when plane crashes happen it makes the news for a few days. The plane crashes and it's sad. Then they search the wreckage hopelessly trying to find survivors and it's sad. Then there's a big memorial service and its sad. Then eventually details come out from the investigation about what caused the accident and people get angry. With MH370 we get no closure, and we may never get closure. 80 years on we still don't know what happened to Amelia Earhart, and we probably never will, and it shall remain a mystery. MH 370 even in our modern age may remain a mystery.

       We're pretty damn sure we found her.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In July of 2013, TIGHAR (The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery) detected an anomaly using side scan sonar off the coast of Nikumaroro island, an uninhabited tropical atoll in the southwestern Pacific republic of Kiribati which was the target of TIGHAR's underwater search in 2012. Upon review, it was determined that the anomaly resembles that of a crashed Lockheed Electra, the type of plane which Earhart was flying. TIGHAR believes that they have found evidence that the plane crash landed on the shallow reef before being washed to its current position a few hundred yards off the reef itself. Past expeditions on the island have turned up some curious artifacts, in particular 1930's anti freckle cream, an American made woman's compact, and buttons and zipper from a flight jacket. TIGHAR theorizes that Earhart made a water landing and she and her copilot survived on the remote island for a time, before succumbing to starvation. They plan to return to the island in 2014 to better inspect the wreckage found, and perform an archaeological dig on the site in the hopes of finding remains.

       In my opinion the Ukraine situation is actually getting a large amount of coverage. Granted that means that TPTB endorse it, but still I see no complaint in this case.
