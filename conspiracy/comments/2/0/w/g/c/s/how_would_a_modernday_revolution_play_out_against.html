<p>And why are you getting so personal?  The OP seemed to be speaking in generalities which is how I tailored my response.

    <div class="md"><p>Well if there was a revolution, it would be against those in power.</p>

<p>My guess is the answer to this question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, since I might be the most liberal person on reddit, I would be a target?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would you be fighting for a Federal Government against revolters looking for something new (be that anarchy, minarchy, city statism, state autonomy)?</p>

<p>If so then I imagine yes, unless this revolution would be one against nationalism by globalists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am only trying to find out who you consider to be the enemy, your neighbor?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that&#39;s the thing about politics. The communists in Catalonia worked with the anarchists and fought the fascists. When the fascists were gone, they killed the anarchists... Revolt is usually not black and white, contains multiple factions, and those factions can work with or against each other.</p>

<p>Why are you insinuating that we&#39;re conspiring to revolt? Quite an assumption.</p>

<p>Besides, it&#39;s naive to think everyone has the same answers to the who and what the enemy is.</p>

<p>I think this hypothetical is naive and contrived anyway. Passionate and stupid people die in revolutions, and smart and cautious people get the hell out of dodge and live another day. Instead of trying to figure out who&#39;s side you&#39;re on and who you&#39;ll need to fight against why don&#39;t you find out how to avoid conflict?</p>

<p>About 20% are highly prejudiced towards other people with different ancestors(race/culture), religion, politics, wealth(big difference, who gets to have it)</p>

<p>And is not the problem, except that some of the billionaire class running the show hold some of those ideas dear and exploit and use them to achieve political changes that are then used to increase their wealth and power.  </p>

<p>To me geography is only a factor now, because the coastal populations are more diverse.  That should show you millions of people from many different backgrounds, can live near each other and co-operate.
Physical geography didn&#39;t cause political differences, it only made it more difficult to keep everyone rowing in the same direction, as a nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, you&#39;re on reddit and you think people just &quot;have different opinions&quot; ?  Let me tell you, the anger levels and nutjob quotient out there are high.  Most people avoid talking about politics, religion, etc because any such conversation usually gets heated and people end up angry.</p>

<p>Also, something like 40% of households have a gun.  We have about 1 gun per person in USA, including children.  So probably the male heads of household who own guns have about 5 guns apiece.  (Not sure of my math.)  I wonder about the stability of many people who own 5 guns.  We have lots of drunks, road ragers, crazy people running around already, and highest murder rate among developed nations.  Throw us into a semi-lawless situation, maybe not enough food in the stores, and see what happens.</p>

<p>No, I think those who think &quot;the people&quot; are somehow unified against &quot;the wealthy&quot; are WAY off base.  The people are fragmented, heavily armed, often not very rational, and want many conflicting things.</p>

A &quot;loss of reserve status&quot; is a slow thing, not a sudden event.

<p>The government shutdown was a drama show. The US is not legally allowed to default on debt. It&#39;s either shutdown the government to pay the debt, or borrow more money to pay the debt. </p>

<p>All it would take for the dollar to lose it&#39;s reserve status would be for Saudi Arabia to announce it would not longer accept dollars for oil. The announcement would have immediate and long term effects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Legally allowed&quot; has little meaning.  If Congress doesn&#39;t authorize interest payments on the debt, they don&#39;t happen.  And they DID shut down the govt (but not to pay the debt).</p>

<p>If Saudi announced that, they&#39;d be hurting the value of the trillions they have invested in US govt bonds and other US assets.  And we in US don&#39;t get much of our oil from Saudi anyway.  About 8%, according to <a href="http://www.realclearenergy.org/charticles/2012/04/23/where_does_the_us_gets_its_oil_106533.html">http://www.realclearenergy.org/charticles/2012/04/23/where_does_the_us_gets_its_oil_106533.html</a>  We&#39;d just exchange dollars for euros or whatever, and buy the Saudi oil that way.  Or get more oil from other countries, while Europe shifts to get more of its oil from Saudi and less from the countries US has shifted to.</p>

<p>Sure, long-term, that kind of Saudi announcement would have a slow effect.  And we&#39;d probably retaliate by weakening our military alliance with Saudi.  And they&#39;d still have tons of money invested in US assets.  If they wanted to move that money, where else would they invest ?  US govt bonds are considered safest in the world (lowest interest rate).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>Realistically, an armed revolution is really unlikely to be successful, not would it be desirable. A distinction should probably be drawn between revolution against the interior government of a country, which could be called &quot;class revolution,&quot; and a revolution against an exterior force, which could be called &quot;national revolution.&quot; Keep in mind, I just made those terms up, but they&#39;re useful.</p>

<p>A lot of people in this sub probably don&#39;t want to hear it, but throughout history, virtually every single class revolution ended tragically. The people that lead and participate in such an event tend to be either extremely naive or extremely cynical and power-hungry, depending upon which niche they occupy in the movement. The most commonly known examples of this are the French and Russian revolutions, but there are a number of others. </p>

<p>The only class revolution that I know of that ever turned out OK was the English &quot;glorious&quot; revolution, and frankly, that was barely a revolution at all. The point? Even though we really do need drastic change, armed revolution is simply always a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Even though we really do need drastic change, armed revolution is simply always a terrible idea.</p>

<p>I agree that it is terrible (usually resulting in a lot of collateral damage), but do you think we might be heading towards a place and time where it is inevitable (considering the corruption in government and business)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly? It&#39;s unlikely. Another interesting function of revolutions is that they almost exclusively happen when control is relaxed, not when it is strengthened. </p>

<p>This runs counter to what people expect, but consider the fall of the USSR. Nothing happened for 70 years, but give people a little freedom of speach, some economic relief, and suddenly you have a full blown uprising. North Korea, by contrast, is extremely stable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be a catastrophe.  USA is the most heavily armed (civilian, police, military) country in the world.  Various groups in the country would use the opportunity to carve out fiefdoms (religious, ethnic, racial, geographic).  The national economy, US dollar, world economy would collapse.  No one in USA would agree on what the new govt should be, so the warfare would go on for a LONG time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An armed revolution against the most powerful armed forces in the world is a joke. I don&#39;t care how many angry veterans you have supporting an armed revolution, it just wouldn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>What is needed, is a peaceful revolution. Something along the lines of the American Civil Rights Movement. Except every able bodied American should be a part of the protests.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Movement#Mass_action_replacing_litigation">&quot;Direct action: primarily boycotts, sit-ins, Freedom Rides, marches and similar tactics that relied on mass mobilization, nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience.&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My revolution would be fought peacefully. A violent revolution, on the other hand, would be up against a well armed and organized police force. I think you are giving too much credit to the righteousness of service members. Many joined to serve. Many joined for a paycheck. Many join for many different reasons. And here is an extra many just because. I was taught to follow orders. If the police and the national guard fail to subdue an uprising, the next step is the military. Detroit in 1967, for example. I would like to say that I would never harm a civilian. But that motivated Marine that I was may have opened fire. </p>
