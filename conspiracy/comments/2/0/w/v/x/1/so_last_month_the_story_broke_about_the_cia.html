    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t the CIA (or perhaps, wasn&#39;t JUST the CIA) it was the DEA. Also possibly the ATF and FBI as well, if you believe Operation Fast and Furious was part of the deal.</p>

<p>Here is a good article with an interesting, and in my opinion quite compelling, theory about why Guzman was arrested: <a href="http://whowhatwhy.com/2014/03/10/deal-right-devil/">http://whowhatwhy.com/2014/03/10/deal-right-devil/</a></p>

<p>The part that lays it out. Note Peña Nieto is the President of Mexico: </p>

<p>&quot;“An arranged thing to show Peña Nieto is in control”</p>

<p>That may be why El Chapo was arrested now (the question WhoWhatWhy recently asked). Indeed, the kingpin’s arrest came just days after TIME Magazine put Peña Nieto on its cover with the headline: “Saving Mexico.” His government paid Time-Warner a few months prior for a 14-page advertorial promoting the country as a tourist destination and hyping the president’s reform agenda.</p>

<p>“The political scene right now is that Peña Nieto is victorious, nobody’s looking at anything,” Gaxiola said. “The Mexican economy is in a dive, the country’s going to hell, and TIME Magazine tells the world Peña is saving México.”</p>

<p>The Mexican president’s need for a “win” was urgent. As WhoWhatWhy previously reported, using WikiLeaks documents, the U.S. apparently knew where El Chapo was on any given day, at least since mid-2010. Gaxiola agreed the authorities likely were aware of the kingpin’s whereabouts, and said, “They had no interest in arresting him before. When he was more useful arrested than free, then they arrested him.”</p>

<p>Hector Berrellez, a retired supervisory DEA agent and once the agency’s lead investigator for Mexico, told Narco News that El Chapo’s capture was no daring predawn raid, but “an arranged thing” to show Peña Nieto is in control of the chaotic country.</p>

<p>“Chapo was protected by Mexican federal agents and military, by the Mexican government,” Berrellez said. “He was making Peña Nieto look bad, and so the government decided to withdraw his security detail.”&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly. I mean, they got you two over here to react just how they wanted. &quot;Ok.&quot;</p>

<p>·Cartel leaders are so elusive that even their members don&#39;t know who they&#39;re working for.</p>

<p>·The court documents that revealed this information was <em>supposed</em> to be hush hush. Oop.</p>

<p>·Instead of addressing the matter, the DEA miraculously finds and captures the &quot;leader&quot; of the cartel that they allowed to operate within their own states.</p>

<p>·If you&#39;ve got even the smallest amount of imagination, it literally takes no brain power to come up with a conclusion that differs from the &quot;official&quot; one. I mean come on, DEA was in cahoots with the cartel!! How is that not enough to question anything else they do or say? </p>

<p>·Chapo Guzman hadn&#39;t been in charge in a long time. For all we know, he&#39;s dead and this guy assumed his identity. Or maybe Chapo was tipped off by one of his many DEA employees and left a decoy. I don&#39;t know. Idk! Conspiracy theories are my guilty pleasure and I will indulge as I please. Hope you can be tolerant to my unsubstantiated conclusions.</p>
