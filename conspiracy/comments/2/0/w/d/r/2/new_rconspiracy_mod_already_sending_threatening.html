        After reviewing your posts, insults aside, I generally agree with the majority of what you have to say and don't see it necessary or ideal to remove you from the community.
I consulted with the other mods and they feel a warning should be adequate, so long as it doesn't happen again. That would be a preferable outcome, from my perspective.

        If your first move in this subreddit is going to be to ban me for such an innocuous "violation" because of your overly-authoritarian interpretation of a vague rule in here, I guarantee that won't go over too well with the longtime members of this community.

       I am disturbed that he left your comments because he agrees with your points.  The mod is showing everyone, who gets the slack, who gets the wack, very double standard, that is what you should be upset about
      </p>
      <p>
       You were excused, The mod says since you agree, ok.  So he is also saying, If I had disagreed, you would be gone.

       I sent him the following warning:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You've been reported for violations in
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        , insulting other users, etc.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's up to our discretion to decide whether this would constitute a ban or not. Given the fact you were nominated to be a mod and I was only recently appointed I felt it was inappropriate for me to ban you personally.
       </p>
       <p>
        After reviewing your posts, insults aside, I generally agree with the majority of what you have to say and don't see it necessary or ideal to remove you from the community.
I consulted with the other mods and they feel a warning should be adequate, so long as it doesn't happen again. That would be a preferable outcome, from my perspective.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand, if I see another report of you legitimately violating any rules, I'll have no choice but to ban you, and I really don't want to do that unless you make it a necessary course of action.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, do we have an understanding?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He replied with this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oh god here we go. Big fucking surprise, another overzealous mod who wants to throw his weight around. Don't test me, I've been here a lot longer than you, and I've said a lot worse things than calling someone a "loser" and an "idiot." If your first move in this subreddit is going to be to ban me for such an innocuous "violation" because of your overly-authoritarian interpretation of a vague rule in here, I guarantee that won't go over too well with the longtime members of this community. Remember, I can just create another DocHopper account (which you clearly are unaware that I have done in the past) and continue to post in
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        . This new mod team is exactly what this subreddit doesn't need, and for me to wake up to a cocky PM from one of them is insulting and disrespectful.
Do we have an understanding?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I tried to give him a second chance. He wouldn't take it. He was pretty much
       <em>
        asking
       </em>
       to be banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reason he came to my attention to begin with:

        .
       </p>

      <p>
       He then proceeded to spam the mods begging to have his account unbanned.
       <a href="/u/Flytape">
        /u/Flytape
       </a>
       decided to give him a second chance. Personally, I don't care either way, so long as he refrains from harassing me and others in the sub.

       This is problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
       You were in fact breaking the rules.  We don't want people throwing around low effort comments (childish insults) because it makes it impossible for everyone else to have grown up time where we actually have intellectual conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You were warned, big whooping deal!
      </p>
      <p>
       You were banned last year for the same thing and were only unbanned because you agreed to stop with the name calling.  This community is sick and tired of this low effort SRD bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the only understanding we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can appeal your ban if you wish, but you won't be making your own rules and starting a witch hunt against our mods because you want be allowed to make snarky insults to people you don't like.

       You can word it as cleverly as you want but you're saying "don't police insults just let what happens happen".  In other words "let the metasubs rule this roost" and I that is not going to happen.

       Why would this even be a factor?
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that whether or not this mod
       <em>
        agrees
       </em>
       with you is a deciding factor in how the rules are enforced is absurd on its face.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also rather ironic, considering the general tone and viewpoint here regarding authoritarian control, manipulation of viewpoints and opinions, and the oppression of dissenting views.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       breaking the rules and were doing so repeatedly, you've just got to live with the consequences just like anyone else - especially if you have been warned about it in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Just like anyone else
       </em>
       being the key point. If the mods are, in fact, using whether or not they agree with you as a factor in applying the rules, that is as problematic as your repeated insults of people. In fact, I'd argue moreso, since they are in a position of authority and you are not.

       It's right there in black and white. It is not ambiguous. Agreement with his person's posts was a factor in this mod's view on whether it was "necessary or ideal" to ban them. You can try to spin it otherwise, but again, it is not ambiguous.

      <p>
       I understand that it was for a warning. The fact remains that the mod took into consideration whether or not he/she agreed with OP when deciding whether or not to support a ban. The mod in question made clear that they agree with OP, and therefore for the moment didn't think a ban was needed. It was not ambiguous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not a ban came later due to repeated infractions is irrelevant. Initially, agreeing with OP was a factor in their decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly not see how that approach is problematic, or is defending the modship here in order to keep the peace more important than objectivity?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's the latter I completely understand that you may want to toe the line simply for the sake of keeping up appearances. Honestly, I really do get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's the former, though, I'm honestly a little baffled at how an otherwise intelligent person can't see how that approach is troubling (not to mention contrary to the very ideals that the majority of this sub hold so dear).

       So you're saying it's typical for r/conspiracy mods to use manipulative language in order to guide the community towards the kind of thinking and behavior you'd like them to engage in?
      </p>
      <p>
       What a mod here says to you might not be entirely true, and is not said for the sake of honesty or full disclosure, but rather in order to guide and manipulate a person's viewpoint and/or actions?

       That's interesting.

       Although I have since been (rightly) un-banned, I'd still like to point out that I received a warning for my offense, and only when I refused to grovel and thank the first-day moderator profusely did I get banned, for my original offense that I initially only got a warning for.

       You have a point. And I'll take that into consideration the next time I consider a ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to tell you, I
       <strong>
        do not
       </strong>
       like banning people. I only do it when the rules dictate it is necessary, and feel it is a responsibility of mine to do so as a mod when a user has been reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a user's posts are generally good contributions, it only makes it that much more difficult for me to ban them. I suppose I should try to be more impartial.

       This is a completely understandable and completely human reaction. I certainly can't fault you for having it. I think we'd all lean this way if we weren't careful. All anyone could ask of you is what you just said:

       Good luck as a mod. If your reaction to my comments is any indication, you're going to be a good one.

       I can't see how insulting another user is necessary to use r conspiracy, not that I decline to do the same, now and then, but try to at least be creative when serving insults. On the internet, idiot, only means, I disagree with you. Not much of an insult,  you seem to be displaying a limited vocabulary and a strong need to stomp on toes.

       Lol. Thank you for making me laugh. If the rules weren't what they are, I would agree with you there. In the other subs I moderate, I prefer a "hands off" approach only intervening in extraordinary circumstances.

       Nonetheless, he was reported repeatedly, for violating the rules repeatedly, using an alternate account after being banned repeatedly, then had the gull to insult me and all the other mods after I asked him nicely to stop. Why

       Is that warning linked to a specific greivance? like a particular comment?

       (fwiw I don't think it's great form for a new mod to be actioning warnings on their own recruitment thread, but also I really think subredditdrama bullshit is a pain in the arse and ruins subreddits for genuine users. So personally I'd rather keep out of this.)

       He has even admitted to doing worse in his post here when he says "I've said a lot worse things than calling someone a "loser" and an "idiot."

       Though "insults" have never been chief among the problems, they are a problem, as they contribute nothing constructive to any conversation, which is the reason we have rules against insulting people here.

       I mentioned it to doc himself, and two other people wondering what the deal is.

       My claim, though unfounded, is not unreasonable as he did apply for moderation, though I can't prove that as the thread is gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't dislike OP, I dislike what he is doing and how he is acting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not trying to get him banned, I am trying to get to him to stop violating rules by reporting his comments which do so. I AM trying to make it clear to him that the rules exist for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not "trying to shame him". I am revealing how he is making false claims in stating that he is being unfairly antagonized by as he claims "over-zealous" moderators, who are simply doing their job by issuing him a warning for violating the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can I establish this all if I don't establish the fact that he called me an idiot, thus making his claims of being unfairly targetted untrue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Being innocuous has absolutely no bearing on the fact that it is still a rule violation to directly insult somebody.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did apply for mod as well, I never tried to hide the fact, and am behaving exactly how I did before I applied.

       I agree. These threads are useless. I guess that's why Rule 10 specifically states that 'posts that attack this sub, users or mods thereof, will be removed'.

      <p>
       To be clear, I believe the moderation was fair, it was simply a warning after all, no real consequence... yet here we are commenting on something that amounts to little more than a tantrum.

       Anyway, I detest arbitrary censorship. In all the other subs I moderate I allow people to do whatever the hell they want minus a) spamming and b) repeated harassment or threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this sub, I have more rules to abide by, and as an mod am expected to enforce, whether I agree with them or not. That's basically and literally all I was doing, and trying to be as nice and diplomatic about it in the process. Nothing more, nothing less.
      </p>

       Also, if you have any concerns in the future regarding censorship or unjust enforcement, PM me and I'll take it up with the other mods.

       Gee thanks. Did you actually read what I typed to him? What he typed in response? What he's been calling me in this thread?
      </p>
      <p>
       To recap:
      </p>
      <p>
       I sent him the following warning:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You've been reported for violations in
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        , insulting other users, etc.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's up to our discretion to decide whether this would constitute a ban or not. Given the fact you were nominated to be a mod and I was only recently appointed I felt it was inappropriate for me to ban you personally.
       </p>
       <p>
        After reviewing your posts, insults aside, I generally agree with the majority of what you have to say and don't see it necessary or ideal to remove you from the community.
I consulted with the other mods and they feel a warning should be adequate, so long as it doesn't happen again. That would be a preferable outcome, from my perspective.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the other hand, if I see another report of you legitimately violating any rules, I'll have no choice but to ban you, and I really don't want to do that unless you make it a necessary course of action.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, do we have an understanding?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He replied with this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oh god here we go. Big fucking surprise, another overzealous mod who wants to throw his weight around. Don't test me, I've been here a lot longer than you, and I've said a lot worse things than calling someone a "loser" and an "idiot." If your first move in this subreddit is going to be to ban me for such an innocuous "violation" because of your overly-authoritarian interpretation of a vague rule in here, I guarantee that won't go over too well with the longtime members of this community. Remember, I can just create another DocHopper account (which you clearly are unaware that I have done in the past) and continue to post in
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        . This new mod team is exactly what this subreddit doesn't need, and for me to wake up to a cocky PM from one of them is insulting and disrespectful.
Do we have an understanding?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I tried to give him a second chance. He wouldn't take it. He was pretty much
       <em>
        asking
       </em>
       to be banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reason he came to my attention to begin with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="/u/Doc---Hopper">
         /u/Doc---Hopper
        </a>
        : [reported] for calling others
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20uhg1/top_3_conspiracy_theories_about_malaysia_air/cg6wmx5">
         'idiot'
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20rcoh/rconspiracy_is_recruiting/cg6j5zq">
         'loser'
        </a>
        repeatedly throughout the sub.
       </p>
       <p>
        Was previously
        <a href="/u/DocHopper">
         /u/DocHopper
        </a>
        (already banned) as admitted
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20rcoh/rconspiracy_is_recruiting/cg65xm1">
         here
        </a>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He then proceeded to spam the mods begging to have his account unbanned.
       <a href="/u/Flytape">
        /u/Flytape
       </a>
       decided to give him a second chance. Personally, I don't care either way, so long as he refrains from harassing me and others in the sub.

       I've never expected shit to be real polite when I go online.  It's kind of like the wild west in my experience.  I think there's a balance and difference between using a bit of salty language and abusive bullying.  I think also think for instance the "no caps lock" rule and the no "facebook" links rule are a little nanny state like.  Can't we just vote up or down if we don't like those particular things?  Just seems like mods should take a minimal role rather than an overzealous role in most instances and whenever possible.  But I'm interested to see how the conspiracy subreddit goes and I think we have some good mods to keep an eye on things.  I still think my original statement stands about whoever is controlling the politics, news, and worldnews subreddits etc. probably want to get some control over this subreddit as well, especially as our numbers grow, and I hope they don't get it.  Good luck.

       So you're saying it's typical for r/conspiracy mods to use manipulative language in order to guide the community towards the kind of thinking and behavior you'd like them to engage in?
      </p>
      <p>
       What a mod here says to you might not be entirely true, and is not said for the sake of honesty or full disclosure, but rather in order to guide and manipulate a person's viewpoint and/or actions?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the clarification. Much appreciated. I have a better understanding now of why this approach was taken. Consider my earlier objections dropped.
