    <div class="md"><p>I sent him the following warning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve been reported for violations in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, insulting other users, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s up to our discretion to decide whether this would constitute a ban or not. Given the fact you were nominated to be a mod and I was only recently appointed I felt it was inappropriate for me to ban you personally.</p>

<p>After reviewing your posts, insults aside, I generally agree with the majority of what you have to say and don&#39;t see it necessary or ideal to remove you from the community.
I consulted with the other mods and they feel a warning should be adequate, so long as it doesn&#39;t happen again. That would be a preferable outcome, from my perspective.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I see another report of you legitimately violating any rules, I&#39;ll have no choice but to ban you, and I really don&#39;t want to do that unless you make it a necessary course of action.</p>

<p>So, do we have an understanding?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He replied with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh god here we go. Big fucking surprise, another overzealous mod who wants to throw his weight around. Don&#39;t test me, I&#39;ve been here a lot longer than you, and I&#39;ve said a lot worse things than calling someone a &quot;loser&quot; and an &quot;idiot.&quot; If your first move in this subreddit is going to be to ban me for such an innocuous &quot;violation&quot; because of your overly-authoritarian interpretation of a vague rule in here, I guarantee that won&#39;t go over too well with the longtime members of this community. Remember, I can just create another DocHopper account (which you clearly are unaware that I have done in the past) and continue to post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This new mod team is exactly what this subreddit doesn&#39;t need, and for me to wake up to a cocky PM from one of them is insulting and disrespectful.
Do we have an understanding?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to give him a second chance. He wouldn&#39;t take it. He was pretty much <em>asking</em> to be banned.</p>

<p>This reason he came to my attention to begin with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/Doc---Hopper">/u/Doc---Hopper</a>: [reported] for calling others <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20uhg1/top_3_conspiracy_theories_about_malaysia_air/cg6wmx5">&#39;idiot&#39;</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20rcoh/rconspiracy_is_recruiting/cg6j5zq">&#39;loser&#39;</a> repeatedly throughout the sub.</p>

<p>Was previously <a href="/u/DocHopper">/u/DocHopper</a> (already banned) as admitted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20rcoh/rconspiracy_is_recruiting/cg65xm1">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then proceeded to spam the mods begging to have his account unbanned. <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> decided to give him a second chance. Personally, I don&#39;t care either way, so long as he refrains from harassing me and others in the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is problematic.</p>

<p>You were in fact breaking the rules.  We don&#39;t want people throwing around low effort comments (childish insults) because it makes it impossible for everyone else to have grown up time where we actually have intellectual conversations.</p>

<p>You were warned, big whooping deal!</p>

<p>You were banned last year for the same thing and were only unbanned because you agreed to stop with the name calling.  This community is sick and tired of this low effort SRD bullshit.</p>

<p>That is the only understanding we have.</p>

<p>You can appeal your ban if you wish, but you won&#39;t be making your own rules and starting a witch hunt against our mods because you want be allowed to make snarky insults to people you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>Why would this even be a factor?</p>

<p>The idea that whether or not this mod <em>agrees</em> with you is a deciding factor in how the rules are enforced is absurd on its face.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also rather ironic, considering the general tone and viewpoint here regarding authoritarian control, manipulation of viewpoints and opinions, and the oppression of dissenting views.</p>

<p>if you <em>were</em> breaking the rules and were doing so repeatedly, you&#39;ve just got to live with the consequences just like anyone else - especially if you have been warned about it in the past.</p>

<p><em>Just like anyone else</em> being the key point. If the mods are, in fact, using whether or not they agree with you as a factor in applying the rules, that is as problematic as your repeated insults of people. In fact, I&#39;d argue moreso, since they are in a position of authority and you are not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No,</p>

<p>Every time someone gets banned for breaking the rules the first conclusion they jump to is that the mod doesn&#39;t like them because of some political idea.  When in fact they got banned for shitting all over the place and making the community here less enjoyable for everyone but SRD.</p>

<p>the mod was saying &quot;I&#39;m not banning you because I disagree with you, I&#39;m banning you because you won&#39;t follow the community guidelines!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s right there in black and white. It is not ambiguous. Agreement with his person&#39;s posts was a factor in this mod&#39;s view on whether it was &quot;necessary or ideal&quot; to ban them. You can try to spin it otherwise, but again, it is not ambiguous.</p>

<p>And that approach is wrong.</p>

<p>Since he agrees with what the user says yet he banned him for breaking the rules, reality is quite the opposite from what you&#39;re suggesting.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I understand that it was for a warning. The fact remains that the mod took into consideration whether or not he/she agreed with OP when deciding whether or not to support a ban. The mod in question made clear that they agree with OP, and therefore for the moment didn&#39;t think a ban was needed. It was not ambiguous.</p>

<p>Whether or not a ban came later due to repeated infractions is irrelevant. Initially, agreeing with OP was a factor in their decision.</p>

<p>Do you honestly not see how that approach is problematic, or is defending the modship here in order to keep the peace more important than objectivity?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s the latter I completely understand that you may want to toe the line simply for the sake of keeping up appearances. Honestly, I really do get it.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s the former, though, I&#39;m honestly a little baffled at how an otherwise intelligent person can&#39;t see how that approach is troubling (not to mention contrary to the very ideals that the majority of this sub hold so dear).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s typical for r/conspiracy mods to use manipulative language in order to guide the community towards the kind of thinking and behavior you&#39;d like them to engage in?</p>

<p>What a mod here says to you might not be entirely true, and is not said for the sake of honesty or full disclosure, but rather in order to guide and manipulate a person&#39;s viewpoint and/or actions?</p>

<p>That&#39;s interesting.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification. Much appreciated. I have a better understanding now of why this approach was taken. Consider my earlier objections dropped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point. And I&#39;ll take that into consideration the next time I consider a ban.</p>

<p>I have to tell you, I <strong>do not</strong> like banning people. I only do it when the rules dictate it is necessary, and feel it is a responsibility of mine to do so as a mod when a user has been reported.</p>

<p>If a user&#39;s posts are generally good contributions, it only makes it that much more difficult for me to ban them. I suppose I should try to be more impartial.</p>

<p>This is a completely understandable and completely human reaction. I certainly can&#39;t fault you for having it. I think we&#39;d all lean this way if we weren&#39;t careful. All anyone could ask of you is what you just said:</p>

<p>I may have objected to the wording of that PM, but your reaction here speaks well of you.</p>

<p>Good luck as a mod. If your reaction to my comments is any indication, you&#39;re going to be a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. Thank you for making me laugh. If the rules weren&#39;t what they are, I would agree with you there. In the other subs I moderate, I prefer a &quot;hands off&quot; approach only intervening in extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, he was reported repeatedly, for violating the rules repeatedly, using an alternate account after being banned repeatedly, then had the gull to insult me and all the other mods after I asked him nicely to stop. Why <a href="/u/FlyTape">/u/FlyTape</a> felt compelled to reinstate him is beyond me. Maybe he just likes drama, maybe he&#39;s masochistic, who knows?</p>

<p>Right there he&#39;s admitting he violates rule 10 here in calling people stupid and idiot, which he called me twice.</p>

<p>I just take issue with you stating I&#39;m central to this issue.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Doc---Hopper">/u/Doc---Hopper</a> is mad he didn&#39;t get the mod spot and is now accusing the mods of threatening him, when they are simply issueing clear warnings of clear rule violations.</p>

<p>I have absolutely nothing to do with any of this, my only &quot;involvement&quot; in this is where <a href="/u/Doc---Hopper">/u/Doc---Hopper</a> called me an &quot;idiot&quot; twice.</p>

<p>I fucked up here in this thread by violating the rules, which is where the aggressiveness you speak of is manifesting, though it&#39;s not quite as aggressive as I feel you are suggesting.</p>

<p>And yes, I most definitely am being defensive here, I am fully aware of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mentioned it to doc himself, and two other people wondering what the deal is.</p>

<p>My claim, though unfounded, is not unreasonable as he did apply for moderation, though I can&#39;t prove that as the thread is gone.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t dislike OP, I dislike what he is doing and how he is acting.</p>

<p>I am not trying to get him banned, I am trying to get to him to stop violating rules by reporting his comments which do so. I AM trying to make it clear to him that the rules exist for a reason.</p>

<p>I am not &quot;trying to shame him&quot;. I am revealing how he is making false claims in stating that he is being unfairly antagonized by as he claims &quot;over-zealous&quot; moderators, who are simply doing their job by issuing him a warning for violating the rules.</p>

<p>How can I establish this all if I don&#39;t establish the fact that he called me an idiot, thus making his claims of being unfairly targetted untrue?</p>

<p>Being innocuous has absolutely no bearing on the fact that it is still a rule violation to directly insult somebody.</p>

<p>I did apply for mod as well, I never tried to hide the fact, and am behaving exactly how I did before I applied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gee thanks. Did you actually read what I typed to him? What he typed in response? What he&#39;s been calling me in this thread?</p>

<p>To recap:</p>

<p>I sent him the following warning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve been reported for violations in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, insulting other users, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s up to our discretion to decide whether this would constitute a ban or not. Given the fact you were nominated to be a mod and I was only recently appointed I felt it was inappropriate for me to ban you personally.</p>

<p>After reviewing your posts, insults aside, I generally agree with the majority of what you have to say and don&#39;t see it necessary or ideal to remove you from the community.
I consulted with the other mods and they feel a warning should be adequate, so long as it doesn&#39;t happen again. That would be a preferable outcome, from my perspective.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I see another report of you legitimately violating any rules, I&#39;ll have no choice but to ban you, and I really don&#39;t want to do that unless you make it a necessary course of action.</p>

<p>So, do we have an understanding?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He replied with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh god here we go. Big fucking surprise, another overzealous mod who wants to throw his weight around. Don&#39;t test me, I&#39;ve been here a lot longer than you, and I&#39;ve said a lot worse things than calling someone a &quot;loser&quot; and an &quot;idiot.&quot; If your first move in this subreddit is going to be to ban me for such an innocuous &quot;violation&quot; because of your overly-authoritarian interpretation of a vague rule in here, I guarantee that won&#39;t go over too well with the longtime members of this community. Remember, I can just create another DocHopper account (which you clearly are unaware that I have done in the past) and continue to post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This new mod team is exactly what this subreddit doesn&#39;t need, and for me to wake up to a cocky PM from one of them is insulting and disrespectful.
Do we have an understanding?</p>

<p>I tried to give him a second chance. He wouldn&#39;t take it. He was pretty much <em>asking</em> to be banned.</p>

<p>This reason he came to my attention to begin with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/u/Doc---Hopper">/u/Doc---Hopper</a>: [reported] for calling others <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20uhg1/top_3_conspiracy_theories_about_malaysia_air/cg6wmx5">&#39;idiot&#39;</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20rcoh/rconspiracy_is_recruiting/cg6j5zq">&#39;loser&#39;</a> repeatedly throughout the sub.</p>

<p>Was previously <a href="/u/DocHopper">/u/DocHopper</a> (already banned) as admitted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20rcoh/rconspiracy_is_recruiting/cg65xm1">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then proceeded to spam the mods begging to have his account unbanned. <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> decided to give him a second chance. Personally, I don&#39;t care either way, so long as he refrains from harassing me and others in the sub. </p>

Can&#39;t we just vote up or down if we don&#39;t like those particular things?  Just seems like mods should take a minimal role rather than an overzealous role in most instances and whenever possible.  But I&#39;m interested to see how the conspiracy subreddit goes and I think we have some good mods to keep an eye on things.  I still think my original statement stands about whoever is controlling the politics, news, and worldnews subreddits etc. probably want to get some control over this subreddit as well, especially as our numbers grow, and I hope they don&#39;t get it.  Good luck.</p>

<p>Holy fuck, hyperbole much? Rabble rouse much? You are an incredibly ignorant asshole and I am glad to see a lot of other people agree with me and are mass downvoting you and anything you post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s typical for r/conspiracy mods to use manipulative language in order to guide the community towards the kind of thinking and behavior you&#39;d like them to engage in?</p>

<p>What a mod here says to you might not be entirely true, and is not said for the sake of honesty or full disclosure, but rather in order to guide and manipulate a person&#39;s viewpoint and/or actions?</p>

<p>That&#39;s interesting.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification. Much appreciated. I have a better understanding now of why this approach was taken. Consider my earlier objections dropped.</p>
