<p>Not just taken off the defaults but suddenly you have Politics mods clamping down on anything that doesn&#39;t toe the official government line. They come out with new rules every month, rules that nobody in the sub supports but they shove it down our throats anyway</p>

A &quot;battle of fallujah&quot; article wasn&#39;t allowed because 10 years ago isn&#39;t &quot;history&quot;....but then it changed to &quot;it&#39;s not history because the US is still fighting in Iraq&quot; when i questioned the 10 year time limit which wasn&#39;t listed anywhere in their rules.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in the realm of sports, the rules are extremely important, which is why most games employ several people to act as umpires, referees, goal judges, etc. to make sure the rules are followed.</p>

<p>so, in the case of football, the officials will actually bring out a length of chain to measure the position of the football down to the inch, while millions of spectators look on in anticipation. </p>

<p>but in the case of ObamaCare, the rules are a little more &quot;flexible&quot;, where he gets to measure the position of the football with a length of rubber band, while a bored public entirely ignores the process.</p>

<p>this is why the few people who pay attention to politics get frustrated with politics. maybe its the strict adherence to rules that the public really appreciates. maybe we shouldn&#39;t mock the public for being absorbed with bread and circuses, but rather demand the same kind of rigerous rules enforcement in government that we have come to expect in games. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You had me so confused. I understand football rules just fine it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t watch it so I don&#39;t know how common it is for refs to disagree, and I wasn&#39;t  sure if you meant it about the refs interperiting the actuall rules differently or just calls on certain plays. </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t see how you made the transition from the mods here to obscure and the government but ill roll with you it&#39;s a topic I don&#39;t get to talk about often enough. I do watch politics often, but not because I agree with the way our US politics are. In fact I watch them and pay attention because I don&#39;t agree with them on many points. I agree with you on how we should make them adhere to a strict rule set where they can&#39;t bend the rules but it comes down to semantics and words, which they have gottwn good at using to their advantage. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible, but I do think it will require a gutting of current position holders and replacing or removing vague laws.</p>

<p>Edit: also in regard to mods, not just these ones specifically, rules really should be clear, specific and equally inforced, or else they might has well be called guidelines that give mods power, and not be called rules at all.</p>
