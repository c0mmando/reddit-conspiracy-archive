<p>The name Rothschild was created (Red Shield) by a man named Bauer. His descendants are indoctrinated, from birth (I&#39;d even say prior to conception, based on some things I&#39;ve read) to be fully complicit in the family business. They have one of the strongest nepotistic traditions in the history of inherited wealth, dating all the way back to Mayer Amshel Bauer (an Ashkenazi pawn broker who hated paying taxes and chose the name Rothschild for his money-changing operation, about 300 years ago - ironic that we all now pay taxes to them).</p>

<p>Attributed to Senator John Sherman in a letter supposedly sent from the Rothschild Bros. of London to New York bankers Ikleheimer, Morton, and Vandergould, on 25 June 1863. The letters are forgeries that could not have been written before <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Conspiracy#Ikleheimer">1876</a>. Further, no evidence of a firm with the name &quot;Ikleheimer, Morton, and Vandergould&quot; has been found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give the Rothschilds credit for one thing. They don&#39;t have very much &quot;documented proof&quot; in the public arena. It&#39;s all whitewashed with &quot;it could have been forged&quot; (later reiterated as &quot;it was likely a forgery&quot;, and even later reiterated as &quot;obviously a forgery&quot;, and finally reiterated as &quot;proven to be a forgery&quot; -- all very carefully cited once the documents themselves have been secured and disposed of). No, I don&#39;t have a citation for this other than observation of the way this seems to be a recurring trend here in this subreddit when it comes to the Rothschilds. They&#39;re squeaky clean.<sup>/s</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tear down in the second link (1876) seems somewhat damning. This is a popular quote and if it cannot be correctly attributed to the Rothschilds it loses a lot of it&#39;s strength.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is/was that every quote ever attributed to a Rothschild in any damning manner has been through this evolutionary process of &quot;could have, likely was, obviously is, proven to be fake&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you&#39;re trying to separate truth from lies about a disagreeable topic doesn&#39;t mean you are a &quot;fan&quot; of that topic.  For instance, I don&#39;t like soft drinks, but if someone said that Coca Cola contains donkey piss, I would call them out on that.  I&#39;m not defending coke, but defending truth.  There are plenty of valid reasons to criticize the soft drink industry without inventing any.  Please try to move beyond black and white thinking and you&#39;ll be helping our cause.</p>
