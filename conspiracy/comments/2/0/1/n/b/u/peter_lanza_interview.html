<p>I thought the same thing about the Ron Paul connection, it seemed out of place.  He is crying in the floor of the bathroom because of homework yet has the tenacity to argue economic theory...  yet another inconsistency in this article.  Not to mention that we all saw the back end of his car from a helicopter on the news and I didn&#39;t see a Ron Paul sticker.  At most he was a casual Ron Paul fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the Ron Paul thing seems odd placement in an article about mass murder.  But I have an autistic child, so I don&#39;t think arguing economic theory and crying on the floor is out of place.  </p>

<p>Autistics become obsessed with things.  Things that might not interest anyone else, can become all they think and talk about.  After a while those interests suddenly change to something else entirely.  My kid has been on a Nerf gun kick for about a year now.  Before that it was candy from foreign countries.  Nerf is all he talks about or thinks about.  He can tell you literally  anything about any nerf gun ever made.  </p>

<p>He also has trouble processing changes to his environment and will often break down and cry if he has trouble accepting those changes. </p>

<p>ex.  If I don&#39;t explain to him beforehand that we are not taking our usual route to the store, he will freak out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Originally the above message was pointing out that Adam liked Ron Paul, and commented &quot;fascinating!&quot;</p>

<p>Then I replied with everything below the line and the original comment was ninja edited....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam was a fan of Ron Paul, and liked to argue economic theory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating!</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>When Adam was thirteen, Peter and Nancy took him to Paul J. Fox, a psychiatrist, who gave a diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably actually relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>showed an interest in joining the military.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He played video games!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So which one do we blame the murders on?</p>

<p>My vote is for the tech club... /s</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam continued to attend Newtown High’s Tech Club meetings. “He fit in there,” Peter said. “They’re all weird and smart.” Adam once held a Tech Club party at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since he didn&#39;t host any Ron Paul money bombs at home, he was obviously more interested in killing people because of the tech club meetings...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Adam didn&#39;t exist and they could write the character any way they wanted to, why would they write a bunch of expert psychologist into the story that missed the violent tendencies?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it have been more effective for gun control purposes if the psychologist had recommended that Adam be kept away from weapons because of a risk of violent outbursts and the mother had ignored the doctors?</p>

<p>For that matter why not have the mother and father killed?  Even the brother.  That way there are no loose ends to add confusion and doubt.</p>

<p>It just seems to me, if the whole story was fabricated to the point where Adam never even existed, a far superior story could have been written.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I remember one of the very first news stories specifically mentioned that one of the brothers (there were two shooters initially) had killed the father, Peter Lanza, and the other had killed the mother. </p>

<p>Most of the stories have been scrubbed from the internet, but the ghosts remain. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/nancy-lanza-gunmans-mother-was-target-in-connecticut-school-shooting-peter-lanza-is-alive-28339/">http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/nancy-lanza-gunmans-mother-was-target-in-connecticut-school-shooting-peter-lanza-is-alive-28339/</a></p>

<p>This narrative was ditched when Ryan Lanza went on facebook to deny his involvement. </p>

<p>So you are correct - the plan was probably for there to be no loose ends, but something went wrong with the plan, and both Ryan and Peter Lanza are alive because of it.</p>

<p>I have Clinical Depression, have for two years, and have struggled with trying to find confidence in a liberal arts college with extremely difficult work loads not meant for someone like me. I CANNOT handle the same work loads as someone who is not mentally ill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few others I noticed too.  Without even looking at other TON articles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She[Nancy Lanza] played down the significance of Adam’s failure to answer his father’s e-mails: “He stopped emailing me a year ago or so, but I assumed it was because he actually started talking to me more.” However, the state’s attorney’s report suggests that Nancy’s account was misleading: Adam had stopped speaking to his mother and communicated only through e-mail. “It bothers me that she was telling me he doesn’t use e-mail at the same time she was e-mailing him,” Peter told me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is an inconsistency that is acknowledged even by the official narrative.</p>

<p>So was the mother irresponsible?  Or was she &quot;in on it&quot; whatever it is.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one of the dumbest things I&#39;ve ever heard.  You realize that the entire foundation of science/philosophy/religion/technology existed as speculation before it was made reality right?  Without speculation based on logic, we would have nothing.</p>

<p>What&#39;s actually easy and meaningless is swallowing the MSM narrative that&#39;s spoon-fed to you without doing any research of your own or seeing for yourself if it makes any sense whatsoever (which in the case of SH, it doesn&#39;t at all).</p>

<p>Who ever said anything about proving anyone wrong?  And who is this &quot;person&quot; being proved wrong?  All anyone has said is that this article completely ignores all of the holes in the official story, of which there are many, and which it clearly does.  That&#39;s it.  Stop inventing arguments where none exist.</p>

<p>There are more than enough inconsistencies in the official story to seriously doubt its veracity.  I think that&#39;s pretty clear to anyone who actually spends an hour or two reading about the &quot;facts&quot; of the case.</p>
