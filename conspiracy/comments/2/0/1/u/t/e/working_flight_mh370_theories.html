And now these 20 Freescale Engineers whom work for a global leader in embedded processing solutions (embedded smart phone tech and defense contracting) with equal NSA ties (Project PROMIS), all together on a plane..And now disappeared..</p>

<p>Coincidence??</p>

<p>These 21 people might not even be dead. My two running theories.</p>

<ol>
<li>Perhaps a little fast and furious dive under the radar</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/m/story?id=22922961">http://abcnews.go.com/m/story?id=22922961</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/world/asia/malaysia-military-radar.html?hp&amp;amp;_r=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/world/asia/malaysia-military-radar.html?hp&amp;amp;_r=1</a></p>

<p>to a flat water landing or remote island strip within fuel range after disabling the transponders to rendezvous with a Chinese ship or sub for transport to a black-site for advanced interrogation, scuttling the plane along with the remaining passengers.(any oceanic trenches in fuel capacity distance?)</p>

<p>Honestly, what would 200 lives be to the Chinese intelligence community for the opportunity to find out &quot;exactly&quot; the depth and scope of our intrusion.</p>

<p>Or perhaps US intelligence got late wind that their flying brain-trust of 21 were going to be arrested/detained/interrogated upon landing in China and the US intelligence community deemed the risk too great to their Asian based espionage programs and took appropriate action to &quot;sanitize&quot; the plane midflight.</p>

<p>2 US Aircraft carriers, a ballistic missile ship and an undetermined number of submarine all steaming at combat speed to the region to &quot;assist in the rescue effort&quot;..</p>

<p>Something&#39;s amiss..</p>

<p>Show me precedent where we have taken an equal MILITARY response in any other foreign civilian airline crash and I&#39;ll gladly retract my postulation.</p>

<p>With SOSUS declassified for some time now and used for scientific research by the national oceanographic association, and knowing that military technology stands a solid 20+ years ahead of available civilian technology, one can only assume that an order of magnitude increase in resolution and sensitivity has been achieved and implemented in their current global sonar network.
This deduction implies that if a 770,000 lb (unoccupied and unfueled) 777 impacted the water at terminal velocity from 33,000ft, then ours or someone else&#39;s Navy triangulated the impact position within moments. (Even the engines alone assuming a fully catastrophic airframe failure weight approximately 18,260 lb (8,283 kg) or more apiece.. Those had to make one hell of a &quot;ping&quot;!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couple of things here.  A Boeing 777-200 is not going to fly &quot;under the radar&quot; for 3100 miles getting hijacked to North Korea.  Think about it.</p>

<p>This under the radar thing really gets me.  The world we live on is basically a sphere.  (I know that some in this reddit might take issue with that but lets just accept it as a fact.)  So to use terrain blocking radar denial techniques would mean that you have to fly with some part of the terrain betwixt you and the radar transmitter.  Now some of you get it.  The only terrain in the ocean is waves and they are hard to fly a passenger jet behind.  Now you can fly behind the curve of the planet but keep in mind that is a passenger jet you are trying to hide.  Not a stealth fighter.  It has the radar cross section of a 100 foot long billboard.</p>

<p>And you aren&#39;t trying to hide from A radar but from ALL radars.  In practical terms it can not be done.  Especially when you consider that as soon as they stopped transmitting the air traffic controllers started to look for them and pass the word to others to look for them.  So sneaking off to North Korea isn&#39;t a viable scenario.</p>

<p>And I know that guy has more crazy in his head than his dear old dad did but do you really think he would hijack a passenger airliner?  Because I think he would rather hang out with washed up NBA players and pretend he has a nuclear weapons program.</p>

<p>Edit 1: Some new information has become available.  The Malaysian AF &quot;tracked&quot; the flight off to the west until it left their scopes at about 225 miles.  The flight was at approximately 30,000 feet which correlates to a ground radar tracking station line of sight to the aircraft.  This accounts for about 1000 miles of flight, only leaving 6000 possible flight miles left.  Although it is improbable that the flight continued on that course the range still available to the aircraft could put it as far as the east coast of Africa.  That leaves just the entire Indian Ocean to search.  </p>

Theres a genuine concrete runway with more than enough length for a plane of her size to land, and she belongs to one of our closest Allies and is leased to the US Navy... Very Interesting indeed.

Had no clue an island of that size and national background even existed in the middle of that sea. Must be a relic of British expansionism.

Azharuddin would not explain why crews were searching there, saying, &quot;There are some things that I can tell you and some things that I can&#39;t.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My 2 cents:</p>

<p>The pilot was paid to &quot;deliver&quot; the plane, and the folks with stolen passports were there to ensure the plan went right.</p>

<p>The pilot was very experienced, and even <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/09/us-malaysia-crash-pilot-idUSBREA280BK20140309">&quot;spent his off days tinkering with a flight simulator of the plane&quot;</a> - offer him enough money to pull it off and you have a plane that got hijacked by the pilot with a quick turn and nose-dive off of radar, and passengers kept in-check by the terrorist minders who boarded with stolen passports.  </p>

<p>The plane was flown low and/or outside of radar and landed somewhere  and delivered.  OP&#39;s theory on the Chinese is interesting, but this could even be pirates or terrorists who may wish to ransom passengers or plane, or use the plane in a future attack.  There were some very smart tech people on that plane, and ransoms could fetch ALOT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing.  Googling it finds a YouTube video of flight simulator.  I hope all the sources on this sub are so good.  Did you mean Cpt Lim&#39;s page then?  Which you quoted verbatim with no reference?  Where he calls the likelihood of that happening remote?  Yes, it&#39;s possible with perfect conditions he says.  Possible and probable are so different though, aren&#39;t they.  Think back to all those plane crashes were we saw the dramatic footage of rescuers pulling people off of life rafts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way you could guarantee a water ditching without a significant chance for losing some, or all, lives on board.  Water ditchings with jumbo jets take an extreme combination of circumstance, pilot skill and luck.  You hit a wave the wrong way and suddenly your aircraft is broken apart and passengers spilled into the sea or strapped into a rapidly sinking aircraft.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They could have ditched! 
i wonder if there are any parachutes on a commercial airliner?(pilots for sure) And if so how many? Kill the pilots, lock the door and let gravity and inertia do the rest. But indeed a water landing does appear not to be an &quot;ideal&quot; exit strategy if you want living interogees. 
But time may have been short on planning this. </p>

<p>I just saw an unconfirmed reddit article stating a pilot may have found a large debris field near ho chi minh city.</p>

<p>Looks to be false though, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe commercial airliners typically carry any parachutes nor are they really designed to have people jump out of them.  (In almost any situation where an evacuation by parachute would be feasible, passengers, most of whom have no skydiving experience, would have a higher probability of survival staying on the plane).  But I&#39;ve really given your insane ramblings of a troubled mind more thought and time than they are worth.</p>
