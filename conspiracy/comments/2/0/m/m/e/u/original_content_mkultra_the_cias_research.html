<p><strong>HYPNOTISM</strong></p>

<p>In mainstream culture, hypnotism is viewed as a type of &#39;science fiction&#39;, confined to the realm of magic tricks and entertainment. The truth is that hypnotism is very real and used both in mainstream psychology and in military intelligence.</p>

<p>Hypnotism was used by the United States military before the creation of the CIA, during World War II. Psychologist Dr. George H. Estabrooks recalled his involvement in the clandestine program to Science Digest in 1971, in an article titled “Hypnotism Comes of Age”. I will quote most of the article here, because it is all so fascinating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One of the most fascinating but dangerous applications of hypnosis is its use in military intelligence. This is a field with which I am familiar through formulating guidelines for the techniques used by the United States in two world wars.</p>

<p>Communication in war is always a headache. Codes can be broken. A professional spy may or may not stay bought. Your own man may have unquestionable loyalty but his judgment is always open to question.</p>

<p>The “hypnotic courier,” on the other hand, provides a unique solution. I was involved in preparing many subjects for this work during World War II. One successful case involved an Army Service Corps Captain whom we’ll call George Smith. Captain Smith had undergone months of training. He was an excellent subject but did not realize it. I had removed from him, by post hypnotic suggestion, all recollection of ever having been hypnotized.</p>

<p>First I had the Service Corps call the captain to Washington and tell him they needed a report on the mechanical equipment of Division X headquartered in Tokyo. Smith was ordered to leave by jet next morning, pick up the report and return at once. These orders were given him in the waking state. Consciously, that was all he knew, and it was the story he gave his wife and friends.</p>

<p>Then I put him under deep hypnosis, and gave him—orally—a vital message to be delivered directly on his arrival in Japan to a certain colonel—let’s say his name was Brown—of military intelligence. Outside of myself, Colonel Brown was the only person who could hypnotize Captain Smith. This is “locking.” I performed it by saying to the hypnotized Captain: “Until further orders from me, only Colonel Brown and I can hypnotize you. We will use the signal phrase ‘the moon is clear.’ Whenever you hear this phrase from Brown or myself you will pass instantly into deep hypnosis.” When Captain Smith re-awakened, he had no conscious memory of what happened in trance. All that he was aware of was that he must head for Tokyo to pick up the division report.</p>

<p>On arrival there, Smith reported to Brown, who hypnotized him with the signal phrase. Under hypnosis, Smith delivered my message and received one to bring back. Awakened, he was given the division report and returned home by jet. There I hypnotized him once more with the signal phrase, and he spieled off Brown’s answer that had been dutifully tucked away in his unconscious mind.</p>

<p>The system is virtually foolproof. As exemplified by the case, the information literally was “locked” in Smith’s unconscious for retrieval by the only two people who knew the combination. The subject had no conscious memory of what happened, so couldn’t spill the beans. No one else could hypnotize him even if they might know the signal phrase...”</p>

<p>“The potential for military intelligence has been nightmarish. During World War II, I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I’ll call Jones. Under the watchful eye of Marine intelligence I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A, once a “normal” working Marine, became entirely different. He talked communist doctrine and meant it. He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells, and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps (which was in on the plot) and became a card-carrying party member.</p>

<p>The joker was Jones B, the second personality, formerly apparent in the conscious Marine. Under hypnosis, this Jones had been carefully coached by suggestion. Jones B was the deeper personality, knew all the thoughts of Jones A, was a loyal American and was “imprinted” to say nothing during conscious phases.</p>

<p>All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man, get in touch with Jones B, the loyal American, and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp. It worked beautifully for months with this subject, but the technique backfired. While there was no way for an enemy to expose Jones’ dual personality, they suspected it and played the same trick on us later.” - Science Digest, April 1971<sup>24</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is pretty shocking to see that Estabrooks was willing to completely destroy the life of a marine by relegating his primary personality to an &#39;alternate&#39; that would only appear when accessed through hypnosis. It is more shocking that such an application of hypnotism is even possible. He noted that the potential for military intelligence was nightmarish but felt content that his knowledge was being used for the United States instead of the Nazis or the Russians. Unfortunately, corrupt elements in the United States, namely the CIA, would capitalize on this knowledge for illicit means in the near future.</p>

<p>There are a variety of CIA documents released through the Freedom of Information Act that shed light on their hypnotism activities. One particularly disturbing example is MK-ULTRA document 190691. It describes an experiment where an unnamed CIA official hypnotized two subjects, both 19 year old women. In an awakened state, they expressed deep disgust in the idea of holding a gun, yet when hypnotized, one was willing to grab it and fire at her peer (the gun was unloaded and no one was hurt.) It states:<sup>25</sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“[Redacted] was then instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms in any fashion) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken [redacted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep) and failing in this, she would pick up a pistol nearby and fire it at [redacted]. She was instructed that her rage would be so great she would not hesitate to “kill” [redacted] for failing to awake. [Redacted] carried out these suggestions to the letter, including firing the (unloaded pneumatic) pistol at [redacted] and then proceeding to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened and expressed complete amnesia for the entire sequence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only was the CIA officer able to coerce otherwise peaceful subjects into violence, he was able to remove any memories of the event after they &#39;woke up&#39; from the hypnotism.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/zxqk37p.png">VIEW: MK-ULTRA Doc 190619</a></p>

<p>MK-ULTRA Document 190527 reveals that through hypnotic suggestion, one subject was coerced into setting up an incendiary bomb and leaving the device in a bathroom.<sup>26</sup> The document states that even with unforeseen problems in location availability during the hypnotic state, the experiment was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“...carried off without any difficulty or hesitation on the part of either of the girls... Throughout, their movements were easy and natural, and (bystanders) were, to all intents and purposes, completely unaware of what was taking place although they could clearly observe the movements of [redacted] and [redacted].”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Estabrooks once noted that only 1 in 5 people were susceptible to hypnotism in this manner. True to form, the CIA researched ways to improve to hypnotic susceptibility in their subjects, and found some success by combining techniques with administering drugs. A document titled Continuation of Studies on Hypnosis and Suggestibility states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Preliminary clinical research during 1955-56 has yielded promising leads in terms of knowledge of how hypnotizability can be influenced by pharmacological means. Several drugs have been identified that apparently are effective in speeding the induction of a hypnotic state...”<sup>27</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>CONTINUED</strong></p>

<p>The two cited CIA documents describe the unwitting hypnosis of two young women for the use of experimentation. What is the possibility that psychopaths would use this knowledge to exploit women sexually? Perhaps the most disturbing CIA document I have come across is numbered 140393 and details a CIA interview with a professional hypnotist who was asked to give an instructional course in hypnotism to CIA agents. It states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“On July 2 1951 approximately 1:00 pm the instruction began with [redacted] relating to the student some of his sexual experiences. [Redacted] stated that he constantly used hypnotism as a means of inducing young girls to engage in sexual intercourse with him. [Redacted], a performer in [redacted] orchestra was forced to engage in sexual intercourse with [redacted] while under the influence of hypnotism. [Redacted] stated that he first put her into a hypnotic trance and then suggested to her that he was her husband and she desired sexual intercourse with him. [Redacted] further stated that many times while going home he would use hypnotic suggestion to have a girl turn around and talk to him and suggest sexual intercourse to him and that as a result of these suggestions he spent approximately five nights a week away from his home engaging in sexual intercourse.”<sup>28</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is nothing short of terrifying to read how interested the CIA was in methods of rape. The fact that this was beyond any application to intelligence is an afterthought. The document finishes by describing how the student of the hypnotism instructor was able to successfully use his newly-learned techniques on new subjects, indicating that hypnotism was able to spread throughout the ranks of the CIA relatively effortlessly. </p>

<p>When Operation Bluebird first began, marking the beginnings of research into hypnosis, one early document revealed a surprising goal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Can we &quot;condition&quot; by post-hypnotic suggestion agency employees (or persons of interest to this agency) to prevent them from giving information to any unauthorized source or for committing any act on behalf of a foreign or domestic enemy?”<sup>29</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This raises the distinct and disturbing possibility that the act of hypnotizing agency members for the purpose of altering their behavior became a common practice at the CIA under MK-ULTRA, with the power of what suggestions to induce at the hands of only two psychopathic men.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Upon MK-ULTRA becoming public knowledge in 1971, the CIA was quick to claim that the program was halted due to a lack of production. The available evidence clearly shows that this is a lie. From the documents that survived Director Helm&#39;s destruction order, we can already see the potential for a &#39;Manchurian candidate&#39;: a mind controlled assassin. </p>

<p>So what happened to MK-ULTRA? 14 year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in numerous interviews that the claim MK-ULTRA was halted was merely a cover-story, and that the operation went completely black, in other words, research continued at the highest level of secrecy.<sup>30</sup> </p>

<p>Is it possible that academic research into hypnosis and other organic forms of mind control have been deliberately marginalized from mainstream entertainment, media and academics in order to keep its potential use within a military-industrial complex a secret? After all, MK-ULTRA researcher Dr. Ewan Cameron became the president of the World Psychiatric Association in 1961 and also served as presidents of the Canadian and American Psychiatric Associations.<sup>31</sup></p>

<p>It is important to reiterate that not only does the available evidence of MK-ULTRA comprise a portion of the documents that were created, but many of the experiments were never recorded in the first place. The operation was presided over by only two individuals who had a complete knowledge of the operations. Not even the Director of the CIA had full access. When John F. Kennedy appointed John McCone as the new director in the wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Richard Helms declined to inform him about the more sensitive MK-ULTRA operations, such as George White&#39;s safehouses.<sup>32</sup> </p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of MK-ULTRA was not to find the &#39;holy grail&#39; of mind control but to map out a complete knowledge of human nature and the human mind, and then find ways to exploit it. This was done on both individual and group levels. We have no idea how much was accomplished towards this goal, or how much more developed the mind control research has gotten in the 50 years that have passed since the available documents were last issued. After all, if this is what the CIA was able to accomplish in the 1950&#39;s, what are they capable of today?</p>

<p><strong>Food for Thought:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>What kind of experiments were detailed in the documents that were destroyed after Director Helm&#39;s orders?</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of experiments were never recorded and why did they require such a high level of secrecy?</p></li>
<li><p>Do any recent instances of terrorism or assassinations sound similar to the documented instances of hypnotically induced susceptibility to carry out acts of violence?</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of power does mind control represent in the hands of a psychopath?</p></li>
<li><p>How widespread was the entrapment program and is it possible that it ended up targeting U.S. Politicians? Military leaders? Businessmen?</p></li>
<li><p>What is responsible for the complete lack of knowledge of MK-ULTRA among the public?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the purpose of associating trauma through electro-shock and other means with mind control?</p></li>
<li><p>What new means of mind control have emerged with new technology?</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>A FINAL COMMENT</strong></p>

<p>Hypnotism isn&#39;t the bottom of the MK-ULTRA rabbit hole. It actually goes deeper. Connect the dots between the fact that Estabrooks could create alternate personalities in his subjects, claimed that only 1 in 5 people were susceptible to hypnotism, the extensive use of electroshock throughout MK-ULTRA, and the use of drugs to facilitate a hypnotic state... one ingredient is missing for a phenomenon known as Trauma-Based Mind Control. This is where agents subjected children to torture, sexual abuse, hypnotism and drugs to deliberately create Dissociative Identity Disorder, with the goal of programming the alternate personalities and calling them to the front as needed through hypnotism. This program is popularly known as Monarch Mind Control. I cannot possibly justify the existence of this program in a format like this, but I do address it in depth in a free ebook, if anyone is interested in reading it please PM me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great stuff. I would suggest that the NSA/DARPA is tracking and profiling most of the population with the express purpose of mass hypnosis. The suggestive programming is managed by an extremely complex artificially intelligent system. Things like 9/11 and Sandy Hook are dreamed up and carried out through suggestion of this system that manages concious state, feedback and instruction of us all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info! There should be no doubt that controlling forces research and develop psychotronic weapons with conscious intent to control the entire population. Further, the development of purely psychological suggestive/hypnosis science partnered with chemical/biological &quot;psych-adjuvants&quot; continues to progress and are widely and openly used on the entire population. While information on the how and why should be of interest to anyone with an open mind it is equally important (as it has been for 1000s of years) to seek Truth through quiet contemplation. Everything that is being impressed on everyone seeks only to destroy one&#39;s ability to associate self to what is and always will be Real. The fictional drama where no truth can ever be found is their arena! Peace!</p>

<p>If anyone wants an idea of how much you can manipulate someone&#39;s mind they need to watch Derren Brown. If he&#39;s doing this stuff in magic shows then imagine what the people who&#39;ve researched these methods for 50 years can do.</p>

The person is awoken from the trance in a real life version of the game where he doesn&#39;t hesitate to &quot;shoot.&quot;</p>

<p>“[Redacted] was then instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms in any fashion) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken [redacted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep) and failing in this, she would pick up a pistol nearby and fire it at [redacted]. She was instructed that her rage would be so great she would not hesitate to “kill” [redacted] for failing to awake. [Redacted] carried out these suggestions to the letter, including firing the (unloaded pneumatic) pistol at [redacted] and then proceeding to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened and expressed complete amnesia for the entire sequence.”</p>

<p>Reminds me of Derren Brown&#39;s, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xfZJQzAhc">The Experiments: Assassin</a>. In the linked episode, Derren Brown, was able to hypnotize a young man into pulling the trigger of a gun on a man stage using post-hypnotic triggers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it needs to be both.  Reddit is heavily censored now, you may have noticed, and sometimes this is the only sub that can get exposure for a story.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This topic has been written about by Lt. Col. Michael Aquino in a paper called &quot;MindWar&quot;- which he later expounded upon. Aquino is a psychological warfare expert, the head of an offshoot of The Church of Satan called The Temple of Set, a psychotronics proponent, and has been accused of pedophilia in The Franklin Scandal and while working at The Presidio- resulting in San Francisco police searching his home and temple headquarters there. I&#39;ve yet to read OP&#39;s Monarch paper, but would venture to guess Aquino makes an appearance. </p>

<p>In the Military Psyop paper linked below he specifically discusses how ELF waves are capable of biological interaction (inducing &quot;physiological disorders and emotional distortions&quot;) and the effects that could be provoked when coupled with media broadcasts. </p>
