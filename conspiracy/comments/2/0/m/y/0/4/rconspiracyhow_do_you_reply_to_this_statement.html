<p>I&#39;ve used this line more than once and I&#39;ll tell you that you need to be prepared for them to say that the people assassinated had it coming to them and deserved it. They may even point out the person&#39;s name and how Muslim and scary it sounds!</p>

<p>Just remind them that these people were american citizens and were not given a trial. They were executed because Obama said they should be executed and no matter what reason Obama had that spits in the face of the American justice system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a silly person.</p>

<p>If public record is any indication, then it appears that under the Bush administration the United States was spying in on Americans&#39; phone conversations. The administration also cancelled a program called &quot;Total Information Awareness&quot; that was being developed by DARPA. So that is the extent of Bush&#39;s domestic surveillance, that we know of. </p>

<p>It is during Obama&#39;s administration that the Snowden revelations came to light. And what we know from those is that the Obama administration is not only tapping our phones again, they also reinstated the Total Information Awareness program except they took it from DARPA and gave it to the NSA so that they could fully implement it. </p>

<p>The evolution of these programs under the Obama administration is well documented. Although you&#39;re right, there is good reason to believe that these programs go way, way back. Even further than the Bush administration. But I&#39;m just talking about what we can prove from public record. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that the Obama administration doesn&#39;t have culpability for what&#39;s going on. That&#39;s obvious to anyone with half of a brain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so, there is a conspiracy, very visible and with history back to 1960. (actually earlier) but we can stick to the active conspiracy that began with the JFK win and was followed by several assassinations, 
JFK, RFK, MLK, MalcomX, Medgar Evers, etc. </p>

<p>In this post the issue is the control of the news (propaganda outlets). 
Very obvious during Jimmy Carter years, when he was very publically humiliated by that propaganda for 40 years now. </p>

<p>Remember the multiple daily attacks and the hundreds of millions of tax money spent to destry Clinton? </p>

<p>Now it is Obama&#39;s time, The people must not be allowed to choose their leader, if they dare do so, no problem, start the attack machine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama is a sock puppet.</p>

<p>The government, itself, is a hostile and parasitic entity. Obama is merely the latest mask.</p>

<p>If one wishes to decry a puppet they&#39;re wasting their time.</p>

<p>Look at the puppet master - if it&#39;s a show you look at the people putting on the show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a valid point. I don&#39;t know if it still stands, but at one point I heard mention that individuals could be fined for not having health insurance. I am not sure if that was true or if so, it is still in effect. </p>
