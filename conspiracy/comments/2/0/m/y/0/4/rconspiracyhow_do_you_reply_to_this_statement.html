       "please....tell me how Obama has taken away your freedom", or "please...tell me what freedoms you have lost". I am sure one or two of us has had this thrown at us in the past as a passive aggressive tactic during a discussion. I have had it used against me in the past and I was so thrown off guard from the original discussion that I found it hard to get back on track. How do you reply?

       Well, you've lost your right to a fair trial because the administration has murdered US citizens without a trial in a targeted drone assassination program.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've lost your right to privacy because the administration has continued the NSA's Stasi-like surveillance program. This is a pretty big one.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've lost your right to a fair and speedy trial because the administration has codified the indefinite detainment of individuals without a trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've lost your right to be protected by the police because the administration has ramped up the militarization of domestic police forces, and the Department of Justice has presided over a drastic increase of no-knock raids and other extra-constitutional police privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've lost your right to be a patriot and expose the government's wrongdoing because the administration has viciously attacked whistleblowers, more so than any administration in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just you, as a citizen. The administration has also presided over wide-scale violations of international law, like torture, which Feinstein's intelligence committee will make soon public.

       I've used this line more than once and I'll tell you that you need to be prepared for them to say that the people assassinated had it coming to them and deserved it. They may even point out the person's name and how Muslim and scary it sounds!

       Just remind them that these people were american citizens and were not given a trial. They were executed because Obama said they should be executed and no matter what reason Obama had that spits in the face of the American justice system.

       Just a quick off the top of the head reply; We have lost the freedom to NOT buy health insurance. For the first time in the history of the USA we are being forced to BUY something we may not have been compelled to buy in the first place.

       That is a valid point. I don't know if it still stands, but at one point I heard mention that individuals could be fined for not having health insurance. I am not sure if that was true or if so, it is still in effect.

       That's the idea. They fine you and the fines get larger, year over year, as I understand it. People who still think Obama is some kind of "president" who runs the executive branch of a government that is by the people and for the people, are maybe the most dimwitted brain slaves. It's unfathomable.

       It isn't just Obama.  This started A LONG time ago.  The most immediate culprit is G.W. Bush.  None of Obama's shit would be possible if not for Bush, nine-eleven, DHS, TSA, two illegal wars, etc., etc.  Oh, and I like to remind people that we have a right to the pursuit of happiness per the Declaration of Independence.  Are we able to pursue happiness in this world of false flags and false terrorism?

       I will accept ACA as an argument, but that brands your as selfish and short sighted,  but then you will be happy to toss your parents/grandparents into the poor house to starve and die, after all they should have planned  better on how to not be poor at the end of their life.

       True,  there is a difference in the wall material.  I can see through from my side of the wall, you can't see from your side.

       The reason you can't see anything on my side of the wall is quite simple, you have been told it is all brown, black and green, version of N. Korea.  That is a vision so false you can't see what is actually there.

       Just off the top of my head the expanding police state and the Orwellian NSA spying program are two huge oppressive systems put in place by Obama.

       Final Congressional "adjustments" made to NSA in 2006 Law, blessed by the FISA court in 2008,  Obama became President Jan. 2009. 
More evidence no one told him the details than there is evidence he planned it.

       Here is the best summary of that program I have seen so far.

       Fair Enough he didn't implement the programs. That's besides the point. During his time in office these programs have expanded and can be seen and felt everywhere. Under Obama this subtle authoritarianism has grew. You'd have to be blind not to notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Complicity in this process doesn't vindicate him. He's just as guilty as the power behind him that pulls the strings.

       You have been told constantly these programs have been expanded, but have not a single credible source with details on how the program was expanded, from what to what.

       What changes after Jan. 2009.

       Seems like after Jan. 2009, a lot more information became available, ok, mostly used to Attack the President, but, before that, nothing.

       The underwear bomber, (just before the ACA fight)

       That mysterious dramatic, but short, stock market plunge in 2011, just before the first gov. shut down budget talks, the ones that resulted in that now being swept under the rug, sequester deal.

       You're a silly person.
      </p>
      <p>
       If public record is any indication, then it appears that under the Bush administration the United States was spying in on Americans' phone conversations. The administration also cancelled a program called "Total Information Awareness" that was being developed by DARPA. So that is the extent of Bush's domestic surveillance, that we know of.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is during Obama's administration that the Snowden revelations came to light. And what we know from those is that the Obama administration is not only tapping our phones again, they also reinstated the Total Information Awareness program except they took it from DARPA and gave it to the NSA so that they could fully implement it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evolution of these programs under the Obama administration is well documented. Although you're right, there is good reason to believe that these programs go way, way back. Even further than the Bush administration. But I'm just talking about what we can prove from public record.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that the Obama administration doesn't have culpability for what's going on. That's obvious to anyone with half of a brain.

       You have no evidence any part of the program was a result of a direction by President Obama.

       False on both accounts, actually. The latter claim you can research yourself, it's obviously false. As for the former claim, well, the NSA is under the direct control of the White House, so if Obama had no idea about this trillion dollar program, then that is just as damning.

       Not so, there is a conspiracy, very visible and with history back to 1960. (actually earlier) but we can stick to the active conspiracy that began with the JFK win and was followed by several assassinations, 
JFK, RFK, MLK, MalcomX, Medgar Evers, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this post the issue is the control of the news (propaganda outlets). 
Very obvious during Jimmy Carter years, when he was very publically humiliated by that propaganda for 40 years now.

       That is a valid point. I don't know if it still stands, but at one point I heard mention that individuals could be fined for not having health insurance. I am not sure if that was true or if so, it is still in effect.
