<p>The cell carriers would presumably have data showing the last known location of the cell phones. </p>

<p>Especially, since the plane was last spotted near areas with a population, and probably cell coverage. </p>

<p>Royal Malaysian Air Base Kedak was very close. Also nearby is Sultan Ismal Petra Airport, near Kota Bharu. </p>

<p>If I were checking, I&#39;d start with pilots and crew. I&#39;d guess they would be most likely to leave their phones turned on. </p>

<p>It&#39;s my wild theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy I work with is a huge bible thumper, like the conspiratorial, end of days kind.  He&#39;s all into numerology and the banned bible books and shit. Anyway, he was going on and on about this earlier today showing me all these numbers he calculated from the date, year and the 777&#39;s flight number, etc and how they added up &quot;in his mind&quot;...he believes a lot of missing people these days have vanished because they&#39;re part of <strong>an ongoing early rapture</strong>... Basically he says the people on the plane were God&#39;s chosen and taken up to Heaven early and that they&#39;ll never find the plane or if they do find the plane, there won&#39;t be any bodies found.  I tried hard not to laugh because other than this crazy shit that comes out of his mouth he&#39;s a great co-worker to have but I can&#39;t help but to wonder what he&#39;ll say next when they do eventually find the plane and the bodies.  Guess I&#39;ll have to stay tuned!    </p>

<p>It is a battery hog though, since it needs to provide a geo-location every time-interval. If the telephone has no access to GPS location (eg indoors), but to data packets, it will give an estimate location based on closest wi-fi/antenna/data center.</p>
