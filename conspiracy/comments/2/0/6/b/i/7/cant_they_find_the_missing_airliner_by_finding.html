       My son's iPhone tells me it's location every 30 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cell carriers would presumably have data showing the last known location of the cell phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially, since the plane was last spotted near areas with a population, and probably cell coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Royal Malaysian Air Base Kedak was very close. Also nearby is Sultan Ismal Petra Airport, near Kota Bharu.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were checking, I'd start with pilots and crew. I'd guess they would be most likely to leave their phones turned on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's my wild theory.

       Good point.

       But if it crashed, or if it landed, maybe at least one of the phones was located.

       I'm sure the authorities looking for the plane have tried it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They won't release all the methods tried. But still if it crashed in the middle of the sea, still probably wouldn't have towers near them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure the Nsa has looked through there records of the night and tried their tricks.

       But if that is the case, the phones wouldn't ring. They'd go straight to voicemail. See, that's why it's so significant if the story turns out to be true.

       My phone used to ring on other people's end but not my end. It can happen. Specially the while roaming. The few rings you hear is your phone trying to find theirs.

       Your phone was malfunctioning it seems. A phone working properly goes straight to voicemail if it's essentially off. Normally, anyway.

       I don't think the planes situation is normal.

       I'd like to know how long the phone rings before it goes to voice mail.

       No, it sure isn't normal, but the phones would go to VM if destroyed (ie by fire) or submerged in deep water. The fact that they are ringing is giving some folks hope that if the phones aren't damaged maybe there are survivors.

       This guy I work with is a huge bible thumper, like the conspiratorial, end of days kind.  He's all into numerology and the banned bible books and shit. Anyway, he was going on and on about this earlier today showing me all these numbers he calculated from the date, year and the 777's flight number, etc and how they added up "in his mind"...he believes a lot of missing people these days have vanished because they're part of
       <strong>
        an ongoing early rapture
       </strong>
       ... Basically he says the people on the plane were God's chosen and taken up to Heaven early and that they'll never find the plane or if they do find the plane, there won't be any bodies found.  I tried hard not to laugh because other than this crazy shit that comes out of his mouth he's a great co-worker to have but I can't help but to wonder what he'll say next when they do eventually find the plane and the bodies.  Guess I'll have to stay tuned!

       Nope. I just checked. On 9/11, Flight 93 passengers were successfully making calls and sending texts at 40,900 feet. But this Malaysian flight was at 36,000 feet when they lost it.

       icloud service "pings" the phone location (not sure about the frequency though) to Apple's servers. Any user with access to the account can then "locate" the device through Apple's icloud service. Google offers the same service.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a battery hog though, since it needs to provide a geo-location every time-interval. If the telephone has no access to GPS location (eg indoors), but to data packets, it will give an estimate location based on closest wi-fi/antenna/data center.

       Yes, I say it isn't actually recorded, because it isn't. You're confusing a real-time trace with some kind of magical perpetual archive of data that simply doesn't exist.
