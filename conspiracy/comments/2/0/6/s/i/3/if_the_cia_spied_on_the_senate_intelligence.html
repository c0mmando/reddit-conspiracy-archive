        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>from Page 84 of <em>The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation</em> by Philip Shenon (2008):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. <strong>The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA</strong>, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission&#39;s offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>The CIA has already gone to great lengths to cover up the torture … and the unreliability of the testimony published by the 9/11 Commission.</p>

<p>The CIA has blocked release of the Senate’s torture report for years. In addition, it has taken many other actions to try to keep the lid on the torture program.</p>

<p>For example, the CIA videotaped the interrogation of 9/11 suspects, but falsely told the 9/11 Commission that there were no videotapes or other records of the interrogations, and then illegally destroyed all of the tapes and transcripts of the interrogations.</p>

<p>9/11 Commission co-chairs Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton wrote:</p>

<p><em>Those who knew about those videotapes — and did not tell us about them — obstructed our investigation</em>.</p>

<p>Government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one the greatest tragedies to confront this country. We call that obstruction.</p>

<p>(And <strong>the chairs of both the 9/11 Commission and the Official Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 said that Soviet-style government “minders” obstructed the investigation into 9/11 by intimidating witnesses</strong>. We believe that some of the minders were from the CIA.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The committee’s preference was for the CIA to turn over all responsive documents to the committee’s office, as had been done in previous committee investigations.</p>

<p>Director Panetta proposed an alternative arrangement: to provide literally millions of pages of operational cables, internal emails, memos, and other documents pursuant to the committee’s document requests at a secure location in Northern Virginia. We agreed, but insisted on several conditions and protections to ensure the integrity of this congressional investigation.</p>

<p>Per an exchange of letters in 2009, then-Vice Chairman Bond, then-Director Panetta, and I agreed in an exchange of letters that the CIA was to provide a “stand-alone computer system” with a “network drive” “segregated from CIA networks” for the committee that would only be accessed by information technology personnel at the CIA—who would “not be permitted to” “share information from the system with other [CIA] personnel, except as otherwise authorized by the committee.”</p>

<p>It was this computer network that, notwithstanding our agreement with Director Panetta, was searched by the CIA this past January, and once before which I will later describe.</p>

<p>In addition to <strong>demanding that the documents produced for the committee be reviewed at a CIA facility</strong>, the CIA also insisted on conducting a multi-layered review of every responsive document before providing the document to the committee. This was to ensure the CIA did not mistakenly provide documents unrelated to the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program or provide documents that the president could potentially claim to be covered by executive privilege.</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...</p>

<p>...“My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....</p>

<p>...“That’s where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.</p>

<p>“Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...</p>

<p>...“In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSA’s senior leaders took me off the task because they realized – belatedly, for some reason – that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.</p>

<p>“When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So doesn&#39;t that tend to indicate that there <em>were</em> external terrorists who carried out the 9/11 attacks, and inconsistencies probably arise from the embarrassment and subsequent cover-ups of the NSA and similar government departments to try and conceal their own ineptitude?</p>

<p>Also seems a pretty safe bet that the NSA has some interesting communications pre-911 saved on disks.</p>
