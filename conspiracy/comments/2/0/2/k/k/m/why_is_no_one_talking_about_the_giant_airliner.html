       How does a huge airplane go missing? Maybe 20-30 years ago this was possible...but now? With all of the instruments aboard the plane? All of the GPS on the cell phones?

       Assuming its still in one piece, things "that big" can still vanish easily. Planes are big, but when compared the the vastness of the planet and many of its features, a plane is miniscule.

       The Air France 447 flight wreckage took 2 years to find. Stop making these stupid claims and your title is bullshit as well. It's been all over this sub and all over other subs since it was first reported. The area where it could be is huge, you have to be aware of the variables to understand why it would take so long to find a plane like that.

       Well when someone pointed out that it was on a major national news outlets front page and you answer "I don't watch CNN" that kind of gives the impression that you're not trying all that hard to talka bout this story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been inundated with the story today. As I said, there have been multiple front page posts on reddit and at least 5 or 6 topics discussing it in this sub. The assertion that no one is talking about it is simply incorrect. Just go to the new queue and go back a few pages and you'll have plenty to talk about.

       I didn't actually say that. I just said that your response to that specific post showed a lack of willingness to seek out the story.

       Because there is nothing to post other than idle speculation about what might have happened. While this sub certainly has its fair share of invented from whole cloth speculation, for the most part people try to have at least
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       to grab onto when they come up with a theory to discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       posted some theories and talked about what might happen, but again, there just isn't a lot of information to go on yet so there just isn't much to
       <em>
        talk
       </em>
       about yet.

       Lots of people are.

       It's literally the top story on CNN.com, and it's on the front page of the MSNBC and Fox News webpages.

       I don't really watch CNN or go to their website. They're almost as bad as MSNBC and FOX.

       I just expected to see a lot more conversation on it here because this is real...as opposed to some of the stupid crap that gets posted here time and time again.

       You only mentioned this sub specifically in your most recent response.

      <p>
       The reason no one is talking about it here is partially because so little is known, and partially because everyone is talking about it in other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once there's more information, people will start to build theories off of it.  If it doesn't fit the reported narrative then people will probably start to talk about it more here.

       There is some speculation over on the Airliners forum (lots of pilots) that as it was reported by authorities that the plane may have turned and they have widened the search area to include the Malacca Strait, that the plane may have been flying in the direction of Diego Garcia.

       My own view is a missile strike in an area not being searched (maybe before or after hijack).

       I'm not sure why you think this. In the grand scheme of things, the plane just isn't that big. All it takes is one expanse of wilderness or water to make something of that size very,
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       difficult. Things that are much larger have easily escaped our notice, and in this case a wreck would mean that not-as-big-as-you-think plane would just be a field of shredded wreckage strewn through a dense forest or mountain valley or ocean floor.
