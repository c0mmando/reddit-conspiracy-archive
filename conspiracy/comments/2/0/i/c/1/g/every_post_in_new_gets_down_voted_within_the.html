       Becuase not everyone is actually plugged into a hivemind, this subreddit is controversial and contentious. Yes some people actually have competing conspriacy theories, it's not just
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       downvoting it's actually more likely that like religious sects arguing over mundane details conspiracy theorists who disagree with one another will downvote one another over things that can be easily overlooked in hopes that they can work together.

       The water fluoridation shit that's been around here lately has been pretty bad, also. I mean, what better way to make a group seem totally crazy then to start talking about your precious bodily fluids. Case in point for your argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to always downvote when someone accuses another of being a shill though. There is no way anyone knows that, so the accusation is useless and unhelpful to any discussion. Conspiritard does downvote brigade occasionally, but only for certain threads and even then they do tell their people not to do it.

       I'm convinced there's no good reason to have fluoride in the water supply. Cavity rates have dropped in developed countries regardless of water flouridation.
      </p>

       It's a poison and there's no reason to put it in the water. Tell me again why I'm crazy for thinking maybe we don't need fluoridated water.

       It's fine to say it's not needed anymore. But saying that the guberment is putting it in there to make us all stupid sheeple is stupid and worthy of a downvote, imo.

      <p>
       Also, to say it's a poison is not exactly right. Water is a poison too, in sufficient amounts.

       Why contribute to the ridicule of the anti-fluoridation people then?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't invoke Dr. Strangelove, one of my all-time favorite movies. Kubrick is a film god, not god himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most convincing evidence to me that there is some sort of conspiracy is that A) there's no proof fluoridation has any significant benefit yet we still do it and B) people who don't want fluoride in their water are ridiculed and called crazy for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The connections between Flouride and the Pineal Gland, "the third eye" and holy experiences, DMT and human access to divine truth, gives me my suspicions about the motives behind such a conspiracy.

       His pro government support of reckless endangerment to the people is readily apparent.  Likely a conspiritard member, as this is also one of their objectives.  Do not listen to or believe his lies.

       The mass medication of fluoride that is forced on everyone through their public water supply is highly dangerous.  If fluoride is so necessary, it should he properly dosed and provided by a pharmacy to be topically applied.  Fluoride has zero positive effects when consumed.  Zero.  It's actually quite harmful when consumed in water.  Those millisecond contacts with your teeth do absolutely no good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remove fluoride from your diet.  It's challenging, but highly worth it for your health.  Purchasing distilled water is quite easy.  And isn't terribly expensive when done in bulk through a water delivery service.  10-25 dollars per month.

       Reading my posting history? Don't worry I'm no shill, just disagree a lot on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ridicule them because I have found no actual science that the levels of fluoride that are added to many water sources is harmful in any way. Too many of the anti-fluoridation people cite bad science or find one sentence in a real peer reviewed study that agrees with their viewpoint, even if the actual paper disagrees with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is certainly a case that it just isn't needed anymore, but beyond that there is clear science that it was at one point and possibly is still is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no I do not intend to continue this argument. You disagree with me, I disagree with you. And I seriously doubt any evidence I link will change your mind. And I can promise that any thing you link will not change my mind,
       <em>
        unless
       </em>
       it is a peer reviewed study that shows that the levels of fluoride in our water is dangerous. Not levels in areas with very high natural fluoride like that China study that a lot of anti-fluoridation people like to cite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;Dr There is no point in continuing this argument. Enjoy your night.

       Water is not a poison.  Fluoride is.  The hydrofluoric acid placed in your water supply is an industrial waste product that is not needed for ANY biological process in the human body.  Not one.  It is

       </strong>
       effective and beneficial for oral health when
       <strong>
        topically

       administered, therefore consumption doses based on water consumed is highly dangerous.  It damages the human body.  It lowers IQ, and makes the proles less likely to stand up when wronged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Support for fluoridation is exclusive to the shills.  Normal people do not support the poisoning of their paid public wager supply.  In unmetered doses.  Where a small woman or child receives a much heavier dose than a full grown man simply.because of their size.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's so required for humanity, do it at the pharmacy.  Give a prescription for the proper topical dose, dependent on each person's individual needs.  Mass medication is reckless and wholly unnecessary.

       "Support for fluoridation is exclusive to the shills." Really? I mean how can a person with a working(ish) brain even type that out. Maybe the fluoride did actually get to you.

       Yes, they definitely deserve to be there.  So you and your goons can take consensus against the tide of truth.  How many people support the forced medication of their water, with doses based ONLY on how much water one consumes, how long they spend in the shower, and how large they are? It's not many.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why you need to bring all of your lower friends into the conversation to take widespread belief.  The people know that fluoridation of their water supply is wrong.  We are now actively fighting it across the globe.

       Stalking?  You consider this stalking?  By replying to

        your

       goddamn reply to
       <em>

       I won't hit you with the hard questions any longer.  You can spread your lies all you want.  Good luck.  It must he hard when the only people that believe your lies are your peers that are also pushing the same dangerous lies.

       1) many stories are old or dupes that have been posted many times before, i am guilty of this from time to time. i will stop. new people may not have seen these tired old links.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) any of the keyword shill-alarm-bell-ringing, genie-from-a-bottle-summoning instant-response topics such as: nine 1 one, j-ewes, hollow hoax, nook powah, etc, all the usual suspects do not just get one downvote they get several. especially if its a new or damning piece of the puzzle. the more important bury targets will attract just enough downvotes to make sure they stay out the top25, forever. in this case the topic poster should delete and repost until it slips past the shill downvote brigade and or wait for saturday, when many have the "day off"... try and avoid using keywords in topic titles also, as it draws the shills like flies to shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) ignorant retards that downvote anything that impinges on their tiny fragile reality bubble or goes against the mainstream programming they just received from the tv or newspaper

       It's not turned people that control this.  They are paid government shills, utilizing persons management software.  I'm grateful that many are called out immediately, causing them to work harder to create believable shills.  They are losing, no question.  I will not allow them to win on my watch.  The truth will he heard, discussed, and distributed.

       Why do you think the shill protection act was implemented with the highly unnecessary Rule 10 change?

       They are fighting a losing battle.  I will forever post the truth.  Call out lies. Call out obvious shillls.  Not allow them to control our forum.  They are NOT winning.  They have full control over TV.  Here, they are fighting hard for control.  Do not let them win by giving up.

       That is how an automated process works.  All submissions, downvote by default.  Unless they are of their own.

       This is how they control much of what makes it to the first page.  Everything not of their creation is immediately downvoted.  When items slip past, they create a link to thr same article or story, and then downvote the original submission while upvoting their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly recommend you turn off the hiding of downvoted comments.in your Preferences.  Clear out both boxes there.  I believe both have -4 as a default value.  This will make it so the shills cannot control what comments you see h default.  It cripples much if their ability go censor.

       They work this site like a news network.   It's purely for propaganda purposes.  The control they actively use is sourced in censorship.  It's the core reason why the modifications to Rule 10 were implemented.  To protect the paid liars and censors.
