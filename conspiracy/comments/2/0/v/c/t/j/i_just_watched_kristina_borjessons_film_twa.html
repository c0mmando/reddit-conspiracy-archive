<p>In light of the latest airline mystery, MA370, this documentary caught my attention; I just finished watching it on Netflix.  By most all accounts, it seems that there were three separate missiles.  So, it doesn&#39;t appear to have been some sort of military accident.  I&#39;ve found plenty of technical information documenting a conspiracy, but none pointing to a person, party, or reason for perpetrating it.  My question is why?  Was it for money?  Was it to eliminate someone, or some group?  Was it to see if it could be done?  Was it a false flag aborted?  Do any of you free thinkers who have studied this have any idea the reason this attack was executed?  I&#39;m sorry if this might have been covered in the past ad infinitum, but I&#39;m kind of new to this and seeing that MA370 is in the news, I thought it might be and appropriate post/question.  Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But according to some accounts three different missiles were seen; two launching from shore, and another from out at sea. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t think it was accidental. I&#39;m beginning to wonder, terrorism is a real thing, what if this was something that had to be covered up, so, as ,to prevent divulgence of info that could have tripped up plans for 9/11?  Like amature Arabs with fudementalist ties attending flight schools. This really could have placed a microscope on airline safety before they were ready to roll out all the security theater. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was like a theory I had read about before posited by this group that was investigating it. That the Navy accidentally hit the plane with a missile during a training exercise but it didn&#39;t have a warhead because it was just a training exercise. The missile damages the plane and causes it to rapidly decompress and everyone on board is incapacitated from oxygen deprivation. Now the plane is still flying on autopilot, no way to land it and no way to save the passengers and crew because oxygen deprivation is going to kill them all anyways if it already hadn&#39;t. So they have to shot it down with a live missile before it has a chance to possibly crash into something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what the wikipedia page says:</p>

<p>&quot;The last radio transmission from the airplane occurred at 20:30 when the flight crew received and then acknowledged instructions from New York Center to climb to 15,000 feet&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;thirty-eight seconds later, the captain of an Eastwind Airlines Boeing 737 reported to Boston ARTCC that he &quot;just saw an explosion out here&quot;, adding, &quot;we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here...about 16,000 feet or something like that, it just went down into the water.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_800">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_800</a></p>

<p>&quot;16,000 feet. .... Your blood oxygen saturation will have dropped to 79 percent and you will be seriously disabled. You will be euphoric, belligerent, disoriented or perhaps all three. You will be irrational, unreliable and dangerous. If you are alone, your chances of survival are decreasing rapidly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, the most serious effect of decompression is the resultant hypoxia and more or less rapid loss of effective consciousness. The most noticeable immediate effect of rapid cabin decompression will be the sudden rush of air from the lungs.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paranoid much? Read the whole thread. It was just a research article I read <em>years</em> ago that posited that theory. That&#39;s how theories work. You come up with a hypothesis and do the research. I sighted my references. All that info I posted came from Wikipedia and the other site I linked on airline safety. I&#39;m not discounting what your saying, it makes sense. I have seen skydivers before. Honestly, Im actually really curious about it now. But I do know airplanes have oxygen masks for a reason oxygen and oxygen gets thinner at high altitudes. There&#39;s has to be a logical explanation so if you know why <em>explain</em> it to us. If you know of some good sites post some links so the rest of us can check it out. I&#39;m a reasonable open minded individual. Don&#39;t just hurl vague accusatory passive aggressive insults around. It&#39;s just strange behavior honestly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting article, thanks for linking it. Maybe they were basing the rapid decompression theory on the estimated altitude given by the other pilot of 16,000ft. I read this so long ago it may have been before the NTSB report was released. There&#39;s some key information I found in the NTSB report that wasn&#39;t in the articles I read. I&#39;m thinking that might be the case. This is really interesting though:</p>

<p>&quot;These simulations indicated that after the loss of the forward fuselage the remainder of the aircraft continued on in crippled flight, then pitched up while rolling to the left (north),[98] climbing to a maximum altitude between 15,537 feet (4,736 m) and 16,678 feet (5,083 m)&quot;</p>

<p>If it got hit in the forward fuselage there&#39;s a good chance it would have killed/disabled the pilots outright or at the very least taken out flight controls. When planes loses flight control it causes phugoid instability and the plane pitches up. The plane climbs a few thousand feet, then they fire the second, live missile.</p>

<p>&quot;Trace amounts of explosive residue were detected on three samples of material from three separate locations of the recovered airplane wreckage (described by the FBI as a piece of canvas-like material and two pieces of a floor panel).[79] These samples were submitted to the FBI&#39;s laboratory in Washington, D.C., which determined that one sample contained traces of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), another nitroglycerin, and the third a combination of RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>have you guys heard about the people on the plane from a energy company? it turns out these individuals who were on the flight for business,were apparently working on a free energy car. ( what happened to Nicola Tesla?) it only makes sense to me that this plane was deliberately attacked accurately and efficiently as I cant think of any other way for a whole p[lane to disappear without any on-board staff sending any kind of alarms back to anyone wat so ever.

    <div class="md"><p>perhaps it was a real terrorist attack done with shoulder launched missiles.  If word of that got out then nobody would fly anywhere.  They would be too terrified to get on an airplane.  Which in turn would cause serious damage to the US economy.  It could be as simple as:</p>

<ol>
<li> Terrorists shoot down airplane</li>
<li> Military responds, finds the terrorists and kills them</li>
<li> Covers up the attack to prevent public panic</li>
<li> citizens believe it was an accident so they are not afraid to fly</li>
<li> after a few days everything is &quot;back to normal&quot;</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good theory.  But I wonder if there were any terrorist claims of responsibility?  They seem to enjoy taking credit for their work.  When I posted this, I really was hoping for something concrete, like a theory with pieces of evidence.  I would have been happy with even circumstantial evidence that could help explain the empirical evidence of exothermic explosions that occurred from outside the plane, e.g., proximity-fused missiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it&#39;s just speculation on my part, not an actual &quot;theory&quot; with evidence to back it up.  I do believe some type of rocket/missile came from the surface and took out the plane.  I do find it hard to believe that a Navy vessel with hundreds of sailors on board would shoot down a plane and nobody on the ship would talk about it.  The US gov&#39;t does a good job of controlling the news here so I think they could blackout any reports of a terrorist claiming to be responsible...  But again, it&#39;s just a guess.  IMO we will never know the real truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Navy was performing exercises directly below the flight and subsequent impact path.  The date of the attack could also be important.  </p>

<p>Was it an accident?  Was it a false flag they called off just seconds too late, then covered up with lies?  Taking over the investigation, and falling the eyewitnesses liars?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what the wikipedia page says:</p>

<p>&quot;The last radio transmission from the airplane occurred at 20:30 when the flight crew received and then acknowledged instructions from New York Center to climb to 15,000 feet&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;thirty-eight seconds later, the captain of an Eastwind Airlines Boeing 737 reported to Boston ARTCC that he &quot;just saw an explosion out here&quot;, adding, &quot;we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here...about 16,000 feet or something like that, it just went down into the water.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_800">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWA_Flight_800</a></p>

<p>&quot;16,000 feet. .... Your blood oxygen saturation will have dropped to 79 percent and you will be seriously disabled. You will be euphoric, belligerent, disoriented or perhaps all three. You will be irrational, unreliable and dangerous. If you are alone, your chances of survival are decreasing rapidly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, the most serious effect of decompression is the resultant hypoxia and more or less rapid loss of effective consciousness. The most noticeable immediate effect of rapid cabin decompression will be the sudden rush of air from the lungs.&quot;</p>
