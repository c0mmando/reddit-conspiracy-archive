        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So i have decided to watch literally everything on youtube about 9/11 attacks,i cannot decide if it was bush/cia or it was the terriost,in one of the videos on youtube of the first plane hitting the north tower there is a flash before it hits which is suppose to be explosive matertial to put a hole in the side so the planes can enter the building, alot of experts are saying millatary drones flew in to the WTC&#39;s but if thats the case then why is one of the pilots widows speaking out about it,if the passenger plane was swapped for remote controlled drones then why are members of the familys that died speaking up about aircraft securirty?</p>

<p>I did not understand how BBC or CNN say that building 7 is about to go down because of a fire,also the fire department said it before it happens,so that is very fishy that a news channel can predict it.</p>

<p>Then theres evidence in the cleanup operation that a special substance was found to melt steel,how has george bush cia/fbi all not been trialed for in court for 3000 murders?</p>

<p>It just seems like its been swepped under the carpet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I can&#39;t comment on the flash of light...too many speculating grainy YouTube videos and not enough eyewitness/circumstantial evidence to really conclude. Many people believe that explosives were rigged to the planes and/or inside of the building to go off at at the moment of impact, making the damage that much worse. Surely this wouldn&#39;t be a &quot;conspiracy&quot; if it was carried out by some turban-wearing, freedom-hating terrorists from Afghanistan, but then again, they wouldn&#39;t have the access to the planes or buildings to rig such explosives. So if such explosives existed...who put them in place? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t explain it. And the ones that do, say it was a controlled demolition - plain and simple. The building was pre-rigged with explosives and was &quot;pulled.&quot; All evidence points to that. If you look at WHO/WHAT was housed within Building 7, it will make a lot more sense. It is highly probably that Building 7 held the papertrails and evidence that could potentially raise suspicion about WTC 1 and 2. Its &quot;coincidental&quot; collapse would be the PERFECT way to cover the tracks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I can add to this is that the planes that crashed into the WTC were either 100% completely real commercial planes, commercial planes modified with remote controls, or &quot;drone planes&quot; completely refitted to hold passengers like a commercial jet. My bet is on #2 - modified commercial airliners.
The only reason I am so sure, is because I live in Brooklyn right across the water and collected scraps of paper - some FROM INSIDE THE PLANES. I have pieces of the flight safety inserts that go into the back of the seats...so, IF the planes were not simply commercial airlines, they went to great efforts to make it a completely normal commercial flight to all who were on board and may find wreckage afterwards. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Hang on a second. This is just a distraction bullshit to pollute the science, so don&#39;t fall for this. The plane&#39;s speed alone was enough to penetrate the WTC. First off, the I-beams in the areas of both plane impacts were only 1/4&quot;  thick because the building&#39;s use of structural steel tapered from the bottom (because not as much steel was needed to support the weight of the top floors). DID YOU KNOW: From the 75th floor on up, the buildings comprise less than 2% of the WTC&#39;s total structural weight.
The planes might have been resisted much better if the planes had hit near the bottom, where the steel is 4&quot; thick.</p>

<p>The reason this happens is because of kinetic energy. You&#39;ve heard of tornadoes driving straws into telephone poles and brick walls, haven&#39;t you? Someone asked about this and got the following answer  <strong><a href="http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/phy00/phy00325.htm">link here</a></strong>. Excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Question:
Tornado Effect I&#39;ve heard stories about tornados shoving drinking straws through phone poles and brick walls. Is the reason for this known? I am curious what would be discovered if I constructed a large ring, weighted heavily (tons?), spun it at extreme speeds, and tested the maliability of metals placed within the center of the spinning ring. </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>About the tornado. The mechanical properties of a projectile depends on its speed. For example, if I take a soft lead bullet and press it slowly against a steel plate, say 0.5 cm thick, using a mechanical press, it would deform into a lead disc and the steel plate would be largely unaffected. However, if I take the same soft lead bullet and it&#39;s fired from a 0.357 Magnum, it would easily blow a large hole in the same steel plate. <strong>The difference is that deformation of a projectile takes a certain amount of time to occur. If the impact time is very short compared to this characteristic time of deformation, the mechanical properties of the object will be very different.</strong> This is not an uncommon phenomenon. Another example, if I jump into a lake from a height of 1 meter, I just sink and make a splash -- no harm. But if I jump into the same lake from an airplane at 1000 meters above the surface, I&#39;m a pancake. I might just as well hit solid ground. The reason is: at the speed with which I hit the water is so fast, the water does not have time to &quot;get out of the way&quot; <strong>so it becomes essentially a solid.</strong> This is what happens to straws etc. driven by tornadic winds. They become projectiles, like an arrow. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>These physics properties also applied to a 767 (coincidentally, flying WAY outside its envelope) going into the buildings at 550mph.</p>

<p>This also caused the Columbia shuttle launch disaster. Foam travelling at high speed smashed into the wing. The foam weighed literally enough for you to hold in your hands, but smashed through and damaged the wing, causing the loss of the shuttle. <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suniiico7z4">See this video of the test</a></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I graduated high school.</p>

<p>Hmmmm. So, let&#39;s see: somehow, the a 180k KG 767 didn&#39;t have enough energy to penetrate the WTC&#39;s 1/4&quot; steel, but a slightly smaller 757 magically had enough energy to penetrate the Pentagon&#39;s newly-refitted and structurally reinforced rings ALL the way to the center? The &quot;Official Story&quot; supporters should probably put their heads together before they post these things.</p>

<p>And no, not going to let this become about &quot;Newton&#39;s laws of motion,&quot; which we know are true of course. If a soda straw can penetrate a 2x4 in 200mph+ winds, thinking that the plane would have bounced off is just silly. The WTC had 2.5&#39; spaces with no structural steel between for the windows.</p>

<p>EDIT: This is also how &quot;bunker buster&quot; bombs work. They penetrate using their kinetic energy first. In fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZLe-tObCeQ">you can see holes from just these sorts of penetrations</a> here.</p>
