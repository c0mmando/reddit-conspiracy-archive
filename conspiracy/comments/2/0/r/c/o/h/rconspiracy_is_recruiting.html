       Most of the regulars will know the drill by now. The sub is growing and we need help moderating. Be warned it is mostly a thankless task and a role which will cause you headaches and possibly bowel disorders so think on before asking to help out here.

       I am interested in the position.
      </p>

       Unfortunately, I have deleted a lot of my older posts and have only returned from a hiatus a couple weeks ago, but here are some of my contributions to the sub:

       I have a lot more original content to come as well.

       As far as moderating, I only have mild experience, but promise to enforce the rules fairly and in a manner that the mods and community see appropriate, without any personal agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       My oldest account is over 4 years old, if any mods want to know which one it is, pm me, though I have stopped participating on it before I became active in this sub. I have the time and motivation to be very active.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit for full disclosure: Yes I do have a free self-published book as people have mentioned, and a blog. I do not plan on abusing a moderator position in any way to promote either of these, but if it is viewed as a conflict of interest, i understand.

       But his push for mod is troubling to me. Something he also did the last time mods were recruited. Think he'll get a bonus? The last 3 mods, which we seem satisfied with, did not campaign for it.

        this

        you!!
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I just finished the part in your book about the Franklin Scandal, Dutroux Affair, Presidio SF, and Jimmy Savile/British elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've researched some terrifyingly odious conspiracies to death, but nothing has prepared me for the implications of the rampant pedophilia networks among the elite. I really have a hard time finding the words...
      </p>
      <p>
       Your research lead me to the wikipedia page for
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutroux">
        Marc Dutroux
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Despite several warnings to the authorities, Dutroux's intentions were not properly followed-up. Dutroux had offered money to a police informant to provide him with girls, and told him that he was constructing a cell in his basement. His mother also wrote a second letter to the police, claiming that he held girls captive in his houses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The police search of Dutroux's house on 13 December 1995 and again six days later in relation to his car theft charge, came under harshest scrutiny. During this time, Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo were still alive in the basement dungeon, but the police failed to discover them.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...in an otherwise decrepit and dirty basement they failed to recognize the significance of the freshly plastered and painted wall that concealed the dungeon. While in the basement, a locksmith who was accompanying the police said he clearly heard children's cries coming from inside the house, but was overruled by the police, who...concluded the cries must have come from the street outside.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several videotapes were also seized from the house that showed Dutroux constructing the secret entrance and the dungeon where the girls were then held. The tapes were never viewed by the police, who later claimed this was because they did not have a videotape player.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This shit makes me quite literally sick to my stomach.
      </p>
      <p>

       This has to be the best irony I've run into today. A three letter agency being a mod in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       has to happen. It's just too hilarious.

       Although I suspect that you wouldn't be capable of being a very active mod.  You seem very busy and that shouldn't be taken as an insult.  I think you would be a great mod when you found time to be one.

       I just control+f'd my entire post history and never mentioned wanting to be a moderator of any sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the comment that being a mod would inhibit my ability to wake people up, to be honest I do not have a full answer for that. I am never antagonistic to posters in the first place, as I believe that to be the antithesis to the goal of waking people up, so I would not change my posting or commenting behavior. I have no intention of stickying my own content or anything like that, either.

       It's just a formatting change.  When you make a list in a comment now the bulletted points are now light gray instead of regular black text.  Makes them de-emphasized in my opinion when the intent of the author is to emphasize them.  Minor change, but reddit is doing these minor changes and over the long term the site is changing for the worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Quit fucking with Reddit
       </li>
       <li>
        The censoring is out of control
       </li>
       <li>
        Shadowbans suck
       </li>
       <li>
        9/11 Truth stands the test of time
       </li>

       Maybe so.  All I'm saying is that I don't think karma is the end-all/be-all when it comes to choosing a mod.  I think consistency, level-headedness, and activity (even if just in comments) are equally if not more important.  I do agree with you though that we should try to stick to users who have a history of posting here that dates further back than just a couple months.

       I agree 100%. The posts are balanced. Not pushing any one agenda. Also, because of that balance I personally look at situations from all angles. All the conversations I've had with

       I've been here for over 3 years. Look through my history. I have no experience moderating but I've been pushing non stop for transparency in this sub... Occasionally butting heads with the current moderators. I believe we need somebody in here who questions the mods.  If you think I'm worthy I'd be honored.

       Also had I known that I would 1 day be throwing my name in as a contender for moderatorship of this, the sub that I created my Reddit account for, r/conspiracy, I would've spent more time coming up with a clever/incendiary username, but here we are.

       Now, because this a democratic system I plan on using some good old fashioned fascism and fear-mongering to rile up the free thinkers to get them in a frenzy and sweep into the cabal of power &amp; influence that is moderator status on r/conspiracy /s.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is under attack, the content on this sub has taken a nose dive over the last 6 months and that decline in quality conspiracy-related content has been in direct correlation with the spike in subscribers to r/conspiracy. How is it that around the same time the Snowden leaks began this sub saw a sharp increase in traffic of the shill variety ? Could it be coincidence ? I don't think so, and in IMHO most of you would agree with me. This sub has clearly been hijacked by r/conspiratard and their merry band of vote brigadiers. To defend this sub I would :
      </p>
      <p>
       Greatly reduce the amount of memes that get submitted to this sub, the memes that make it to the top of the page here over the past 6 months have at times been either what I would consider to be circlejerk material or it's been things that have been entirely antithetical to what this sub is supposed to be about, like the link I've provided as an example. (
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1yzx2k/alan_moore/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1yzx2k/alan_moore/
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also investigate/ban all suspected shills immediately after viewing their inane comment/submission. No one understands the frustration of witnessing your controversial yet somehow popular submission to r/conspiracy have it's comment section derailed by an endless cadre of suspected shills and their stupid jokes, like I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If made moderator I would respond to any queries regarding the sub or my actions as moderator in a timely fashion, I've dealt with mods that are quick at removing your post and then slow at explaining why it was taken down, it can be frustrating. Over the course of an average day I am on Reddit on my work computer &amp; personal laptop as well as being on the Reddit is Fun app on my smartphone &amp; tablet while I'm out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for reading all of this/considering giving me your vote.

       I have neither the time nor inclination to be a mod in this sub, but I do have a question:
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed that
       <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">
        /u/illuminatedwax
       </a>
       is the top mod of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and is ALSO the top mod in
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       - yet the latter summarily (and automatically) REJECTS any and all submissions from the former.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's up with that,
       <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">
        /u/illuminatedwax
       </a>
       ?

       Yes he does and if he wished he could get rid of all of us. However he never has and really he helped us after a rogue mod removed all of the existing mods some time ago. illuminatedwax helped the team when we needed it.

       Note that I have nothing against illuminatedwax, and I am happy to hear that support was provided when needed - I just found it curious that (s)he mods both subs, and yet submissions from r/conspiracy are banned (unjustly, IMO) in r/bestof.

       His last post anywhere on Reddit was 4 months ago and he only occasionally did anything on
       <a href="/r/911Truth">
        /r/911Truth
       </a>
       before that. Basically he's been a seldom seen ace in the hole to prevent subs from getting derailed. He's still a mod of 57 subs.

       He has a 7 year old account, he managed to get many good subs when the system started and that's why he has them.

       Being active or not doesn't matter and you can't remove a top mod from being a mod, unless its a special case where the admins remove a mod, but these are extremely rare circumstances.

       Well that's not actually at all true. But like was said in the movie Her, the past is a story we tell ourselves. I gave the entire community full licence to be critical of me for days as they created hate post after hate post. It wasn't until the very end when some users became especially abusive that I banned anyone and even then it was only something like 3 users. But facts don't matter here right? Only the narrative that we tell ourselves.

       I remember when I was banned from conspiratocracy because the facts I presented made people uncomfortable.  It was a test my man.  You wanted to heal the wounds between conspiratard and conspiracy, the fact is that they don't want to change.  They want to change us here, but not themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The past is only a story if we ignore the uncomfortable parts and embellish the pleasurable parts.

       Wow... that is way worse than I imagined, I've heard about business influence on Reddit but not to the point where they can actually have content removed that shouldn't be in fear of job loss, and the fact that it even

       Wow I remember that whole incident but didn't really understand the implications. If that was happening 4 years ago just imagine how tight the control is today. Reddit is a goldmine now compared to then.

       I am applying for a moderator position.

      <p>
       I only want to help take care of reported comments, to ensure the rules of this sub are being fully upheld in a timely and fair manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will also be discussing strategies to improve transparency in this sub, particularly on issues such as shadow bans, comment deletion and removal, and other areas that could use improvement that I may not be aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been a redditor for almost 6 years now, and a member here for about 4 years.

       Thank you, I am more than happy to answer any questions from anybody.

       I hope I am able to be a part of helping to keep this sub great.

       2) I would revert the name of the department of defense back to the department of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of War got a name change as part of the military industrial congressional complex propaganda campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       When ordinary people are asked if they want to spend money on war, the answer is probably "no", but ask those same people if they want to cut defense spending and they would also answer "no".

       i'd like you to you know that i was not prepared for your question, so i have had to take some time to think about it. fortunately, I'm not under a lot of pressure at the moment, so this gives me an opportunity to think it through and give more thoughtful answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, i try to think of things that the president can
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       accomplish. its nice to hear promises from candidates, only to hear later that the caveat was that the congress had to go along with the plan. what can the president unilaterally do on his first day within the confines of the constitution?
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the most obvious and pressing one of all...
      </p>
      <p>
       i still have 3 answers to give, and i may work your concerns into my answer... if only i knew what they were... please give a hint?

       You are very right about this and if nothing else I think it's a pretty interesting thought experiment and I've liked your two answers so far - I'd vote for you. As for the most pressing of all, in my opinion it's ending the Fed and their usury scam. That's the problem from which most others stem from where I'm sitting.

       3) i would address the problems of voter fraud and election fraud in one fell swoop.
      </p>
      <p>
       a) if you get a paper receipt for a cup of coffee, then you should get a paper reciept for your vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       b) your paper receipt would be in the form of HALF of a ballot that is perforated in the middle, top to bottom, with a column list of candidates names on each half of the ballot. there would be a column of spaces in the center of the ballot to fill in your choices for each office. when the voter is done, they tear the ballot in half, the one half goes to the county clerk for digital imaging, indexing and archiving, while the other half goes home with the voter, so that the voter can verify their ballot anytime later online.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm not sure if this type of ballot currently exists, or if it has a name. if it doesn't have a name, i would call it a "tally stick ballot", named after tally sticks, which have served their purpose very well for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       c) ballots would have sequential serial numbers, so that there is a record of the total number of ballots outstanding, and spoiled ballots should be accounted for. ballots would have the same serial numbers in all 4 corners.
      </p>
      <p>
       this system would preserve the anonymity of voters by not assigning a numbered ballot to a specific individual, while giving the voter a way to verify their vote, (and snoop through other anonymous voting data).
      </p>
      <p>
       it is quite obvious that our elections have been rigged, and that the voters have good reason not to want to participate in a sham system. by restoring confidence in the peoples votes, we may increase voter participation, and move toward the true will of the people.

       Your first thought when voting for these people should be "How likely is it that this person might be working for the CIA, the FBI, British Intelligence, etc". Someone incompetent will be less harmful than someone like that. One of most useful positions such a person can get is as a mod. Then they can move the entire sub in ways that their masters want. Like the recent decision to outlaw shill accusations and misleading or sensationalist headlines (WHAT? On
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ??)? Who would object to that most? Shills and agents. And they send a mod we respect out to push it. There used to be few rules for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       except no spamming. Now there are 11. And they are inching us toward the control they want us to have. And those of the mods who are innocent (Most mods) , are more manipulated by them than the rest of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO THINK. Go look at the profiles. And more than the first page. Think if the person has been around a while, been active here, if they submit good articles, if they share at least some of our beliefs. Please consider this. Especially since there are shills and trolls in this comment section voting up their, well, sometimes themselves using mask and sockpuppet accounts. So THINK!

       I would like to volunteer my services.  I greatly believe in the power of this sub and the importance of asking questions.  I am also from an unorthodox religious background with experience in leadership.  I grant that I havent always been on my best behavior here, but I would treat this very seriously because this is a sub under attack and needs vigilant and compassionate protectors.

       I dont think karma points alone should dismiss me. Would you rather have a karma addict or someone who is an established mod from various other subs? I would find their intentions more questionable. I am not trying to get your vote. I just believe in this sub and maybe we need some new blood? Maybe someone who believes that this sub should be a force for good alone is enough? I respect your opinion. Live in peace and love with my blessings.

       And I've never seen a post of yours on the front page , granted I'm not looking at account names usually. Link karma shouldn't be a factor. Also proving to not be a shill seems impossible. But you having half million link karma makes me think multiple people may use your account. So maybe you are a shill

       Unfortunately, I am in the U.S. and I dont have as much time as sovereign man to moderate, but I can help out about half that time. I spend a few hours each day reading posts so that would be the amount of time I could moderate.

       I have thought about throwing my hat into the ring many times, but I do not want the extra stress in my life right now, but I will make these suggestions
      </p>
      <p>
       1-  In the comment box before you type should be  a message on red etiquette  voting (Some lik they have at
       <a href="/r/chiliadmystery/">
        /r/chiliadmystery/
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       2-
       <strong>
        STRICTLY
       </strong>
       No memes/pictures with words, only allow these in self posts, to drive debate about the interesting ones. To discourage kharma whores.
      </p>
      <p>
       3-  A side note for the side bar encouraging  people to visit the ‘new’ queue
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you and good luck to the new Mods whoever they may be, you'll need it

       I'll throw my hat in the ring. I'm state-side if that matters. Not really active in the comments anymore but if I'm online I always stop by to check out what's what and read a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a fair number of the posts here as BS but I'm willing to entertain any thought just for the exercise. I enjoy playing devil's advocate even if I don't agree with the idea. It's always good to get a different perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       When applicable, I always try to keep a level playing field. One person should not receive preferential treatment over another...as I said, when applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not entirely sure what the duties would entail but I'm down for a challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with the process.

       Sounds interesting, but I feel like I have not been here long enough and don't know the "good guys" from the "bad guys" (shills ect). Also I don't always have the time that would need to be invested to do a good job.

       I spend my time in the trenches and provide content that way.  Link karma shouldn't be a requirement.  Your account age, comment karma and stance on 9/11 should meet minimum criteria.

       I'd like to help out, if at all possible (a little late I know).  I haven't deleted anything from my history, so feel free to look at what I've said.

       I'd like to have a shot at being a mod here. I always suspected that this sub is also being controlled by obscure forces and the only way to know is to get into the mod team. I'm mostly a lurker (in this sub everyday) but post very rarely. I'm not from the US, so you'll have someone from a different timezone.

       Thank you all for the kind words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not exactly looking forward to the hate mail I may receive as a result of this, but what the hell?
      </p>
      <p>
       Foremost: I'd like to reassure everyone here I'll do my best to be as impartial and fair as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the other subs I moderate I tend to prefer a "hands off" approach, encouraging free speech, civil discourse and dissent as much as possible. The only two things I don't tolerate: 1) actual spam and 2) overt trolling or threats of any sort. With the added rules here I'll have no choice but to add those to my list when moderating here, within reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line: Don't be an ass and try not to violate the rules.

       Hi, I missed this thread by some time, as you have already found your people. I would however like to express my interest, for any future possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the Internet is the most important resource humans possess today, and Reddit is an amazing invention that allows for people everywhere to communicate with people who share their interests. I love this community, sure there are some nuts here, but I believe this subreddit  could actually change the world. Obviously something so important needs a staff of just, unbiased, moderators to help facilitate the communication of this huge community. I could and can exercise these standards to the very best of my ability. I love it here. I learn something everyday, and I talk with people who, on a great deal of things,  share my views. There's also people who challenge my opinions, which is great too, I enjoy hearing someone else's perspectives. If in the future this community should ever need new moderation, I humbly ask that my name be put in the ballot.

       Well thanks I think.

       I am here for the truth. I believe that the world is extremely corrupt and that the majority of people are completely oblivious to this. My username is coincidental to that. This account was my alternate account back when I had my main account. I deleted my main account when I became fixated on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       because my main account had personal information about me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have learned in time that if people see you as a big enough threat they are going to use any means possible to stop you, hence the deletion of my main account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I seek the truth. I believe the truth is unwavering. It's equal to fact. Many people try to distort the truth whether it be propaganda or such. There are people who come to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to distort the truth. Whether these people be shills or trolls I still believe they are here. That doesn't mean I don't believe that there may be a handful of users that are legitimate skeptics.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit is an important gathering place for conspiracy theorists. It's part of an extremely popular website. This makes it a prime target for any propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am here to spread the truth and to fight against misinformation. If becoming a moderator helps me with this then I would accept. If not, I will continue to be an extremely vocal user who will come to be known.

       She seems to be a very poor judgement for who becomes a moderator. That's what I have against
       <a href="/u/alllie">
        /u/alllie
       </a>
       . She believes that link karma and account age can be a legitimate decider of if somebody should be a moderator or not. She also believes that
       <a href="/u/Three_Letter_Agency">
        /u/Three_Letter_Agency
       </a>
       should not be a moderator simply because I believe that
       <a href="/u/Three_Letter_Agency">
        /u/Three_Letter_Agency
       </a>
       should be a moderator.

      <p>
       <a href="/u/alllie">

       I think it's time to give the people what they want.  I will moderate.  Everyone knows me, and knows what I stand for.  I promote this subreddit across Reddit, and stand up for it when people attempt to denounce it.  I call out the moderators here when their actions become questionable.  I will not stop, and to be able to do so from the perspective of moderator means that this subreddit will remain credible and allow the People to have a voice.

       Do you even come here?  I'm in this subreddit all day, accounted for.  I'm one of the most vocal people on here.  As far as moderating goes, the only subreddits I "moderate" besides
       <a href="/r/Nutrition">
        /r/Nutrition
       </a>
       are ones that I created, which by the way are empty.  The subreddits I frequent are
       <a href="/r/NYC">
        /r/NYC
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Community decides ultimately and for the record SovereignMan was great whilst he was here, he didn't do anything wrong and chose to step down of his own accord. He was also voted it by the community at the time and in my eyes is solid and a loss to the team.

       Since when has "the community" decided, besides when you got a bunch of new subscribers to vote in your buddy there one time, who by the way couldn't handle it and stepped down?  If you want to call it a "vote" (it wasn't), then please note that it happened all of
       <em>
        once
       </em>
       in the history of this subreddit.  I know for a fact that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       didn't get "voted" in, no one had a say when you or the other mods in here got put in, so don't make it like it's some prestigious election in this laughably democratic subreddit.  The fact that you would even attempt to project it as such is insulting to the longtime members in here.  Propaganda like that is exactly what this community is against- clearly you are in a position that you would be expected to know that.

       See this post? It's asking for help and nominations. That is all we can do as existing moderators, consult the readers and subscribers. Same as last time really.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find your attack a little short-sighted considering this is all out in the open. What would you have us do when recruiting or taking on board new help? I was asked to moderate my illuminatedwax some years ago. I can post you the link if you wish or if you think i am a liar.

       I know the subreddit's history quite well- I've been around forever.  I remember when you got made a mod, I also remember when everyone else was made one.  Some deserving (
       <a href="/u/9000sins">
        /u/9000sins
       </a>
       ), some nosomuch
       <a href="/u/FlyTape">
        /u/FlyTape
       </a>
       ).  I'm being up front with you, and if that is the dealbreaker, so be it- but I stand behind my words.  If I get made a moderator, I
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       moderate the rest of you..  If I think there is some fugazi shit going on at the top, you all are going to hear about it.  I make no apologies for that, but I just want to go on record and let the community as well as the other moderators know where I stand.

       But i've seen it work both ways. Solid is a mod in Chicago and I saw them crucify him here. But when Flytape does shitty things I never heard a word about it here.   I acknowledge I'm not an active participant in this sub (or reddit in general to be honest) but I've been on reddit for a long time and I've just always found it best for a mod to follow a community, being that the community is their lifeblood. Just my 2 cents

       Understandable. I simply see
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as unique because it has a major problem with disrupters. Whether these people are simply trolls or actually have an agenda to spread misinformation, the community has a problem. This makes moderators following the community to be a trickier task.

       It is relevant because I was specifically asking
       <a href="/u/alllie">
        /u/alllie
       </a>
       . I was specifically asking
       <a href="/u/alllie">
        /u/alllie
       </a>
       because throughout this submission
       <a href="/u/alllie">
        /u/alllie
       </a>
       has been denying person after person applying moderation. I don't believe there was one person who commented on more applications than
       <a href="/u/alllie">
        /u/alllie
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's to the point where
       <em>
        I simply agreed
       </em>
       with
       <a href="/u/Three_Letter_Agency">
        /u/Three_Letter_Agency

       applying to become a moderator so

       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20rcoh/rconspiracy_is_recruiting/cg641va?context=2">

       felt that was enough of a reason to be against
       <a href="/u/Three_Letter_Agency">
        /u/Three_Letter_Agency
       </a>
       becoming a moderator.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot tell if it's immaturity, stupidity, or what but that's why I am asking
       <a href="/u/alllie">
        /u/alllie
       </a>
       why she feels the way she does about users. She's being the most vocal and at the same time not making any logical sense.

       I get it, you got pissy when we pointed out how the comcast/netflix agreement was being censored from
       <a href="/r/technology">

       at all costs. Or perhaps you got pissy when your wanton prohibition on NSA stories was exposed.

       What I find funny is that your cause celebre is rule 9 being enforced on those who attack this sub.

       But that aside, your tactics of manipulation are not welcome here and if you continue to engage in veiled ad hominems designed to infect this community you will be submitted to the modmail for banning.

       I'll just go ahead and tell you the truth about the "subredditoftheday" bannings.
      </p>
      <p>
       One mod was drinking heavily and was drunk, got really upset about the mockery there and banned some people who shouldn't have been banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wooooooo!
      </p>
      <p>
       Big fucking deal.  Drunk people doing drunk people things.  And while we're being honest I going to go ahead and say that I personally didn't mind the subreddit of the day post because it just shows the lack of credibility of SOTD as well as bipolarbear0.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone who got banned wants to appeal they are welcome to it, it would likely be overturned by one mod or another.

       You've got ten mods. Why isn't that enough? Especially considering you might recruit an intelligence agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least make it a long time user that we know. Not someone with a newish account or some one we don't know or who hasn't been active here for a long time. I think the admins make fake accounts since the new shill accounts were easy to identify. But lately I've seen more users with 5, 6, 7, even 8 year accounts than I've seen in the previous 6 years. It's made me very suspicious. And they don't show up on karmawhore so no one through the years ever did an inquiry on them.

       It needs to be somebody the entire community knows, first of all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about a "prestige" thing...mr_dong is right in that the sub is growing and we need very active and engaged users who have a solid understanding of what it means to actually be a mod at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Yo dude. I want to help out. I'm not sure if everybody knows me or remembers me from any of the multiple front page posts I've had here. I'd also like to point out that during the Bradley Manning sentencing I got the collateral murder video at number 2 on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       before it was removed. That was my alternate account, which I can provide credentials for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please consider my application, go through my history! We've butted heads before but I'd like to think you guys know I have the communities interest in mind always!

       And I've never seen a post of yours on the front page , granted I'm not looking at account names usually. Link karma shouldn't be a factor. Also proving to not be a shill seems impossible. But you having half million link karma makes me think multiple people may use your account. So maybe you are a shill
