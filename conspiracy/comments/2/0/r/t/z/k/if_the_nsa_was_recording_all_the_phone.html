       Good fucking point I never thought of this. Most people keep their phones/tablets on during flight and
there are countless apps that track
Your location. Can anyone else comment on the ability to track this way in flight?

       I would even break policy and leave my devices on, but I've heard of quite a few that do.  Using their GPS to track the flight, speed, etc.  Pretty cool shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to track the passengers, they needed to be near a tower and be within range of the towers.  Typically below 10k feet.

       If the phones can't connect to a cell tower (for example, if they are over the ocean), then there is no way the phone company or the NSA can track the phone.

       As far as I know, the cell phones just rang, and didn't actually connect. You can still get ringback tones even if the phone is unavailable.

       I'm going with a big fat NOPE on this one. It has actually been tested and proven that it was not possible for calls to be made and stay connected as long as they were.

      <p>
       Also, how many people have listened to the recordings? Several of them come off very weird. "Hi mom, this is John Doe, your son...." Who calls their mom and introduces yourself using your first and last name and stating you're their son??

       I very much doubt that in the post 911 world there arent redundant tracking methods on every passenger plane. I suspect they want us to think they can lose a plane.

       Could be that they want us to think they can be lost.  Or they could have hidden it.  I am not quite on board with any missing plane conspiracy theories, but if we explore that scenario, I think it's quite possible all of the tracking systems could have been tampered with.  Even if they flew by a cell tower, it is easy to destroy 200-some cell phones.

       Absofuckinglutely they are.  This was likely the first objective, which grew to capture all data and voice communications.

       Remember that will smith movie where they took control of satellites real time in 1998? 3 years before 911. Before the patriot act and other surveillance state laws and practices exploded into existence? 1998 was 16 years ago. Are we to believe there are no satellites aimed at the direction of where the plane was flying with no redundancy in 2014 when the NSA and all govt have pretty much come out and admitted they are recording everything? Do the satellites not have the capability to record? Why do most people I and everyone else assume we currently have this technology in place? If the people in charge of this sort of thing wanted to, could they not review their recordings starting with where and when the plane took off then follow where it went? If they do have this technology and are still not telling us what happened then only reasonable assumption is that they don't want us to know.

       The majority of satellites generally have bad resolution, and no, they do not track everywhere all the time - it would be very easy to miss the plane going down because it was in the middle of the fucking ocean - somewhere surveillance is not a priority. By the way, that was a goddamn movie. I'm not saying they didn't have the technology but I am saying you're an idiot for using a movie for evidence of what can be done.

       I did not use the movie as evidence I asked if anyone remembered the movie. To think there is no satellite watching that area is hopelessly naive or intentionally deceiving. I bet if you were standing next to me you would think twice before calling me names.

       The problem is that's not who collecting the location data on you, it's being done at the municipal level:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Two dozen police agencies have gathered more than 160 million data points showing the exact whereabouts of L.A.-area drivers on given dates."
      </p>
      <p>
       "LAPD already is using a sophisticated intelligence-analysis program from Silicon Valley firm Palantir, which is partially funded by In-Q-Tel, the Central Intelligence Agency's venture capital firm. Palantir sells data-mining and analysis software to the NSA and other intelligence agencies."
