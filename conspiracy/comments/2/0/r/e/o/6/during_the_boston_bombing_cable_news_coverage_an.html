        BURNETT (CNN's Erin Burnett): Tim, is there any way, obviously, there is a voice mail they can try to get the phone companies to give that up at this point. It's not a voice mail. It's just a conversation. There's no way they actually can find out what happened, right, unless she tells them?

        CLEMENTE (Tim Clemente, former ): No, there is a way. We certainly have ways in national security investigations to find out exactly what was said in that conversation. It's not necessarily something that the FBI is going to want to present in court, but it may help lead the investigation and/or lead to questioning of her. We certainly can find that out.

       Honestly it just seems simply implausible. The overhead to manage a process like that is insane. Think of the amount of phone traffic in the US, all of that would have to be intercepted (a huge task requiring massive technical infrastructure) and transmitted to some central location(s) (massive bandwidth requirement) and stored (huge data requirements).
      </p>
      <p>
       Estimates on the amount of storage required for all phone communications within the US each year are pretty variable, but about 400-700 Petabytes per year seems plausible, but those tend to be based only on personal usage, not necessarily business use which would likely ramp it up substantially (I'd guess double it at least). By comparison, in 2012 it was estimated that YouTube was storing about 80PB a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also from a practical perspective the more content you put into a collection (database etc) the more difficult it will make it to find relevant stuff later (you make your haystack bigger).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in Snowden's documents supports domestic interception in the way it's described here, and surely if it were true then a many many more serious criminal cases would be solved.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like hyperbole from the interview subject to me.

       Did you see the cost of a gigabyte of data?  Petabyte drives are coming to consumers soon.  You don't think that the government wouldn't already have Exabyte or larger?

       I'd say Petabyte drives are quite a way off. 4TB is our limit currently, and drive capacity hasn't been advancing especially dramatically in the last decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that I don't think government could have sufficient drive space, I just don't think it's reasonable to expect they'd be storing up to an Exabyte a year (or more) of random domestic telephone intercepts.

       The thing is just saying there's collection of phone records is no different than anyone saying anything. People lie. People make up stuff. The difference between someone telling the truth and someone lying is having the proof to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And looking back, using hindsight to vilify everyone who claimed the govt collected phone records isn't right either. Because that still means that man is no different to the homeless guy on the street who ranted about collection of phone records.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it comes off almost spiteful but that's how we have to look at it. We need actual verifiable evidence before we can take something as gospel.

       I only made those connections due to the subreddit we're on. And I have to admit I'm heavily biased against those two ideas.

       It's a pretty shitty thing for me to say but why couldn't this guy try to gather some proof? I know there are very obvious reasons for this but without proof he just gets lumped with all the other 'nutters' people here about.
We have the ex-defence chief (or something) from Canada saying 5 species of aliens are walking among us. I don't believe him and I doubt many people do... so it's hard to take anyone at face-value when even high-ranking officials can be - for lack of a better word - nuts.
