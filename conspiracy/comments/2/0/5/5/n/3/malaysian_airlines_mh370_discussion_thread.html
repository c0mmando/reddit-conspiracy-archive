<p>Interesting numerology: Flight 370 disappears on 3/7 while <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/08/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-plane-missing/">reportedly traveling 3,700 km</a>.</p>

<p>Flight 370 flew at <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/malaysia-airlines-plane-disappears-south-china-sea">an altitude of 37,000 feet</a> when it was last reported using flight tracking software.</p>

<p>Malaysia Airlines is one of Asia&#39;s largest, <a href="http://www.theherald.com.au/story/2136958/missing-malaysia-airlines-plane-stolen-passports-raise-terrorism-fears/?cs=2452">flying nearly 37,000 passengers daily</a>.</p>

<p>As of today, we are beginning the 37th month since the Fukushima tragedy, which is located on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster">37th degree and initially caused 37 injuries at the plant</a>. Someone stop me plz :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I instantly suspected the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories of being disinfo, so much so that I didn&#39;t even look into it for a whole year. When I did, I found some of the weirdness surrounding the case very interesting.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just really good disinfo. I&#39;ve been fooled before, I was fooled for a minute today. </p>

<p>My wildest theory is that Sandy Hook was an intentionally obvious hoax to test the limits of psychological manipulation and drive a deeper wedge between &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and the rest of the population. Suggesting Sandy Hook even might have been a hoax will get you lynched in most social situations.</p>

Maybe you should look at the commonality seen on the post here, &amp; that seems to be the act of questioning the information many are fed. Did you ponder for a minute that maybe these incidents are the 9/11 for a younger generation? &amp; instead of disregarding theories (that despite their <em>insanity</em> seem to be growing in perspectives question a said topic based off your own observations of commonality) maybe help push them to other incidents with more investigation? i.e. 9/11, The Reichstag, or any of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZNXt_u7Cr0">the phoney pretexts used to start war</a>.

I will not try to define this incident, because I accept that it can not be defined.

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, but yeah... I was given to conspiracy at one point, out of frustration over the logic in the SAR so far. I think this is really just Malaysia&#39;s incompetence. Their air force, transportation department, and national airlines (MH) all gave 3 different answers about whether passaengers booked or failed to board, as of 4 hours ago, they still are saying different things...</p>

<p>Air force general says they had primary radar contact in the Malacca Straight, and now transportation department is saying &quot;nope&quot; (though I don&#39;t know how/why they would have primary radar). </p>

<p>Some news is coming out that Chinese presence in Kuala Lumpur is increasing in the past day and that they are taking a more direct role in &quot;advising&quot;  the Malaysian and multinational SAR effort.. I hope to god... Malaysia has really bungled this from the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code> The media has reported the supposed incompetence of the Malaysian military. Specifically: we are to believe FH370 flew unidentified and unchallenged across four Malaysian radar zones, due to the lax or incapable monitoring of their national defense system. No jets were scrambled, no attempts were made to identify this aircraft or contact it. A theory could be put forth that The Malaysian authorities were in fact in contact with those in control of MH370 and - under threat of harm to the passengers - allowed flight FH370 to cross Malaysian territory unmolested. Another issue hiding under the veil of incompetent Malaysian officialdom is the bungling of search operations; slow or misleading information releases and ham-handed management of public relations. If examined in its entirety, one gets the impression that they are intentionally misinterpreting events in order to buy more time. Buy more time for what? Negotiations? Redeployment of assets? Hard to say, but these new wider search parameters will allow more time for whatever is really going on. 

 I pray that each and every soul on flight MH370 is returned safely to their loved ones.

    <div class="md"><p>I have the same theory, the plane was hijacked and flown off course for a reason.  The emergency transponder and GPS both disabled before setting a course for Pakistan, or somewhere similar.  There are a ton of airports that could accommodate a plane of that size but most likely would need to land in an unmarked/private field to limit detection.  After the landing they clear the plane of its passengers and load it with a payload (nuclear, biological, explosive) and reskin the exterior of the fuselage to cloak it as a different carrier.  With the new look/signal and the payload on board they fly into a heavy populated area undetected and detonate their cargo.  Even after the terrorist event transpires they will have the ability to negotiate given they have 200+ hostages now in the undisclosed location.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Just read about the computer vulnerabilities <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/18/2013-27343/special-conditions-boeing-model-777-200--300-and--300er-series-airplanes-aircraft-electronic-system">DESCRIBED HERE</a>.  It would seem that it would take &#39;young&#39;, &#39;intelligent&#39; hackers to take control of the plane electronically.  I wonder if you can disable the GPS/transponder from the on board network.</p>

To much work goes into a plan like this to just blow it up over the ocean, I believe the terrorists know that this is an old tactic.  Fear is most effective if consumed over a long period of time.  The masses would most likely be upset regarding the destruction of a passenger plane but will not FEAR it.  Terrorism is not effective without fear.  So the possible hostage negotiation with added payload would keep all countries in the region on high alert.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually a pretty compelling theory.</p>

<p>I would point out that there isn&#39;t any evidence that &quot;the phones are still active&quot; - a cell phone &quot;ringing&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything. I call people whose phones e.g. have run out of power and I often get several rings before going to voicemail.  But overall this theory is strong and covers all the solid information.</p>

<p>Honestly, the plane breaking up in midair due to gross mechanical failure or a bomb or a collision with a clandestine plane (drug smuggling) also covers all the facts.  If there were a catastrophic problem, they might have turned the plane around and then had the plane fall apart - pilots are trained aviate, navigate, communicate (in that order) during an emergency, and it&#39;s fairly frequent that pilots never get a chance to speak to anyone in catastrophes).</p>

<p>The longer it goes without anyone announcing they have the plane, the more unlikely this scenario becomes.  We&#39;ll know soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree that a sudden and catastrophic loss of structural integrity due to mechanical failure, collision, or a weapon covers all of the &#39;facts&#39; we have. Why would anyone search the Straight of Malacca hundreds of miles to the west? </p>

<p>At this point, I admitt I&#39;m veering into the tinfoil hat side of things, but if the plane was stolen to be used as a bomber by, say Iran or the Norks, we&#39;d never hear of it. I looked at a map showing international flights into the us and SF is a likely target for a crude (Iranian or North Korean) nuke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it is, I have a hypothesis on where it might have been headed. I&#39;m highly skeptical of it, but here&#39;s some food for thought if you&#39;re looking for a conspiracy.</p>

<p>If you take the route shown in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/11/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-plane">this CNN report</a>, and extend that line, it seems to lead directly to Diego Garcia, home of US Air Force and Navy bases in the middle of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Since a straight line on Google Maps isn&#39;t always the most direct route over the surface of the earth, I used <a href="http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm">this site</a>, which generates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle">great circle</a> route using the Google Maps API. <a href="http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm?route=-7.319500499999999,72.42285560000005%7C8.017891922875743,103.61920159310102">This is the route it came up with.</a></p>

<p>The points at which that route crosses the Malay Peninsula are virtually identical to CNN&#39;s map, and the line continues directly to Diego Garcia, home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Garcia#United_States_military_activities">lots of US military shit</a>, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Garcia#ETOPS_emergency_landing_site">emergency landing site for long-range twin-engine airliners</a>, and formerly a Space Shuttle emergency landing site.</p>

<p>It probably doesn&#39;t mean anything, but it&#39;s kind of interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting suggestion. I am very familiar with Diego Garcia. My airframe flew out of there while I was in the Air Force. </p>

<p>Or, it is a known fact that the Chinese military, FSB and CIA operate many secret runways in and around the Southeast Asia region. Some of these runways can be hidden from spy satellite imagery. With as much disinformation swirling around this incident, I just get the feeling in my gut that this plane didn&#39;t crash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, either it did crash and it hasn&#39;t been found or there is a cover up of an complete destruction of the plane.  A hijacking/kidnap would be the next best theory. There are <a href="http://www.abc15.com/news/national/missing-malaysia-airlines-plane-texas-based-company-says-20-employees-aboard-mh370">reports</a> of 20 employee&#39;s of a <a href="http://www.freescale.com/">Texas company</a> who made semi-conductors. </p>

<p>The questions should be asked if any of these people are significant standing within the company, either financially or through development of technology. The notion that these 20 people were kidnapped by a foreign power, either government or group should be suspected. </p>

<p>Who knows though.</p>

<p>I mean if it was known that these types of planes had these issues, and that this particular plane was 14 years old, then there would be some serious lawsuits out there. If this was an oversight or lack of an inspection that lead to this disappearance then that&#39;s disgusting. Negligence is a bitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This could have been a major false flag event in order to declare the  Malaysian search efforts as inadequate (even though it really isn&#39;t) and move in their navy into Malaysian territory. The Spratly Islands dispute between Malaysia and China has further tensed with China conducting military exercises only just a few miles from Malaysia only a few days earlier. The Spratly Islands are said to be very resource rich with Oil and Natural Gas deposits. Malaysia&#39;s sovereignty may be under serious threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to my common sense, it would be pretty hard to make a domestic flight just &quot;disappear&quot; over American soil without any trace, unlike the Malaysian Airline flying over an ocean near a different country.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m pretty sure this is the executive order Obama just signed on 3/6/2014 declaring a national emergency. Right there on the whitehouse&#39;s own webpage.
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/06/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-contributing-situation">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/06/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-contributing-situation</a></p>

<p>And our entire country has been completely distracted by this &quot;water cooler&quot; talk of Malaysian Airlines flight 370 that disappeared all the way on the other side of the world. Yet it&#39;s all over the news in every news channel in our country.  Last I checked, that IS the definition of a national story. Furthermore, when something in our country is heavily publicized in the media as this has been and everyone is looking the other way, there usually is something USA/NSA/CIA/POTA related that is afoot. Perhaps you should study up on the history of proven U.S. false flags.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going to start by saying.  You are all way over my head in terms <em>potentially legitimate</em> theories and conspiracies.  This is just the theory that I keep coming back to.  </p>

<p>The more I hear about the increasing role of Interpol, and what I see as their future in preventing passport theft, and holding airlines and countries accountable for violations of such.  I would appreciate any opinions on my theory. </p>

<p>The role of Interpol and the stolen passports are actually a huge part of this.  This whole thing is a 9/11 style conspiracy so that Interpol can use it as leverage to force other countries and airlines to start putting in place airport security, surveillance, and controls similar in nature to those that are in place in the USA since 9/11.  </p>

<p>This is more about the politics of controlling other countries in the future than it is about anything else.  </p>

<p>Just a theory I&#39;ve been working on.  Interpol is on the radio, the news, TV media, they are quickly becoming the face of this issue.  The talk has  been bolstered around the notion of improving the search and identification methods in other countries.  </p>

<p>Something from the mainstream media that highlights what I have been feeling in the past few days can be seen <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/11/interpol-passports-airlines-stolen/6297915/">here</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a small step but it just seems like one that is too post 9/11 reminiscent to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I don&#39;t really know where else to mention this and it seems rather silly but Android phones can be tracked by the owner via their Google Play account by signing in and clicking the settings icon, then &quot;Android Device Manager&quot;.  No 3rd party app is rewuired anymore.  It will then show you on a map where you phone is (great if you loose your phone in the couch or at a bar.)  I believe it is just part of their &quot;location service&quot; that helps create traffic maps and create relavent local searches.  Does it show a location of where the phone last was?</p>

<p>If someone I knew went missing with their phone that would be the fisrt thing I&#39;d do.  I guess I&#39;d havin to know their Google Account password though.  Maybe the loved ones of the pasengers could try a few passwords??</p>

<p>So you suppose it&#39;s not safe to assume that all the phones remain well charged, and intact, and that all the passengers are simply not being allowed to answer them, if they still have them. You think that&#39;s <em>not</em> a safe assumption?</p>

I think that is what the families are implying.  And, from my guess, they are experiencing the same phenomena and are &quot;assuming&quot; that their loved ones&#39; phones are still live, thus, leading them to believe that relatives are alive as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, as I&#39;m sure you all know because it&#39;s common sense, there is no way the plane vanished. Now that that is out of the way, there are things that investigators know, that they are not telling the public, which is normal for any situation like this. What I don&#39;t understand is all the conflicting information that is being poured into the mix. Almost like someone has something to gain by keeping this hunt going for a long as physically possible. If the plane were hijacked and rerouted to land somewhere else, someone would have made contact for the purposes of getting ransom or something else out of it.</p>

<p>Honestly, the only thing that makes any logical sense is that there was a catastrophic explosion at 35,000 feet that pretty much vaporized the plane. My only real problem with that theory is that it would have to be a massive explosion, and i mean massive, a little homemade bomb wouldn&#39;t bring down a 777, which would mean there was a mechanical failure most likely having to do with the fuel tank, or fuel lines. But again thats questionable because of the ext ordinary safety records the 777 has shown over its 20+ years in service.</p>

<p>Basically the only thing I&#39;ve taken from this whole thing so farâ€¦ to be 35,000 feet in the air and having something catastrophic happening is by far the scariest thought i can think of. If that is how it went down, if there was anyone who didn&#39;t die immediately, they for sure died the most scary death imaginable.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either that or it is a legit hijacking and it has landed somewhere. I find that unlikely, but given the information we know, the longer time goes on without locating a debris field, the more probably hijacking becomes.</p>

<p>this was my first thought but it would only make sense to highjack the plane to get something out of it. But no one has come forward asking for ransom or anything else. They could be waiting for the right moment I guess, but that seems unlikely to me. </p>

<p>Interesting theory from another pilot</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The terror organisations recognise that the sure way to win the current war they&#39;re waging against the West is to use the Ronald Reagan ploy of making the war simply too expensive for the other side to wage. If this turns out to be a terroist attack, it&#39;s clever, particularly if it can be repeated. </p>

<p>Someone, be it a terrorist who forced his way into the cockpit or a pilot who has been recruited or forced to co-operate with the terrorists, had to have enough knowledge of the 777 to know which nav and comm. functions to disable - and in a very short time - to cause it to disappear (in an electronic sense) in a matter of seconds. After that, it&#39;s just a question of getting the aircraft a long way away from the commonsense search area before ditching it or flying it deliberately into the sea to destroy it. (When your foot soldiers are willing to die for the cause, the possibilities that can be employed are endless.)</p>

<p>The effect of two or three similar disappearances will be huge. The incredible expense, both to governments and airlines, in just trying to find the missing hull, will eventually become crippling; the drop off in passengers, as airline travel becomes something less than 100% safe in the public&#39;s perception, will hurt the airlines&#39; bottom line; the increased security measures will make airline travel an even more painful experience than it has become since 2001.</p>

<p>All will end up making travel very, very expensive, which means the bad guys will have won, for without easy and cheap air travel, Western society will not be what it has become over the last fifty years.</p>

<p><strong>Facts and Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>If you take the point in time where transponders shut off as t=0, or corresponding location as origin point, a few results can be arrived at:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Lack of debris on sea surface in the immediate vicinity of origin point lead us to believe that the aircraft did not structurally disintegrate, either due to aerodynamic forces or through explosives .</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of IR signature confirmation by US SBIRS (Infra red spotting satellite system) also lends credence to the result that the aircraft did not explode in air at origin point.</p></li>
<li><p>Suicide theory can also be laid to rest because a pilot intent on committing suicide will not linger around in air and in fact will try to head down right away after turning off transponders leading to debris field around origin point. </p></li>
<li><p>However, since we know as a fact that the aircraft eventually crashed, it leads us to believe that the aircraft was severely impaired at t=0, even if it was structurally intact. Whatever happened around t=0 was catastrophic enough to eventually bring the aircraft down. It not only took out communication ability of the pilots but a lot more than that.</p></li>
<li><p>A set of pilots finding themselves in a catastrophic situation are highly likely to look for a landing strip ASAP. Given that they have likely lost their navigational ability as well (most likely), at night, they are going to head for nearest land, wherever they might think it is.</p></li>
<li><p>If we take it as a fact from Malaysian authorities that the aircraft tried to turn around, it could be an indication that the pilots were in trouble and wanted to find land in haste.</p></li>
<li><p>Malaysian authorities claimed in the beginning (perhaps even now) that they lost radar contact at 2:40AM, more than an hour after t=0, if that is true then they were tracking an aircraft in huge trouble looking to land somewhere or anywhere. But it provides a radius of around one hour flying time from origin point to search for.</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding US SBIRS lack of IR signature, it could depend on what their system is optimized to detect. A missile launch is sustained bright fire, an aircraft crashing in a fireball is short term quick burning fire. SBIRS probably accurately confirm that the aircraft did not explode in air, however, will it also accurately confirm that it did not burn under jungle canopy for a short time?.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Considering the military&#39;s strange behaviour since the flight has gone missing, does anyone want to check the rest of the manifest to see if there were others?</p>

<p>They&#39;re <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/20gnvv/comprehensive_timeline_malaysia_airlines_flight/cg35400">out there</a>. I wrote that one up after every post with a link to the <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/06/the-pentagons-n/">Pentagon quest for airliner kill-switch functionality</a> was downvoted. I thought maybe a well-argued hypothesis would be voted up, if for nothing other than clear presentation. But no, voted down to one or zero. So does that mean the conspiracy has to include Reddit as well?</p>

<p>That is why it is fascinating to see how speakers to the media frame their statements. They are experts at appearing forthright about what they want to communicate without entertaining anything that could be conflicting or undesireable. Language, in any case, is sufficiently decoupled from reality to conceal the real powers that drive a situation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initially contact was lost just a bit after the flight was started in the gulf of Thailand<br/>
Now...</li>
<li>They are reporting they last seen the plane at 25000 feet on the west coast where primary RADAR lost connection at the end of its range (100 miles).</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I just spent a few hours looking at the Tomnod site, and something odd struck me.</p>

<p>First, there&#39;s the data: there&#39;s just not that much of it.  They&#39;re using tens of thousands of people to crowdsource the browsing of roughly 3400 images at a time which could be gone over by a single person in a day, not to mention how rapidly software could search that same data for anything that doesn&#39;t look like ocean in a few minutes at most.  I don&#39;t know if the map numbers are consecutive, but they only number up to about 24000.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s what&#39;s missing from the photos: aren&#39;t there supposed to be dozens of planes and boats searching for the aircraft?  And yet, after looking at 50% of the imagery I can only find a handful of boats and other objects; oil platforms, ships what appear to be fishing vessels, etc.  I couldn&#39;t find an image of a single airplane involved in the search.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the radar data.  Did we really need days to find out that the plane had turned around?  I can&#39;t think of any other airline accident where the plane was out of touch for so long without anyone taking notice.  Isn&#39;t knowing where all the airplanes are worldwide a top priority for the government since 9/11?</p>

<p>Kudos to Tomnod for the idea of crowdsourcing a search, but I can&#39;t help but shake the feeling that the whole thing is just an elaborate deception; something to keep the public busy while the government is off doing something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good news at all that MH370 has been confirmed to be hijacked in some way. Whoever did it obviously has yet to claim responsibility, which (in my opinion) means one of two things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The plane was in the process of being hijacked to Central Asia but something went wrong and the plane ended up crashing.</p></li>
<li><p>The group or groups who currently have the passengers are planning something far more sinister than hijacking. Possibly using the passengers as weapons (eg: biological warfare) or as leverage for a bomb of some sort on the plane.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they do.  Although they have to be able to receive data and transmit to do it.  They can track you without using gps based on a &#39;ping&#39; from different cell towers to figure out a location.  The police often use this for murder cases to see if a suspect really had been where he said he/she had been.  It&#39;s not a secret, its been very well known for years.  Although, the police have to get a warrant to view the info from the cell company first.  </p>

<p>If you are in an area with no cell coverage your gps can still receive the data, but the phone can&#39;t transmit the data.  So without cell phone services in range, tracking the phone is impossible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>just my 2cents as an aircraft maintenance engineer</p>

<p><strong>probable theory for MH370: right wing structural failure?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/3fj3qZ8.png">aircraft course changed from 25Â° track to 40Â° track</a> during its last moments on radar and its speed reduced from 474knots to 471knots. (something severely uncontrollable happened in seconds)</p>

<p><strong>case: right wing broken and aircraft spun to its right, giving no time to respond</strong></p>

<p><em>case ruled out: engine failure gives few minutes to pilots to call for Mayday</em></p>

<p>Why only the right wing: <a href="http://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/wing-tip-damaged-in-2012-but-plane-safe-to-fly-again-1.505057">the right-wingtip damage from 2012</a> might have weakened the right wing structure at its base where it attaches to the fuselage.. as the wing also hosts an engine, a base structural damage will be catastrophic to the balance of aircraft and might start spinng downwards in no time. </p>

<p><strong>I insist on wing damage due to its right wingtip repair history and its turn rightwards moments before missing.</strong></p>

<p>why will it turn right?: when the right wing is broken it loses lift, now there is more lift on left wing and immediately causes flight to turn/bend towards its right, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3fj3qZ8.png">thats what you may observe in picture</a></p>

<p>pls discuss..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MH370 is truly one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history so far.. here are a couple of reasons why</p>

<p>-No ACARS message from the plane most likely signifying there were no particular mechanical issues or indicating catastrophic electronics failure on board the plane i.e onboard fire/explosion/in flight break up (unlikely given no debris found)
-Transponder turned off unknowingly why after 1 hour into the flight
-No mayday call or communication signifying technical issues or sort
-Incompetence &amp; conflicting information from the Malaysian government about what they know happened &amp; media blunder
-absolutely ZERO wreckage debris found so far signifying that plane most likely touched water relatively intact</p>

<p>This is truly astonishing, I&#39;m just hoping we have some meaningful information sometime soon..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the possibility of an EMP type device that rendered all electronics useless?  Can planes still fly with manual hydraulics? Maybe they lost power to the engines as well and were gliding with no lights or power of any kind and only the manual control of the ailerons, so the pilot tried to glide with his best guess back to land.  Maybe there was massive cloud cover over the part of Malaysia that they passed so he could see no lights on the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My conclusion in short, pilot suicide. Been following this pretty closely and the following is the only theory I have come up with that I can&#39;t pick holes in so I had to type it out. </p>

<p>Plane disappeared at a very specific point on the flight path at a waypoint which also happens to be the switch over point between Malaysia and Vietnam air traffic control. Pilot was heard to say &#39;all right, good night&#39; to Malaysia after being informed of the switch over. Vietnam were never contacted. This timing would suggest knowledge/prior planning.</p>

<p>At this point I think the pilot would have initiated his plan. Being an over night flight the cabin crew would have been less active anyway but the pilot may have spoken to cabin crew in such a way to give him more time alone in the cockpit. He then will have quickly incapacitated the other pilot in the cockpit. He would have steered the plane west as seen on Malaysian radar before switching off all tracking and comms and changing altitude to effectively become &#39;invisible&#39;. Now invisible, he would change heading again to north east over the South China Sea. At this point crew and passengers would be none the wiser, the wayward pilot could have even made an announcement over the tannoy to reassure people about any recent maneuvres. This would explain why there was no distress calls made by either the pilot, crew or passengers. It would also explain why the plane was thought to have changed its heading to the west.</p>

<p>We now know that the plane never re-appeared on any radar so therefore it never made it to any land mass. So it must have gone into the sea. The Mallaca Strait radar sighting and search has drawn a blank.</p>

<p>Therefore I believe that the plane headed north east to the South China Sea where the pilot knew that radar could be avoided and phone signal would be non existent. It was then deliberately crashed into the water. This could be an attempt to make it as hard as possible to track down the wreckage and therefore the true cause of the crash. </p>

<p>The above corresponds to the oil rig sighting and the recent Chinese &#39;wreckage&#39; pictures. Obviously I can&#39;t comment on either pilot on board but you&#39;d need a huge amount of experience and knowledge to pull off this plan so effectively. Whatever happened, I&#39;m sure it will be found soon now that the search is being expanded over the South China Sea, and hopefully the truth will be revealed.</p>

<p>RIP to all of those on board.</p>

<p>China satellite image of wreckage at 105.63E, 6.7N appears very accurate when combined with seas at 225&quot;-230&quot; from witness crash site.</p>

<p>&quot;When I observed the burning (plane) it appeared to be in one piece.&quot; &quot;Until the flames went out&quot; - this is interesting and I can not make head nor tail of what may cause a fire to start and then go out (Engines???).</p>

<p>Possible scenario is that MH370 had fuselage or wing structural failure from prior accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking at the flight path it seems likely that they lost all instrumentation/gimbles. Looks like the pilot tried to turn around to go back and land. I would have done the same thing. About face and descend slowly hoping to see lights and not hit water.</p>

If the SATCOM antenna adapter ripped away it would stop sending out signals and leave a hole in the fuselage. This would lead to decompression which would cause the pilots to turn the plane around for an emergency landing. If the fuselage somehow ripped further apart because of the hole, the plane would go down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi there, I figured i would come to reddit to post my thoughts on the current situation regarding the missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. By all means i do not want to come across as racist, judgemental or inconsiderate to towards anyone or anything involved in this incident. These are simply my thoughts and my way of attempting to help solve this unfortunate mystery.</p>

<p>Whenever we hear about a significant airline terrorism incident it seems to be caused by a fresh mysterious act that always finds a flaw in the security systems. Lets face it, horribly beings are always coming up with new innovative ways to slide through the cracks of airline security. In case you haven&#39;t noticed, my thoughts are directed at terrorism and heres what my brain seemed to come up with piecing the mystery together.</p>

<p>Is it possible flight 370 was hijacked.. yes of course. If this was the case, why hasn&#39;t any body made a claim about such an act?, terrorists like to do that sort of thing you know, make a stand point and take credit for their horrific intentions. For a minute lets assume flight 370 was hijacked and take into the consideration that terrorists are always coming up with innovative plans.</p>

<p>Is it a possibility that flight 370 was landed safely, after being hijacked, and having its location systems deactivated (possibility), at a remote location that could be further undetected. Think about it for a minute, these terrorists could obtain a devastating suicidal homing missile the size of a building and a further 239 alive hostages. This aircraft could be used in future horrific plans and could just be the beginning of something terrible.</p>

<p>I can briefly demonstrate a couple of evidences that might support this theory.</p>

<p>*Some family&#39;s of flight 370 were able to call their flight victims cell phone briefly before being disconnected. How is this possible?<a href="http://mashable.com/2014/03/11/why-malaysia-airlines-passengers-phones-ring/">http://mashable.com/2014/03/11/why-malaysia-airlines-passengers-phones-ring/</a></p>

<p>*No debris have been found, possible satellite images could be very unlikely inaccurate. (Ocean foam, known unrelated scrap rubbish, etc) <a href="http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/malaysian-airlines-flight-mh370-crash-site-found-by-chinese-satellite/story-fnizu68q-1226853195656">http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/malaysian-airlines-flight-mh370-crash-site-found-by-chinese-satellite/story-fnizu68q-1226853195656</a></p>

<p>*An Australian man claims to have clearly spotted a fitting description of an aircraft that flew at a low altitude with no visible damage (flames, smoke, etc)</p>

<p>*US investigators believe the flight may have continued for hours. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/mh370-satellite-images-show-possible-crash-debris-in-south-china-sea-live">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/mh370-satellite-images-show-possible-crash-debris-in-south-china-sea-live</a></p>

<p>I figured this all might sound a bit crazy and unrealistic, but hey people are voting on alien conspiracies.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media (CNN in particular) have interviewed dozens of &#39;experts&#39; who say &quot;It had to happen this way&quot; and few agree - here is a rational scenario that I have not heard yet - much like Swiss 111 DC-10 over Peggy&#39;s cove.
- right after last communication with Vietnam an electrical fire in the electronics bay takes out the radio and transponder and other instruments including all communications.
- pilots get alarms and turn towards home on autopilot - i.e. set heading along an established path towards a way point for approach to KL.
- fire in belly of plane continues to take out controls in the fuselage but does not affect the senors in the engines which are far from the fuselage. 
- Pilots and passengers overcome by smoke - fire either continues or smolders due to lack of oxygen.
- Plane stays on heading and engine setting with or without autopilot until fuel runs out or it gradually descends to the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>So who are these experts that say it MUST be intentional and their scenario is the only possible answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe a nuclear 911 is imminent and Iran will be behind it. Here&#39;s my theory:</p>

<p>Iranian hijacker has a knockout agent, gas mask and tools to defeat the cockpit door lock smuggled onto the plane during servicing. At altitude, the hijacker triggers release of the knockout agent, hides in the bathroom with his gas mask on until everyone is unconscious. He defeats the cockpit door lock, removes the unconscious pilots, turns off all the radios and GPS, puts on the pilots oxygen mask and then depressurizes the plane. At 30,000 feet, everyone will be dead in 5 minute due to lack of oxygen.</p>

<p>Hijacker flies the plane to standard waypoints and merges with other commercial traffic to cloak the planes passage. Past the Adman Islands, he stays below India&#39;s military radar and makes his way to Iran and lands at a secret airport. The aircraft is hidden in a hanger and the dead passengers are removed and buried.</p>

<p>The plane is then repainted, additional fuel tanks are added and a bomb bay door is fitted and 2 nukes are loaded. Plane is flown to NYC and the first nuke is dropped. 30 minutes later, before anyone can figure out what he&#39;s doing, he&#39;s over DC and the second nuke is detonated.</p>

<p>Why would Iran do this? Because they have lost billions due to sanctions so in retaliation, they will cause trillions of dollars of damage to US economy by nuking NYC and DC.</p>

<p>A companion operation is that they will simultaneously nuke the Saudi oil fields which will take 10 million bpd off of the market, causing a global oil panic and shortage, thus Iran&#39;s oil will suddenly be in huge demand, leading to the elimination of sanctions, which is their end game.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you don&#39;t need to steal an extended range 777 just to nuke the Saudi Arabia oil fields so I believe a USA nuclear 911 is imminent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its strange, but everything points to this being deliberate actions, and finding the crash site to be in the southern Indian ocean points me to believe that whoever was responsible doesnt want the plane to be found or retrieved. As criminal investigators usually say, you should follow the money to find out who is behind it. Who has the most to gain. It is possible the pilots parachuted after setting this course, or maybe the course was set beforehand by someone else. One turn, is explainable as being normal, but two and to end up where it did?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t subscribe to any foul play and I think so much has been said about the pilot just because of the flight simulator, and very little said about the co-pilot who was more of a novice compared to the pilot in terms of flying hours.
I think so many things point to electrical/mechanical failure.
Pilot turned to the nearest airport but avoided land as he knew the possibility of a crash was there. He dropped altitude to attempt a sealanding.
In case at any point this plane flew behind another plane, I dont think it was to stay undetected, but probably to get the attention of someone else while keeping a safe distance.
My assessment of the pilots - pilot is a hero, co-pilot was inexperienced but who knows, maybe he was also a hero.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! I completely agree... Finally someone sees what&#39;s going on here. I think the US is responsible in all honesty! I believe the US framed Russia (for what I have yet to discover... perhaps to get Russia to disarm the rebels? ) only to get rid of veteran AIDS/HIV researchers. America sees any country evolving as a threat. In what ways to remain the most powerful country.. Resources?! Money, education, technology, medicine, food, sanitation etc..I believe we were primarily close to finding the cure for AIDS from years of research from many of the passengers on that flight. What country is most effected by AIDS?! (think about it... it&#39;s politics). By keeping the poor,&quot; poor&quot; and the weak &quot;weaker.&quot; The US has a better chance of staying on top. Also, the US initially seized all activity for the search of the black boxes until they had the opportunity to review the site first to avoid fraudulent confiscation of evidence. (Ya Right!) Why was the plane flying over a war zone in the first place? Wasn&#39;t there a more direct route to their destination? Finally, can someone please explain how all of this extreme evidence of videos and audio has emerged out the blue only to point the finger at Russia. If the alleged video activity showed missiles being moved by Russia, and it fact we were aware of this strange activity initially, why didn&#39;t anyone say anything? I would like to think if Russia was honestly responsible for shooting down flight 17 that they wouldn&#39;t be dumb enough to use their own missiles which of course is recorded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is this plane was hijacked in the intention to be used as a terrorist attack. I think something went really wrong somewhere and in the process of disabling communications etc. so the plane couldn&#39;t be tracked they may have turned off gyroscope-autopilot thing (excuse my ignorance!). These hijackers probably relied on this to help fly the plane. Since it was disabled it caused them to enter the ocean at a 180 degree angle completely submerging the plane kilometres under the ocean leaving no debris or traces of anything. </p>

The reason no one could call out is because the people were gassed.  (Put to sleep, so to speak.)  It is currently being re-skinned with other markings, and loaded with nuclear explosives.  It will take off and do damage within the next few hours.  ...Or...not.  I hope not.</p>

<p>How do you pass by a stolen passport?  Isnt there some proof on it that it is actually you??  IF so those 2 people.. hold on <strong>2</strong> people actually did something on this plane.. dont you think that the 100+ people would of done something.  At least someone would of..  </p>

<p>My thoughts are that something is going on underground within the whole cluster fuck of Russia and Ukraine playing with themselves.  Were going to get involved cause were the United States, we want to rule the world.  We cant leave shit alone, we&#39;re in everyones business.  I dunno where this plane is or whats going on, but Russia and Ukraine, now this.. somehow theyre all gonna form together and we are going to be on the brink of World War 3.  Russias gonna overtake Ukraine, forms alliance with N Korea, and the US is gonna is gonna be a test dummy cause &#39;We own everything&#39;</p>

<p>Most people post their sources when they make claims since that&#39;s easier than making everyone Google it to corroborate or refute. Just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>And sorry not being up on my reddit etiquette. Still pretty much a newb on here. I do, however, find it sad that we have apparently reached the point of technological laziness where people can&#39;t even google something for themselves. But they will sit there all butthurt about it and type you a bitchy response for not doing it for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did anyone see the photos of the Flight Captain&#39;s personal flight simulator? It was some high tech stuff. Why would he want that when he clearly has access to better flight simulators for training at work? Perhaps to train for something at home that would otherwise raise suspicion at work? Hmm... You know who invests that kind of time and equipment in training? Military organizations. Look at the US Navy Seal Raid on Osama&#39;s compound. They went as far as to actually construct a mock compound to practice in. Maybe the Captain is part of a black ops operation and the plane was stolen for future nefarious use. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t &quot;send GPS signals&quot;.  GPS signals are nothing more or less than timestamps sent from satellites.  Your phone or other computer has the ability to detect the time differences between those timestamps due to the speed of light, and use that, geometry and a little relativity to work out where in the world you are.</p>

<p>What happens is that planes receive GPS signals, convert these into a position, and then broadcast this result - on a completely separate band and in a different format than GPS.</p>
