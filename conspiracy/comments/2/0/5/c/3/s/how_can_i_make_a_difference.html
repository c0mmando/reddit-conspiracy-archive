I do not mean to disrespect the people that are continuously making great posts and opening my mind, I just get more angry with myself because they make me feel like I am the smallest minority but I want to do something to better this world, or my country or even just my state! I want to band together with my fellow man and fight for a better world where politicians work for the people and not for the money, where the government fights for our rights and not for their paycheck, maybe even a place where we are all treated equally, where education is given without a large expense and no truths are hidden.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, I just want something more for myself and my fellow man, woman and child. I think you guys have the right mindset to achieve this, can you point me in some direction to better the world?</p>

<p>Edit: thanks guys I have a lot of work to do. I&#39;m more than happy to start an internet movement, but I feel underqualified at this point. Time to make some small improvments in my life. Hopefully at least one other persons too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so glad to see this post. Lately i&#39;ve seen posts around here of people telling other people to do something, and accusing those people of not doing something. This is the first post i&#39;ve seen asking for help, and you sound very emerged in all this which is fantastic! It&#39;s nice to know there&#39;s someone who really cares. (not saying anyone doesn&#39;t, you&#39;re just the one to express it) You might form a group of some sort? Like a research group, or something. Get a few guys together over the internet, have each of them spread the word of this group all over their hometown, in hopes of getting people to join. Once you have an in-person group in your town and you can start protesting and other sorts. And having those original connections to those internet guys, you can plan things, all over the country, at the same time. It&#39;s really not hard to do any of this, we just have to take the initiative! If <strong>you</strong> care what society thinks of you then you should just turn around forget about all of this because you&#39;ve already lost. This country is based off <em>freedom</em>, what part of not doing something you&#39;d like to do because you&#39;ve been trained your whole life to think that being judged is the worst thing imaginable is free?. You can&#39;t be scared, you can&#39;t back down. <strong>You really have to understand what we are dealing with right now.</strong> There are bad things coming for us in the coming years... It may be too late to stop it, but it&#39;s not too late to form a group and make connections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP I empathize with you. I too feel like something needs to be done and for a multitude of reasons I am unable to find it in me to do more. I&#39;ve sort of come to the conclusion that there is only so much one can do based on the paradigm we live in. For me personally I do my best to be a good guy to friends, loved ones and everyone and everything in general. This helps keep me smiling and optimistic.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;ll know when the time is right to rise up and change things. I have faith in humans that we eventually will be forced to do whats right for the future.</p>

<p>I try my best to relay information to the sheeple in my life. I keep it low key even though I want to explode into an Alex Jones style rant. (I&#39;ll never forget how turned off I got before I woke up when people would go on about conspiracies). </p>

<p>I typed this top part immediately, then scrolled down to see pretty much all positive useful ideas, what I said is said in other words, and there are tons of other even more practical ideas.</p>

<p>I really do like these self-posts that draw out such positivity, it does a lot for my morale, and as I said, there are practical ideas there too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most important thing <em>not</em> in the news right now is the JTRIG leaks. Most people think the spying is only being against defense threats, now we have proof it&#39;s being used to interfere with public discourse and to assassinate the characters of political opponenents to the Powers that Be. </p>

<p>You can make a very reasonable argument that any government that engages in this activity is illegitimate, and the proof is all laid out in the leaked slides.</p>

<p>All you have to do is look at the extreme lengths that have been gone to the censor this story to get a hint of how damaging it is.</p>

<p>Even on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> we have an army of people trying to convince us Greenwald is a &quot;limited hangout&quot; agent, going so far as to suggest those particular slides are forgeries. Funny that the UK government simply censored the story instead of challenging its veracity.</p>

A lot of the shit on this site is nonsense, people talking out their asses, and a lot of just hateful arguing and irrational fear. But the reason I still subscribe here is for the few posts that clearly come from someone who knows what he or she is talking about. If you really want to do something for this world, goddammit you need to be smart enough to entertain ideas without accepting them, as well as be able to see new knowledge and change your previously held beliefs. Education&#39;s the silver-bullet: the only investment that you can make and recieve positive returns from no matter what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can be &#39;active&#39; without much effort by using counter-propaganda, at the least to create awareness. Stickers are good for that.

    <div class="md"><p>You can make a difference by trying to wake up other people and make them question what they think they know. </p>

<p>It sounds trivial, but most of us here remember a stage &quot;Before Conspiracy&quot; - when ideas that challenged the official narrative would not even be considered. And then, at some point, the curtain opens and you realise that your blind confidence in the official narrative was just an illusion - a delusion.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s a delusion that we all have, and if you can help someone by lifting the curtain, you have really achieved something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this may be unpopular but I have to disagree.  I understand the idea of voting in a democracy to express your overall opinion on the direction of our country, but in my opinion the ability to finance a candidate and a campaign gives an extraordinary amount of influence to individuals and corporations that have lots of money, at the cost of completely disregarding the wishes of anyone that does not.  </p>

<p>Case in point: most people voted against the Iraq war, but we went to war anyway.  The majority of the country favors not for profit healthcare, but it doesn&#39;t matter.  Most people would like to see more efficient travel so we don&#39;t have to drive cars everywhere, yet it never happens.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that our government does not represent &#39;most people.&#39;  It advocates for financial capital, often simply to implement the laws which they themselves write.  Our democracy has disintegrated into a corporate oligopoly where the interests of very few dominate the wishes of the many.  It is is the exact opposite of democracy, or perhaps its logical endpoint.  </p>

<p>Regardless, it&#39;s eating itself and the planet.  Our economic and political system appear to be completely unsustainable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voting is nothing more that a facade. Besides, when you vote your not just voting for democrat or republican, you vote on which laws are to become legal. Which all in all you are voting to take someone&#39;s money, and put it somewhere else, like social security for example. The people who choose not to vote are truly the ones who allow others to be free. </p>

<p>Voting will never change anything, PERIOD.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave this here, even though you wont watch it. It clearly explains more about why voting is useless, and fuels the fire. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5mZ5FBHg0A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5mZ5FBHg0A</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Direct democracy and anarchy are slightly different, and a large civilization based on voting is subject to a number of concerns. Who decides what issues need to be voted on, how and when? How do you overturn old decisions? What makes an issue worthy to be public domain, and not something for the markets to decide? Who enforces the vote and how can we trust them?</p>

<p>Instead of direct democracy, libertarians or anarchists might advocate for a system based on non-aggression <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle</a></p>
