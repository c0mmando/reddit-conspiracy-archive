       If you want to go on someone else's website and locate an address, go do that. You don't have to post it on this website for a discussion of the events that occurred. What's your address? Would you mind posting it here for everyone to see?

       of course I mind, but if there was a reason to discuss where I live - some kind of rumor that I got the house for free, and just moved in, like most of my neighbours. .and then we all sold.  yeah I'd be curious.    If I had been a witness or participant in a crime, you can bet the media vultures would be here at my door harassing me and putting me on TV whether I liked it or not.

       weren't we discussing people on a plane that disappeared.  I saw names on the news, I can't repeat them here?  is that harassing the families?  what about the reporters that harassed the victims and the kids on the scene that day!! and then paraded them in media for weeks and months..  such exploitation is only one sided?

       Names are fine, addresses and further details are not.  Why the fuck do you care so much about "exposing" the families of dead children?  This isn't a fucking witch hunt.  Or wait it is.  Ive had enough being civil, sandy hook truthers are as bad as holocaust deniers and are as abhorrent to me as torturers and rapists.

       LOL.  I never accused you of calling me or anyone a shill, but it does happen round this sub on occasion.  Dont be butthurt your comment was deleted because it broke reddits TOS.  Do that on your own private website if you so desire, but as the mod CORRECTLY deleted it, you can see its not allowed here.

       No problem.  They should just put a waiver and say they aren't responsible for the views and content of users.   I'm sure that the poster is the one that would get sued if it could prove damages, and not reddit.    If we post copyright material, that's fine too..

       The fact that they have to play this game is more revealing to me than anything.

       Sigh.  Reddit is not governed by the US constitution.  Its a private entity which can set its own rules.  Dont come here if you dont like it, no one is forcing you here.
       <br/>
       And the people being oppressed are victims families and Lanzas family.  You have no right to start a witch hunt by posting information.  I'm truly amazed you cant see what you are actually saying.  You can be free to oppress people because you feel like it and anyone who tells you otherwise is "the police" or JTRIG (still haven't explained that yet).  Why are you allowed to victimize innocent people, whilst also saying your rights are being infringed?  Christ I have a complete lack of empathy for people but I at least understand the fuckimg CONCEPT.

       It's the names, addresses, and date of birth that bother me. Just as I would report someone for going through your trash, scanning your bills, and posting them on reddit, I don't think it's appropriate to be sharing this information with a group of strangers.

       If I was a suspect in such a visible and extraordinary case, I think it can be expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because certain names and associations of interest are discussed publicly, doesn't mean there's a slippery slope that everyone will be doxxing everyone else in no time...
      </p>
      <p>
       and on that point, we already pay people to do this, but we don't think that the law enforcement is being effective (even with all their invasive spying with no oversight)
      </p>
      <p>
       in these cases I feel it is important for people to be able to communicate freely and openly.  if they are not, then it only goes to further their resolve,  as you are seeing.    there are more Spartacus' than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       If our authorities are behaving criminally (not a stretch) and police are not effective (also not a stretch) do you agree that shutting down and censoring citizen action is appropriate action?  do you think it's effective?

       If you want to start your own forum where you can post people's personal information for discussion, you are more than free to do so, dealing with all legal ramifications on your own. However, this is Reddit, and it's against the rules.

       Listen; I agree with you...partially. Stay with me. I know you have different beliefs about Reddit's censorship than me but I will try to be as unbiased as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       No proof has been presented for
       <em>
        either
       </em>
       side. If they were posting personal information (addresses, phone numbers, etc.) then it would've been recorded and banned. If they weren't then it would have been allowed to remain. No one in this thread has evidence and neither side should be jumping to conclusions (myself included). I realize the burden of truth is on those making the claims, but because proof is not readily accessible yet doesn't mean it isn't there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's your job as a moderator at this time to make sure discussion stays intelligent and ensure that people don't attack each other personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look forward to your opinion and hope that this thread doesn't devolve further into ad hominem than it has already. The hostility in here is palpable and I think that most people should just take a chill-pill until the situation is clearer.

       <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zDRU1dvoXEEJ:www.reddit.com/r/sandyhookjustice+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us">
        the Google cashe
       </a>
       and check some of those ingur links, you will see many full names, full addresses, and other personal information. There are instances where personal info was redacted, but others in which it wasn't. That's just on the one page, too, so there may be other instances on other pages.

       Thank you for posting some form of proof. Perhaps this will provide enough incite as to why it was removed. Full addresses and phone numbers should not be tolerated even if they are "limited purpose public figures" as many people on this subreddit are justifying.

       Certainly, that's what I try to do. Likewise, I also have an opinion on the situation as a byproduct of being a regular user so I am trying to do both in different places. Get's a little tough sometimes due to the way in which external groups engage in manipulation on this medium.

       Is it terrible logic to assume that the standard for banning subreddits is maintained no matter what subreddit it is or is it terrible logic to look at this situation with a dogmatic bias, like you have? There has been no falsifiable evidence to link Reddit, Inc. to a specific agenda so I am basing my conclusions off of the standard that they have upheld in banning subreddits in the past - a violation of Reddit policy. The burden of proof is on those who accuse Reddit of having an agenda.

       I liked your response but I also don't think you realize that both parties are at fault here. Many people are coming from
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       and admittedly some of them are probably vote-brigading but so is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Both sides are de-railing intellectual conversation. Many from
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       are trolling but many people from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are ignoring all criticism and claiming "shill!"...
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I found this post from
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       but I'd like to have intelligent discussion. To say that "external" groups are ruining this thread is a ridiculous generalization as it's overreaction and dogma - from both sides - that is ruining this thread.

       I'm entirely with you here. I've noticed the same thing on ATS and a with a few friends who recently got into conspiracy theories and its the same reason I barely even bother to browse this sub / ATS anymore. The best part is, he didn't even answer your very simple one line question. It may be a complicated answer, but he didn't even mention any relevant information. I think the scientific process has been lost from a lot of peoples approach to how they treat information they are presented. A lot of the time photos and videos are provided with zero context, and propagated as factual and undeniable proof of events they are barely related to, its scary what some people will believe. But I remain open minded, and will make my own decision based on what I think of the evidence, not what someone else says.

       Nah I'm still with you! I think the worst part is how easily people will demonize institutions or governments just because they're organisations. They seem to treat them as single entities and not as being made up of other humans, with lives, thoughts, emotions, ambition and most likely, a different perspective than their own. For example somewhere in this thread someone said "how can reddit be so against internet freedom" (because of banning the subreddit) and the assumptions of conspiracy started. Someone has also mentioned it was "likely" the father of the shooter, who owns a big company, put pressure on reddit to remove the sub. No evidence. No clues that point to any wrongdoing, but a dangerously paranoid assumption of there being more than meets the eye. I'm very tempted to start a website or YouTube channel based around dispelling some of these more outlandish theories, or at least collating information, giving people a (mostly) unbiased look at the evidence. I would start with the 'no planes' theory I think.  I haven't found one bit of evidence that isn't either the dying words of a 90 year old man or a story about 2 guys seeing a plane disappear one time, and I'm supposed to believe the USA had hologram tech 13 years ago that could pull of 9/11. Now if I see evidence, I'll adjust my outlook, but Ockham's razor suggests maybe we hold off on the assumptions. Heh now I'm ranting!

       The type of "revolutionary speak" you mention is merely proper english written in a verbose way with no limits to diction or vocabulary. Is it so wrong to write in such a way? Writing is one of the last bastions of proper language, as colloquialisms have all but engulfed modern spoken language. To write in these "grand" ways is merely to write in the "right" way, nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your attack of the language is peculiar since the language and style of delivery have no bearing on the merit of the message, yet you use it as an ad hominem to justify your dismissal of the subreddit and its ideas. Tell me, am I justified in saying you're a fucking idiot because you write in such a haughty fashion as to tell others what they can and cannot write and how they can or cannot write it? Because you "seem" to have a superiority complex, is it fair to write you off as a complete loser stuck behind a keyboard, possibly working for someone who is equally spineless?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it unfair to do those things because the way a person speaks isn't a valid point to judge by?
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that, and stop downvoting someone for having a serious discussion.

       To me, it didnt look like you pointing out irrational behaviour so much as you taking issue with the kind of language he used. Just my 2 cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what if he wants to use long or dramatic words? At least he's speaking in complete English sentences which is more than can be said for a large percentage of today's Twitter-damaged minds.

       I hate how that one incident is used to argue that investigating and discussing anything on your own is stupid, dangerous, and reprehensible. It wasn't the people scrambling to find answers and save lives who were at fault, it was the people who jumped to conclusions and decided to take the law into their own hands.

       There's ample precedent for this decision (just ask
       <a href="/r/pcmasterrace">
        /r/pcmasterrace

       ): when doxing becomes a problem in a community, that community is banned (except if it would set off a PC bombshell like srs). If doxing was a problem in this community, you can rest assured that this subreddit would be banned too.

       The entire subreddit was basically dedicated to sifting through people's personal information (among other things) until they found a "lead." The
       <em>
        entire subreddit
       </em>
       was the problem, not just a post or two. It was many, many posts. Reddit was the wrong place for a community like that.

       Agreed, the admins really seem to prefer leaving big mods alone until it explodes (e.g., violentacrez and what's probably gonna happen with BipolarBear).
      </p>
      <p>
       In good faith, I think it's justifiable to an extent: they don't want to set a precedent for stepping in and solving community issues (e.g., what happened with
       <a href="/r/xkcd">
        /r/xkcd
       </a>
       ), they seem to see that as the job of the individual communities. I think they really just don't like stepping in and figure that's the job of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       In bad faith, sometimes that logic goes too far, I agree. Sometimes "not stepping in" becomes "don't ban powerful mods even when they break rules" and that's a problem.

       Nobody is stopping you from investigating and discussing anything. Go get a 10 dollar a month web host, throw a forum up, share it with your fellow investigators, and do it there. You're not allowed to doxx people on REDDIT. The site you're currently on.

       You personally posted Adam Lanza's home address (we can see it on the cached version of the subs front page). Does that not explain to you why your sub was banned? You were the only mod, you deserved to be banned for doxxing, your sub went with you.

       His address, phone number, gas bill, AAA number (of both him and his brother) were all posted. And the mod did nothing to stop it, in FACT, it was the one and only mod of the sub posting those things. The sub didn't have a chance and I don't think it was a very grey area.

       You keep changing what matters. Regardless it's against TOS. Just because someone dies doesn't mean you can post personal info on REDDIT. I swear, all you people need to get your own fucking forum. Get a 10 dollar web host, throw a forum up, share it around with all the little investigators here, and then you can't blame reddit anymore. Reddit has TOS, read it, tell me where him being dead changes anything. It sounds like YOU don't think it should matter. And when you make your own forum, that's fine. Right now the Admins control reddit, they control the TOS, and when you break it they ban you. This is not a complicated matter, I don't understand how SO many people are having a hard time getting such a simple matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fyi, Ryan Lanza isn't dead. Yet his personal AAA information was posted right there on the front page by the subreddits only mod. Also, for all we know that's Ryan Lanza's phone number. The paid PeopleSmart search couldn't even differentiate the two people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Or some random person's phone number, those searches aren't reliable. That's just one more reason why it's not allowed on Reddit. Innocent people get hurt.

       Reddit itself has only a very few rules.  No posting personal info is one of them.  They intentionally made it very broad because they didn't want people trying to carve out loopholes.  Technically you can't even post your own home address.

       You're correct that I dislike the conspiracy angle. It's disgusting and ignorant by any measure.

       However, I'm not so sure you understand the flaws in the argument you're presenting. Even setting aside the glaring obviousness of breaking Reddit's ToS, you should take a look a closer look at the information detailed on that site and compare it to the information shared in the subreddit. There's a pretty big difference.

       I am glad that you felt compelled to put your two cents in. Using your logic editing a newspaper article to comply with privacy laws is a form of censorship and that by extension editors should rightfully be known as censors. You should write a letter to your local paper's
       <del>
        censor
       </del>
       editor and inform them of their new job title and the fact that they are producing and distributing heavily censored material. I am sure that they would perform a cover up of your exposé by not printing your letter.

      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess I can spare a moment for a short English lesson.
       <br/>
       The word "censorship" means blocking speech that is not favorable to a government, media outlet, or some other group or individual that has the power to censor for one reason or another.
       <br/>
       In this case, reddit is a media outlet, much like a TV station or newspaper would be. Reddit finds the articles of speech which provide personal information about other individuals to be harmful and objectionable, so they block it from their media outlet. This act is also knowing as censoring content. You'll find that this is very similar to an FCC censor who will bleep out profanity and cover up nudity on network television, albeit on a much smaller scale.

       Oh your one of those pedantic ones that can't take a joke. OK then you must be correct because you are persistent, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       No. You are still incorrect in calling the removal of the ravings of a lunatic that was posting personal information censorship. To use the example that you provided an FCC employee that removes or obscures offensive or obscene material is indeed a censor. I would be very surprised to learn that an FCC censor was censoring news items though. Pray tell which branch of the government has an employee at Reddit banning Sandy Hook private subreddits because they are offensive,lewd, harmful, or otherwise unfavorable to Reddit? Link me a source as I am sure it would be a rattling good read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Removing material harmful to a private individual who is not affiliated with or employed by Reddit or it's parent corporation and it' subsidiaries is not censorship as you have defined it. In removing that sub Reddit is not "blocking speech that is not favorable to a government, media outlet, or some other group or individual that has the power to censor for one reason or another" (your own words) because those individuals who had been 'doxed' do not have the power to censor and the sub was not presenting material unfavorable to Reddit. By your own definition you have proved yourself wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is an aggregate and only hosts user supplied or user generated material and aside from an administrative blog doesn't itself generate posts or material and is therefore not a news or media outlet. It would make the decision to remove that crazy fucks blather closer to a materials collection policy or editorial selection.

       Those were your words, your definition. If you had linked to a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship">
        Wikipedia
       </a>
       article or something as I had prompted you to do you could have read a far more encompassing definition of censorship. The issue is that you have a feeling about what you perceive censorship to be and you want me to share that emotional response. Most of these conspiracies are based on feelings and information is judged by it's ability to reinforce those feelings. You have feelings of inadequacy and of being insignificant--hence your pedantic attitude and blind insistence that you are right and that yours is the only view possible despite evidence to the contrary. You are so emotionally invested in the idea that Reddit is engaging in censorship that you will not even accept your own words, your own definition of censorship. Admitting that you are incorrect will not diminish you as a person but instead aid in your on going development as a human being. You are retarding your own growth; You are literally retarded. I will have that chai now with extra black pepper. I like the zing, don't you?

       You continue to read too far into things, and you continue to not understand the simple meaning of words. I'm not emotionally invested at all. I've even said it was well deserved censorship. But it is literally censorship in the pure essence of the word. Reddit doesn't like personal information being posted, so reddit censors posts that contain it and subreddits devoted to it. It's really not that difficult of a concept, how are you having such trouble with it? Did you hit your head? Have you been doing too many drugs?

       I have broken it down Barney style for you. You used too broad a brush when characterizing Reddits responsible and reasonable actions as censorship. You did not apply those broad strokes to your own stated definition of censorship though. The individuals who had been doxed did not censor the material harmful to them and that material was not harmful to Reddit. When a city works department removes graffiti from a wall is it censorship of the artist or is it enforcing rules and complying with policy? Now imagine the same artist has tagged your home, business, or personal property. When you remove it are you now a censor and are you amending the free speech of the artist?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Reddit doesn't like personal information being posted, so reddit censors posts that contain it and subreddits devoted to it
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So it really is about the feels for you and not about the rules then?  As I said you are so emotionally invested in your incorrect interpretation of the situation that you feel so threatened by the idea of being wrong  that you are closed to any other view, so much so that you are compelled to engage me time and time again. Perhaps you could start a subreddit devoted to Reddits using the TOS agreement to censor the internet. r/TOS_is_Censorship with

       Holy shit you STILL don't get it. You could win an award for your thickness. Enforcing rules and censorship are not mutually exclusive.  Censorship is not necessarily a nefarious cover-up or attack on those being censored. I'm giving you a simple neutral classification but all you're seeing is the negative connotations that I'm not even implying, no matter how much I explain to you that I'm not implying them. Your complete avoidance of anything even remotely approaching a reading comprehension competency will astound generations to come.

       I'm  not really sure why he approved me. I sure as heck never asked to be part of the sub, but I did submit actual crime scene photos to r/conspiracy with little notice until r/conspiratard got into a lather about it. They can be frisky that way.

         It's pretty blatant how obsessed he was over /r/sandyhookjustice. He spent a considerable amount of time copying and pasting entire comments from the private sub to /r/conspiratard in order to mock them.

      <p>
       You say the idea that he spent a lot of time in

       despite being against the sub's general gist as "vile and disgusting" and call him "obsessed" for doing so.

       At the same time, you say that you spend a considerable amount of time in r/conspiratard, a sub you presumably do not support. Would you consider yourself obsessed? Perhaps leaning towards vile and/or disgusting? If not, why are your hands clean and his dirty?

       It's ironic that you pose as a high minded individual, looking out only for the people who had their address published. However, your comment history is dominated by bile and bias attacks in this sub. Why visit if you're not going to keep an open mind and only contribute by belittling others?

       You are absolutely correct that the address should not have been published but banning the sub was a drastic step. I'm assuming you asked OP to delete the offending post first and they failed to co-operate?

       well, since you didn't spaz out and accuse me of being a monsanto shill or whatever, i'll give you the gift of perspective.

      <p>
       to an outsiders perspective:
      </p>
      <p>
       A senseless tragedy occurs, due to a combination of lax gun laws and poor mental healthcare. Its tragic, but statistically inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, here's a group of people who are taking as their starting premise that it couldn't possibly be that simple, it had to be a shadowy nexus between agencies X Y and Z, the actual functions of which they are willfully unaware of, involving the cooperation of tens of thousands of people, for nebulous, unimaginable goals which are presumably of earth-shattering consequence, however whose shadowy lies are easily revealed by google searches.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are using willfully/ incompetently misinterpreted data to harass families who have had loved ones taken from them by a senseless act of tragedy, accusing them of being a part of some shadowy movement to steal our purity of essence, because if you REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want to, bend a few facts here and there, cite a few schizophrenics, squint really hard and just basically flout all rationality and logic, you could create an argument that its a conspiracy. And anyone who doesn't believe you is a fucking idiot, and you're all basically harvey dent crossed with jesus

       True that, anders brevik happened in a society which is basically utopia compared to ours. However, you must agree that more guns + less mental health equals a higher chance for this to happen than anywhere else, which seems borne out by evidence.

       Sure, however this kid  couldn't get guns anyway, he was a child. So the laws are already there for children. Furthermore besides the massacre there was absolutely no reason to believe that this would happen. If it were impossible for the mentally ill to get firearms it's reasonable to assume that this guy (once he turned 18) should have been allowed to purchase guns.

       That's the thing though. More legal guns in circulation means more chances for a legal gun to get stolen or misappropriated. If there's one gun in the country in a glass case, we can be pretty sure nobody is going to get their hands on it. If there are millions...

       So you think that 'a nutcase shot up a school' is less plausible than 'the government built a fake village staffed with hundreds of actors to stage a shooting to ineffectually push gun control, and not one person has spilled the beans, but they left tons of evidence literally everywhere including in the movie batman.'

       You are right in much of what you say but I personally don't think you were right to do what you did.

      <p>
       Free speech is in the constitution not to protect speech we agree with but to protect the speech we don't agree with. I subscribe to the school of thought that believes it's fundamentally important in any democracy that all voiced have a right to speak. I don't have to agree with them, listen to them or like them but I must allow them their opinion.

       To use a technicality to get rid of speech that many hate, will be popular- but it doesn't mean it's right.

       Reddit isn't the United States government so 'freedom of speech' has absolutely zero relevance here. I think you may be confused about how the constitution works.

       Additionally, try distributing your literature in McDonald's. When they kick you out, is that also part of a conspiracy?

       To be fair, he wasn't attacking your right to say what you want. He was defending other people getting pissed off at the inflammatory uses of your free speech. Just because you have the right to free speech doesn't mean anyone has to like it, agree with it, or even accept it as legitimate discourse. If you're going to cry out about the right to freedom of speech, you can't really turn around and say that its unfair and ridiculous that there is backlash to unpopular and inflammatory crap. They have the right to call the sandy hook conspiritards just that as much as they have to spew hate speech and ridiculous accusations at the families of the victims and so forth. I honestly would have no remorse if the family member of a victim physically assaulted (no matter how bad the extend of the injuries may be) a conspiracy theorist who accuses them of being part of some big conspiracy or ploy or whatever they call it. I think it is pathetic, vile, and disgusting that they would approach the family members of the victims. It wouldn't be any different if they did that to 9/11 victim's families.

       I don't actually subscribe to the Sandyhook conspiracy.  I like ideas and understanding people's perspective. I can do that without having to agree with them.

       My problem isn't that people don't like the banned sub. People  can downvote and comment to their heart's content, that's reddit. Using a technicality to get the forum banned, is a step beyond free speech. It's an attempt to close it down.

       Did I ever make that claim? I just think the official story is full of hole, anomalies and inconsistencies and so I'm curious which pieces of evidence led you to agree with the official version of events? Since I'm sure, of course, that you wouldn't just take the MSM's word for it.

       if you google hard enough, and start with a conclusion instead of a question hard enough,   The evidence that you aren't a serial killer is full of inconsistencies.  The evidence that we live in a reality governed by physical laws and logic is full of inconsistencies. The evidence that two plus two equals four is full of inconsistencies. At some point, you have to use occam's razor and decide that the CIA didn't implant you with a chip to make you THINK 2+2 = 4

       It seems reasonable people would want to see proof to back up this commentators claims, as there are a few users in this sub who were members of that private subreddit who have directly contradicted his claim that personal info was not censored.

       Probably because the sub was centered around getting that type of info  and Reddit didn't want to be complacent in whatever was going on and took the road that protects their private interest to avoid potential lawsuits.

       I can see a sub being deleted if the moderators weren't removing the content themselves.  The admins aren't interested in moderating subs, so if a sub is violating their policy I imagine they just view it as not being able to trust the moderators/creators and just remove the sub.  If the creator was violating reddits policy even more reason for them to remove the sub as it would be clear they can't trust the sub not to break the rules again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a touchy subject that's for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       with the size of the site they could easily claim ignorance to whatever happens on it or have something that absolves them of liability I imagine.  But I think the moment it's brought to their attention they are obligated to act if it's violating their policy or else they become liable at that point for facilitating or being complacent.
      </p>

       I'm not a lawyer so i have no idea about the legal mumbo jumbo in that could or could not get them in trouble.

       A very convenient overreaction. I wouldn't be surprised it was JTRIG agents posting the info just so they could have an excuse for their other agents (mods/admins) to delete the sub.

      <p>
       Funny how other subs (ones that don't ask uncomfortable questions about the official story) don't get completely deleted when people post personal info. The post gets deleted, the user banned, and it's done.

      <p>
       I wonder when the wider reddit community is going to say 'fuck this' and leave for pastures new. The site is completely corrupt. Then again, the vast majority of users only seem to care about posting about memes, cats, and games.

       IS the user that posted it and the only mod, as far as I can tell. You can't just delete someone's account and not their subreddits that they are the only mod for. Who do you make moderator? How would that be objectively* decided? It couldn't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the user added other mods, we wouldn't be having this discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with the amount of upvotes that this has, I don't think I can subscribe to
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       sub anymore. It shows how much bullshit is upvoted without any logical reason, and just to further convince themselves that everything's a fucking conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       *added 'objectively' to emphasize my point that while it could physically be done, there would be no way to determine objectively who the new moderator would be. What if it's a shill? What if it's an asshole? Also, if you allow the only mod to choose, they could choose their alternate account, rendering the deletion useless.

       edit: I like this sub, but, the reddit conspiracies are kind of distracting at times. However  I do remain subscribed because I like all the information I can get. I can sift through all of it and come to what I can think is a logical conclusion. Now that this site has garnered main stream attention it has to be assumed it will be swayed at times especially with so many posts being deleted from the front page.

       <a href="/u/mindsequalone">
        /u/mindsequalone

       's account was banned, it would effectively make it an unmodded subreddit. How would he transfer ownserhip? With the account he can't use?

       All that information is public record.  You can find it by request at the local city or county courthouse.  And most (if not all) states have it available on-line for anyone and everyone to peruse.  The backwoods state where I live has a site laid out with pictures of the homes, value, ownership, other properties owned, and other information.  In many cases, layouts of the homes are shown.

If I get banned, I will find a new way to disseminate information. This way seems open enough to allow dialogue, but benign enough not to scare, hurt or intimidate people too much. I do want to be sensitive to those who were negatively affected by whatever this IS.... They are a huge part of the reason I'm looking for the truth.

       I'm confused, as we also prohibit vacuously calling other users shills or trolls. In this way rule 10 is tailored to protect the free flow of ideas on both sides, while abating those here to intentionally distract from pertinent discussion.

       I generally don't have a problem with moderation on a subreddit--I'm a moderator of a few subreddits myself.  It does strike me as hypocritical when mods of community that is almost always ready to assume any deletion of content is unfair moderation (not saying all are like that, but it's a very common theme here) would so freely ban others for their opinion, even if they are blunt.

       You see this a lot in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       offshoots, where they say "This subreddit is about freedom of speech!  All shills (as decided by the mods) will be banned."  Erm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think there should be an atmosphere where people should be able to criticize certain theories, but part of that is allowing people to criticize the overall culture of a place.

       Completely unrelated, but have you noticed that vacuous is a reddit-word, just like defenestrated? Although vacuous is probably more widely used, both are rather obscure--and if you ask me, bombastically magniloquent.  ;)

       You realize that public figures, even if they were thrust into the limelight against their will, cannot be doxxed?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A person can become an "involuntary public figure" as the result of publicity, even though that person did not want or invite the public attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        A person can also become a "limited public figure" by engaging in actions which generate publicity within a narrow area of interest.

       Having your child get killed in a mass shooting does not make you a public figure and it certainly isn't justification for what you guys are doing. Harassing the families of dead children so you can fit some insane theory to your political ideology??? That's real fucking nice. I'm all for a good conspiracy but holy shit you guys are way off on this one.

       I have a serious question about this.  If your child was killed at Sandy Hook, and you were invited to the White House and paraded about to gather support for the administration... And you went along with it... does that make you a public figure?  Seriously, I'm asking.

       You may have felt you were protecting Reddit, sir, but you are only harming it.  Information wants to be free and your censorship runs counter to that. Also, I don't believe anyone in this sub, let alone the 141 up votes you have at the time of writing, are from r/conspiracy subscribers, but from another source stuffing the ballot, so to say.  Democracy is dead and Reddit is proof of it.  You are the agent of the destruction of democracy and should be ashamed!

       I did not ask for shit. I found the sub through searching for 'Peter Lanza' reddit, and this sub was near the top of the links. If the sub is private, then there must have been some magic spell put on my account when I created it because I had access. I thought all of reddit had access too. That's why I was concerned.

       I heard there's a whole floor in secret underground government lairs where they just browse reddit. they get there by going into the men's restroom of the old truckstop/Hardee's on I-470 headed East out of Topeka. It's been closed since 9/11, when they suspiciously built a new one on the more heavily-trafficked I-70. They just go in there, browse reddit, and look for conspiracy-based subreddits to report. It's the ultimate way to stir dissent.

       I don't think so, honestly and no one's ever accused me of it. I have a really hard time figuring out who the subscribers of this sub are. I used to think they were hopped up 19 year olds who could "see what's REALLY happening, man."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I think it's just a scary feedback loop. There is literally no controversy here. Yet, all these comments. All this vitriol. Why is it being wasted online? Because it doesn't exist. If we all did half of the things we said we would do online, there'd be people in the streets - but there isn't, cause we don't. You guys just sit here and bark at shadows. Which is fine, but don't pretend like there's any nobility in it.

       I think you are scared. I think you know there is something terrible and nasty in the room, but you won't look at it, and you don't want anyone else to look at it because that would give it power. You come here to keep glancing tabs and huffingly bolster your ignorance, and maybe it is working, it is for most of the insipid masses, so congrats. Leave us who care to our studies.

       Sure. There's enough in this world to be scared of without going around pretending like there are monsters behind every curtain. This sub, in general, is alarmist and dysfunctionally paranoid. But I won't deny being scared, I will deny using that fear as an excuse to create more problems than I really have.

       Yet here were are talking about it uncensored.

      <p>
       Censorship means the government won't allow it. Violating reddits TOS and getting banned or deleted is not censorship.

       Everyone keeps bringing up the fact that this information is "publicly available". That is irrelevant. The terms of service are about
       <em>
        personal
       </em>
       information, regardless of whether the information is public or private.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three different words: personal, public, and private. Personal information is forbidden, regardless of the other two words. I can only explain it to you. I cannot understand it for you.

       No.. It's a more complex form of censorship. Read the JTRIG slides to get an idea of how nuanced the government's information manipulation strategies are.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there really is old-fashioned government censorship going on. There's no reasonable explanation why the JTRIG leaks were completely ignored by mainstream media. Someone told them not to run it.

       Actually the terms state that things such as a celebrities and senators publicly available is ok. And that posting details of another redditor is not.

       Actually, whether or not it is protected free speech is up for debate, and is being debated. To just point out "Well they are a company so HAHA fuck you!" Is an absolute fallacy of logic. It is unacceptable for ANYONE to censor ANYTHING. Period. Its the same kind of shit that JTRIG does.

       If YOU owned the site and it was taken down by a governing body then yes it's censorship. However, if someone else owns the site, makes rules, and deletes something based on those rules, well thats just them doing exactly what the terms of service said they'd do. It's not censorship and its not a violatuion of your rights considering they have no obligation to even provide the platform for you to express yourself.

       If Reddit has a problem with personal information being posted, why have the mods of

      <p>
       I want you to answer that question since you agree that the posting of personal information is a banning offence. If someone gets banned immediately for posting personal information like being discussed now, why do repeat offenders who also send death threats not get banned?

       They certainly do apply, insofar as if reddit inc wants to hide behind the veil of legal culpability with regards manipulating the organic curation of content then they must do so legitimately.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could theoretically censor and remove every story that Alexis, Erik and Steve didn't like (and openly say so); but that 230 million in valuation wouldn't last very long, would it?

       Oh c'mon, the valuation comes from the (false) perception that content flows freely here; to quote Yishan directly, "Any manipulation of the organic curation of content poses a direct threat to the viability of the jobs of the admins."

       Sure this instance of manipulation may not reverberate in the larger metasphere, but repeat this type of shit ad nausem and reddit v2 is waiting right around the corner.

       Did you just tell me to give up on the free flow of information as a maxim because it's 2014? That's disgusting.

        The admins have been very good at subtly intervening with the organic flow of information when no clearly spelled out rules are broken. IMO, this is why they run PR firms and are known for the "antique jetpack line of business" in the industry.

       It wasn't the families that sparked this theory IIRC, it was just the homes in SH and Newtown in general from a public website listing home values. It began by looking at Nancys home and finding that, and traveled from there. I don't remember any full addresses being posted, just Street names.

       You must not be familiar with how someone becomes a limited purpose public figure, often times they are thrust into the limelight against their own will.

       As to the distant relatives aspect, you missed the point by a mile. Cupcake made it clear that distant relatives were the only one's who could fall under the category of "private indvidual", therein precluding her statement from applying to any of the Sandy Hook families.

       Do you have any evidence to back up what you're saying? I know early on people were getting in trouble for this and I believe the user who ran it was very careful not to do this as he knew it was an offense.

       FEMA deputy director Richard Serino was at the finish line of the Boston Marathon 15 minutes before the bombs went off, and immediately after. You should downvote my comment instead of investigating for yourself, because Richard Serino might upset your world view. Remember kids, downvotes are upvotes!

       First one, I was pointing out the fact the reddit admins banned the sub, that's usually good enough since they don't go around banning subs unless they have too. Second one, I was questioning this sub who normally only require a youtube video or an article from "asheepnomore" or some bullshit. Learn to read.

       Theres a reason Sandy Hook won't go away. The public is aware that something isnt right, and they are talking about it. If you want to believe the official story, you can just veg out in front of the TV. the internet works well for people who appreciate many points of view, as opposed to the canned talking points of corporate agenda driven media.

       This is completely moronic.  What do I have to gain by thinking it was a hoax and/or psy-op?  Why would that make me "feel special and better than everyone else"?  Think about what you're saying and you'll realize it makes no logical sense at all.

       If you were honest, you would admit your "doubt" is from a position of complete ignorance. You weren't subscribed to that subreddit, and you are arguing with some people who were. Your opinion is of, literally, no value.

       That's Adam Lanza's address which is already publicly known as he was the gunman, it wasn't sharing any personal information apart from that of the already convicted mass-murderer.  All it shows is that he chose the alias 'Ryan Lanza'.  Where's the personal info?

       First you say you can't see any personal info... Then I show you. Then you say it's ok because he's a public figure. Let me help you out here so you can figure this out.

       I linked to you right there so there's no hard work on your part. Now tell me where it says you can post personal information on public figures on THIS, a private owned website. Because as I read it, you can't post ANY personal information.

       My point is that it wasn't information on random/related people like some were suggesting in this thread, not once was it mentioned by you guys that it was Adam Lanza's information, and furthermore this information is readily available and has been repeatedly shared through media.  This guy pointed out that if you searched Adam Lanza, Ryan Lanza came up as an alias.  There was no new, incriminating or private information shared here.  An article with Adam Lanza's information would not be deleted off of the main subreddits, and has been included in many news articles that have made the frontpage, because it is a unique news story of a particular magnitude.  That subreddit was private, consisting of 90 members, and the 'personal' information was widespread and would not lead to a 'witchunt' because Adam Lanza was already a public figure.  Would Saddam Hussein's, Osama Bin Laden, or other terrorists information not be allowed to be posted anywhere on reddit? That is simply not that case, in journalism or on reddit.

       And my point is it doesn't matter. He PAID a service to get all of Adam Lanza's personal information and then without his consent (obviously) posted it on reddit which is firmly against the TOS. Reddit is not journalism. Reddit is a private company with TOS YOU agreed to when you signed up... Paying a service for Adam Lanza's phone number and address and then posting it is against that TOS. Adam Lanza's personal phone number, by the way, not saying anything journalist posted. Google it yourself, all you'll find is it posted on a couple internet sleuth shit blogs. God forbid whoever gets that number next.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, we'll ignore the AAA card pictures of both the Lanza boys, we'll ignore the private gas bill he posted, we'll ignore all that. All of which are against the TOS of this site. Because just posting the paid PeopleSmart picture was enough to get him banned.

       y You can believe what you want. I just wouldn't go around posting peoples addresses, gas bills, and AAA cards unless you wanna get banned. Regardless of if you consider them a public figure or not. Just my suggestion, and as we've seen, the admins agree with that and it's their website.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wish you would just tell me where in the reddit TOS/rules it makes an exception for famous people. Then I would agree with you, but you haven't really argued about the TOS. Only that YOU think it should be allowed.

       In my opinion the TOS/rules on private information is ambiguous and isn't a universal application.  I can post the address of the whitehouse here, or the location of Osama Bin Laden's last hide out, or a number of other things that could be considered personal information.  The rules are ambiguous and apply to appropriate circumstances.  Either way, let's say you're right, why does that justify the deletion of a whole subreddit? Are you saying if I post personal information on any subreddit it should just be entirely deleted?

       If you're the only mod of a subreddit, posting 80% of the content in the subreddit, and you get banned. The subreddit can't exist without a mod. It goes too. Also, there were MULTIPLE doxxing accounts on the subreddit with the mod not doing anything about it (he was posting it in fact!). Subs have been banned for less, but this doesn't really seem very grey to me.

       Mate you just massively changed your post.  Like I said, I see your point, but we very much disagree, I'd like to remind you we're talking about the information of a terrorist who killed a bunch of children here though.  Once again, this isn't private/personal information of random/loosely related people, it's information that has had plenty of coverage.  Sharing information of a confirmed mass murderer and terrorist is simply not grounds to delete a whole subreddit, and if that were the case, the majority of the main subreddits wouldn't be here.

       His phone number (which can belong to someone else now), gas bill, and AAA information are not public information. Especially when its the sole mod of the subreddit who's posting it all. It's a mods job to STOP people from posting personal info, not post it. And you're literally making things up. His phone number, which was in that search, was NEVER released by anybody bot internet sleuth spamblogs. Google it yourself. Find one journalist with integrity that posted all his info. You won't find it. I'll link you to reddits TOS here.

       Ahh nice, resorting to attacking my character and strawman arguments, nice bit of rhetoric you get there.  I've looked through, and there's no personal information there, so yeah, you're wrong.  PM the link or whatever then if you're worried about being banned. It's embarrassing btw, arguing like a child.

       It is from ignorance, there's no evidence to either side now. However there have been multiple times where personal info was not redacted, and has caused problems. Especially with people trolling others in conspiracy subs, I still highly doubt every piece or personal info in that sub was censored/redacted.

       Just ignore him. He spends his time playing semantics and poking holes in people's posts like this. He's not worth your effort.

       You could just give us the evidence that shows why you think what you said is true, that would be really easy and would prove you are not just here to stir shit.

       I already posted above that the user who ran the sub was well aware that posting public information would get him banned, so unless you can show me the personal info which you are referring to I have no reason to believe that was the issue.

       Not everything said in this sub needs evidence, half the shit said here is without anything behind it. We are all here to share our thoughts/ideas/opinions. But the only time mine is called out is when it goes against some conspiracy. When all I've stuck to is saying, there isn't evidence to prove either side, but that I will still hold an opinion that I doubt it. I've never said I had evidence to back it up, next time my thoughts disagree I'll try and keep them to myself.

       It's just that the whole issue of posting personal information in regards to Sandy Hook has been a big thing around this sub and I'm almost certain that the user running that subreddit was well aware that they'd be banned for posting information.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when you so confidently suggest that they were posting personal info it's not surprising that people ask you why you think that. There's another user claiming he SAW the personal info on a cached site, and so far he's linked one URL that showed no personal information. This is why I'm skeptical that personal information is the issue here and would prefer to see it myself before taking anyone's word.

       It was more than a single post and that was just one page.  It only takes once instance for a user to get banned and since
       <a href="/u/mindsequalone">
        /u/mindsequalone
       </a>
       was the only mod his subreddit was deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get why everyone is blowing up.  There was a very clear TOS violation.  There's plenty of Sandy Hook talk here so its not like Reddit its trying to stop it.

       Why, so if I link X you can tell me I need to find X+1 in your ever moving goalpost? Are you going to admit it may have been banned simply because of personal information if I do? Or just move the goalpost again?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is your goal simply to get me to post multiple pieces of personal info so I get banned?

       Edit: Yea, there are multiple posts on the webcache's first page that have personal info. It's been proven, you just refuse to look.

       I'm sure you did. That's called confirmation bias. You can't be assed to take 2 minutes (if you click reeeally slow) to see it. The only reason I haven't linked it directly is that it's personal info.

       There's someone else telling you where to look. It's pathetic that there is proof right in your face a dozen times in this thread and you refuse to face it. Like as long as you pretend it's not there the rest of us will magically not see it too. Shit like that is exactly why people don't take conspiracy claims seriously.

       You know pretending something isn't real doesn't make it not real. You just look like a tool when you respond to me posting the proof with "but y u no post proof?"

       Do you have yourself convinced that I didn't JUST post proof, or do you realize you're trying to ignore reality and just don't want to admit it?

       Which is still a bannable offence to post on reddit... The only mod of the sub was banned and the sub went with it. We'll ignore the gas bills, AAA cards, dates that families moved, we'll ignore all that personal information. He PAID a service to get that personal info and posted it on reddit. You could do that with anybody, and you would get banned.

       Fifth down, it shows all of Adam Lanza's personal information. Now, read the title, he admits he paid for it... Is that good enough proof that the only mod of the subreddit was paying to dox people?

       I see. And yet here you are talking about a banned user, and a PRIVATE subreddit that you won't have come across before, as if you know all about them? Excuse me for being a tad sceptical.

       No they weren't. Where's your proof? You're trying to discredit an honest investigation into a massive government operation. We know who was behind it and the user who ran that sub was showing us all the evidence. Either you are voluntarily closing your eyes, or you happen to work for a certain organization that has a vested interest in keeping people away from the truth. Which is it?

       You're new here, so I'll give you a pass. The Sandy Hook event was a hoax - a "virtual atrocity" or drill scenario, in which fictional persons, including 20 children (whose identities and flimsy backstories were created for this event) were "murdered" by a crazed gunman. Adam Lanza is also a fictional character, based on a real person called Ryan Lanza (that the media would have you believe his brother).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though it was a poorly executed hoax and the official narrative is riddled with inconsistencies, the fact that local, State and Federal authorities and the media promoted the event as genuine has succeeded in fooling millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of actors played the roles of parents in the virtual atrocity, and they have become extremely rich by fraudulently setting up charities for their fictional children. Those parents.

       I can't tell if you're trolling or if you genuinely can't figure this out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A subreddit that is brand new has little readers or spotlight. It was deleted early before anyone really got to view it. The only people really focusing on it is one moderator, the creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Delete a thread like this which has probably been viewed by thousands of people in a subreddit directed to pointing out this kind of censorship and that is controlled by a group of moderators trying to actively point out the same thing and you'll get a shit storm.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really wasn't that hard to figure out. I have a feeling you were just trying to be contrary..

       idk, you make a great point.
maybe they did it because its a specific topic that has a specific sub?
if its this post logged under the sub conspiracy it might be blown over/ over looked anywhere else (on other pages on reddit.)

       It was a trash subreddit for a bullshit &amp; offensive conspiracy theory, makes complete sense it was deleted(about time). The sooner this community can move on from that disgusting joke of a crusade for "truth", the better.

       Also, you're out of your mind if you think a meaningful portion of the population believes in this BS. A revolution is already underway, a social one. "They" is not a singular entity. Get real.

       You talk about reddit in the same way some people refer to the government, as a single entity. However its made up of people. Individual people making decisions, not one all powerful corrupt single entity banning and censoring whatever it sees fit. How can reddit be so for internet censorship? Because its full of users who understand enough about technology to understand how important internet freedom is. Look beyond the typical over hype conspiracy bullshit and I bet there's a logical reason for the sub getting banned, and I bet you it comes down to butt-hurttery, needless drama, and not "reddit" trying to censor a conspiracy. I'm getting sick
 of the mindset around here that EVERYTHING deserves a conspiracy, or is a coverup, before there is any evidence people are at arms, just chill down, let's see what emerges.

       That's the thing, isn't it? I frequently observe people address this place as if it's a sentient being. Reddit said this. A sub did that.

       but thats kind of the problem, this isn't a big life revelation. This is a subreddit getting banned for (at the time of the post) a reason that we weren't aware of, yet people are so eager to make a big deal about it without waiting for the facts. So it turns out some personal information was posted and someone took the opportunity to get the sub taken down, but without knowing that beforehand how can you decide what your actions should be? it's a dangerous mindset to get angry over assumptions. Even now, the right action should only be to create a new sub, restart the community and be more careful about breaking reddits rules and giving people a chance to be assholes. By the way I say all this and am very much opposed to the sandyhook conspiracy, I do however advocate free speech. This isn't entirely directed at just you either, however this mindset of "do now, think later" is becoming quite scarey as I notice it a lot more from friends recently too. We should be able to control ourselves and think logically about these things and not rush to any conclusions, and certainly not call for any "action" (whatever that may be) before we even understand the situation.
       <br/>
       edit: now it turns out it was a troll, yet you were ready for action against Reddit and internet censorship. Point proven.

       It's a meta-sub for separating borderline schizophrenia from plausible conspiracy. "NSA coverup evidence revealed," 1000 upvotes? They don't care. "Ancient aliens predicted Obama's election via Oscars numerology," 30 upvotes? They break out the popcorn. They poke fun at the latter nonsense from everywhere...

       And really, this Sandy Hook bullshit is much closer to the latter than the former. Some super-secret cabal fabricates an entire town for the express purpose of faking a shooting and passing gun control... and we don't even fucking pass the gun control?!

      <p>
       Anyway, if you wanted endless media coverage of a tragic shooting, you wouldn't hire "crisis actors" to live the rest of their lives under fake identities with imaginary dead children. You'd give some nutjob a bag full of guns and point him at a real school. Infinitely simpler. No loose ends.

       Christ, seriously. Like 9/11 wouldn't have been a national tragedy if the buildings hadn't fallen. They were ruined and probably needed to be demolished anyway. It was a gigantic "fuck you" that would've served bin Laden's stated goal: goading the US into a war of attrition against piss-poor guerrillas.

       Try to understand this: Just because the outcome of the plan did not happen the way they wanted it to (gun laws passed) does not mean that they did not stage the event for that exact reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       People say over and over again. "No laws were passed, see!" That's as much proof as Sandy Hook's plan failing as it is evidence for SH not being staged to begin with.

       They're obviously powerful enough to have staged such an event but not omnipotent hence why all of the story's loose ends and unanswered questions.

       cares about. Some guys arming one nutjob to "hasten the inevitable" and push their agenda is, while improbable, certainly plausible. It only requires one asshole and one nutjob (and some guns). There's nothing funny about nitpicking that. It's simple and dull. Only the truly wacky shit rises to their attention.

       No, but it severely undermines the claim that some unseen agency (presumably government-based) would have the power to fake an entire town and all its denizens. When you have the resources to fake a school shooting, let alone to actually pull off

       When people disagree on the actual FACTS that prove this was a false flag, it's obvious they're not just some ordinary sheep. Why else would the government want to get rid of the subreddit that was showing proof of their involvement? And why else would so many commenters show up in this thread claiming the sub broke the rules, without any proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to learn that there is a difference between what 'they' want you to think, and what reality shows you. This subreddit has done wonders to free the people from the chains that oppress them. Anyone that chooses to come here and deny others their right to be enlightened, is nothing more than a government agent, whether they know it or not.

       The bear situation is pretty fucked, seeing as the admins were given evidence that bear was using IRC to spread links to his attempted anti-Semitic cognitive manipulation here.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's also interesting is bear caused reddit inc a worldwide PR snafu over the censorship of the JTRIG story last week, yet he is didn't even get a slap on the wrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very interesting indeed, as it does seem that the admins "reward" certain groups (
       <em>
        ahem
       </em>
       srs
       <em>
        ahem
       </em>
       ) on this site with the ability to brigade with impunity, manipulative the organic curation of content at their will, and openly laugh at those who try to stop them.

       I was shadow banned for posting a print screen of that.  That's my best guess anyway, since i did nothing else for a week+ leading up to my shadowban.  And i messaged the admins, and never received a reply.  Meanwhile that fuck is still a mod LOL.

       And yup, subreddits exist whose sole purpose is brigading.  That NP link stuff is nonsense.  Just make it against the rules to link anything...print screens/np links/etc if the sole purpose of that is ridicule

       At the risk of sounding like an activist, getting in touch with an anti semeticism advocate can help put political pressure on even Conde Nast, and you can bet that some heads would roll regardless of whether the Bear is a paid schmuck or not because hes one of their big official mods and represents them regardless of anything Reddit or Nast claims in a legal announcement. But thats just pressure on the corp. The bear can just switch to another alt and have the "council of elders" modificate him again.

       It's troubling when reddit admins remove a subreddit.  Particularly when they won't explain why.  Removing a subreddit should be a very last resort and should be thoroughly explained.

      <blockquote>

        I reported this sub to the admins because u/mindsequalone was posting the names and addresses of neighbors to the Sandy Hook school. The insinuation was that all of the properties on that dead-end street were owned by the same family, therefore it is somehow related to the shooting. It really doesn't matter what the intentions are. He posted names and addresses.

       Posting the names and addresses of those people is not a wise idea, and potentially dangerous.

       not really a fair comparison.  reddit can ban and censor all they want.  the more they do it, the more the Streissand effect kicks in.. so enjoy the show they put on for us.   We pay for it after all.

       There is a subculture of conspiracists who are fixated on local level tragedies [Boston, Sandy Hook, etc.].
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I follow, the tragedy is enacted in order to convince the public to give up their civil liberties [guns, privacy]. Then the group develops into a semi - movement, where they disect whatever is available online, and arrange it into a few variations of 'what really happened'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nay - sayers [who believe the official stories] consider the conspiracists to be paranoid/fearful. The common assertion says 'the paranoid conspiritards can't face the chaos and uncertainty of reality, that bad things sometimes happen, and rationalize the tragedy as some sort of setup/insidejob/cover up/fakery acted out by a variety of powerful shadow rulers [who have a variety of motivations].
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracists consider themselves to be privy to the true narrative of reality, naysayers to be uninformed, ignorant sheep. Quite often there are accusations that users [those who voice opposition to the alternate, premeditated theory] are or seem like/sound like paid government agents who are spreading disinformation in a cyber-info war between the shadow rulers and the resistance burdened with knowing the truth.
I have never found myself entirely in either camp [both examples are on the extreme]. Five years ago I was an avid skeptic of the official stories of 9/11 and vocally anti-fed. At this point in my life, I look back at how much time and energy was spent fixated on the struggle-for-the-truth, and decided that those beliefs just distracted me from focusing on my school, work and relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to your question about the cover up. To naysayers, occam's razor is more than enough to discredit a conspiracy.
To conspiracists, they too use occam's razor. However, the rationale is preceded with an a priori truth that there is an agenda pushing shadow elite who frequently manipulates events; therefore it seems more simple that this is yet another case if the wool being pulled over the eyes of the ignorant majority. The difference lies in the foundational beliefs [the popular narrative vs the shadow elite narrative].
      </p>
      <p>
       Without changing the initial belief of the other, both groups are bound to endlessly argue, ridicule, attack, accuse, etc. It becomes a cycle of finger pointing and back-patting [circle jerking?]. This ultimately serves to preserve the integrity of each's own ego- a very fundamental motivation for many acts and beliefs of various groups and individuals.

       One of my main issues with the whole shadow gov't illumanti controlling the world narrative is that the same conspiracists claim that gov'ts are stupid and don't work. How can the US gov't be an infallible machine that can cover up tons of innocent bystanders deaths(9/11, sandyhook, boston) and also be incredibly stupid? Either they are incredibly efficient and smart or they are totally incompetent...I think most would agree on the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US gov't can take tons of time on even the most mundane tasks and issues...how can they possibly be covering up all these deaths? That network would literally include like 100,000s of people. I'm sorry but there is no way our gov't is that efficient and if there is some efficient shadow gov't that can do of all of this stuff then what is their endgame? Why poison and ruin all of their "slaves", why kill the manipulated masses? For what reason? Population control? Oh yeah thats working real well...
      </p>
      <p>
       However I do think real conspiracies do exist...for instance something like watergate at the time of its occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got really into the 9/11 and RFID chips in highschool but ended up in a similar boat to you. "Trying to uncover the truth" takes up far to much time and it often leads people to anger or depression. Its just not worth it. In the end if its true...well what could I have done? On the other hand if it isn't true then at least I didn't waste years grasping at straws.

       This is the real gaping hole with this conspiracy(and others). We need to hold two contradictory statements as true in order to keep the conspiracy narrative alive.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The government is a massive, powerful entity, with the means and motivation to stage this event in full public view.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They hired amateurs who leave holes that the (methodical, rigorously skeptical) conspiracy community
         <em>
          always
         </em>
         sees right through. Keep in mind that these same folks call conspiracy/false flag after
         <em>
          any
         </em>
         event of historical significance.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In addition these both have basic assumptions that can be easily proven false - half or perhaps even more of the government is very much pro-gun, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, we need to pretend that this resourceful entity also apparently didn't conduct their due diligence and find out if such an event would have the intended effect(see gun legislation enacted/changed in the year following Sandy Hook).

       Really, it comes down to a worldview in the end since you can't prove a negative. It doesn't matter how unlikely the conspiracy theory becomes after skepticism, there will always be people who craft some counter-intuitive reasoning akin to "but that's what they
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       you to think", and there will be those who have the worldview to adopt that as a more reasonable explanation than the commonly accepted one.

       Indeed, personally I think conspiracists fail to grasp the scale and complexity of the modern world. A grand conspiracy of the nature they envision is outright impossible in today's world. Alan Moore had some wise words on the subject:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The main thing that I learned about conspiracy theory is that conspiracy theorists actually believe in a conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, that it is not the Jewish banking conspiracy or the grey aliens or the 12 foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control. The truth is more frightening, nobody is in control. The world is rudderless.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and this one in particular which touches on the double-standard of an immensely intelligent and resourceful, yet fatally stupid nefarious entity:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yes, there is a conspiracy, in fact there are a great number of conspiracies that are all tripping each other up. And all of those conspiracies are run by paranoid fantasists and ham-fisted clowns. If you are on a list targeted by the CIA, you really have nothing to worry about. If however, you have a name similar to somebody on a list targeted by the CIA, then you are dead.

       Haha I hadn't heard the second quote yet. Thats good. It's true though -- I think a parallel can be drawn between the more fanatic religious people and extreme conspiracy theorists. They both do their best to ignore the reality that we live in a world in which no one has control, IE god or the illuminati, as well as usually having an inflated ego due to the thought they are somehow woken up and above others.

       I'd argue that conspiracists do not use Ockham's Razor because the application of Ockham's Razor refers specifically to Ontological Parsimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracists create the existence of a brand new entity to explain an otherwise explainable phenonemon.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the non-conspiracist view is more onotlogically parsimonious than the conspiracist view--a shadowy global elite/nwo/illuminati is an additional entity.

       Very good comment, even you do come across as a tad jaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's worth mentioning that there is an unofficial triage stage for an event to make it to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Only a small number of aviation disasters make it through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, if the official narrative is very implausible, self-contradictory, where there appears to be a cover-up, where there appears to be evidence of prior knowledge etc etc, then these anomalies will be discussed in detail, and "theories" will inevitably arise to explain these anomalies. The theories can only exist where there is legitimate doubt in the official narrative.

        What's the deal with Sandy Hook posts anyway? There are more of then usual lately.

      <p>
       There's been a lot of activity on the Sandy Hook front lately.  Huffpo and New Yorker just posted interviews with Peter Lanza as well.  I'm not sure if the gun control crowd is trying a second offensive after their losses in the wake of the killings, but they've spurred a lot of people who think there was something odd about the killings.  And there was- whether it was because something untoward went on, or that a lot of people made bad decisions when trying to "protect" victims families I don't know, but trying to shut people up is only going to convince more people that something screwed up DID go on.

       I've never believed the Sandy Hook coverup BS. Tragic events happen, thats life. You know how hard it would be to fake something like that in a community where everybody knows each other. It probably got deleted because someone finally caught on to how offensive is it to entertain this conspiracy. Thats not to say conspiracies don't happen, but I don't think this is one. The perpetrator was clearly off for many years.

       It looks like mindsequalone was ruffling some feathers with research on the area around Sandy Hook Elementary. Lots of apparently empty properties, convoluted ownership, ofthen changing hands for $0. Sandy Hook appears to be a government-owned spooksville, not a real town.

       Do some research into how municipalities handle properties changing hands. In most of the country the price in the field they are consulting for this particular tidbit is almost always $0 and (obviously) does not reflect the actual sale of the property.

       If you ever get answer please let me know. When I asked i got something about fed agents running a drill that went wrong to Sandy Hook wasn't even a real place it was a training area. Its almost like asking who they think was behind 9/11. You get it was 5 Jews to "the government" to Saudis etc.

All the same information that used to go into that subreddit can be posted elsewhere (for example here at r/conspiracy) so I see no problem. Looks like the mods are just banning a user for an obvious infraction and ending a niche subreddit.

       I sympathize with the notion of uncovering inconvenient truths hidden by those in power to preserve their hegemony. I think this particular conspiracy and others like it shit on the legitimacy of that effort. So I guess nobody should bother offering dissenting opinions on those subjects because they disagree with(and are disgusted by) them?

       Essentially, you are just a troll. You deliberately post on Sandy Hook threads to disrupt the discussion - as revenge for people daring to discuss things you disagree with. You are a sad little man.

       At least your investigative prowess is consistent with that of your kin - which is to ignore the stuff which might run counter to your already established and unshakable belief in something which only has conjecture to back it up.

       Yeah but if no one calls him out on his bullshit his comment may be misconstrued by some as actually having some merit (which it quite clearly doesn't, especially now that I got him to admit he has no proof whatsoever).

       Sorry but they can do what they want, Reddit is a privately owned website and thus they can put up and remove what ever they want. Freedom of Speech only applies in public spaces and I am sure the Admins had good reasons for taking it down.

       You are on Reddit, not a free fucking country.  This is their private website, and as such whether you are in a free fucking country is irrelevant to whether they can or should be able to remove content.

       Love how this sub brings out the worst (in) people. Did I ever say that it was
       <em>
        illegal
       </em>
       ? no, because I'm not stupid. I stand by it, when the media censors shit in a free country, I pay attention. Now tell me this, oh great peddler of constitutionality and legality, Why the fuck shouldn't people pay attention.

       Well, the fact that you mentioned being in a free fucking country, I assumed you thought right to speech was being affected.  My bad.

       Also, I never said people shouldn't pay attention to what the media does.

       Finally, Reddit doesn't really seem to be censoring very well since Sandy Hook is talked about on this subreddit very often without it being deleted, or those posts being deleted or anything.

       Sandy Hook got my attention when I found out they were going to pave it and rebuild.  (Waste of money.)  And I think they're getting federal money for that.  Just weird.

       This raises so many questions.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         From the way you worded it, you're implying that the dumpster is indoors. Why the hell is the dumpster indoors? That seems unsanitary and impracticable to say the least. Have you considered moving the dumpster outdoors? It certainly seems like it would make it easier on yourself and the garbage men.

       </li>

        <p>
         <strong>
          Why do people who can see the truth get their common sense from a dumpster???
         </strong>
         The fact that it's in a dumpster seems to imply that the previous owner found it worse than useless. Have you considered that you're using someone's discarded common sense that they found faulty? I think you just called your own common sense garbage dude.

       That maybe it wasn't the topic that they were discussing that caused the subreddit to be deleted, perhaps it was the way it was done, or some other reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are going to try to censor something, it makes very little sense to do so for a small subreddit, while allowing essentially the same content to exist on the front page of much larger subreddits.

       You know, I have a kid that got put in time out twice. Obviously I'm part of a conspiracy to keep him punished for revealing my evil plots.

       Oh he broke the rules twice. I know this is going to sound crazy, but people who break the rules tend to keep breaking them.

       Are you talking about when the mod who shall not be named came here and posted anti-semitic comments as a "drunken experiment" in an effort to discredit the sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you talking about the occasional "j00s" nonsense posts that get posted here sometimes before being summarily downvoted to oblivion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again - you can't accuse an entire sub of 200k+ people of being "anti-semitic" (which is itself a meaningless propaganda term) without any examples to back it up and not expect to be called on your bullshit.

       Edit: And before you come back with the inevitable "I'm not the OP", I know you aren't the person I was responding to.  I meant "you" in the universal sense.

       This is the fourth time in this thread I've seen a highly provocative and insulting accusation about this subreddit or related subreddits.  None of you have provided any proof rather than vague generalizations, if you're so right like you claim that 'You could sit on the main page of conspiracy for three minutes and see it pretty easily', then why do none of you provide any direct information?  And don't give some rhetorical bullshit answer, just give a source (which should be easy) or GTFO.

       I never believe anyone who says they have no opinion on Israel. It's one of the great polarizing issues of our time.
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW I think Zionism is the most specious of reasoning, although this is a separate issue than both Israels' deplorable treatment of arabs and also from the USA's endless and often irrational support. Zionism denotes the belief that a small group of people descended maybe from some other group of people were given a deed by god 4,000 years ago to own a particular parcel of land.

       Jews are disproportonately represented in entertainment because Christian prejudice drove them there, and they succeeded, so everyone calls them corrupt and evil.  If they'd failed instead, they'd be talking about how stupid and inferior they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a Jew is a literal catch 22.  If you fail, you're scum and a disgrace; if you succeed, you're scum and corrupt.  I have no idea how I wake up in the morning sometimes.

       Man, it must be convenient to have anyone who makes you community look bad be

       This is a wonderful example of the kind of mental gymnastics I see around here to justify completely unsubstantiated bullshit, like "false flag predictions" - "Oh, no false flag happened...that doesn't mean we were wrong, it means we prevented it by predicting it!"

       When you live in a world where NOTHING will disprove your beliefs, you need to rethink your life, because it's sure as shit not based on logic and facts.

       They did worse with catch the boston bombers..  reddit got a JRTIG DDOS and the sub disappeared.   since then the 'we did it reddit meme' is being used to ridicule and deny, distract, degrade and deceive.

       Regardless of how completely insane, delusional, offensive, and downright stupid a subreddit about a sandy hook "cover up"  must inevitably be, if mods are actively making sure addressees and all other personal information is redacted, and none of those idiots are trying to contact the families of victims, than let them continue their little ridiculous circle jerk.

       The gun grabbers were on this with a quickness, that's what made me think twice about it

       Less than 24 hours and they already had celebrities ready to go for an anti gun campaign.  I don't personally think there's anything crazy about a group of power hungry fucks sitting by and waiting for a psycho to kill some kids.  Especially knowing what we know now about how much of our lives are surveiled.

       edit: nevermind, that site is dead now.  it was scores of FOIA emails between Bloomberg/his people/the media about how to go about convincing americans to give up their guns.  if i can find another link i'll post it here

       They're protecting us. Stories that claim things about SH are harmful, the more questions you ask, the more harm you're doing. They've already told us some kid shot up a whole school and even though we've seen zero bodies, that's for our own protection. See... protecting us is their job. Just like 9/11, we need to be protected from questions. Questions are bad. I hope that clears it up for everyone.

       I think we should kill anyone who doesn't have a majority opinion.  All content and information, from books, television to the internet, should be filtered through government agencies.  Like racists, they just need to die off and fade away.

       Reddit is a private company. You have no right to free speech.

      <p>
       Just as a store can ask you to leave or refuse you service just because they want to.

       Freedom of speech is only legally in public places.

       So its OK for a restaurant to refuses service to someone just because they want to discriminate against blacks? Private is like your house. If you open a restaurant and its open to the public, it becomes more of a public than a private place.

       No, discrimination is illegal. The restaurant is a bad example. What a restaurant owner can do however is to tell a person or an employee to shut the fuck up if he doesn't like what they're saying. and if they don't comply, the owner could then ask them to leave. He just couldn't it do purely based on race.

       So, its wrong to discriminate based on some criteria (like skin color)  but ok to discriminate based on other criteria (like the content of speech)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont want black people in my restaurant because they talk about black people things. Im not discriminating against them because they are black, im discriminating because I dont like their conversations.

       Thats where things get interesting with the laws on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't discriminate on race, color, religion, or national origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       My example was a little unclear. Lets say you went in to the store and were running around and messing with everything in the store, leaving it messy and being loud; they would have every right to refuse you service and ask you to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the case that the censorship being argued against here is not based on any of the protected criteria...The point is still valid that Reddit admins have the legal right to remove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not take me as condoning the removal though, sadly not much can be done about it. Aside from maybe try to rebuild it either here (being much more careful with what is posted) or hosted some where else.

       You use that word 'censorship' like it's something they're not allowed to do. Mrg13's point is, they are allowed to do it. They can control content on their site however they want.

       The fact that you can even comment is proof enough that you accepted the terms of service. It's not reddit's problem that you didn't read them, you are the one to blame for infringing on terms.

      <p>
       In a private setting you do not have the right to free speech. All the Declaration entitles is you can create your own website and say whatever you want on it. Likewise, the owners of Reddit can create a website and say and do whatever they want on it, including telling anyone they want to fuck off and kicking them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr You do what you want on your website. Reddit does what it wants on theirs.

       That's because more and more human rights are being encroached upon by private corporations. Shifting the purview of civil rights to protect users against encroaches from private faction is perhaps more important, in our day, than protecting from the over extension of State power.

       That would be true if it wasn't for the fact that Reddit and it's admins work directly for the government. So it is the government stifling free speech, but doing it through the guise of "private business". Open your eyes.

       Why don't you explain to me how someone who's contracted to work for the government isn't working for the government then.  While you're at it, explain to me how all contracting work is exactly the same as all other contracting work.

       Those are complete generalizations and are not true at all in many cases.  As the name suggests, contract work involves signing a
       <em>
        contract
       </em>
       - a contract that can have many different stipulations and a contract which is enforceable by law.  It sounds like you may be under the false assumption that whatever contracting work you've done is exactly the same as all other contracting work.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an obvious example of why you're incorrect, Edward Snowden was a contracted NSA employee - was he not held accountable to them?  Could they not have fired him if they wanted to?

       What assumption did I make?  All I did was point out that "contracting" can mean many different things to many different people/organizations and that you were incorrect in your assertion that your experience with contracted work is exactly the same as everyone else's.  These are easily verifiable facts, not assumptions.

       You assumed that two people who were high level employees at reddit working for another (not-reddit) company that worked with yet another company that worked with the government automatically meant that reddit is entirely run by the government...

       You must have been trying to provide evidence in defense of some

       position which you never at any point state for some reason, I'm sure.

      <p>
       No, all of your comments
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the one I quoted are regarding the debate around whether contracting == working for. The original comment you made was you defending the position that Reddit works directly for the government. "The other guy" made the claim that contracting != working directly in response to your comment defending the position that reddit works directly for the government.

       So, just to establish a quick order of events here:

        <p>
         erehsiputeseht claims reddit is working directly for the government

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you respond to anotherdamnsnowflake to defend erehsiputeseht's claim with evidence that two reddit employees work for another company that's worked with another company that's worked for the government
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you and anotherdamnsnowflake get into a spat about the meaning of the term "contracting".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

       Why would content creators choose to continue to contribute time and effort to a website like reddit when they can take their talents elsewhere? Reddit, in and if itself, doesn't create much. Its the community that creates the content, and that content can be created elsewhere. This arbitrary censorship of content creators is what destroyed digg, and it will destroy reddit if it persists. Theres too many alternatives for reddit to feel secure in their position.

       No, you need to present evidence to the contrary. There's ZERO proof SH was a conspiracy. That's like me saying I can jump over a house and you believing me without me providing any proof.

       In real life we need things like proof because otherwise people could claim anything and there's nothing about SH that suggests anything different and from browsing this subreddit, people only have hunches and conjecture.

       There's plenty of proof that the official story is bullshit.  Or, said another way, there is

       proof that the official story is true.

       This would be more like you making an outrageous claim (such as saying you could jump over a house) without any evidence that your claim is true and expecting me to just take you at your word rather than point out the obvious inconsistencies in your claim.  You're arguing against yourself and you don't even realize it.

      <p>
       What you're saying is akin to: "You can't say exactly what happened step by step with physical evidence, so therefore the official story is true."  That's atrocious logic by any measure.

       A true skeptic actually tries to break theories that divert from the generally accepted explanation of a given phenomena, not trying to establish one of any number of possible alternative explanations and scrounge up(tenuous at best) evidence and logical footing to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, if you're truly "open minded", googling "sandy hook &lt;claim&gt; debunked" and read what you find with an open mind. There's a subforum on Metabunk dedicated to Sandy Hook, and they have a thread for most of the popular conspiracy questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you chose to hand-wave it all as propaganda, then your mind is already made up. It's a matter of looking at things objectively and deciding what seems like a more
       <em>
        likely
       </em>
       explanation(which is essence Occam's razor). The conspiracy narrative for Sandy Hook requires a massive bridge of assumptions that must remain unbroken. It's not supported by physical evidence(if you actually look deeply into the evidence outside of conspiracy sites), and the logic sure as hell doesn't support it.

       "The conspiracy narrative", as you put it, is that the official story is bullshit - period.  I think that's about the only thing anyone knows for sure and can agree on.  There is no "official conspiracy narrative" - not sure where you got that idea from.

       See, my default position with something of this nature is credulity. That's not to say I'm not a skeptic of "official" stories, I'm just not of the mind that there is a larger overarching conspiracy by &lt;some powerful, near omnipotent entity&gt; to do &lt;something evil&gt;. That seems to be a prerequisite for believing in a lot of conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen the questions and (what passes for) evidence presented by the conspiracy community. I've also seen all of them categorically debunked on various places around the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that isn't what's really sunk the conspiracy narrative for me. If we give some thought to the
       <em>
        logic
       </em>
       behind what you're suggesting, that's where it really falls apart. We must make a slew of contradictory assumptions to hold up the idea that there is a conspiracy here:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The government wants our guns
       </li>
       <li>
        They are willing to stage an event of this nature to pull it off instead of just going about taking them anyways(given the presumption that they do what they want)
       </li>
       <li>
        They didn't make the event
        <em>
         much worse
        </em>
        to ensure that it succeeds in shaping public opinion
       </li>
       <li>
        They are capable of doing so in the public eye without a hitch.... but hire amateurs which the methodical, oh-so-rigorously skeptical conspiracy community sees right through
       </li>
       <li>
        They did no research into whether such an event would have the intended effect of astroturfing support for gun control(it didn't, in fact, the opposite effect by orders of magnitude)
       </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
       By "conspiracy narrative" I mean the idea that there is a conspiracy here at all. I'm not sure where you got "official" though. However, the most common one is that it was staged in order to promote gun control. I haven't seen any other explanation that even begins to hold some faint sense of legitimacy than that.

       Well, there's the mountain of evidence that supports the commonly held explanation. It's funny, if you look at debunking forums on the subject they've pulled together far more detailed information about Sandy Hook itself, the municipality, their police, school system, the families, etc, than any conspiracy site I've seen(including
       <a href="/r/sandyhookjustice">
        /r/sandyhookjustice
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we hand-wave that away as all part of the propaganda effort, then we're left with the broken logic. Either way, the conspiracy narrative does not hold water.

       We aren't talking about the "conspiracy narrative", we're talking about the official one and why you believe it. You keep saying there's a "mountain of evidence" to support it but you won't list any of said evidence. Stop changing the subject and tell me what evidence convinced you that the official story was true. I'd like to see it - maybe my mind would be changed.

       The funny thing is I haven't changed the subject once! I've explained, in detail, why I remain credulous of the so-called "official" story(even though it isn't official in any sense). In short, it's the much more rational explanation. It satisfies Occam's razor much more readily. The "evidence" and "questions" I've seen to the contrary fall apart quite easily under scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want specific articles of evidence, you can start with looking for the recently released information from the investigation. There are threads here on reddit with the crime scene reports and photos. Details of Lanza's life and online activity were also released. As I mentioned in my previous post, looking at debunking forums is a good idea as well since they(at least, in my experience) do a much better job of gathering readily verifiable and detailed information about something than conspiracy sites do. I'm not sure if that's because most conspiracists are not that adept at using the Internet for research or they choose to ignore information that makes the conspiracy narrative seem even more unlikely than it already is, but the fact remains that in the effort of disproving a particular assertion they do a really good job of finding information to support their arguments.

       If you want to claim that such a tragedy was fabricated, you best bring your cards to the table, because I've been making fools of people who say SH is a conspiracy for a while now, because there simply is no proof to the contrary. SH was not a conspiracy.

       You think there was no shooting? Are you serious? How could you arrive at that claim? Were you there? Unless you were there or knew people who were there, which wouldn't even make sense since there were lots of witnesses who survived.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are documented pictures of the shooting all over. There's A LOT of proof that there was one. I have no idea how you could say there wasn't one.

      <p>
       What are the "holes, anomalies, inconsistencies, lies, omissions" that you speak of? Some people on here tried to say that the shooter's DNA wasn't found on the gun and I proved them wrong.

       Like where?  I haven't seen a single picture of Adam in or around the school.  Not a single picture of a body or blood of any kind.  No spent shell casings in the school (there should have been well over 100 of them so they should've been easy to find).
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you this: what actual proof led you to believe that the official story of events was true?  We all know that our government and news media lie to us constantly and have been for hundreds of years (thousands if you go back before the great US of A was established), so you must have some pretty rock solid proof that a shooting took place.  I'm sure you wouldn't be so mindless as to just take the MSM's word for it so what proof, specifically, led you to side with the MSM version of events?

       The photos were leaked, more than a year after the fact. The videos were released years later for the documentary.

       There is plenty, but nothing short of photographs of him in the building will satisfy you. I'm guessing this is because you think it was staged in order to take your guns. Good news for you, the gun rights advocates lost:

       So, either the gun-grabbing government that is capable of pulling this over in full view of the public(but hired amateurs that the methodical, scientific conspiracy community saw right through) are a bunch of idiots and didn't research whether this would have the intended effect, or maybe there isn't a conspiracy and terrible things like this can happen. Food for thought.

       no, there isn't - there are a few mass-circulated pictures, but none of them can you bring to a person and say "see? it happened" - the only picture of any kids being evacuated, for example, is the one that shows ~10 being led by an official of some kind; there were hundreds of kids there, supposedly

       This is what I mean though. Your default position is of incredulity, and that's totally respectable. The problem is that there is plenty of evidence, but you will only be satisfied by a picture of the kid in the school. Forget the completely broken logic that the event was staged/didn't happen, what you need to see is a photo because

       Anyone who has researched Sandy Hook should be confused, because the facts keep changing. Why dont you tell everyone how its perfectly normal for journalists to fabricate complex lies when news breaks, because thats what journalists are trained to do. Im reminded of when Harvard Journalism professor Andrea McCarren "accidentally" fabricated this long-winded bullshit about her meeting Sally Cox walking down the street and pumped her for info and Sally Cox told her that the shooters mom was a kindergarten teacher at sandy hook.

       Perfectly normal for journalists to fabricate news, because journalism is hard. But if you are a conspiracy theorist, dont you dare get one fact wrong or you will be crucified. Im reminded of how "screw loose change" made a big deal out of the fact that "loose change" described the rubble from WTC7 as "small", when the d ebunkers thought that the rubble pile was bigger than small.

        What's the deal with Sandy Hook posts anyway? There are more of then usual lately.

      <p>
       There's been a lot of activity on the Sandy Hook front lately.  Huffpo and New Yorker just posted interviews with Peter Lanza as well.  I'm not sure if the gun control crowd is trying a second offensive after their losses in the wake of the killings, but they've spurred a lot of people who think there was something odd about the killings.  And there was- whether it was because something untoward went on, or that a lot of people made bad decisions when trying to "protect" victims families I don't know, but trying to shut people up is only going to convince more people that something screwed up DID go on.

       There is a subculture of conspiracists who are fixated on local level tragedies [Boston, Sandy Hook, etc.].
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I follow, the tragedy is enacted in order to convince the public to give up their civil liberties [guns, privacy]. Then the group develops into a semi - movement, where they disect whatever is available online, and arrange it into a few variations of 'what really happened'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nay - sayers [who believe the official stories] consider the conspiracists to be paranoid/fearful. The common assertion says 'the paranoid conspiritards can't face the chaos and uncertainty of reality, that bad things sometimes happen, and rationalize the tragedy as some sort of setup/insidejob/cover up/fakery acted out by a variety of powerful shadow rulers [who have a variety of motivations].
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracists consider themselves to be privy to the true narrative of reality, naysayers to be uninformed, ignorant sheep. Quite often there are accusations that users [those who voice opposition to the alternate, premeditated theory] are or seem like/sound like paid government agents who are spreading disinformation in a cyber-info war between the shadow rulers and the resistance burdened with knowing the truth.
I have never found myself entirely in either camp [both examples are on the extreme]. Five years ago I was an avid skeptic of the official stories of 9/11 and vocally anti-fed. At this point in my life, I look back at how much time and energy was spent fixated on the struggle-for-the-truth, and decided that those beliefs just distracted me from focusing on my school, work and relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to your question about the cover up. To naysayers, occam's razor is more than enough to discredit a conspiracy.
To conspiracists, they too use occam's razor. However, the rationale is preceded with an a priori truth that there is an agenda pushing shadow elite who frequently manipulates events; therefore it seems more simple that this is yet another case if the wool being pulled over the eyes of the ignorant majority. The difference lies in the foundational beliefs [the popular narrative vs the shadow elite narrative].
      </p>
      <p>
       Without changing the initial belief of the other, both groups are bound to endlessly argue, ridicule, attack, accuse, etc. It becomes a cycle of finger pointing and back-patting [circle jerking?]. This ultimately serves to preserve the integrity of each's own ego- a very fundamental motivation for many acts and beliefs of various groups and individuals.

       I have a serious question about this.  If your child was killed at Sandy Hook, and you were invited to the White House and paraded about to gather support for the administration... And you went along with it... does that make you a public figure?  Seriously, I'm asking.

       That maybe it wasn't the topic that they were discussing that caused the subreddit to be deleted, perhaps it was the way it was done, or some other reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are going to try to censor something, it makes very little sense to do so for a small subreddit, while allowing essentially the same content to exist on the front page of much larger subreddits.

       You keep changing what matters. Regardless it's against TOS. Just because someone dies doesn't mean you can post personal info on REDDIT. I swear, all you people need to get your own fucking forum. Get a 10 dollar web host, throw a forum up, share it around with all the little investigators here, and then you can't blame reddit anymore. Reddit has TOS, read it, tell me where him being dead changes anything. It sounds like YOU don't think it should matter. And when you make your own forum, that's fine. Right now the Admins control reddit, they control the TOS, and when you break it they ban you. This is not a complicated matter, I don't understand how SO many people are having a hard time getting such a simple matter.

       Fyi, Ryan Lanza isn't dead. Yet his personal AAA information was posted right there on the front page by the subreddits only mod. Also, for all we know that's Ryan Lanza's phone number. The paid PeopleSmart search couldn't even differentiate the two people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Or some random person's phone number, those searches aren't reliable. That's just one more reason why it's not allowed on Reddit. Innocent people get hurt.

       True that, anders brevik happened in a society which is basically utopia compared to ours. However, you must agree that more guns + less mental health equals a higher chance for this to happen than anywhere else, which seems borne out by evidence.

       You assumed that two people who were high level employees at reddit working for another (not-reddit) company that worked with yet another company that worked with the government automatically meant that reddit is entirely run by the government...

       What are you talking about? I thought that strict gun laws protect people. Look at DC or Chicago for example, where guns are banned. They are safe cities, right?
