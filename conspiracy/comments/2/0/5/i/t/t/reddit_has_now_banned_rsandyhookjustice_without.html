And the people being oppressed are victims families and Lanzas family.  You have no right to start a witch hunt by posting information.  I&#39;m truly amazed you cant see what you are actually saying.  You can be free to oppress people because you feel like it and anyone who tells you otherwise is &quot;the police&quot; or JTRIG (still haven&#39;t explained that yet).  Why are you allowed to victimize innocent people, whilst also saying your rights are being infringed?

<p>This is terrible logic and rests on the proposition that reddit admins don&#39;t have an agenda.</p>

<p>Certainly, that&#39;s what I try to do. Likewise, I also have an opinion on the situation as a byproduct of being a regular user so I am trying to do both in different places. Get&#39;s a little tough sometimes due to the way in which external groups engage in manipulation on this medium. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it terrible logic to assume that the standard for banning subreddits is maintained no matter what subreddit it is or is it terrible logic to look at this situation with a dogmatic bias, like you have? There has been no falsifiable evidence to link Reddit, Inc. to a specific agenda so I am basing my conclusions off of the standard that they have upheld in banning subreddits in the past - a violation of Reddit policy. The burden of proof is on those who accuse Reddit of having an agenda. </p>

<p>I liked your response but I also don&#39;t think you realize that both parties are at fault here. Many people are coming from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and admittedly some of them are probably vote-brigading but so is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Both sides are de-railing intellectual conversation. Many from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are trolling but many people from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are ignoring all criticism and claiming &quot;shill!&quot;... </p>

<p>Personally, I found this post from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> but I&#39;d like to have intelligent discussion. To say that &quot;external&quot; groups are ruining this thread is a ridiculous generalization as it&#39;s overreaction and dogma - from both sides - that is ruining this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m entirely with you here. I&#39;ve noticed the same thing on ATS and a with a few friends who recently got into conspiracy theories and its the same reason I barely even bother to browse this sub / ATS anymore. The best part is, he didn&#39;t even answer your very simple one line question. It may be a complicated answer, but he didn&#39;t even mention any relevant information. I think the scientific process has been lost from a lot of peoples approach to how they treat information they are presented. A lot of the time photos and videos are provided with zero context, and propagated as factual and undeniable proof of events they are barely related to, its scary what some people will believe. But I remain open minded, and will make my own decision based on what I think of the evidence, not what someone else says.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah I&#39;m still with you! I think the worst part is how easily people will demonize institutions or governments just because they&#39;re organisations. They seem to treat them as single entities and not as being made up of other humans, with lives, thoughts, emotions, ambition and most likely, a different perspective than their own. For example somewhere in this thread someone said &quot;how can reddit be so against internet freedom&quot; (because of banning the subreddit) and the assumptions of conspiracy started. Someone has also mentioned it was &quot;likely&quot; the father of the shooter, who owns a big company, put pressure on reddit to remove the sub. No evidence. No clues that point to any wrongdoing, but a dangerously paranoid assumption of there being more than meets the eye. I&#39;m very tempted to start a website or YouTube channel based around dispelling some of these more outlandish theories, or at least collating information, giving people a (mostly) unbiased look at the evidence. I would start with the &#39;no planes&#39; theory I think.  I haven&#39;t found one bit of evidence that isn&#39;t either the dying words of a 90 year old man or a story about 2 guys seeing a plane disappear one time, and I&#39;m supposed to believe the USA had hologram tech 13 years ago that could pull of 9/11. Now if I see evidence, I&#39;ll adjust my outlook, but Ockham&#39;s razor suggests maybe we hold off on the assumptions. Heh now I&#39;m ranting!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The type of &quot;revolutionary speak&quot; you mention is merely proper english written in a verbose way with no limits to diction or vocabulary. Is it so wrong to write in such a way? Writing is one of the last bastions of proper language, as colloquialisms have all but engulfed modern spoken language. To write in these &quot;grand&quot; ways is merely to write in the &quot;right&quot; way, nothing more. </p>

<p>Your attack of the language is peculiar since the language and style of delivery have no bearing on the merit of the message, yet you use it as an ad hominem to justify your dismissal of the subreddit and its ideas. Tell me, am I justified in saying you&#39;re a fucking idiot because you write in such a haughty fashion as to tell others what they can and cannot write and how they can or cannot write it? Because you &quot;seem&quot; to have a superiority complex, is it fair to write you off as a complete loser stuck behind a keyboard, possibly working for someone who is equally spineless?</p>

<p>Or is it unfair to do those things because the way a person speaks isn&#39;t a valid point to judge by?</p>

<p>Consider that, and stop downvoting someone for having a serious discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, the admins really seem to prefer leaving big mods alone until it explodes (e.g., violentacrez and what&#39;s probably gonna happen with BipolarBear).</p>

<p>In good faith, I think it&#39;s justifiable to an extent: they don&#39;t want to set a precedent for stepping in and solving community issues (e.g., what happened with <a href="/r/xkcd">/r/xkcd</a>), they seem to see that as the job of the individual communities. I think they really just don&#39;t like stepping in and figure that&#39;s the job of the community.</p>

<p>In bad faith, sometimes that logic goes too far, I agree. Sometimes &quot;not stepping in&quot; becomes &quot;don&#39;t ban powerful mods even when they break rules&quot; and that&#39;s a problem.</p>

<p>You keep changing what matters. Regardless it&#39;s against TOS. Just because someone dies doesn&#39;t mean you can post personal info on REDDIT. I swear, all you people need to get your own fucking forum. Get a 10 dollar web host, throw a forum up, share it around with all the little investigators here, and then you can&#39;t blame reddit anymore. Reddit has TOS, read it, tell me where him being dead changes anything. It sounds like YOU don&#39;t think it should matter. And when you make your own forum, that&#39;s fine. Right now the Admins control reddit, they control the TOS, and when you break it they ban you. This is not a complicated matter, I don&#39;t understand how SO many people are having a hard time getting such a simple matter.</p>

<p>Fyi, Ryan Lanza isn&#39;t dead. Yet his personal AAA information was posted right there on the front page by the subreddits only mod. Also, for all we know that&#39;s Ryan Lanza&#39;s phone number. The paid PeopleSmart search couldn&#39;t even differentiate the two people.</p>

<p>Edit: Or some random person&#39;s phone number, those searches aren&#39;t reliable. That&#39;s just one more reason why it&#39;s not allowed on Reddit. Innocent people get hurt.</p>

<p>So I guess I can spare a moment for a short English lesson.<br/>
The word &quot;censorship&quot; means blocking speech that is not favorable to a government, media outlet, or some other group or individual that has the power to censor for one reason or another.<br/>
In this case, reddit is a media outlet, much like a TV station or newspaper would be. Reddit finds the articles of speech which provide personal information about other individuals to be harmful and objectionable, so they block it from their media outlet. This act is also knowing as censoring content. You&#39;ll find that this is very similar to an FCC censor who will bleep out profanity and cover up nudity on network television, albeit on a much smaller scale.</p>

To use the example that you provided an FCC employee that removes or obscures offensive or obscene material is indeed a censor. I would be very surprised to learn that an FCC censor was censoring news items though. Pray tell which branch of the government has an employee at Reddit banning Sandy Hook private subreddits because they are offensive,lewd, harmful, or otherwise unfavorable to Reddit? Link me a source as I am sure it would be a rattling good read. </p>

<p>Removing material harmful to a private individual who is not affiliated with or employed by Reddit or it&#39;s parent corporation and it&#39; subsidiaries is not censorship as you have defined it. In removing that sub Reddit is not &quot;blocking speech that is not favorable to a government, media outlet, or some other group or individual that has the power to censor for one reason or another&quot; (your own words) because those individuals who had been &#39;doxed&#39; do not have the power to censor and the sub was not presenting material unfavorable to Reddit. By your own definition you have proved yourself wrong.</p>

<p>Reddit is an aggregate and only hosts user supplied or user generated material and aside from an administrative blog doesn&#39;t itself generate posts or material and is therefore not a news or media outlet. It would make the decision to remove that crazy fucks blather closer to a materials collection policy or editorial selection.</p>

<p>Thank you this has been both instructive and constructive. Regards.....wrinkleneck71</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those were your words, your definition. If you had linked to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship">Wikipedia</a> article or something as I had prompted you to do you could have read a far more encompassing definition of censorship. The issue is that you have a feeling about what you perceive censorship to be and you want me to share that emotional response. Most of these conspiracies are based on feelings and information is judged by it&#39;s ability to reinforce those feelings. You have feelings of inadequacy and of being insignificant--hence your pedantic attitude and blind insistence that you are right and that yours is the only view possible despite evidence to the contrary. You are so emotionally invested in the idea that Reddit is engaging in censorship that you will not even accept your own words, your own definition of censorship. Admitting that you are incorrect will not diminish you as a person but instead aid in your on going development as a human being. You are retarding your own growth; You are literally retarded. I will have that chai now with extra black pepper. I like the zing, don&#39;t you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You continue to read too far into things, and you continue to not understand the simple meaning of words. I&#39;m not emotionally invested at all. I&#39;ve even said it was well deserved censorship. But it is literally censorship in the pure essence of the word. Reddit doesn&#39;t like personal information being posted, so reddit censors posts that contain it and subreddits devoted to it. It&#39;s really not that difficult of a concept, how are you having such trouble with it? Did you hit your head? Have you been doing too many drugs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have broken it down Barney style for you. You used too broad a brush when characterizing Reddits responsible and reasonable actions as censorship. You did not apply those broad strokes to your own stated definition of censorship though. The individuals who had been doxed did not censor the material harmful to them and that material was not harmful to Reddit. When a city works department removes graffiti from a wall is it censorship of the artist or is it enforcing rules and complying with policy? Now imagine the same artist has tagged your home, business, or personal property. When you remove it are you now a censor and are you amending the free speech of the artist? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit doesn&#39;t like personal information being posted, so reddit censors posts that contain it and subreddits devoted to it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it really is about the feels for you and not about the rules then?  As I said you are so emotionally invested in your incorrect interpretation of the situation that you feel so threatened by the idea of being wrong  that you are closed to any other view, so much so that you are compelled to engage me time and time again. Perhaps you could start a subreddit devoted to Reddits using the TOS agreement to censor the internet. r/TOS_is_Censorship with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VFVWdlY.jpg">you</a> as the lead mod.</p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s a group of people who are taking as their starting premise that it couldn&#39;t possibly be that simple, it had to be a shadowy nexus between agencies X Y and Z, the actual functions of which they are willfully unaware of, involving the cooperation of tens of thousands of people, for nebulous, unimaginable goals which are presumably of earth-shattering consequence, however whose shadowy lies are easily revealed by google searches. </p>

<p>These people are using willfully/ incompetently misinterpreted data to harass families who have had loved ones taken from them by a senseless act of tragedy, accusing them of being a part of some shadowy movement to steal our purity of essence, because if you REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want to, bend a few facts here and there, cite a few schizophrenics, squint really hard and just basically flout all rationality and logic, you could create an argument that its a conspiracy.

<p>Free speech is in the constitution not to protect speech we agree with but to protect the speech we don&#39;t agree with. I subscribe to the school of thought that believes it&#39;s fundamentally important in any democracy that all voiced have a right to speak.

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, he wasn&#39;t attacking your right to say what you want. He was defending other people getting pissed off at the inflammatory uses of your free speech. Just because you have the right to free speech doesn&#39;t mean anyone has to like it, agree with it, or even accept it as legitimate discourse. If you&#39;re going to cry out about the right to freedom of speech, you can&#39;t really turn around and say that its unfair and ridiculous that there is backlash to unpopular and inflammatory crap. They have the right to call the sandy hook conspiritards just that as much as they have to spew hate speech and ridiculous accusations at the families of the victims and so forth. I honestly would have no remorse if the family member of a victim physically assaulted (no matter how bad the extend of the injuries may be) a conspiracy theorist who accuses them of being part of some big conspiracy or ploy or whatever they call it. I think it is pathetic, vile, and disgusting that they would approach the family members of the victims. It wouldn&#39;t be any different if they did that to 9/11 victim&#39;s families. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see a sub being deleted if the moderators weren&#39;t removing the content themselves.  The admins aren&#39;t interested in moderating subs, so if a sub is violating their policy I imagine they just view it as not being able to trust the moderators/creators and just remove the sub.  If the creator was violating reddits policy even more reason for them to remove the sub as it would be clear they can&#39;t trust the sub not to break the rules again.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a touchy subject that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>with the size of the site they could easily claim ignorance to whatever happens on it or have something that absolves them of liability I imagine.  But I think the moment it&#39;s brought to their attention they are obligated to act if it&#39;s violating their policy or else they become liable at that point for facilitating or being complacent.</p>

<p>and that justifies deleting the entire sub and not just the information or the user that posted it? </p>

<p>A very convenient overreaction. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised it was JTRIG agents posting the info just so they could have an excuse for their other agents (mods/admins) to delete the sub. </p>

<p>Funny how other subs (ones that don&#39;t ask uncomfortable questions about the official story) don&#39;t get completely deleted when people post personal info. The post gets deleted, the user banned, and it&#39;s done.</p>

<p>I wonder when the wider reddit community is going to say &#39;fuck this&#39; and leave for pastures new. The site is completely corrupt. Then again, the vast majority of users only seem to care about posting about memes, cats, and games. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/mindsequalone">/u/mindsequalone</a> IS the user that posted it and the only mod, as far as I can tell. You can&#39;t just delete someone&#39;s account and not their subreddits that they are the only mod for. Who do you make moderator? How would that be objectively* decided? It couldn&#39;t be.</p>

<p>Had the user added other mods, we wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion.</p>

<p>And with the amount of upvotes that this has, I don&#39;t think I can subscribe to <em>this</em> sub anymore. It shows how much bullshit is upvoted without any logical reason, and just to further convince themselves that everything&#39;s a fucking conspiracy.</p>

<p>*added &#39;objectively&#39; to emphasize my point that while it could physically be done, there would be no way to determine objectively who the new moderator would be. What if it&#39;s a shill? What if it&#39;s an asshole? Also, if you allow the only mod to choose, they could choose their alternate account, rendering the deletion useless.</p>

<p>edit: I like this sub, but, the reddit conspiracies are kind of distracting at times. However  I do remain subscribed because I like all the information I can get. I can sift through all of it and come to what I can think is a logical conclusion. Now that this site has garnered main stream attention it has to be assumed it will be swayed at times especially with so many posts being deleted from the front page. </p>

If I get banned, I will find a new way to disseminate information. This way seems open enough to allow dialogue, but benign enough not to scare, hurt or intimidate people too much. I do want to be sensitive to those who were negatively affected by whatever this IS.... They are a huge part of the reason I&#39;m looking for the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally don&#39;t have a problem with moderation on a subreddit--I&#39;m a moderator of a few subreddits myself.  It does strike me as hypocritical when mods of community that is almost always ready to assume any deletion of content is unfair moderation (not saying all are like that, but it&#39;s a very common theme here) would so freely ban others for their opinion, even if they are blunt.</p>

<p>You see this a lot in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> offshoots, where they say &quot;This subreddit is about freedom of speech!  All shills (as decided by the mods) will be banned.&quot;  Erm.  </p>

<p>If Reddit has a problem with personal information being posted, why have the mods of <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> not been banned for repeatedly doxxing and posting personal information including death threats to Reddit users?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/1vilhc/collection_of_incidents_where_the_nolibs_crew/">http://www.reddit.com/r/NolibsWatch/comments/1vilhc/collection_of_incidents_where_the_nolibs_crew/</a></p>

<p>I want you to answer that question since you agree that the posting of personal information is a banning offence. If someone gets banned immediately for posting personal information like being discussed now, why do repeat offenders who also send death threats not get banned?</p>

<p>Edit: No answer yet, what a surprise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#section_reddit_rules">Read Reddit&#39;s TOS on posting personal information.</a></p>

<p>I linked to you right there so there&#39;s no hard work on your part. Now tell me where it says you can post personal information on public figures on THIS, a private owned website. Because as I read it, you can&#39;t post ANY personal information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that it wasn&#39;t information on random/related people like some were suggesting in this thread, not once was it mentioned by you guys that it was Adam Lanza&#39;s information, and furthermore this information is readily available and has been repeatedly shared through media.  This guy pointed out that if you searched Adam Lanza, Ryan Lanza came up as an alias.  There was no new, incriminating or private information shared here.  An article with Adam Lanza&#39;s information would not be deleted off of the main subreddits, and has been included in many news articles that have made the frontpage, because it is a unique news story of a particular magnitude.  That subreddit was private, consisting of 90 members, and the &#39;personal&#39; information was widespread and would not lead to a &#39;witchunt&#39; because Adam Lanza was already a public figure.  Would Saddam Hussein&#39;s, Osama Bin Laden, or other terrorists information not be allowed to be posted anywhere on reddit? That is simply not that case, in journalism or on reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And my point is it doesn&#39;t matter. He PAID a service to get all of Adam Lanza&#39;s personal information and then without his consent (obviously) posted it on reddit which is firmly against the TOS. Reddit is not journalism. Reddit is a private company with TOS YOU agreed to when you signed up... Paying a service for Adam Lanza&#39;s phone number and address and then posting it is against that TOS. Adam Lanza&#39;s personal phone number, by the way, not saying anything journalist posted. Google it yourself, all you&#39;ll find is it posted on a couple internet sleuth shit blogs. God forbid whoever gets that number next.</p>

<p>Again, we&#39;ll ignore the AAA card pictures of both the Lanza boys, we&#39;ll ignore the private gas bill he posted, we&#39;ll ignore all that. All of which are against the TOS of this site. Because just posting the paid PeopleSmart picture was enough to get him banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just that the whole issue of posting personal information in regards to Sandy Hook has been a big thing around this sub and I&#39;m almost certain that the user running that subreddit was well aware that they&#39;d be banned for posting information.</p>

<p>So, when you so confidently suggest that they were posting personal info it&#39;s not surprising that people ask you why you think that. There&#39;s another user claiming he SAW the personal info on a cached site, and so far he&#39;s linked one URL that showed no personal information. This is why I&#39;m skeptical that personal information is the issue here and would prefer to see it myself before taking anyone&#39;s word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re new here, so I&#39;ll give you a pass. The Sandy Hook event was a hoax - a &quot;virtual atrocity&quot; or drill scenario, in which fictional persons, including 20 children (whose identities and flimsy backstories were created for this event) were &quot;murdered&quot; by a crazed gunman. Adam Lanza is also a fictional character, based on a real person called Ryan Lanza (that the media would have you believe his brother).</p>

<p>Even though it was a poorly executed hoax and the official narrative is riddled with inconsistencies, the fact that local, State and Federal authorities and the media promoted the event as genuine has succeeded in fooling millions of people. </p>

<p>A number of actors played the roles of parents in the virtual atrocity, and they have become extremely rich by fraudulently setting up charities for their fictional children. Those parents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You talk about reddit in the same way some people refer to the government, as a single entity. However its made up of people. Individual people making decisions, not one all powerful corrupt single entity banning and censoring whatever it sees fit. How can reddit be so for internet censorship? Because its full of users who understand enough about technology to understand how important internet freedom is. Look beyond the typical over hype conspiracy bullshit and I bet there&#39;s a logical reason for the sub getting banned, and I bet you it comes down to butt-hurttery, needless drama, and not &quot;reddit&quot; trying to censor a conspiracy. I&#39;m getting sick
 of the mindset around here that EVERYTHING deserves a conspiracy, or is a coverup, before there is any evidence people are at arms, just chill down, let&#39;s see what emerges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but thats kind of the problem, this isn&#39;t a big life revelation. This is a subreddit getting banned for (at the time of the post) a reason that we weren&#39;t aware of, yet people are so eager to make a big deal about it without waiting for the facts. So it turns out some personal information was posted and someone took the opportunity to get the sub taken down, but without knowing that beforehand how can you decide what your actions should be? it&#39;s a dangerous mindset to get angry over assumptions. Even now, the right action should only be to create a new sub, restart the community and be more careful about breaking reddits rules and giving people a chance to be assholes. By the way I say all this and am very much opposed to the sandyhook conspiracy, I do however advocate free speech. This isn&#39;t entirely directed at just you either, however this mindset of &quot;do now, think later&quot; is becoming quite scarey as I notice it a lot more from friends recently too. We should be able to control ourselves and think logically about these things and not rush to any conclusions, and certainly not call for any &quot;action&quot; (whatever that may be) before we even understand the situation.<br/>
  edit: now it turns out it was a troll, yet you were ready for action against Reddit and internet censorship. Point proven.</p>

<p>Try to understand this: Just because the outcome of the plan did not happen the way they wanted it to (gun laws passed) does not mean that they did not stage the event for that exact reason. </p>

<p>People say over and over again. &quot;No laws were passed, see!&quot; That&#39;s as much proof as Sandy Hook&#39;s plan failing as it is evidence for SH not being staged to begin with.</p>

<p>They&#39;re obviously powerful enough to have staged such an event but not omnipotent hence why all of the story&#39;s loose ends and unanswered questions. </p>

<p>Just searching <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a> for &quot;Sandy Hook,&quot; <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1s3g5k/recordings_of_911_calls_from_the_sandy_hook/">a nonzero number of users here do</a>. This <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rl07g/sandy_hook_911_calls_must_be_made_public_judge/">predates the release of the tapes</a>. Same idea, <a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1s098g/sandy_hook_911_tapes_to_be_released_wednesday/">different thread</a>. Just scroll through any of those and see the varying levels of fakery proposed by <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> members in good standing. </p>

<p>And look - suggesting Sandy Hook was an &quot;inside job&quot; probably wouldn&#39;t rise to a level of absurdity <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a> cares about. Some guys arming one nutjob to &quot;hasten the inevitable&quot; and push their agenda is, while improbable, certainly plausible. It only requires one asshole and one nutjob (and some guns). There&#39;s nothing funny about nitpicking that. It&#39;s simple and dull. Only the truly wacky shit rises to their attention.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t just pull this &quot;the whole town is fake&quot; idea out of my ass. I don&#39;t take nearly enough good drugs to imagine something so ridiculous. It is the most ridiculous form of an <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/01/15/this_man_helped_save_six_children_is_now_getting_harassed_for_it/">alarmingly popular meme</a> asserting that the shooting itself was somehow a hoax.</p>

<p>No, but it severely undermines the claim that some unseen agency (presumably government-based) would have the power to fake an entire town and all its denizens. When you have the resources to fake a school shooting, let alone to actually pull off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielefeld_Conspiracy">the Bielefeld conspiracy</a>, why the <em>fuck</em> wouldn&#39;t you just bribe politicians with lobbying? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a subculture of conspiracists who are fixated on local level tragedies [Boston, Sandy Hook, etc.]. </p>

<p>From what I follow, the tragedy is enacted in order to convince the public to give up their civil liberties [guns, privacy]. Then the group develops into a semi - movement, where they disect whatever is available online, and arrange it into a few variations of &#39;what really happened&#39;. </p>

<p>The nay - sayers [who believe the official stories] consider the conspiracists to be paranoid/fearful. The common assertion says &#39;the paranoid conspiritards can&#39;t face the chaos and uncertainty of reality, that bad things sometimes happen, and rationalize the tragedy as some sort of setup/insidejob/cover up/fakery acted out by a variety of powerful shadow rulers [who have a variety of motivations].</p>

<p>The conspiracists consider themselves to be privy to the true narrative of reality, naysayers to be uninformed, ignorant sheep. Quite often there are accusations that users [those who voice opposition to the alternate, premeditated theory] are or seem like/sound like paid government agents who are spreading disinformation in a cyber-info war between the shadow rulers and the resistance burdened with knowing the truth.
I have never found myself entirely in either camp [both examples are on the extreme]. Five years ago I was an avid skeptic of the official stories of 9/11 and vocally anti-fed. At this point in my life, I look back at how much time and energy was spent fixated on the struggle-for-the-truth, and decided that those beliefs just distracted me from focusing on my school, work and relationships. </p>

<p>Back to your question about the cover up. To naysayers, occam&#39;s razor is more than enough to discredit a conspiracy.
To conspiracists, they too use occam&#39;s razor. However, the rationale is preceded with an a priori truth that there is an agenda pushing shadow elite who frequently manipulates events; therefore it seems more simple that this is yet another case if the wool being pulled over the eyes of the ignorant majority. The difference lies in the foundational beliefs [the popular narrative vs the shadow elite narrative].</p>

<p>Without changing the initial belief of the other, both groups are bound to endlessly argue, ridicule, attack, accuse, etc. It becomes a cycle of finger pointing and back-patting [circle jerking?]. This ultimately serves to preserve the integrity of each&#39;s own ego- a very fundamental motivation for many acts and beliefs of various groups and individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my main issues with the whole shadow gov&#39;t illumanti controlling the world narrative is that the same conspiracists claim that gov&#39;ts are stupid and don&#39;t work. How can the US gov&#39;t be an infallible machine that can cover up tons of innocent bystanders deaths(9/11, sandyhook, boston) and also be incredibly stupid? Either they are incredibly efficient and smart or they are totally incompetent...I think most would agree on the latter. </p>

<p>The US gov&#39;t can take tons of time on even the most mundane tasks and issues...how can they possibly be covering up all these deaths? That network would literally include like 100,000s of people. I&#39;m sorry but there is no way our gov&#39;t is that efficient and if there is some efficient shadow gov&#39;t that can do of all of this stuff then what is their endgame? Why poison and ruin all of their &quot;slaves&quot;, why kill the manipulated masses? For what reason? Population control? Oh yeah thats working real well...</p>

<p>However I do think real conspiracies do exist...for instance something like watergate at the time of its occurrence.</p>

<p>I got really into the 9/11 and RFID chips in highschool but ended up in a similar boat to you. &quot;Trying to uncover the truth&quot; takes up far to much time and it often leads people to anger or depression. Its just not worth it. In the end if its true...well what could I have done? On the other hand if it isn&#39;t true then at least I didn&#39;t waste years grasping at straws. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the real gaping hole with this conspiracy(and others). We need to hold two contradictory statements as true in order to keep the conspiracy narrative alive.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The government is a massive, powerful entity, with the means and motivation to stage this event in full public view.</p></li>
<li><p>They hired amateurs who leave holes that the (methodical, rigorously skeptical) conspiracy community <em>always</em> sees right through. Keep in mind that these same folks call conspiracy/false flag after <em>any</em> event of historical significance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In addition these both have basic assumptions that can be easily proven false - half or perhaps even more of the government is very much pro-gun, for example.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we need to pretend that this resourceful entity also apparently didn&#39;t conduct their due diligence and find out if such an event would have the intended effect(see gun legislation enacted/changed in the year following Sandy Hook).</p>

<p>The guy you responded to it couldn&#39;t have said it better:</p>

<p>Really, it comes down to a worldview in the end since you can&#39;t prove a negative. It doesn&#39;t matter how unlikely the conspiracy theory becomes after skepticism, there will always be people who craft some counter-intuitive reasoning akin to &quot;but that&#39;s what they <em>want</em> you to think&quot;, and there will be those who have the worldview to adopt that as a more reasonable explanation than the commonly accepted one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, personally I think conspiracists fail to grasp the scale and complexity of the modern world. A grand conspiracy of the nature they envision is outright impossible in today&#39;s world. Alan Moore had some wise words on the subject:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main thing that I learned about conspiracy theory is that conspiracy theorists actually believe in a conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, that it is not the Jewish banking conspiracy or the grey aliens or the 12 foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control. The truth is more frightening, nobody is in control. The world is rudderless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this one in particular which touches on the double-standard of an immensely intelligent and resourceful, yet fatally stupid nefarious entity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there is a conspiracy, in fact there are a great number of conspiracies that are all tripping each other up. And all of those conspiracies are run by paranoid fantasists and ham-fisted clowns. If you are on a list targeted by the CIA, you really have nothing to worry about. If however, you have a name similar to somebody on a list targeted by the CIA, then you are dead.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s worth mentioning that there is an unofficial triage stage for an event to make it to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Only a small number of aviation disasters make it through. </p>

<p>Basically, if the official narrative is very implausible, self-contradictory, where there appears to be a cover-up, where there appears to be evidence of prior knowledge etc etc, then these anomalies will be discussed in detail, and &quot;theories&quot; will inevitably arise to explain these anomalies. The theories can only exist where there is legitimate doubt in the official narrative.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been a lot of activity on the Sandy Hook front lately.  Huffpo and New Yorker just posted interviews with Peter Lanza as well.  I&#39;m not sure if the gun control crowd is trying a second offensive after their losses in the wake of the killings, but they&#39;ve spurred a lot of people who think there was something odd about the killings.  And there was- whether it was because something untoward went on, or that a lot of people made bad decisions when trying to &quot;protect&quot; victims families I don&#39;t know, but trying to shut people up is only going to convince more people that something screwed up DID go on.</p>

<p>You are on Reddit, not a free fucking country.  This is their private website, and as such whether you are in a free fucking country is irrelevant to whether they can or should be able to remove content.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the fact that you mentioned being in a free fucking country, I assumed you thought right to speech was being affected.  My bad.</p>

<p>Also, I never said people shouldn&#39;t pay attention to what the media does.  </p>

<p>Finally, Reddit doesn&#39;t really seem to be censoring very well since Sandy Hook is talked about on this subreddit very often without it being deleted, or those posts being deleted or anything.  </p>

<p>This raises so many questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>From the way you worded it, you&#39;re implying that the dumpster is indoors. Why the hell is the dumpster indoors? That seems unsanitary and impracticable to say the least. Have you considered moving the dumpster outdoors? It certainly seems like it would make it easier on yourself and the garbage men. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why do people who can see the truth get their common sense from a dumpster???</strong> The fact that it&#39;s in a dumpster seems to imply that the previous owner found it worse than useless. Have you considered that you&#39;re using someone&#39;s discarded common sense that they found faulty? I think you just called your own common sense garbage dude.</p></li>

<p>FWIW I think Zionism is the most specious of reasoning, although this is a separate issue than both Israels&#39; deplorable treatment of arabs and also from the USA&#39;s endless and often irrational support. Zionism denotes the belief that a small group of people descended maybe from some other group of people were given a deed by god 4,000 years ago to own a particular parcel of land.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours and they already had celebrities ready to go for an anti gun campaign.  I don&#39;t personally think there&#39;s anything crazy about a group of power hungry fucks sitting by and waiting for a psycho to kill some kids.  Especially knowing what we know now about how much of our lives are surveiled.</p>

<p>edit: nevermind, that site is dead now.  it was scores of FOIA emails between Bloomberg/his people/the media about how to go about convincing americans to give up their guns.  if i can find another link i&#39;ll post it here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats where things get interesting with the laws on it. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t discriminate on race, color, religion, or national origin.</p>

<p>My example was a little unclear. Lets say you went in to the store and were running around and messing with everything in the store, leaving it messy and being loud; they would have every right to refuse you service and ask you to leave. </p>

<p>But in the case that the censorship being argued against here is not based on any of the protected criteria...The point is still valid that Reddit admins have the legal right to remove it. </p>

<p>Do not take me as condoning the removal though, sadly not much can be done about it. Aside from maybe try to rebuild it either here (being much more careful with what is posted) or hosted some where else. </p>

<p>In a private setting you do not have the right to free speech. All the Declaration entitles is you can create your own website and say whatever you want on it. Likewise, the owners of Reddit can create a website and say and do whatever they want on it, including telling anyone they want to fuck off and kicking them off.</p>

<p>tl;dr You do what you want on your website. Reddit does what it wants on theirs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are complete generalizations and are not true at all in many cases.  As the name suggests, contract work involves signing a <em>contract</em> - a contract that can have many different stipulations and a contract which is enforceable by law.  It sounds like you may be under the false assumption that whatever contracting work you&#39;ve done is exactly the same as all other contracting work.</p>

<p>As an obvious example of why you&#39;re incorrect, Edward Snowden was a contracted NSA employee - was he not held accountable to them?  Could they not have fired him if they wanted to?</p>

<p>No, all of your comments <em>after</em> the one I quoted are regarding the debate around whether contracting == working for. The original comment you made was you defending the position that Reddit works directly for the government. &quot;The other guy&quot; made the claim that contracting != working directly in response to your comment defending the position that reddit works directly for the government.</p>

<p>So, just to establish a quick order of events here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>erehsiputeseht claims reddit is working directly for the government</p></li>
<li><p>anotherdamnsnowflake expresses incredulity at this position</p></li>
<li><p>you respond to anotherdamnsnowflake to defend erehsiputeseht&#39;s claim with evidence that two reddit employees work for another company that&#39;s worked with another company that&#39;s worked for the government</p></li>
<li><p>you and anotherdamnsnowflake get into a spat about the meaning of the term &quot;contracting&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>I point out that your original evidence completely and utterly fails to support erehsiputeseht&#39;s claim in the first place</p></li>

<p>This would be more like you making an outrageous claim (such as saying you could jump over a house) without any evidence that your claim is true and expecting me to just take you at your word rather than point out the obvious inconsistencies in your claim.

<p>See, my default position with something of this nature is credulity. That&#39;s not to say I&#39;m not a skeptic of &quot;official&quot; stories, I&#39;m just not of the mind that there is a larger overarching conspiracy by &lt;some powerful, near omnipotent entity&gt; to do &lt;something evil&gt;. That seems to be a prerequisite for believing in a lot of conspiracies.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the questions and (what passes for) evidence presented by the conspiracy community. I&#39;ve also seen all of them categorically debunked on various places around the Internet.</p>

<p>But that isn&#39;t what&#39;s really sunk the conspiracy narrative for me. If we give some thought to the <em>logic</em> behind what you&#39;re suggesting, that&#39;s where it really falls apart. We must make a slew of contradictory assumptions to hold up the idea that there is a conspiracy here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The government wants our guns</li>
<li>They are willing to stage an event of this nature to pull it off instead of just going about taking them anyways(given the presumption that they do what they want)</li>
<li>They didn&#39;t make the event <em>much worse</em> to ensure that it succeeds in shaping public opinion</li>
<li>They are capable of doing so in the public eye without a hitch.... but hire amateurs which the methodical, oh-so-rigorously skeptical conspiracy community sees right through</li>
<li>They did no research into whether such an event would have the intended effect of astroturfing support for gun control(it didn&#39;t, in fact, the opposite effect by orders of magnitude)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no &quot;official conspiracy narrative&quot; - not sure where you got that idea from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By &quot;conspiracy narrative&quot; I mean the idea that there is a conspiracy here at all. I&#39;m not sure where you got &quot;official&quot; though. However, the most common one is that it was staged in order to promote gun control. I haven&#39;t seen any other explanation that even begins to hold some faint sense of legitimacy than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s the mountain of evidence that supports the commonly held explanation. It&#39;s funny, if you look at debunking forums on the subject they&#39;ve pulled together far more detailed information about Sandy Hook itself, the municipality, their police, school system, the families, etc, than any conspiracy site I&#39;ve seen(including <a href="/r/sandyhookjustice">/r/sandyhookjustice</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing is I haven&#39;t changed the subject once! I&#39;ve explained, in detail, why I remain credulous of the so-called &quot;official&quot; story(even though it isn&#39;t official in any sense). In short, it&#39;s the much more rational explanation. It satisfies Occam&#39;s razor much more readily. The &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;questions&quot; I&#39;ve seen to the contrary fall apart quite easily under scrutiny.</p>

<p>If you want specific articles of evidence, you can start with looking for the recently released information from the investigation. There are threads here on reddit with the crime scene reports and photos. Details of Lanza&#39;s life and online activity were also released. As I mentioned in my previous post, looking at debunking forums is a good idea as well since they(at least, in my experience) do a much better job of gathering readily verifiable and detailed information about something than conspiracy sites do. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s because most conspiracists are not that adept at using the Internet for research or they choose to ignore information that makes the conspiracy narrative seem even more unlikely than it already is, but the fact remains that in the effort of disproving a particular assertion they do a really good job of finding information to support their arguments.</p>

<p>There is plenty, but nothing short of photographs of him in the building will satisfy you. I&#39;m guessing this is because you think it was staged in order to take your guns. Good news for you, the gun rights advocates lost:</p>

<p>So, either the gun-grabbing government that is capable of pulling this over in full view of the public(but hired amateurs that the methodical, scientific conspiracy community saw right through) are a bunch of idiots and didn&#39;t research whether this would have the intended effect, or maybe there isn&#39;t a conspiracy and terrible things like this can happen.

<p>no, there isn&#39;t - there are a few mass-circulated pictures, but none of them can you bring to a person and say &quot;see? it happened&quot; - the only picture of any kids being evacuated, for example, is the one that shows ~10 being led by an official of some kind; there were hundreds of kids there, supposedly</p>

<p>it&#39;s incredible that the one piece of evidence that could corroborate the official story (a picture of the suspect at the scene of the crime) can&#39;t be gathered in this case because the multitudes of cameras at a <strong>school</strong> weren&#39;t recording</p>

<p>Um, yes, yes there is. But I&#39;d be willing to bet you haven&#39;t done shit for looking for yourself since the initial cries of &quot;fales falg!!!!&quot; a year ago.</p>

<p>This is what I mean though. Your default position is of incredulity, and that&#39;s totally respectable. The problem is that there is plenty of evidence, but you will only be satisfied by a picture of the kid in the school. Forget the completely broken logic that the event was staged/didn&#39;t happen, what you need to see is a photo because <em>your guns</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as for gun laws not being put in place, think again:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you even read the link I gave? A handful of already strict states passed new gun control measures... but the <em>vast majority</em> of the country actually <em>loosened</em> gun control.</p>

<p>Also, that letter has been completely disproven as a hoax, btw. Probably shouldn&#39;t cite &quot;beforeitsnews&quot; as a source, lol.</p>

Why dont you tell everyone how its perfectly normal for journalists to fabricate complex lies when news breaks, because thats what journalists are trained to do. Im reminded of when Harvard Journalism professor Andrea McCarren &quot;accidentally&quot; fabricated this long-winded bullshit about her meeting Sally Cox walking down the street and pumped her for info and Sally Cox told her that the shooters mom was a kindergarten teacher at sandy hook. </p>

<p>Perfectly normal for journalists to fabricate news, because journalism is hard. But if you are a conspiracy theorist, dont you dare get one fact wrong or you will be crucified. Im reminded of how &quot;screw loose change&quot; made a big deal out of the fact that &quot;loose change&quot; described the rubble from WTC7 as &quot;small&quot;, when the d ebunkers thought that the rubble pile was bigger than small.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the deal with Sandy Hook posts anyway? There are more of then usual lately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s been a lot of activity on the Sandy Hook front lately.  Huffpo and New Yorker just posted interviews with Peter Lanza as well.  I&#39;m not sure if the gun control crowd is trying a second offensive after their losses in the wake of the killings, but they&#39;ve spurred a lot of people who think there was something odd about the killings.  And there was- whether it was because something untoward went on, or that a lot of people made bad decisions when trying to &quot;protect&quot; victims families I don&#39;t know, but trying to shut people up is only going to convince more people that something screwed up DID go on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a subculture of conspiracists who are fixated on local level tragedies [Boston, Sandy Hook, etc.]. </p>

<p>From what I follow, the tragedy is enacted in order to convince the public to give up their civil liberties [guns, privacy]. Then the group develops into a semi - movement, where they disect whatever is available online, and arrange it into a few variations of &#39;what really happened&#39;. </p>

<p>The nay - sayers [who believe the official stories] consider the conspiracists to be paranoid/fearful. The common assertion says &#39;the paranoid conspiritards can&#39;t face the chaos and uncertainty of reality, that bad things sometimes happen, and rationalize the tragedy as some sort of setup/insidejob/cover up/fakery acted out by a variety of powerful shadow rulers [who have a variety of motivations].</p>

<p>The conspiracists consider themselves to be privy to the true narrative of reality, naysayers to be uninformed, ignorant sheep. Quite often there are accusations that users [those who voice opposition to the alternate, premeditated theory] are or seem like/sound like paid government agents who are spreading disinformation in a cyber-info war between the shadow rulers and the resistance burdened with knowing the truth.
I have never found myself entirely in either camp [both examples are on the extreme]. Five years ago I was an avid skeptic of the official stories of 9/11 and vocally anti-fed. At this point in my life, I look back at how much time and energy was spent fixated on the struggle-for-the-truth, and decided that those beliefs just distracted me from focusing on my school, work and relationships. </p>

<p>Back to your question about the cover up. To naysayers, occam&#39;s razor is more than enough to discredit a conspiracy.
To conspiracists, they too use occam&#39;s razor. However, the rationale is preceded with an a priori truth that there is an agenda pushing shadow elite who frequently manipulates events; therefore it seems more simple that this is yet another case if the wool being pulled over the eyes of the ignorant majority. The difference lies in the foundational beliefs [the popular narrative vs the shadow elite narrative].</p>

<p>Without changing the initial belief of the other, both groups are bound to endlessly argue, ridicule, attack, accuse, etc. It becomes a cycle of finger pointing and back-patting [circle jerking?]. This ultimately serves to preserve the integrity of each&#39;s own ego- a very fundamental motivation for many acts and beliefs of various groups and individuals.</p>

<p>*edit: first gold! thank you, whoever you are...</p>

<p>You keep changing what matters. Regardless it&#39;s against TOS. Just because someone dies doesn&#39;t mean you can post personal info on REDDIT. I swear, all you people need to get your own fucking forum. Get a 10 dollar web host, throw a forum up, share it around with all the little investigators here, and then you can&#39;t blame reddit anymore. Reddit has TOS, read it, tell me where him being dead changes anything. It sounds like YOU don&#39;t think it should matter. And when you make your own forum, that&#39;s fine. Right now the Admins control reddit, they control the TOS, and when you break it they ban you. This is not a complicated matter, I don&#39;t understand how SO many people are having a hard time getting such a simple matter.</p>

<p>Fyi, Ryan Lanza isn&#39;t dead. Yet his personal AAA information was posted right there on the front page by the subreddits only mod. Also, for all we know that&#39;s Ryan Lanza&#39;s phone number. The paid PeopleSmart search couldn&#39;t even differentiate the two people.</p>

<p>Edit: Or some random person&#39;s phone number, those searches aren&#39;t reliable. That&#39;s just one more reason why it&#39;s not allowed on Reddit. Innocent people get hurt.</p>
