<p>As somebody who has only posted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> once before...this means nothing to me! Instead of attacking me and branding me as a &#39;troll&#39; could you please explain this further. I was not aware that the no planes theory was disinfo, that it wasn&#39;t widely followed (Although I found a ton of Youtube vids on it...hence why I was led to believe it was widely followed. In hindsight that probably means fuck all) and that it seemingly must be a common issue that people troll this sub.</p>

<p>I apologise that I didn&#39;t click your link or respond to it, I was too taken aback by the fact you thought I was here <em>purposely to attack</em> members of this sub. I appreciate your explanation and am sorry that you feel so negatively towards me and my question. All I wanted to know was how the theory accounted for debris. You mentioned planting in another post? Was that how the theory addressed it? If so <strong>that</strong> was the answer I was looking for! I had no intention of arguing about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If what you say was true then you would also have easily seen the explanations for the debris in the videos themselves declared as planted, the forums that talk about this theory clearly state the same, everywhere this theory was discussed says that the debris were planted.</p>

<p>You have no excuse. If you really want to have a reasonable discussion ask the actual problems with the 911 official version of events, which you continue ignoring. Find out why NIST produced a fraudulent report instead of chasing a disinfo theory. Which I really doubt you will because people like you refuse to consider that the government would do such thing.</p>

<p>For example: ELI5: Why did NIST deliberatly stated that the WTC7 18 stories collapsed in 5,4s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;t=4536">when it clearly did in pure free-fall time of 3.9s?</a></p>

<p>I think you got it the wrong way round mate.</p>

<p>I just wanted someone who believes the theory to explain how the theory accounts for the debris that was photographed at the scene. I never said I supported the theory or don&#39;t agree with what you said...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The presence of evidence -<em>planted or not</em>- is the most strongest lead in any investigation. Until you have anything else that is in direct conflict with that evidence -<em>let&#39;s say that 3 engines are found when the airplane supposedly only had 2</em>- you cannot call it planted evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree the presence of evidence is the foremost issue when conducting an investigation.  Lack of direct evidence to the defendant is one of the most common reasons for failing to get guilty verdicts.</p>

<p>But the evidence in this case was collected in a shoddy manner and much of the plane evidence is missing or doesn&#39;t show a direct link to the alleged hijacked planes.  Much of the plane parts found in New York were found under scaffolding which indicates an opportunity to plant evidence.  Also, the distance these plane and building parts traveled (as in the case of the alleged plane tire wedged in the steel slab) appears physically impossible (much like mostly aluminum planes disappearing into a steel building like butter and having parts ejected out the other side).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t base my conclusion that the plane crashes were faked <em>solely</em> on the idea the plane parts were planted . . . it&#39;s based on the totality of circumstances and the (lack of) plane evidence (and the shady nature of it) fits with this theory best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The no planes group started out as the only 9/11 group out there.</p>

<p>In my opinion they were there as controlled opposition as it turned out.</p>

<p>I thought at the time I was utterly alone in disbelieving the 9/11 official story and sought out the main proponent of the pod planes theory, the webfairy, Rosalee Grable.</p>

<p>At the time no one had mentioned the no planes theory.</p>

<p>She got my attention with this, the very first 9/11 truth  video I had ever seen.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/ghostplane2.wmv">http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/ghostplane2.wmv</a></p>

<p>It was a camera glitch in which several camera&#39;s filming the south tower hit recorded  anomalous pods on the bottom of the plane and a missile being fired as the plane hit the tower.</p>

<p>Here are some of them</p>

<p><a href="http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/Splitscreen%20Low.wmv">http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/Splitscreen%20Low.wmv</a></p>

<p>Anyway I joined their email group for a couple of years and mostly observed.</p>

<p>I did contribute a much needed demonstration of thermite that I got from WestVilliage Link Dump.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/thermite.wmv">http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/thermite.wmv</a></p>

<p>I think the webfairy herself was a well intentioned but misguided person who had attracted the attention of a couple of &#39;followers&#39; who were working for the government as disinfo agents, controlled opposition</p>

<p>They encouraged Ms Grable to come up with wilder and wilder theories and she obliged. </p>

<p>A couple of other followers were really good researchers who did fine and truthful work, notably &#39;killtown&#39;, Erik Hufscmid  and &#39;plague puppy&#39;.</p>

<p>The reason I think of her as well intentioned is that she offered me free space on her domain to store any 9/11 files that I wanted to with no oversight or input from the no planers. </p>

<p>As you can see by these links they are still up.</p>

<p>Eventually Ms. Grable came up with her &#39;holographic planes&#39; theory and that no real planes were used at all  and that was too much of a  fantasy for the rest of us since there was plane debris at the trade towers. Not so much at Pennsylvania and the Pentagon. At Shankesville the debris was spread out for 7 miles but was not in the hole. At the pentagon there was so little that it looked planted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the internet in general became much more boisterous in their opposition to the no planers and hooted them off the internet. </p>

<p>Ms. Grable became a bit bizarre.</p>

<p><a href="http://webfairy.org/flyingpig/">http://webfairy.org/flyingpig/</a></p>

<p>I was intrigued by the pod planes as the only video out but never had any faith in &#39;no planes&#39;.</p>

<p>Once that started I left the group.</p>

<p>The no planers are long defunct.</p>

<p>What have you seen lately?</p>

<p>edit I forgot to mention  how the no planers explained the plane  parts at the towers.</p>

<p>There was a partial  engine found under a tarp on a sidewalk  where it was &#39;unlikely to have just landed&#39; They said it had been planted and wanted the part numbers matched to the actual United Airlines plane. </p>

<p>As far as I know that was never done.</p>

<p>This is a danger with any self-appointed, topic-specific watchdog.</p>

<p>There&#39;s always a reason (or many reasons) to believe that someone is trustworthy. Yours was technical (storage space), thankfully it wasn&#39;t emotional (she just seemed so sincere).</p>

<p>Eventually Ms. Grable came up with her &#39;holographic planes&#39; theory and that no real planes were used at all</p>

<p>And now, according to the derailers, &quot;every truther believes this&quot;.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your very interesting comment.</p>

<p>Just saw a few youtube videos that say they show the planes were holographs or something other than planes</p>

<p>In all my years of direct and indirect participation, I never witnessed nor even heard of an aircraft loss, where the wreckage was accessible, that prevented investigators from finding enough hard evidence to positively identify the make, model, and specific registration number of the aircraft — and in most cases the precise cause of the accident. This is because every military and civilian passenger-carrying aircraft have many parts that are identified for safety of flight. </p>
