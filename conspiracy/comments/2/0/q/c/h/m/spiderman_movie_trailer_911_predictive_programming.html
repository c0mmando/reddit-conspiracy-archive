       You've probably seen many cases of 9/11 foreshadowing that came straight out of Hollywood over many years leading up to the false flag attack.  I recently discovered this Spiderman movie trailer that came out a few weeks before the CIA/Mossad operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-r7qymfa0Q">
        Link to trailer.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This predictive programming trailer came out sometime in August of '01 just prior to Sept 11.  What's particularly odd about this trailer, independent of the conspiracy, is that
       <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/news/brief/1091707/spider-man-trailer-movie-poster-axed">
        it was shot specifically for the trailer and was not ever part of the actual film
       </a>
       .  Every other trailer I've ever seen has been a collage of scenes/audio from the actual film being promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting thing about this trailer
       <a href="http://www.releaselyrics.com/700d/e.s.-posthumus-pompeii/">
        is the music
       </a>
       .  The song is called Pompeii (an ancient Roman town-city that was largely destroyed/buried under 13-20ft of ash and pumice) by a band called E.S. Posthumus (posthumous means "after death").
      </p>
      <p>
       Here you have the lyrics to the song, Pompeii:
      </p>
      <p>
       Saevio saevio pessum trans
      </p>
      <p>
       Sewndum sed de potestas
      </p>
      <p>
       Surculus neo propinquo
      </p>
      <p>
       Haechostes par peior fas Pompeii
      </p>
      <p>
       Horrendeoa
      </p>
      <p>
       Peractio
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanitas
      </p>
      <p>
       Tergiversatio
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Google translation of these latin lyrics:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rage against the bottom side of the Rampage
      </p>
      <p>
       Sewndum but of power
      </p>
      <p>
       Shoot neo nearby
      </p>
      <p>
       Haechostes an even worse fit for Pompey
      </p>
      <p>
       Horrendeoa
      </p>
      <p>

       As someone stated earlier, they removed it out of respect. Then, towards the end of the movie, you see a bunch of New Yorkers throwing rocks at the goblin to help Spiderman. One of them says, "You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us." Very patriotic the country was right after that.

       I made no claims about why they pulled the trailer.  The point there is, the trailer was produced independently from the movie.  The towers weren't ever featured in the film and of course, a helicopter was never trapped by spiderman between the towers in the film.  Every trailer I can think of contains a mashup of actual film footage/audio.

       This is just not 100% true. They routinely will edit a shot that's in the trailer or just not include it completely sometimes.

       As a filmmaker, I can tell you it's not unusual to shoot footage specifically for a trailer.  Trailers are very different from films and need to convey the story's world in a very concise way.  This is not always possible with what is shot for the film, so additional footage is shot to aid in the process.  Sometimes it is done to expand the world, and this trailer seems to fall into that category.  It's a teaser that stands alone as an advertisement for the story world and provides a reveal that pushes the viewer into that world without giving anything away.
      </p>
      <p>
       If is also common to use footage that was shot for inclusion in the film, but was cut for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the music, I'm sure the trailer editor picked a piece of music from the studio's library simply for its pacing, without any idea of what it actually said.

       The most current one is Godzilla which will be released in May.  The ones that immediately spring to mind are Inglourious Basterds, District 9, Fight Club, Knocked Up, Ace Ventura, Twister, The Master, and Superman Returns.  I'm sure there are many, many others as it's a practice that dates back to the 1930's.

       I just asked a friend who is particularly annoyed by this practice and he rambled off this list...
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the Harry Potter films, all of the Lord of the Rings films, Superbad, The Transporter, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, King Kong, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Major League, The Grinch, The Avengers, Hulk, Predators, Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, Sherlock Holmes, Men in Black, The Last Airbender, National Treasure, Anchorman, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Fantastic Four, Titanic, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Iron Man 3, and Independence Day
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these had trailers containing substantial footage that wasn't in the film.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the trailers for both Black Christmas and Paranormal Activity 3 consisted almost entirely of footage shot specifically for the trailer.

       They did not include out of respect. I've copied the paragraph below from the link you provided. So it is not odd they did not include it makes perfect sense.

        Now, in light of the horrible tragedy in New York City, this image invokes only tremendous despair and sadness. In response to this inevitable fact, Jeff Blake, President of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution for Columbia Motion Picture Group, has officially removed all Spider-Man movie trailers from exhibitors, distribution houses and Web sites. In addition, all movie posters and images of the poster, in which Spider-Man is featured peeking around the corner of a tall building with the WTC reflected in his eyes, have been pulled. They will be revised and re-released.

       Humus means "ground."

       Posthumous literally means 'after earth' as in after you've been buried.

       That seems important to clarify.

       The spelling of words changes over time for various reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example; the root word for 'knowledge' is 'gnosis' (kno / gno) The 'G' was changed to a 'K' for whatever reason and few people will ever think about it. Another example; Lucifer takes its root from 'lucere' (light) and 'ferre' (carrier / bearer). The spelling has been modified over the years and now it has a meaning completely divorced from its original intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       My usage of language has become much more precise as I study etymology / philology.

       I just asked a friend who is particularly annoyed by this practice and he rambled off this list...
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the Harry Potter films, all of the Lord of the Rings films, Superbad, The Transporter, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, King Kong, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Major League, The Grinch, The Avengers, Hulk, Predators, Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, Sherlock Holmes, Men in Black, The Last Airbender, National Treasure, Anchorman, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Fantastic Four, Titanic, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Iron Man 3, and Independence Day
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these had trailers containing substantial footage that wasn't in the film.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the trailers for both Black Christmas and Paranormal Activity 3 consisted almost entirely of footage shot specifically for the trailer.
