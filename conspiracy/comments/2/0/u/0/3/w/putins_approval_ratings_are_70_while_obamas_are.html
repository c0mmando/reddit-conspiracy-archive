        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/putins-approval-ratings-are-70-while.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/putins-approval-ratings-are-70-while.html</a></p>

<p>Winners </p>

<p>Putin</p>

<p>Putin has consolidated his already high approval ratings and strong power base within Russia as a result of his actions in Crimea.</p>

<p>Putin has also consolidated his power base among the oligarchs and power elites in Russia.</p>

<p>Putin gave the nod to his top cronies in Russia before he intervened in Crimea. E.G. the head of Gazprom sold ALL his sizable shareholding in the company a week or two prior to Russia&#39;s military intervention in Crimea.</p>

<p>The obvious message that Putin is sending out to the rich and powerful in Russia, is that working closely WITH Putin is worth their while and not working closely with him will cost them money. (The rich and powerful in Russia already knew this - but it&#39;s always worthwhile sending out pertinent reminders every so often.)</p>

<p>The stock market fall in Russia won&#39;t of affected Putin&#39;s inner clique much at all.
I wonder if anyone benefited by actually shorting Russian shares? (Shorting is betting that share prices will fall.)</p>

<p>American Neocons and Warmongers</p>

<p>The Neocons are using the American engineered crisis in Ukraine as an excuse to escalate global tensions and even start another major war or cold war with Russia.</p>

<p>Ukraine : US officials and US media go bat shit crazy over Russian interference in Crimea <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/ukraine-us-officials-and-us-media-go.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/ukraine-us-officials-and-us-media-go.html</a></p>

<p>Neocon William Kristol wants the US to start a war against someone .... anyone! <a href="http://antiwar.com/blog/2014/03/17/bill-kristol-calls-for-americans-to-be-awakened-and-rallied-to-war/">http://antiwar.com/blog/2014/03/17/bill-kristol-calls-for-americans-to-be-awakened-and-rallied-to-war/</a></p>

<p>Israel is also trying to goad America into war, for the benefit of Israel and the certain detriment of over 99% of Americans. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-israel-usa-idUSBREA2H0SV20140318">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-israel-usa-idUSBREA2H0SV20140318</a></p>

<p>Arms Companies </p>

<p>Calls to cut back on America&#39;s current astronomical level of arms spending (over $1tn a year) will now be more muted - not that there was much in the first place.</p>

<p>There may even be calls to increase it in the near future &quot;to counter the Russian threat&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Cold War mentality and deeply against the interests of over 99% of Americans, but it usually works on a hugely gullible and ignorant American public. </p>

<p>Arms sales to the rest of the world are also likely to significantly increase if the Neocons succeed in engendering a new Cold War type mentality.</p>

<p>NSA and CIA</p>

<p>Calls to defund the NSA and to control the CIA will now be more mooted.</p>

<p>Who in Congress is now going to speak out against the recently revealed (to the mainstream) criminal activities of the intelligence agencies in the face of this new escalation with Russia?
At the very least the American engineered Ukrainian crisis will distract from the crimes of the CIA and the NSA.</p>

<p>Maybe the CIA and NSA should concentrate on spying on Russia, to glean Putin&#39;s intentions before he acts, instead of spying on Congress and the American people.
Maybe they already did and knew that Putin wouldn&#39;t take a coup in Ukraine lying down.
Either way it does not put the intelligence agencies in a very good light (but it is very doubtful that anybody in the mainstream is actually going to come out and say it.)</p>

<p>Just like 9/11 and Boston were massive intelligence failures and if the intelligence services were actually doing their supposed job of protecting Americans, they would never have been allowed to happen.</p>

<p>Republican Party Establishment</p>

<p>(See Democrat Party below.)</p>

<p>The Neocons who completely dominate the Republican Party Establishment will benefit from the renewed spirit of warmongering which is being encouraged in the Corporate owned and controlled media.<br/>
Recent polls were indicating that Americans were getting fed up with the endless wars and multiple interventions in numerous countries.</p>

<p>The number of instances of warmongering Neocons being treated as sane policy makers (rather than the insane people they actually are) has dramatically increased, e.g. on MSNBC in recent months.
E.G. John McCain, American Enterprise Institute, Brookings Institute, ex-advisors to McCain etc.</p>

<p>Losers</p>

<p>Barack Obama</p>

<p>Barack Obama is being portrayed as spineless and weak in a lot of the media.</p>

<p>A lot of it will stick among Independent voters - the only people that count in an election.</p>

<p>It will stick because it is true (but not in the way that the Neocon Corporatists like John McCain portray).</p>

<p>Barack Obama has never stood up against the big banks, the arms companies, big oil, big pharma, Monsanto etc. He has never stood up for, or worked for, the American people.</p>

<p>He is a spineless puppet for Big Corporate and Big Money interests .</p>

<p>The Neocons also portrayed Obama as weak when he did not pursue the Neocon agenda for overt full scale war in Syria for the benefit of Saudi Arabia, Israel, the arms companies and big oil.</p>

<p>He backed down in the face of overwhelming public opinion against war in Syria, a lack of international support - even the UK government could not hoodwink their Parliament enough to authorize it and he was going to lose the vote in Congress if he had pursued it.</p>

<p>Democrat Party </p>

<p>The Democrat Party will lose further support from Independents in the 2014 mid-term elections.</p>

<p>Independents are the largest demographic at 40% of the electorate.</p>

<p>Democrat candidates were already up against it because of the slow-motion train-wreck that is Obamacare, which Obama continues to try and run from by delaying the fines for not being Obamacare covered.
See the recent result in Florida.</p>

<p>The young who were conned by Obama&#39;s empty and meaningless rhetoric in 2008 are starting to smell a rat in the face of the overwhelming evidence that Obama has reneged on numerous campaign promises.
He has just continued the disastrous economic policies of GW Bush and massively expanded the Mass Surveillance State.</p>

<p>Barack Obama : A Gigantic Fraud upon the American People <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/barack-obama-gigantic-fraud-upon.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/barack-obama-gigantic-fraud-upon.html</a></p>

<p>The economy is already sinking like a stone and despite the media headlines unemployment is going up, particularly among the young. </p>

<p>The Real Story on the US Labor market - only 42,000 jobs were added in February. Real unemployment just went up yet AGAIN. <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-real-story-on-us-labor-market.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-real-story-on-us-labor-market.html</a></p>

<p>Goldman Cuts Q1 GDP Forecast To 1.5% (from 3% at the start of the year), the third lowering of forecasts in 2014 <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-03-13/goldman-cuts-q1-gdp-forecast-15-weaker-retail-sales-half-goldmans-original-q1-gdp-fo">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-03-13/goldman-cuts-q1-gdp-forecast-15-weaker-retail-sales-half-goldmans-original-q1-gdp-fo</a></p>

<p>Ukrainian People </p>

<p>The Ukrainian people are certainly going to be worse off as a result of the American intervention in the domestic affairs and Coup D&#39;Etat in their country.</p>

<p>This is not exactly unusual - see Iraq, Libya, Syria etc.
<a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/ukraine-us-officials-and-us-media-go.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/03/ukraine-us-officials-and-us-media-go.html</a></p>

<p>Ukraine is already poor with a per capita income of only $6,500 a year.</p>

<p>It already had extreme difficulty in paying it&#39;s bills, e.g. the $2bn or so owed to Gazprom.</p>

<p>Russia had given Ukraine a 33% discount on it&#39;s gas - nearly half of it&#39;s energy supply.</p>

<p>Russia is likely to withdraw this discount, which will lead to the impoverishment of Ukrainians and have a severe detrimental effect on Ukrainian industry (they will be forced to pay market rates or 50% more for their gas). </p>

<p>Ukraine&#39;s industry is very inefficient and relies on exports to Russia (the only country willing to buy it&#39;s steel products). These have now been put at risk, through higher energy costs and e.g. via new Russian trade tariffs.</p>

<p>Unemployment in Ukraine will no doubt rise as a result of American actions (the American actions were never designed to benefit the people of Ukraine).</p>

<p>Ukraine has now lost the very significant gas reserves in the Black Sea around Crimea, which it could of used to revamp it&#39;s economy. Exxon and Chevron were planning to put up $1bn as an initial investment for exploratory drilling.</p>

<p>The story sold to poorer countries that joining the EU will provide benefits and better job prospects might of been superficially and temporarily true when Poland joined the EU in 2004.
It no longer is. See Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Cyprus, among several other countries that are in deep economic trouble.
The EU is bankrupt with massive and rising National Debts, over 500 insolvent banks and massively high unemployment - an average of 12%. </p>

<p>I very much doubt that the German people are going to be overly enamored with helping Ukraine - they are already crying foul from the continuing bail outs to the rest of the Eurozone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ukraine is exactly part of a 2-tier EU system. It is also applied to most northern African nations. The Trade Agreement is basically an economic rape as (even despite the Euro) European products are extremely competitive, when not subsidized. EU membership is just a carrot on a stick, an empty promise to seduce countries in accepting the non-favorable trade agreement. Ukraine is a market of 40 million people, exactly what the EU needs to expand its economy. And most importantly the trade deal is exclusive, prohibiting members from joining other custom unions.</p>

<p>If Ukraine was actually &quot;smart&quot;, it would&#39;ve forced joining both Russian and EU custom unions, and profit by reselling and repackaging EU merchandise to Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fortune 500 will own Ukraine lock stock and barrel (except the Crimean corner that Putin controls) within 5 years.   Every major manufacturer every substantial farming operation, every pipeline, every new military installation (NATO will come into the Ukraine and have missiles on the eastern border facing Russia), will be a subsidiary of western global corporations,  or a government asset in the control of the western/global MIC.   Governments may have their deficits,  but the corporations will dole out benefits to all of the key kleptocrats of the &quot;democracies&quot;.   Governments will be bailed out by the people and will direct the benefits to the corporations.   The plantation owners do &quot;public service&quot; stints raping the state for a couple years and then back to board positions in the wonderful capitalist institutions that are so pro-democratic whenever it is a handy slogan but who would smash any real democracy if it started to bud at home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That will be the intention. Exactly the same as has been done to Poland.</p>

<p>I could of mentioned Monsanto, which no doubt has it&#39;s eye on Ukraine&#39;s extensive farmland. Then there are the Walmarts and the Carrefour&#39;s and the Tesco&#39;s. </p>

<p>Ukraine&#39;s manufacturing industry, which is mostly in the East, currently seems to operate at a similar level to East Germany prior to reunification</p>

<p>Ukraine is a more interesting and more complicated situation given the level of Russian support in Eastern Ukraine. </p>

<p>I think there are likely to be prolonged struggles and social unrest within Ukraine, battling for and against this agenda. </p>

<p>I was born in the form Soviet republic of Lithuania. Heck, my passport event has the good old SSSR logo and it fucking grinds my nuts how ignorant Ukrainian people are. Yes, this might sound hypocritical coming from a guy who moved to the West, graduated with an economics degree from a top London university, but in short I don&#39;t see how in the long term the lives of Ukrainians will improve by abolishing their relationship with Kremlin. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but the fact is that neoliberal globalisation fucks shit up, especially in developing states that seek to reinvent themselves. Look at crisis at south east asia at the end of the 20th century. They have opened up their markets, state&#39;s power has been reduced and in the long term those countries got raped by the world capitalist system.</p>

<p>In short, what I&#39;m trying to say is that <a href="/u/rockytimber">/u/rockytimber</a> has a point.</p>

Don&#39;t get me wrong,  Putin and his Russia are no panacea,  there is plenty of crap on both sides,  and selective reporting as well.   Its just the degree to which the public mind in the US has been fed selective information,  and has been excluded by other relevant data is astounding.   On top of that,  the public feels good about &quot;their team&quot;  and &quot;doing the right thing on the side of white hats&quot; and &quot;Putin is deluded&quot; and &quot;Putin&#39;s support is a sham concocted from manipulation and lies,  and peopled exclusively by thugs&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Kudos for a meaty post with plenty to mull over, I have some niggles with your analysis but appreciate the post.</p>

<p>One thing I think is worth consideration is that it is all too easy to assume institutions, governments, agencies and populations operate in a knowing ideological lock-step. Agitators equally could represent a small, well-funded minority or group who operate beyond the scope and oversight of their respective positions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I expect some disagreements with some of my points. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also pretty sure I missed some of the winners and losers. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mention the oil companies as it is not obvious to me if they are a winner or loser out of this. Exxon and Chevron&#39;s deal to develop Ukraine&#39;s gas is on hold, while energy prices will be boosted by an increase in global tensions.  </p>

<p>It is much better for the overall success of a secretive undercover major project if individuals and groups are informed as little as possible on a need-to-know basis about the overall scheme and other members involvement.</p>

<p>You just give a group a nudge in the right direction and probably some money to help them achieve the part of the overall scheme, that you want that particular group to achieve. The risk in not giving out full information is that some of the groups might do something you don&#39;t want them to do.</p>

<p>This applies equally well to CIA operations, terrorist cells or the operations in Ukraine.</p>
