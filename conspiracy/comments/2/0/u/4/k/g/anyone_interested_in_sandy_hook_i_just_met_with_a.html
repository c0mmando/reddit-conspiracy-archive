<p>The lawyer said that it appears to be that whoever bought those homes, and at whatever price and date, for whatever reason (we were not speculating) was able to obtain support from the Corporation who enters the information in the Vision Appraisal Inc. website. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s put the bickering and speculation behind us, and get the real answer, which I will be updating here. If I can, I will photocopy and scan in redacted versions of all hard  copies to get to the root of this problem. </p>

<p>No more infighting here! Remember, none of us have an answer yet. It looks like soon, we will.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT EDIT/REQUEST:  While I&#39;m there, any photos, data, questions I should look for/take pictures of/ ask? I have to be careful not to come across as an annoying reporter (which I&#39;m not, well maybe a bit annoying....lol.....)  but this is kind of a long drive for me and I don&#39;t want to come home and think, &quot;Damn, I should have _________.&quot;   Please post requests below. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#39;ll stop at the Newtown Bee Publishing office as well I think and ask about the deleted articles on sex offenders. </p></li>
<li><p>Does anyone know where the grave markers of the victims are? I can see if they are there as well. </p></li>
<li><p>I will get a few copies of the town paper. </p></li>
<li><p>A large town map from the clerk.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>-I will ask about the TUNNELS under the school.</p>

<p>-Anything else?</p>

<p>This is very likely the payoff for the participants.  All to avoid the unconstitutional door-to-door mass firearm confiscations they are preparing for now.  The surrounding communities do not have this sake glitch.  Only Newtown, and covering all key participants, except the fictional Lanza.  Fond out who now owns the note.  A mortgage company or bank, like just about everyone in the US, or the homeowner (unlikely owned outright by so many people in Newtown).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much my goal. I spoke on the phone yesterday with someone from the Assessor&#39;s site. (wont use names) but she seemed....patronizing. You know that voice, sticky sweet but phony. I don&#39;t care but it was interesting. She called me sweetie and dear, but it felt so disingenuous like she was mocking me I said, &quot;ok well who can I reach out to at the Town Hall who can help me if I have questions, I don&#39;t want to be a bother, and I&#39;d like to know what time is best for them so I figured I&#39;d call ahead?&quot;</p>

<p>And she said, &quot;Sweetie, EVERYONE there is just sweet as pie, and will be more than happy to assist you.&quot;  </p>

<p>The way she was saying it just rubbed me the wrong way.</p>

<p>Any suggestions as to what else I can get?</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if the Town Clerk (who may be a road block since she is Bill Halstead&#39;s - firechief- wife) has blueprints for buildings eg. SHS and other things. I do not work in this field and was hoping that some people here could give me feedback since I dont want to keep traveling all that way over and over. I&#39;d like to go in, get what I need, and get out.</p>
