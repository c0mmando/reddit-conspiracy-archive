       I will be going to the Town Clerk's office next week to look at the property deeds - hard copy- next week when I have the morning off and finding out what is really on there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lawyer said that it appears to be that whoever bought those homes, and at whatever price and date, for whatever reason (we were not speculating) was able to obtain support from the Corporation who enters the information in the Vision Appraisal Inc. website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's put the bickering and speculation behind us, and get the real answer, which I will be updating here. If I can, I will photocopy and scan in redacted versions of all hard  copies to get to the root of this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       No more infighting here! Remember, none of us have an answer yet. It looks like soon, we will.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMPORTANT EDIT/REQUEST:  While I'm there, any photos, data, questions I should look for/take pictures of/ ask? I have to be careful not to come across as an annoying reporter (which I'm not, well maybe a bit annoying....lol.....)  but this is kind of a long drive for me and I don't want to come home and think, "Damn, I should have _________."   Please post requests below.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         I'll stop at the Newtown Bee Publishing office as well I think and ask about the deleted articles on sex offenders.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Does anyone know where the grave markers of the victims are? I can see if they are there as well.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I will get a few copies of the town paper.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A large town map from the clerk.

       -I will ask about the TUNNELS under the school.

       Thanks! Speculating gets so annoying. I like to get right in there. It'll be a timeconsuming hike, but worth it, and we can knock off all this infighting and stuff - hopefully- at least on this one topic, you know?

       Now that he's given them warning, at least he can blame the lack of evidence on the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without warning them then the lack of evidence would just be proof that Sandy Hook truthers are simply delusional.

       Because these assholes read the site.  They will not allow any proof of their engineered event to be released to the public.  This is one of those things you do, and then report the results
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       you have firm data.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very likely the payoff for the participants.  All to avoid the unconstitutional door-to-door mass firearm confiscations they are preparing for now.  The surrounding communities do not have this sake glitch.  Only Newtown, and covering all key participants, except the fictional Lanza.  Fond out who now owns the note.  A mortgage company or bank, like just about everyone in the US, or the homeowner (unlikely owned outright by so many people in Newtown).

       So they were given a home in 2009 for free, in return for promising to participate in a fake massacre three years later, which was going to be staged in order to put together some compromised legislation saying that people had to register their guns?

       To make it appear as though the people were demanding the erosion or their rights, in the name of "protecting the children." It if course did not work because we don't believe it relinquishing our natural human rights, and because they botched the operation so poorly.

       Excellent step.  I guess I'd also figure out what else you need from the Town Clerk's office, and try to get it in one fell swoop.

       That's pretty much my goal. I spoke on the phone yesterday with someone from the Assessor's site. (wont use names) but she seemed....patronizing. You know that voice, sticky sweet but phony. I don't care but it was interesting. She called me sweetie and dear, but it felt so disingenuous like she was mocking me I said, "ok well who can I reach out to at the Town Hall who can help me if I have questions, I don't want to be a bother, and I'd like to know what time is best for them so I figured I'd call ahead?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And she said, "Sweetie, EVERYONE there is just sweet as pie, and will be more than happy to assist you."
      </p>
      <p>
       The way she was saying it just rubbed me the wrong way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any suggestions as to what else I can get?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wondering if the Town Clerk (who may be a road block since she is Bill Halstead's - firechief- wife) has blueprints for buildings eg. SHS and other things. I do not work in this field and was hoping that some people here could give me feedback since I dont want to keep traveling all that way over and over. I'd like to go in, get what I need, and get out.

       She said that based upon the number of records that did NOT have that date, and hundreds if not thousands were tediously reviewed, it was an obvious entry to those specific addresses. She was using her experience in property research which showed her that in the past she saw something similar in instances of things like witness protection homes (AND I AM NOT SAYING THAT IS WHAT THIS IS- but that was her example).

       Dude, stop.  Please do some research before you randomly go down there grabbing at straws.  For one thing, save yourself the trip and ask a title company to pull the prop reports.  It should cost about $50 each.  Tell them you want a 100 year chain of title.  Appraisal software results are irrelevant.  Assessor information is pretty much irrelevant.
