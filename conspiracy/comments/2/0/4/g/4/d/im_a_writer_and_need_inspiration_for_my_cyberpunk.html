       Protagonist, angsty 18 year old who's a military experiment gone wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snippet about him:  "He was honed from a young age to become a master, a tool to the Board to finally end one of the wars.  However, he was not a tank-born Clone, he was naturally born to parents that harbored a secret rebellious attitude towards the board and their religion.  When this was found out through his rebellious nature - which had no other source at his age of eight - they were shot down in front of him and he was put into military school."
      </p>
      <p>
       Antagonist(s):  Shadow corporate syndicate government run by senile chairmen, with a slightly tribal and Vatican like twist.  Kinda incompetent in the end as well.  They are kept alive and are addicted to life extending drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Settings are my specialty.  let me take it from my design doc...
      </p>
      <p>
       "There is a barrier up around the planet, that prevents any sort of space travel.  It also prevents disseminated Quantum souls from being released into the void of space.  For the past few centuries or millenia, the barrier has been kept up by ancient Pylons of nondescript origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The souls are building up such incredible psychic pressure that rifts between dimensions are appearing.  Though these are only in areas where the veil is thin, essentially areas where a lot of psychic trauma occurs or in places far away from civilization.  It doesnt help that the countless wars between the corporate city-states and large tribal republics are destroying the world's resources and arable land, not only causing psychic starvation but physical as well."
      </p>
      <p>
       Had to get some roadside picnic in there as well.  But really, I need help establishing a part of the universe, not constructing the whole plot.  These framework conspiracies and inspirations i'm hoping to get will serve to.. enrich the universe a bit.  If you catch my meaning.

       I hope don't think I'm trying impose on the plot or story in any way. When i help friends or anyone i want to their story I the story is already in them. Usually the way I help my friends with stories I just ask them questions about their story which serves two purposes: 1. I can share historical or conspiratorial references and 2: (more important) by asking the questions everything becomes more apparent to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, there are conspiracy theories that claim Earth is under some form of quarantine. The theories range from a physical barrier to a non-intervention law of some sort. That may be a good place to start. I'll try and track down a few sources of the quarantine concept.

       Another conspiracy idea is that on Earth there are more and more alien souls incarnating on Earth to help with some sort of change that is going to take place. That was a 2012 event kind of conspiracy but after that came and went they either say that the changes in calendars messed it up or that the major 2012 event happened and we just haven't noticed the effects yet.

       Ah, a bit like the whole trekkie "galactic imperative" thing.  Making sure violent and or immature races don't get out and wreak havoc.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the barrier works two ways.  Nothing in, nothing out.  Though, the void of space serves as purgatory in my metaphysics.  Aliens really dont come into play except for the origins of the Pylons, and even then they're not really aliens but the progenitors of the population of the planet

       Eeeugh, sorry.  I refuse to draw inspiration from Scientology of all places.  Truly disgusting cult.  And it is presumably distasteful to draw inspiration from it.  Aliens arent like that at all in my continuity.

       That could work in my universe, using my quantum physics based "magic" system.  Hmm, probably not quite as effective as you're implying..
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, perhaps a sigil that when walking or looking by it you feel less hungry, or maybe a liiiitle bit more compliant.  Either way, with the nature of the main character he'd be highly resistant to psionics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is I don't know how.. prevalent i want psionics to be in my universe.  Thanks though, that's a good concept.

       usually a conspiracy is well hidden even if it comes to light it is plausibly wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example with manhattan project, sept. 2001, PRISM, etc.. too many people would have to keep quiet and the truth would come out.. so it can't be true right?
      </p>
      <p>
       the answer here is compartmentalization.  people only need to know their function, and as in some drills, aren't even aware what is reality and what is the drill.
      </p>
      <p>
       most false flag/psy ops are happening in concert with drills for the same event.. then the drill goes live.  this happened at sept. 2001, london 2005, and many others, including Boston.
      </p>
      <p>
       also there's the whole perception vs. reality, using crisis actors, faking injuries, appealing to emotion, calling detractors monsters and terrorists, and generally accusing your detractor of dong exactly what you are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on if any of this is useful to you.

       the idea of partially revealing or getting ahead of damaging information with a Limited Hangout operation (see wikipedia)
      </p>
      <p>
       also the Hegelian Dialectic (if I'm using this right) is related to the idea of - if we want you to accept something really bad - we'll tell you we're doing something even more terrible, and you'll settle for only some of it thinking that you came out ahead.  (kind of like lowballing an offer in a negotiation)
      </p>
      <p>
       some conspiracies that might be of interest are  Operation Gladio, and even Operation Midnight Climax (there were reports of agents using eachother for target practice on that one)

       An important adjunct to compartmentalization is disinformation within the structure of a long-term plan. Richard Hoagland (not that I'm a fan, but anyway) is fond of saying "the lie is different at every level." People at each level of information and power can believe they're doing one thing while serving an agenda that's hidden from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Characterizing a conspiracy to resemble an onion adds levels of potential intrigue, and BTW this kind of thinking is cited as the reason people will cling to belief in unreasonable theories--you could have disinformationists taking advantage of people's paranoia to perpetuate false conspiracies.

       I've always enjoyed reading about how 2 players in a quest for Technology, the "lesser" but better financially supported, wins.
Tesla vs. Edison

      <p>
       VHS vs Beta

       Essentially yes.

       I'm doing research.  You guys are the closest thing to professionals and I ask for your knowledge.  No need to be a dick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning;  I'm going to a font of knowledge that was closest.  a subreddit
       <em>
        named
       </em>
       conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, you guys spend hours thinking about this on a level reports wont be able to match.  If i can simply tap into your passion, that would be quite beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so bloody hell do you even know how writing works?  I need bloody inspiration.  Yeah.. seriously...  I need a spark for my creative flame.  I cant make that spark on my own; i have to draw it from the environment around me.  Be that spark, please?  I hate to sound artsy and pretentious but it's simply the only combination of words I can come up with right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       besides, I know you have links and stuff but really that's not the same as a hot-off-the-keyboard piece of thought.  It doesn't carry the same potency to me.

       Not the same person but... I know how writing works. It's not a spark to ignite the gasses that writer's need. It's a dam to hold back the flood. Writers find it difficult to ever stop writing. Which is... not necessarily the problem you're having. Would it be more apt to say that you need focus?

       Anyway, to answer your question. Look up Project Flicker. I'm using it myself in my own writing, but the more people who write on it, the more people are aware, then the better.
