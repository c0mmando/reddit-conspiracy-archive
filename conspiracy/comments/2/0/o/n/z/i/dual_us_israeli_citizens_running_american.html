<p>Oh, for fuck&#39;s sake.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Baal is the even-more-primitive and even more openly violent local cult that the invading Jews replaced with their primitve tribal Judaic religion when they first took over the area. A Baal-worshiping zionist is a reference to the zionists&#39; complete disconnection with Jewish tradition; there is a great number of suggestions of different types that the PR &quot;Jewish-ness&quot; of the crazed fucking zionists is really just the original Baal worship.  I thought that that would have been obvious. </p>

<p>A good place to start is <a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com">www.jewsagainstzionism.com</a>, which has been renamed &quot;<a href="http://www.truetorahjews.org/">http://www.truetorahjews.org/</a>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because I have no desire to comb through these people&#39;s lives and evaluating their every statement and stance.  The claim was made that they are Zionists, and I have yet to see any actual evidence that they are, beyond them hold a duel citizenship.  </p>

<p>For example, lets say I claimed person A ate babies for fun.  You ask for proof, I then respond that you should provide proof that person A didn&#39;t eat babies for fun.  If you don&#39;t provide this proof then I declare that person A does in fact eat babies for fun.  </p>

<p>Reddit bots are just automated user accounts...  You can log into them and comment just like any other account.  There are no rules saying you can&#39;t use a bot account to comment without the bot code.  But by all means, freak out about it.</p>

<p>I use alien blue on my phone and log in to this account every so often to check the inbox.  </p>

<p>And I guess I need to apologize for responding to your comment at all as I can tell you just wanted to post your snarky comment without getting an actual response.  Sorry I had to ruin that for you :(</p>

<p>Richard &#39;Prince Of Darkness&#39; Perle creates a think tank paper for Israel entitled; A Clean Break: A New Strategy For Securing The Realm where he and others state two prominent points of action to increase Israel&#39;s regional security. That entailed removing Saddam Hussein from power and &#39;containing&#39; Bashar Al Assad in Syria by &#39;using proxy forces and highlighting their weapons of mass destruction.&#39; If you consider what&#39;s happened in Syria and look back at what was written in 1996, the parallels are obvious and the plan was to attract international response, namely the US which were the ones that were going to take action via Israeli lobbying.</p>

<p>1997</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century</a></p>

<p>The Project For A New American Century was a non profit think tank started by William Kristol and Robert Kagan. Amongst the signatories was Richard Perle as well as prominent Neoconservative members that were and still are big Israel supporters. The removal of Saddam Hussein was also called for in this think tank paper only one year after it was suggested by Richard Perle for Israel.</p>

<p>2001</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Associations_with_Bush_administration">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#Associations_with_Bush_administration</a></p>

<p>Every single member elected into the Bush cabinet that had authority to call for, direct and instigate war were also signatories to PNAC in 1997. Further back even, it was evident that the policy to remove Saddam Hussein because it was not done in Desert Storm in 1992 was by people that put Israel first. They are all members of American/Israeli think tanks based in Washington such as WINEP and JINSA which pushed the US into undertaking Israeli foreign policy.</p>

<p>Again, the PNAC website no longer is being hosted (check the official site link on the wiki page) but there is another full text which I&#39;ll link bellow.</p>

<p>This is a timeline briefing and a proper look into the back rooms of the Iraq War and pulls all the information I&#39;ve provided into an easily digestible piece.</p>

<p>It shows without any doubt whatsoever that it was pre-meditated, the same people were consistent throughout and it&#39;s not just my personal opinion that it was a foreign policy coup in the US government by some very prominent people.</p>

<p>Here is Gen. Wesley Clarke (former Supreme Allied Commander Of NATO) discussing at a talk and backing up all the information I provided and he names the names that are consistent throughout all the information.</p>

<p>There&#39;s conspiracy theories and there&#39;s history. This is history no matter how many times you try to change it or call it anti-Semitic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first paragraph of the article is worth talking about.  </p>

<p>&quot;If you think we’re being unfair here, ask yourself: How you would react to the Head of Homeland Security if he or she were a dual national with citizenship in Iran, Lebanon or Saudi Arabia?&quot;</p>

<p>Guess what.... if there were a bunch of dual citizenship Iranians in positions of influence and power, people would lose their shit.</p>

<p>But Israel gets a free ride.  If they get caught doing anything questionable they can always pull the holocaust card out... cause... I mean... how does that ever get old?</p>

<p>Just to keep things REAL... Israel pretty much did everything we accused Iraq of doing in order to goto war with them.  They secretly developed nukes... Denied having nukes... Have even threatened openly to use the nukes they&#39;ve denied countless times in the past having... and nobody considers it worthy to talk about because they&#39;re supposedly our friends.  </p>

<p>International law applies to everybody.</p>

<p>Recently, in their much lauded paper, The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, Harvard professor, Stephen Walt, and University of Chicago professor, John Mearsheimer, focused attention on the strong Israeli lobby which has a powerful influence over American foreign policies (see BBC article). </p>

<p>They detail the influence that this lobby has exerted, forming a series of international policies which can be viewed as in direct opposition to the interests and security of the American people. These acts and policies are more often than not carried out by US government appointees who hold powerful positions and who are dual American-Israeli citizens. Since the policies they support are often exclusively beneficial to Israel, often to the detriment of America, it has been argued that their loyalties are misdirected.</p>
