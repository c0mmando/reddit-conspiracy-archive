        Here is my last AMA I did a while ago
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you read that last AMA to see if you can get the information you need from there. I'm sure there's still many of you who have questions, or have new questions to ask me, and I'm happy to answer them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assure you, we're not a sinister group that seeks to conquer the world, yes a lot of major historical figures are Freemasons but that doesn't necessarily mean we planned for them to become major historical figures. In a sense, we help people become educated and have good virtues so that may be the reason why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, AMA

       Well, I was curious about groups in general, and I decided Freemasonry was a nice fraternity for me to join, so I did. I had to be an adult and I had to come out of my, "Own free accord" and I had to be deemed of good character.

       I was kind of a novice at first, but it really helped me become a better person.

       I was actually the one who asked it in your last AMA. Some other poster (u/aaronsherman) replied back with a vague wikipedia article but couldnt explain any significance Enoch has in freemasonry.

      <p>
       During that AMA, you didnt respond to my inquiry, unless u/aaronsherman is another account of yours.

       No, Aaronsherman is a member of the Freemasonry like me and he helped answer questions in the AMA.

       Anyway, I don't really know too much about Epoch besides being a figure in the Bible, a descendant of Cain and the subject of several conspiracy theories on the origin of Freemasonry, they're not really very accurate beyond rumors and symbolism.

       Well then, in lieu of information about Enoch, what can you tell me about the Great Deluge, and Freemasonry's knowledge of it? Any pertinent Masonic legends would suffice.

       Well, while there may be variations on this legend, but The Great Deluge is one of the names for the Judeo-Christian Flood Myth. There are many rumors, on of which being that before the Great Flood, humanity had progressed extremely far and was almost at the Tree of Life, which is said to be a metaphor for the invention of true transhumanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the story, God knew that humanity had to be renewed or they would complete their apotheosis and become equal to God in power, but not equal in virtue.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's mostly just a story, an interesting story but not much evidence for it beyond speculation.

       Well, we progress with the times but our goal isn't necessarily to reach transhumanism, just good moral character and helping humanity in general. There's a theory that because of the Hedonic Treadmill humanity can never reach transhumanism.

       Well, we try to provide new and interesting topics in both science and spirituality and possibly advance it if we can. Spiritually we generally are open-minded, and scientifically we're open to new and interesting theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, it may depend on what you mean by initiation, formally once you've followed the fairly guidelines, which may vary somewhat but usually stay basically the same. Basically, once you're in you can possibly move up the ranks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean initiation as in expressing interest in joining the group, then you're not necessarily in. There are different reasons you may be rejected, a lot of the time we get people who are joining for the wrong reasons, we've had people contact us like we're the Mafia, and we're not.

       Well, keep in mind I'm trying to talk about the Freemasonry in general, we are technically a global organization and that means spiritual and scientific openness may vary in the area you go to.

       I think that when you ask, "Is one of the goals of FM to..." you have to realize that you're asking a semantically very light question, since there are as many "goals of Freemasonry" as there are goals of the individuals who have been a part of it over the centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, Freemasonry at its most elemental is a quest for the perfection of the soul through the application of faith, reason, brotherly love and study. Anything layered on top of that, such as definitions of what each of those terms mean (e.g. "what is perfection?" or "how should faith and reason interact?") is someone's personal interpretation. There are several very widely respected personal interpretations, but that's all they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       We refer to "The Work" quite a lot, and that work is discovering for ourselves what these things mean to us and how we can apply them. We have millions of Brothers to help us with this work, stretching back into the past, but we must do that work at least partially on our own.

       Well, they may talk to the person to get their side of the story as there may be more to it. People who commit crimes aren't always necessarily evil, there are many reasons people break the law.

       We may help them find the reason
       <em>
        why

       they committed the crime and find a way to make amends, which usually means following the law and maybe making sure they learn from their mistake(s.)

       We're not Chronarchs, we can't just control the future, that would be highly implausible. In a sense, we do have influence over the future by doing what we do, helping people, usually through charity work.

       With due respect, I don't think that anyone not in the higher ranks of the Freemasonry is a meaningless fool. I don't think we're a, "Fraternity" we're by the definition of a fraternity, so there's no need for quotes.

       We don't cover up really any information from the lower ranks of the Freemasonry. No offense intended, but this seems like kind of black and white thinking, that someone in a group is either a somebody or a nobody. In some groups, this may be partially true, but from my experiences the Freemasonry is not one of those groups.

       Yes, the Freemasonry's roots come from stonemasons, to be honest it kind of grew beyond just a group for stonemasons. To be honest, I didn't join the Freemasonry to learn how to be a stonemason.

       Not really any particular secret to life, but as I said, we're not a cult. A cult tends to tell its members to shut out all other sources of information besides the cult leader. We don't do that, we actually encourage education and introspection.

       That sounds like something that might have been associated with
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriners">
        Shriners International
       </a>
       , one of the appendant bodies associated with Freemasonry. They have a very Egyptian theme, though I think it's more a mid-19th century American sense of what is and is not Egyptian than anything else...
      </p>
      <p>
       Egyptian motifs are only a part of the core of Freemasonry tangentially because of Egypt's proximity to Jerusalem, the location of King Solomon's Temple, which is featured in the allegory and symbolism of the Fraternity and (IMHO) because of the massive contributions to geometry and construction of the ancient Egyptians.

      <p>
       My uncle is a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Freemason, a Shriner, and has a bumper sticker with the Jesters logo and motto (Mirth is King), but wouldn't give me more than the "Yup, I'm a shriner and a mason, we help the community and I get to drive those little cars in the parade".

      <p>
       As a non-Shriner Freemason, I can give you the nickle tour version: Shriners International (previously The Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine) is one of many bodies created by Freemasons over the Centuries. It was created as a less serious effort, more focused on the social and fraternal aspects of the Fraternity than the more serious side embodied by groups like the Scottish Rite or the York Rite, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time, however, they decided to start doing charity work in the community, and that has ballooned out into a major focus of the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand it, the Jesters are an invitation-only social group within the Shrine, but other than a sense that they drink a lot and enjoy telling jokes, I have no idea what the specifics are.

       While there have been incidents in various parts of the world and various times where Freemasons have done unacceptable things (which typically results in their being expelled from Freemasonry), I would be very careful about believing what comes up in Google searches for Freemasonry. You will find
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of anti-masonry drivel that usually tries to connect any Mason or Masonic activity with events that transpire around them, sometimes using real events but with some strange logical leaps and sometimes just inventing things whole-cloth or taking soundly debunked hoaxes and treating them as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do your own research, but make sure you have rock-solid sources before making too many assumptions.

       The Royal Order of the Jesters is a smaller branch of the Freemasonry, it's invitation only and there's a lot of speculation as to what it is they do, including the allegations of prostitution rings which I don't think are true beyond rumors.

       Well, a lot of the time symbolism is used to make a point about virtue, such as a beehive of a symbol of organization and teamwork.

       The Illuminati is a famous example, their name is the plural of the Latin word for, "Enlightened" and they were a secret society founded in the late 16th century. In that time, if they were open about their views which promoted ideas such as giving women rights and in general views that were against what people thought as the truth at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       They met in secret, and what people know about them is based on historians and word of mouth. That is why there is a lot of myth about them, that they're secretly controlling the world. They ended up getting destroyed by their dissenters who accused them of conspiring to destroy the Church even though they never really had the resources to do such a feat. In a sense, they may not be virtuous, they were a little pretentious in the way they presented their views.

       Not necessarily, some things are better left hidden, especially in conservative areas of the globe where the death penalty is allowed for crimes of heresy to that particular religion.

       I'd say while not all secret societies are necessarily positive, I'd say Freemasonry is one of them based on what I've seen. I may be biased though, but that's just me.

       The roots of the Freemasonry date back to a very long time ago, some say dating back as far as the Crusades. Some of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America were Freemasons, this was a fairly big risk at the time considering what they were doing was technically treason and if they failed, they'd most likely be executed and history would call them traitors to the British crown.

       You're welcome, and if you want to start, you could look into Lodges in your area and maybe get to meet a Mason.
As I've said, I don't think people know too much about the Freemasonry aside from layman speculation which can be dangerous.

        I would like to believe those of you who claim Freemasonry is positively transformative, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe any secret society is working towards noble and virtuous ends.

       Freemasonry isn't a secret society...you see people with emblems, rings, etc. advertising their membership in the fraternity. The so called secrets everyone is interested in have no bearing or impact on anyone who isn't a member.
      </p>

       I just got back from a meeting tonight and you know what we talked about? Sponsoring children's organizations, budget allocations for family events, planning our participation in the local parade and learning about Masonic history. No talks of world domination or overthrowing the government took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       In its current state, Freemasonry is largely a social and charity focused men's club.

       The typical argument is that while the Blue Lodges do appear genuinely benign, there is quite a bit of speculation about the highest ranks of Freemasonry. P2 seems sinister, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the secrets aren't dangerous - for I contend that nothing anybody does has zero impact on this world - then why not share them?
      </p>
      <p>
       You say you spoke of Masonic history. Anything you can share? I imagine if its worth discussing, at one point the fraternity was more than a social and charity focused men's club.

       The other ranks of which you speak are appendant bodies of Freemasonry, such as Shriners, York and Scottish Rites. I am not a member of these bodies so I cannot speak on their behalf. What I can say is that if we are some part of a NWO conspiracy, we're doing a really shitty job of it seeing as how we're the world's oldest fraternity. We have a joke that we're taking over the world one pancake breakfast at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the secrets, each member takes an obligation to never reveal them which is why the vast majority do not. If a man cannot keep relatively simple things secret, then that speaks greatly about his character. The secrets involve the specific wording of degree ritual and the ways in which members recognize each other...nothing more. Now why would you need to know this information? Also, please tell me how not knowing this information has a negative impact on your life. You'll find that although these secrets don't affect you at all, they are important to us members due to our obligation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything we discuss about Masonic history is readily available online. Masonic history can be anything from early teachings to historical figures. Hit up Wikipedia if you want to know more.

       But you see, by being secret about anything, you make all non-Masons automatically distrusting of you. For instance, how can I trust you when you say the secrets pertain to nothing but methods of identification when you said yourself you cannot reveal any of the secrets you learned?

       Go to this link and read "The Obligation" section for more clarification. It is against our obligation to reveal certain things, which is why we don't do it. This is keeping true to our roots from a historical standpoint and nothing negative.

       Well, we progress with the times but our goal isn't necessarily to reach transhumanism, just good moral character and helping humanity in general. There's a theory that because of the Hedonic Treadmill humanity can never reach transhumanism.

       I think that when you ask, "Is one of the goals of FM to..." you have to realize that you're asking a semantically very light question, since there are as many "goals of Freemasonry" as there are goals of the individuals who have been a part of it over the centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, Freemasonry at its most elemental is a quest for the perfection of the soul through the application of faith, reason, brotherly love and study. Anything layered on top of that, such as definitions of what each of those terms mean (e.g. "what is perfection?" or "how should faith and reason interact?") is someone's personal interpretation. There are several very widely respected personal interpretations, but that's all they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       We refer to "The Work" quite a lot, and that work is discovering for ourselves what these things mean to us and how we can apply them. We have millions of Brothers to help us with this work, stretching back into the past, but we must do that work at least partially on our own.
