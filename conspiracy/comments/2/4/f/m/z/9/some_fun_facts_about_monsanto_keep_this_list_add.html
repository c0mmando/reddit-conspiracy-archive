<li><p>GMO&#39;s have not been shown to increase production.In fact, some genetically modified produce does NOT have the ability to reproduce on its own. This forces farmers into a contract to buy seed from Monsanto year after year, effectively making the population&#39;s food supply reliant on one company rather than the Earth itself.  <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/our-failing-food-system/genetic-engineering/failure-to-yield.html">http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/our-failing-food-system/genetic-engineering/failure-to-yield.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>GMO&#39;s have had anything but a positive impact on nutrition. GM foods have been linked to cancer and many other ailments. Look into the French Rat Study. Monsanto spent millions and fought adamantly to fight the legitimacy of this study by claiming the rats were of a different breed that were prone to cancerous tumors. But, the rats that were used were the exact same breed used in Monsanto&#39;s own, self-funded study. Funny how the results differed so greatly in an independently funded study. Controversy continues to stir surrounding this study, although I implore those with any doubts to contact a professional or local university to conduct the study themselves. Make all information public. Monsanto will have a hard time denying 100’s of French Rat studies with identical results.

<li><p>Former Monsanto executives are now serving on the board of the FDA, and the Monsanto Protection Act was recently passed, essentially putting Monsanto and its activities past, present, or future ABOVE the law. This stands in stark contrast to current president Obama&#39;s campaign promise to label GMO&#39;s and country of origin immediately after taking office.

<li><p>Monsanto owns the patent for these GMO seeds. If a patented seed blows from a factory farm to an organic farm, Monsanto will sue the organic farm to effectively force them to accept these GM seeds or be put out of business. There is a fantastic documentary entitled, &quot;The Future of Food&quot; that outlines the whole dilemma. It is of note, that Monsanto sends scouts out at night to search for the &quot;patent infringement.&quot;

<li><p>Monsanto spent millions to defeat prop 37 in California, which would have forced food manufacturers to label GM ingredients. Strangely enough, public opinion polls say that 82% of Americans are in favor of knowing what is in their food. This leads many to question the legitimacy and financial influence involved in our democratic system.

<li><p>Monsanto&#39;s GMO&#39;s have been banned in Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, Madeira, New Zealand, Peru, South Australia, Russia, France, and Switzerland. 
Please do your part to extend this wise decision to the United States as well.

<li><p>Over 800 scientists from around the world recently published an open letter to end the “dangerous GMO experiment” and the patenting of bio-organisms. Paragraph 2 states “ It is becoming increasingly clear that current GM crops are neither needed nor beneficial. They are a dangerous diversion preventing the essential shift to sustainable agricultural practices that can provide food security and health around the world.” The open letter can be read at the following link with cited sources for their claims. <a href="http://www.i-sis.org.uk/list.php">http://www.i-sis.org.uk/list.php</a></p></li>
<li><p>Annston, Alabama PCB&#39;s:
Monsanto’s Anniston, Alabama plant contaminated thousands of citizens with PCB runoff the agri-giant neglected to tell them about. Men, women, and children all fell ill and suffered greatly. Monsanto really followed through on their pledge to “respect the religious, cultural, and ethical concerns of people throughout the world. The safety of our employees, the communities where we operate, our customers, consumers, and the environment will be our highest priority.“ <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0101-02.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0101-02.htm</a></p></li>
<li><p>GM crops are becoming even more ineffective as some Iowa corn rootworms have already evolved an immunity to GM corn. The largest of the root worms survive eating this corn and therefor have already evolved a population of larger, more robust, toxin-resistant specimens. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/what-are-gmo-foods-and-are-they-okay-to-eat-1524547249/1547154883">http://gizmodo.com/what-are-gmo-foods-and-are-they-okay-to-eat-1524547249/1547154883</a></p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, if Monsanto is proud of their &quot;safe and healthy&quot; products, why do they spend so much money and time fighting tooth and nail to prevent their labeling? <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/02/prop-37-donors-revealed-f_n_2065789.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/02/prop-37-donors-revealed-f_n_2065789.html</a>  Apparently, Monsanto doesn&#39;t feel that the consumer is wise enough to make their own informed decisions about what goes into their food.</p></li>

<p>Sadly, you don t need GMO to create this seed addiction, you can do this with F1 hybrid(there are not sterile but their offspring are no good). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_hybrid">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_hybrid</a><br/>
Today seed companies such as Pioneer sell hybrid.</p>

<p>This is not a one-sided thing, though. On the other side of the aisle, companies that sell &quot;organic&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, etc. foods and products (e.g. Mercola), who stand to profit from driving consumers away from GMOs, have spend millions as well in the attempt to implement mandatory labeling. Not as much as the opposition, but that just reflects the the respective market shares, not some sort of moral difference between corporations.</p>
