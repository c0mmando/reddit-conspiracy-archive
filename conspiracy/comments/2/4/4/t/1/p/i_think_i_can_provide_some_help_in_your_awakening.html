        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll first tell you a little about myself, how I came to this conclusion and what my path entailed. I am a 19 year old freshmen in college. My whole life I&#39;ve had a little bit different way of thinking which only really led to myself being a little less conformed or a little more unique -- until now. </p>

<p>Since high school and education in general are a joke I was able to have the time to research bigger ideas or conspiracies my senior year. As soon as things began clicking and I was as they say, &quot;going deeper in to the rabbit hole&quot;, I was driven to find an answer for everything or a universal truth. Something that I could tell anyone and regardless of conditioning, it wouldn&#39;t be believed, but known rather. This led me on a pretty incredible journey which was filled with many inaccurate beliefs and deviations away from the truth, usually caused when trying to answer the question, why. In a little over a year I went from, science to Christianity, and then to love. </p>

<p>A downfall of my outgoing &#39;personality&#39; led me to preach a lot of these false beliefs. If anyone was willing to listen or engage in a conversation I could talk for hours. A lot of the substance I preached was true information -- conspiracies (as we see them) and changes actually happening. So in that sense what I talked about could have been beneficial but I lost so many when trying to explain why. I gave up my reputation but it never stopped me from speaking about it and I thought, and partly was, telling the truth. </p>

<p>All of this has led me on a beautiful path where I have discovered further truths and am now attempting to apply. What I have come to understand is that this is all just a beautiful experience where we play the game of forgetting who we are in order to remember and return home. What I know is that we are all one, interacting through unique expressions of consciousness. Until we become conscious and take control, we live as robots. We let our environment and our beliefs shape our reality rather than consciousness. We blame others for our unhappiness and our failure to reach fulfillment when really we have all the power. Its all about the choices. We all know these truths deep down in our core and all we have to do is make the choice to bring them to the surface so that truth (love) is guiding our reality that we are creating together, instead of our programming. There is nobody that wants to hurt you here and since we are all one, we are constantly helping each other along and giving us opportunities to choose love and light, instead of programming. Let fear go, there is nothing to fear about this beautiful ride. Our souls are infinite. You never really die and you never really hurt. The fear you think you feel is what causes conformity. We go through life allowing other people to literally decide nearly everything for us. I would say that most people have less then 15 percent control of their lives. You can gage this by looking at your routines. Work every day? Go out to eat on Thursdays? Bar on weekends? Go to the mall once a month? Being conscious and truly awake is simply following your heart without letting fear tell you not to. </p>

<p>I came to these truths days after simply asking/praying for them. I said I was ready for further truths and I received further truths because I really believed I was ready. For some of you this will go right over your head and that&#39;s perfectly fine. You shouldn&#39;t be told anything, yet you should hear everything. Regardless of when, we will all discover these truths and return home (to love) at some point in our journey. If you are reading this and believe you are ready for further truths then truly believe it. Its waiting to be discovered and a beautiful journey precedes and follows it.</p>

<p>I discovered these final truths around the end of February and have been working on myself since. I am currently in the process of cutting all of the things out of my life that numb or limit me. Alcohol, tobacco, weed, junk food and movies that I presume would have no valuable substance. There is valuable substance in a lot of these negative things though, we just fail to see them. Again, because we are all one, this truth is everywhere. It is hidden in music, movies, interactions with different people -- everywhere. As you begin this journey back to love you will notice more and more that it is everywhere. You will start to notice incredible synchronicities in everything. When you see these synchronicities, remember that there are no coincidences. Einstein once said, &quot;Coincidences are gods way of remaining anonymous.&quot; Everything really does happen for a reason. The universe is providing you with choices daily to make and giving you the opportunity. You just have to decide to take it. </p>

<p>You have the power to change the world. It resides at the core of every being. Lets begin our awakening and journey home to love and to light. If you&#39;re reading I want you to ignite the fire within you to re-discover these truths. Judge your truth&#39;s on your own by what &#39;feels&#39; right or what resonates with you it. </p>

<p>On this journey there are two major steps. I feel that the majority of the people in this sub have taken the first step and I hope I can help you take the second. The first step is seeing the prison and knowing you are controlled in your reality. The final step is realizing that their is no prison. It is not the elitist of this world that have imprisoned you. It is yourself. </p>

<p>I hope I have been of value to some you and anybody that wants to contact me can do so. Thank you all!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear OP, someone said that it looks like you opened your &quot;third eye&quot; for the first time, I have to agree with him or her. It feels exactly like it!</p>

<p>But don&#39;t be fooled into this new age nonsense, we&#39;re not one and the same, this is not a game where you need to remember who you are, and I&#39;m pretty sure that the ones who are suffering right now are not the ones who are really responsible for their suffering.</p>

<p>Bad things are happening at this very moment, when you&#39;re sitting there believing this is all just an &quot;experience&quot;.</p>

<p>We are beings of the nature, we belong to it, just as any dog, cat, bee, monkey, whale, dolphin, ant, bacteria, virus and whatever lives. And we have a special way of interacting with our surroundings.
The synchronicity you may be experiencing happens to everyone who opens the &quot;third eye&quot;. We are still trying to figure it out, but it&#39;s not the &quot;oneness&quot; BS some are trying so hard to sell all around. This is just a new religion!</p>

<p>But good luck on your journey! Keep reading and researching and you&#39;ll find that the rabbit hole is way more filthier than that.</p>

<p>Your naivety is kinda cute, but I&#39;m sorry, far from being the truth.</p>

<p>EDIT: grammar</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of the amount of suffering you go through or your unique journey don&#39;t you think the realization that this is an experience and nobody truly wants to hurt anyone, would make the world a hell of a lot better place to live? </p>

<p>We are beings of nature that is exactly right -- but are we in harmony with nature? I think we are more similar to a cancer to nature right now. Since we are not in harmony with nature (or in one) we feel the need to fill that unfulfilling feeling with materials or substance and take more then we need. When you are taking more then you need from nature, how could you be beings of nature? Think about the Shamans and Native American tribes and their views. They were a little more in touch or in tuned with nature. </p>

<p>Thank you very much for your feedback! </p>

<p>This thought sounds a lot like the ones found in <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/sinistersites/sinister-sites-the-georgia-guidestones/">The Georgia Guidestones</a></p>

<p>We are not a cancer! There are people who are truly trying to hurt some people, if not most people. Are you even aware of what&#39;s happening in the world and what have happened in the past to a lot of innocent people? And by a lot I really mean A LOT!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP is not talking about religion, but personal spirituality.  We in the west like to turn spirituality into religion, rather our handlers do.  The elites would love to again turn an organic spiritual movement into a religion by labeling it &quot;new age&quot; and then dispelling it as more of the same.  It will not work this time.  Thank you for your service to the creator.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you are in a nightmare, isn&#39;t the only fear that you won&#39;t wake up?

    <div class="md"><p>I only realise I&#39;m in a nightmare when I wake up. And what do you mean by &quot;the end&quot;? Death? That is indeed the end, but what will you wake up to? Why should we live our life thinking about the end? For me that&#39;s the same concept of going to paradise, like in so many religions out there.</p>

<p>Truth is, we don&#39;t know if there&#39;s something after death. But why should we life our life thinking about it? Life&#39;s is happening right now, and there are so many problems all around, and there are people who are suffering, people who have no food to eat, no shelter to sleep, children who die in the hands of old psychopaths who are sexually abusing them, families who are being attacked by flying robots with bombs, lots of people who are being lied to, big corporations who are signing deals everyday to make the &quot;commoners&quot; lives more miserable while they get richer and all because they are mentally ill and control the money, our money.</p>

<p>You wanna know what&#39;s funny? Their philosophy sounds a lot like your conclusion, we are only one, no one really suffers, life is just one big illusion and after we die we&#39;ll realise it was all a big joke on us haha! That&#39;s funny isn&#39;t it? This line of thought is very convenient to whoever own the power and tell us how we should live our lives. Don&#39;t follow this path! It will prevent you from going further.</p>

<p>Now that you can see that things are not the way you were taught, there&#39;s room for you to dig deeper. Don&#39;t stop digging my friend! We all feel lost in the &quot;awakening&quot; process, we can all fall victims to this &quot;we&#39;re all one living a beautiful dream&quot; idea, because opening your third eye (also known as awakening, becoming aware, etc...) is a heartbreaking process, it really is and we all feel lost, but you&#39;re not alone and there are a lot of people going through this, just don&#39;t fall in the traps along the way. You&#39;re still new to this, but I&#39;m sure one day you&#39;ll see the bigger picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I was referring to by the end is that we will all go home, to love and light, at some point. I am well aware of the injustices going on everywhere. Those very injustices are what sparked my initial awakening in the first place. What is your explanation of why? Do you believe that the end game is simply a slave race? This would never be possible if we simply realized that we don&#39;t have to go along with the plan. What if all of this evil out there simply existed to offer you the &#39;other than&#39; choice. The people out there committing these atrocities are serving the purpose of choice, without knowing it. To them, its domination or empowerment. To us, it has to be a choice. We sit by every day and let injustices happen all around us and tell ourselves that we can do nothing about it when we absolutely can. Some of us try, by speaking out and such but I believe the step that&#39;s skipped is looking inside ourselves. We have to quit blaming.</p>

<p>Again, thank you for your input. All input can be used as a tool, you just have to know how to use it. This is a truth that I know, and I thank you very much for challenging it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all very true. I think that the difficulty in practice – and what most of the comments allude to – is that we&#39;re all faced with making choices within a socio-economic system that does everything to suppress and destroy the human values that you&#39;re describing. Regardless of one&#39;s level of enlightenment, we are born into and living out a time in our evolution wherein one cannot simply chose between what is best for us and what is necessary for survival. We&#39;re in an era of discovering our shackles; unlocking and releasing them does require a collective decision and understanding that we haven&#39;t found yet. This is why the &quot;New Age&quot; movement was co-opted and corrupted: because the truth of who we are as human beings and how the world can be requires a global understanding, and those who seek to control the globe want also to control and limit that understanding. Thus, all those here who are &quot;awake&quot; to the power and control structure are naturally suspicious of anything that resembles a &quot;global unification,&quot; yet that&#39;s what is happening and what is necessary – but without the bullshit and hedge funds.</p>

<p>What you say needs to be said, and repeated, but your idealism is rightfully called-out. We, however, hear and understand the reservations and obstacles constantly; it&#39;s refreshing to read your post and embrace the ideal for a minute. That&#39;s also what seeds our imagination as to how we might get there.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;How much are the ignorant to blame for their own ignorance?&quot; is a discussion I have often, because of the socio-economic structure that we were born into. I&#39;m twice your age and have been through all the patterning, from Christianity to public school to working for money, so much of that patterning is very well done and disguised as the &quot;greater good&quot; in very compelling ways. It&#39;s very difficult to place all the blame on the deceived without giving a nod to the effectiveness of the deceiver, with tactics perfected over generations.</p>

<p>Your idealism assumes that everyone has the ability to simply choose to wake up, to make choices based on what &quot;feels right,&quot; but many people don&#39;t feel like they can make those choices, even if they&#39;ve awakened to their manipulation and have seen through the conditioning. I&#39;m describing myself, but there are many in this dilemma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand exactly what you are saying and how I may have sounded in the post. I tried to explain it being a two step process, the first being the realization that you aren&#39;t in control. This process is a long one but the understanding can be very simple yet so many people devalue the meaning of that voice in their head that tells them what is right. For instance, you may see an old lady having trouble with groceries and fail to help but you realize later or at that moment that you should have. Its simply a merging of your true inner self with your active reality so you make that decision to help. Its a gradual change and it starts with the little things. I have to stay in college for the moment and even though I know that it does not serve my greater good, I remain here, because I am not ready to take off that limit or fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes indeed. I think the only difference of opinion we have is semantics. Don&#39;t rule out college serving your greater good. My experience of those years was very important to my being who I am now. Use what you know as a tool to approach what is expected of you in a different way. Professors love seeing/reading something different; just make sure there&#39;s footnotes to make it look legit.</p>

<p>MuffGuzzler is 19 I am twice his age and a science head for far too long and an atheist. I am not a born again or nothing like that it&#39;s like he said there is this knowing. If you cannot pick up  on it take a hard good look at yourself and fix you then there will be some conversations. The book that did it for me was &quot;Butterflies are free to fly&quot; free ebook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there are things we cannot conceptualize - the enormous size and age of our universe, and its origins. But these things are inanimate - and attributing sentience to these things is a weakness that humans are susceptible to. </p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s a glitch in our DNA or a particularly powerful meme than descends through the ages, humans are prone to believing there is a purpose to it, and that there is &quot;something&quot; in control. There isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>You cannot be a free-thinker until you overcome this very human weakness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are definitely not the only one who has come to this conclusion. There are more who find this as the ultimate truth every single day.  I am 22 and have realized this a while ago, but I also find it difficult to fully let go of my perceived reality. I am depressed, anxious, and it&#39;s what I&#39;m used to.  Knowing that there are others out there who are also coming to reach this understanding helps me tremendously.  Thank you for sharing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the reasons I am so confident in this understanding of reality in general is because I have lived so many experiences and got to observe and learn from them. During the first step when I was realizing that we have handlers who are guiding us where they want I got really depressed. Shit had me in neutral for the longest time and I began hoping for something big to happen so I could tell people &quot;see the world isn&#39;t as it seems.&quot; I was failing at this point to look within myself. The failure to look within oneself is the reason history repeats. It&#39;s like a mathematical equation of a fixed cause and a fixed affect that we can not change until this realization is made. Thanks for the response! </p>
