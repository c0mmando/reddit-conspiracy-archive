    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but where to start?  The first step must be to start with ourselves, internally.  To enter in to any debate about how to change the larger system is a distraction.  When our society&#39;s internal landscape transforms, it will be far easier to manifest the external transformation so many are seeking.  The answers must be different for everyone, but these are the questions I spend time on personally:</p>

<p>Do you watch mass-produced entertainment? Do you consume harmful food/fluoridated water? Have you unblocked your chakras?  Have you retrieved lost parts of yourself? How often do you marvel at the beauty of this world?  Do you see the creator in all as well as yourself?  Do you write down and take advice from your dreams? Are you aware of your economic slavery and how can you remove every shackle possible?  Can you say you have ever exercised true free will?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to their law system all citizens must pay taxes. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a tort law about it somewhere. It&#39;s not in statute, but it is in tort. And the judges will know about torts that you&#39;ve never heard of. So long as you accept that their laws apply to you they win. If you accept their claims that you&#39;re a citizen they simply win. They&#39;ll even make up new laws as they go along (tort) in order to make everything look good - <em>even if they agree with the person they&#39;re convicting</em>. Larken Rose is a fantastic example. Larken Rose used the 861 defense and lost. When the judge passed sentence the judge even said that he - the judge himself - believed that Larken Rose was in earnest in his belief that he didn&#39;t need to pay taxes. And yet the judge sentenced him to a year in prison. Oddly enough it was for failure to file IRS paperwork.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to halt payment of tribute [Federal Income Tax] you need to know your shit. And you need to understand that you might be the center of attention of actual psychopaths. The IRS is no joke and they will have zero pity for you when they ruin your life. They are not your friends and they are not out to help you.</p>

<p>You can halt payment of tribute any number of ways. The question is whether or not you can disallow their attacks. Many choose the wrong tactic. A prime example of this would be the whole Sovereign Citizen movement. I do not, in any way, recommend that you or anyone go that route. It has always resulted in failure and conviction. Choose, instead, a path that has fewer nettles.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m done giving the self-appointed rulers my compliance. If they want my compliance they&#39;re going to have to work for it. I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m going to learn about court procedure and rules of evidence. I&#39;m going to set up due process violations and then watch as they run over all of my mouse traps. I&#39;ll have a slam dunk appeal on multiple grounds.</p>

<p><a href="http://lysanderspooner.org/node/44">An introduction to my line of thinking</a>.</p>

<p>This is not for the tepid. Halting payment of tribute [Federal Income Tax] means you&#39;re taking on The Beast. Make no mistake - it truly is a mind game and these people play dirty. Mere rules are ancillary to them. They literally make up the rules that they enforce as they go along.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the real question:</p>

<p>&quot;What evidence is there that their laws and codes apply to me?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look at the situation in simple terms. A small number of psychopathic monkeys have taken over the jungle, and are telling all the other more passive monkeys what to do. If the passive monkeys say &quot;no&quot; the psychopathic monkeys hurt them or kill them.</p>

<p>The psychopathic monkeys write laws that benefit their own interests. They themselves are exempt from these laws. They tell the passive monkeys that they can own property, but this is a joke. Whenever the psychopathic monkeys want the land a passive monkey &quot;owns&quot; the psychopathic monkeys just steal it. They are given the power to steal the land from the passive monkeys in the laws they write to control the passive monkeys.</p>

<p>The whole system is based on the fear of punishment. Nobody would obey the psychopathic monkeys were it not for fear of what the psychopaths would do to them and their families. The passive monkeys very rarely get together and overthrow the psychopathic ruling class, but it does little good because a new class of psychopaths arises to take its place and the system perpetuates itself.</p>

<p>To get someone into a position where they can actually have a chance of changing laws means they need to go into debt studying at law school for years, Intern and kiss asses to get an actual job in the law system and then become corrupt to gain any actual influence, seeing as the whole system is full of psychopaths who only ever promote individuals below them who are willing to obey their orders regardless of their morality or ethical repercussions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a greater awareness and use of law may be very helpful.  I am not educated in law, however, as I understand it, law is based in &quot;good faith&quot;- that is to say that for example, a contract with fine print placing one of the agreeing parties in a situation guaranteed to cause them to fail is no contract at all.  Laws by their definition cannot be used to exploit and destroy people.  We seem to have a culture that doesn&#39;t view it this way, yet I believe if you investigate law, it is the case that all &quot;legal&quot; authority is derived from the intent to help people, not harm them.</p>

<p>If you can demonstrate this and convince people of the validity of this fact, so many actions that have hurt people in recent history would be termed (or recognized) as illegal, and prosecution and restitution would have to be forthcoming.  This would apply to political crimes, criminal loans, environmental offenses, and just about all of the large-scale problems that I see.</p>

<p>Once again, it becomes an issue of authority by reason vs authority by force.  I could be correct in all my suppositions here, yet if the culprits have an overwhelming amount of financial or physical force, my observations are somewhat useless.  Yet, at a certain point, if those in a position of power who have exploited and damaged a majority of people are viewed objectively as criminal by the masses, it is clear that paper money and a relatively small amount of muscle would never hold back the righteous anger of wronged and hungry people.  I would imagine that nukes and D.U.M.B.s might be a final deterrent to that sort of thing, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think, for a second, about the number of people required to make the post you just made possible. You&#39;re posting on a computer (or phone), which was the product of decades of research by thousands of people costing billions of dollars. You&#39;re connected to the internet, which required similar amounts of time and money, by different people.</p>

<p>You presumably live in a house or apartment, with indoor plumbing that sends your shit through an elaborate sewage system running miles and miles, clean water that must be filtered at a large, million dollar treatment plant, electricity that must be generated, etc. </p>

<p>All these things are products of society, of having an economy and a government. I will not deny that the current system is fucked in many ways, but there are no easy answers here.</p>

<p>No more games, time to start living. Time to start being human. </p>

<p>Much, <em>much</em> easier said than done - especially since there&#39;s much evidence showing that these systems are, in fact, <em>not</em> purely <del>man</del> human made - but it would seem you are definitely on the right track in terms of advocating for humanity to stop abiding by the manipulation of such systems.</p>

<p>A good portion of humanity doesn&#39;t even <em>know</em> they&#39;re/we&#39;re being played and manipulated in the first place.  Most aren&#39;t even aware, and a good portion that are even slightly aware are living with severe cognitive dissonance as they push away the reality of the shitty, manipulative world we currently live in and then wonder why it is we have so many psychological and emotional imbalances and problems (not to mention physical and financial imbalances and problems).</p>

<p>Until we as a human race put aside as false and inconsequential EVERY one of the artificial differences and problems that have been brainwashed in us from birth, we will not succeed in being able to come together and fight <em>together</em> against the manipulation that exists around us.  So long as we cannot come together as one to fight against this manipulation, we will continue to be controlled by it.  Simple as that.</p>
