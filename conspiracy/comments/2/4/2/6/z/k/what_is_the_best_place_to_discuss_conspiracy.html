       Hi. I was able to understand that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a great place to gather conspiracy related news. But I am looking for a quite place to discuss my own conspiracy theories. As far as I was able to understand this sub has very strict rules that limit you from expressing your thoughts freely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I was able to find these subs:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspirology">
        /r/conspirology
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/Collapse">
        /r/Collapse
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspirators">
        /r/conspirators
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiratocracy">
        /r/conspiratocracy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="/r/conspirology">
        /r/conspirology
       </a>
       sub seems to be the best I have seen. It has a lot of info on the sidebar that really helps thinking, and has no restrictive rules to freely expressing myslef. I am thinking to post there right now. Do you know any sub that is better than those I have?

       I would like to discuss the jewish involvement in the world wide conspiracy. Also I would like to call a troll or shill whoever would disturb my logoc flow of thoughts from progressing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you see the rules do not allow me to talk me freely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder why these rules were made here, if usually Reddit forums use the oringinal Reddit riles made by Aron, which are combined with the Goled Rule? Why there are additional rules here?

       You can talk about any race/ethnicity/religion you want as long as you don't use slurs; but there will likely be trolls and shills trying to derail at every step.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trolls/shills will do this in most any public subreddit which isn't private, though.  You can make a private sub, but then how do you get enough contributers?
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd have to ask the mods why there's so many rules.  Honestly, I wish the mods were more apt to ban here.  It used to be that way quite a long time ago but I think a lot of the prior mods got burnt out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A big change started occurring when, for whatever reasons, the sub started worrying about its reputation within the larger reddit community; I would say that this mindset was a negative aspect from the get-go and is why we have so many restrictions now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, these are just my opinions as I can't speak for anyone but myself and I must point out that there is far more to it than the oversimplifications I've provided.

       It's not just the rules.  This place gets overrun by r/conspiratard users.  I've read multiple discussions that get downvote brigaded after the post gets x-posted to r/conspiratard.  The r/conspiratards claim it's just another one of our "conspiracy theories", but it's blatantly obvious when comments have a number of upvotes, the thread gets x-posted, all of a sudden the regular users here get downvoted to oblivion, and comments insulting or critical of users here get upvoted to the top.  Nothing's being done to stop it either, but rules have been put into place to stop us from calling them out and defending ourselves.  I'm using this sub less and less, and I'm also looking for alternatives too.  OP, let me know what you find.

       Well, as I said, the best place I was able to find on Reddit is
       <a href="/r/conspirology">
        /r/conspirology
       </a>
       because they seem to be genuinely interested in allowing free discussions. I am not even worying about those conspiratads, I am just saying that here the rules are very weird, and do not allow free speech. On conspirology sub is the contrary, they are allowing any kind of free speech that help discussing conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also saw that
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       is not on their sidebar links, and they say do not trust nobody who is not listed there. Do you konw why?

       I am sorry, but I am afraid to post here. This sub has some really strict rules. Right now I can't think of anything I can say freely without breaking the rules. Plus
       <a href="/r/conspirology">
        /r/conspirology
       </a>
       says do not trust any sub that is not listed on their links connections. Why is that? Is this sub somehow against the freedom of speech?

       Thank you captain obvious. Of course I have checked. I also talked to the owner. And he said that I have to check the difference fo what is written on the sidebars of each subreddit.

      <p>
       He said to me that this sub is a honeypot, because they got all the info on the sidebar wrong and are banning users for no reason at all because fo their wicked rules.

       Yes, I was going to say the same thing. Both accounts exhibit the same really negative attitude - being rude to people who are trying to engage him constructively.

       That sounds like a conspiracy we could discuss.  Do you have any direct evidence that the motherfucking asshole likes sucking cock? Or even sucks cock in the first place? And that motherfucking asshole isn't female?  And does it really matter that he or she prefers that activity?

       Put it up in public, so the entire group can see it.  What good is evidence when you only send it to one participant?  And please spoiler... some of us don't want to watch certain things.  I suppose you should check with motherfucking asshole first, if the info isn't public domain.

       Take a casual glance at my recent comments. I posted a single comment in
       <a href="/r/conspirology">
        /r/conspirology
       </a>
       asking for proof that he can be trusted and that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a disinfo site. He never responded, but did ban me for it without explanation. Don't trust the place any more than you would any other site run by a fool with an agenda.

       No problem. If you post something and the spam filter catches it just let me know I'll unflag it. (I do check the spam daily though, so I should see it.)

       Never post, though, just lurk. GLP will ban you if you read it a lot without setting up an account, but you can just use a proxy. Some of the stuff posted on these sites is silly, some decent. Like here, but while I don't really trust the safety of the sites, they feel more free re:open discourse and not getting constantly brigaded by pharmabots and conspiratards.

       Sorry, but ATS and GLP are well known honeypots owned by the elite. Are you sure you are well informed for a conspiracy theorist? I have no idea bout LOP, I will check this out.

       Yeah, like I said, there are reasons why I don't post on those sites, but plenty of real people do post there and post interesting things that are worth reading that you won't see here (and fewer longwinded YouTubes posted over there, thank ye gods and more astronomical/earth stuff). LOP was spun-off from GLP, so I wouldn't trust it, either, but still, some good people posting interesting things from time to time over there.
