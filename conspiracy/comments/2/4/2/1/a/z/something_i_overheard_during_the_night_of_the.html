        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, I&#39;d like to mention that I think the <em>vast</em> majority of conspiracy theories are a bunch of hoopla, but at the same time I feel like I need to mention this somewhere; so here it is:</p>

<p>Ok, so I was listening to the Boston PD radio traffic during the early hours of April 19th, 2013. After the initial shooting of the officer on the MIT campus, the bombers stole a SUV. After ditching the ride, I distinctly remember hearing that an ID was found in the vehicle. The name, which was spelled out phonetically ...<em>twice</em>... was NOT either of the names that were released to the public. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Sunil_Tripathi">Sunil Tripathi</a> - a Brown University student that went missing on March 16, 2013. His body was found in the Providence River on April 23, 2013, and could only be conveniently identified via dental records. The authorities quickly ruled out foul play in his death.</p>

<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/82/Sunil_Tripathi.jpg">A picture of Sunil Tripathi</a> to compare to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qvaWdPs.jpg">the security footage of &#39;Dzhokha Tsarnaev&#39;</a> (on the left).</p>

<p>The only explanation I can come up with is that the government wanted to place the blame on Russians for whatever reason. Maybe to make their Olympic games seem unsafe for being in the same region that the Tsarnaevs hail from, in order to make them accept U.S. security aid? Who knows... Be my guest and guess away. The only thing I know for sure is that Sunil Tripathi&#39;s name came over the radio multiple times, but wasn&#39;t one of the bombers come day break on April 19th.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I heard Boston PD say that an ID found in the bombers&#39; vehicle on April 19, 2013 belonged to a Brown University student that went missing on March 16, 2013 and was later found dead. Coincidentally, he looked <em>very</em> similar to one of the &#39;bombers&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was listening to the police scanner as well that night, and can confirm the <strong>police were indeed calling the suspect Sunil Tripathi</strong>, at least initially. I recall that people on Twitter were saying they recognized the name as the missing Brown University student. I believe that&#39;s how Tripathi was initially connected to the Boston attack by the public. My guess is that he was the lead suspect at the time, and police were working under that assumption. I do not recall re: finding his ID, but I may have missed that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re correct, and Sunil Tripathi&#39;s name was never spoken over any police bands either. His name first appeared in a tweet made by a former classmate that said the suspect in the photo released by authorities was Sunil. The second mention was another tweet claiming Boston PD named Sunil and a &#39;Mulugeta&#39; as suspect on police scanners. The third mention was that tweet being cited in the reddit live update thread. It snowballed from there. In every recording of the heavily listened and independently recorded police scanners do not mention Sunil once, they do however mention this Mulugeta person, even spelling the name, on the scanner recordings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this. It is is extremely interesting, and the first I&#39;ve heard about the officials trying to pin the SUV hijack (and by extension, the bombings) on Tripathi.</p>

<p>It supports the hypothesis that Sunil Tripathi was the original, intended patsy of the Boston Bombings. Like the Tsarnaevs (the Plan B patsies) he was completely innocent. </p>

<p>He was likely abducted by the criminal cabal who perpetrated the Boston hoax, and kept in a safe house until it was time for him to be &quot;wheeled onstage&quot; (whether as a corpse or a drug-addled zombie like James Holmes, I don&#39;t know)</p>

<p>However, and largely due to reddit, there was huge online speculation about Sunil Tripathi being the bomber, and the cabal got nervous about their script being so obvious, and they decided to switch patsies. </p>

<p>Somebody forgot to tell the Boston PD, however, and their radio messages about finding his ID are <strong>strong evidence that the authorities were planning on stitching somebody up - somebody they knew was not guilty</strong>. </p>

<p>The reason they knew Tripathi was not guilty is because the bombing was a drill passed off as a real event, and the police were heavily involved in the drill, and the ludicrous lies that ensued from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been on here for about a year and there are only a handful of &#39;whacky&#39; theories, appearing rarely on the front page.
These include reptilians and sometimes contrails mistaken for chemtrails.
I have never heard of the Malaysian flight and the Pluto connection, probably because you have made it up to prove a point.
But this is what others believe when they hear conspiracy, they think &#39;tinfoil hats&#39; and other exaggerated stories when in FACT this sub is mainly about real worries about governments, banks, corruption and such, which is healthy doubt that is well within the limits of being absolutely possible.</p>

<p>I sometimes wish that there had been conspiracy theorists back in Nazi Germany, but seeing what others think about us, they would have ridiculed them just the same, only to eat their shorts a few years later. </p>

<p>I consider myself interested in injustice, political or scientific or for greed. I am a BSc [Hons.] graduate and completely sane. I have never made a tinfoil hat and never believed that it would do any good. All I am interested in is to find out how much we the public are taken for a ride.</p>

<p>I also believe that the same is true for the majority on here. It will NOT help describing us as loonies and exaggerate our aim with ridiculous statements such as in the above post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you, and it&#39;s people like you and the majority of others on here that make this sub worth our while. I agree, injustice is everywhere and needs to be put into light a lot more than it is. That said, there is still a decent amount of raving tinfoil hat wearers and I&#39;ve read my share of ridiculousness. 
I agree, this sub is important and one of my most frequented. The injustice in the world is ridiculous and needs to be seen by more. That said, OP never said most conspiracy theories HERE are bunk, just that most in general are in their experience. I would have to say, though many are true, I&#39;ve heard a lot of completely irrational conspiracies in my short time as well so I&#39;m wary believing everything I hear. You&#39;ve got to keep a level head and not just assume everything bad you hear is true, just like everything good you&#39;re told isn&#39;t. This isn&#39;t to say that you personally do that or that the sub in general does, nor is it to discredit the worth of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Just some truth.</p>

<p>Yeah, you wouldn&#39;t have heard anything about the Malaysian plane being on Pluto. I hyperbolically came up with that as an example of why some people don&#39;t believe the majority of conspiracy theories. The simple fact is, many people DO believe preposterous claims simply because they&#39;re claiming the government is bad. I thought <a href="/u/zebraton">/u/zebraton</a> was out of line and came back with something similarly out of line. Is that mature? Probably not. What matters is that OP tried to submit something valid and implied they&#39;re not a person to believe everything they hear and got insulted for it. I defend people who are shot down by ignorance. </p>
