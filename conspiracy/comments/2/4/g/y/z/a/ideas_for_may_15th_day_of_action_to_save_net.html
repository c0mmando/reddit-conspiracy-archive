        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello all,</p>

<p>Erik, the reddit GM, is soliciting advice on what the site can do to oppose the FCC&#39;s new anti-net neutrality rules. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/14/d-c-circuit-court-strikes-down-net-neutrality-rules/">a federal appeals court struck down</a> the FCC&#39;s proposed &quot;net neutrality&quot; rules, which would have explicitly prohibited Internet service providers (ISPs) from giving preference to or blocking certain sites or services. Since then <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/finding-best-path-forward-protect-open-internet">the FCC has created a new proposal</a> that would allow ISPs to charge companies more for faster connection speed. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23vddm/we_are_fighting_to_restore_net_neutrality_ask_us/">Here&#39;s a recent AMA about the subject with some of the experts and activists on the forefront of this fight</a>.  </p>

<p>You have probably seen <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=net+neutrality&amp;t=day">a lot of discussion about why this FCC proposal is horrible</a> around reddit and seen some talk about <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/247w3i/two_years_ago_we_got_organized_and_beat_sopa_now/">what can be done to save Net Neutrality</a>, and some of you have been asking us how you can help or what the admins might be planning. Some of the groups fighting to restore Net Neutrality including FreePress have <a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/04/25/its-time-launch-biggest-protest-fcc-has-ever-seen">called for and started planning a massive protest on May 15th</a>, the first day the FCC will begin formally taking public input. We will of course be participating loudly in May 15th day of action, and in the days leading up to it. How can we all have the biggest impact? What non-traditional ideas can we explore? How can we get more people to care? How can we get media to cover?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some suggestions floating around so far are;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Throttle all imgur links with a splashpage promoting &quot;Comcastgur&quot; with a satirical a la carte pricing table for access to certain types of images.</p>

<ul>
<li>Images promoting comcast - FREE ULTRA SUPER SERVICE</li>
<li>Images badmouthing comcast - $19.99 for the first 6 months*</li>
<li>Images featuring nudity - $109.99</li>
<li>Images of cats - $8.99</li>
<li>Animated gifs - $14.99</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>You could put up fake notices based on IP block ownership.</p>

<p>Someone coming from a Comcast IP gets a message like,</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re sorry, but it looks like your ISP, Comcast Inc.,
has not paid for premium access to reddit.com content this month.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>On May 15, let&#39;s have the trending subreddits banner replaced by a banner asking redditors to call their senators and representatives and voice support for re-classification of ISPs as common carriers.</p>

<p>I think that until ISPs have been classified as common carriers, putting the banner up one day each week or having it randomly replace the trending subreddits banner for 1/10 of users at any given time could be in order.</p>

<p>So what do you folks have to suggest?</p>
