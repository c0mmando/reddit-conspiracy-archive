       Imagine you are someone who is revealing world changing information. You put this info online but the people in power take it down and all the people who know are silenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there some way to make sure this info isn't lost due to the powers that be making it disappear off the internet
      </p>
      <p>
       Any ideas?

       You have to spread it all at once. You can't just go posting it somewhere. Mail it to 50 news agencies, post it on every site imaginable, send it to all of your contact lists and do it within a short timeframe.

       You can't trust one method of distribution.

       I hope you posted this using a vpn service or it's a bit late already and your HDD is probably downloaded already. Look up Tails, it's a Linux distro with no traceable memory footprint, encryption is invaluable too.

       Somebody else on here had the answer to that, wikileaks and cryptome are trustworthy. Bear in mind a lot of people are already doing (possibly) more serious things than you and surviving by being careful about their methods and not succombing to paranoia, I wish you all the luck in the world though.

       I'd have multiple copies and give them out to multiple people.  Publish it online.  Send it to lawyers.  Send it to Sibel Edmonds.  Friends and Family.  Whatever to protect yourself.  Don't trust wikileaks and anything else that is highlighted in the mainstream media.  Do an interview with Luke Rudkowski.  Contact James Corbett.  Etc.  Good luck.

       One problem I might face though... I am not a true whistleblower because I am just a nobody. But I feel the info is that important and world changing. But since I am nobody they may not think the info is relevant. It's something that has to be really studied to understand. Lots and lots of info to fully understand it.

       Because in our society we have been conditioned to think certain subjects are a joke. That is how they have been kept secret. So when I try to give this info to people their natural instinct is to assume I am just a mental case. But that reaction is something that has been ingeniously crafted over something like 60 years at least...
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if I was to try to tell people the tooth fairy is real. That actually might be easier to convince people of than the info I have discovered. It's not unlike how conspiracy theories and theorists have been demonized.
      </p>
      <p>
       So because of this I am worried it may just get lost in the shuffle. Also.. this requires looking into many sources such as books and long documentaries. Few people will want to go to those lengths plus they are copyrighted so disseminating all that info is very difficult.

       What kind of things are you into? Work etc. If you could help me bring this info to light in some way I could help you learn this. But I need people that can help me in some way because teaching people all this one at a time takes a long long time so then it delays getting the info to the masses.

       It's pretty tricky though... I would like to keep a low profile so people can get into this before it's discredited somehow. But by spreading the info I am announcing to the suppressors as well. But there may be no way to avoid that.

       Maybe you can provide some sort of document along with it that helps explain the significance or how to understand the material?
      </p>
      <p>
       You might also want to look into leaking it to people in your industry who will understand the impact of what you have. Then again, they may be aware of it as well and not interested in leaking.

       Yeah like some type of synopsis. I was planning on that but it's just tricky. This info is so big that if you say it people just can't comprehend it. That is really why I think it has stayed secret so long. Because people just can't conceive of it. So when you put it in writing like that.. in a synopsis people just go... "right. waste of time"

       Well in that case you should try to provide some sort of proof or strong evidence so that people don't just write it off immediately. Something tangible that people can confirm for themselves or something damning like pictures or video.

       Imagine if I was to say that I discovered who killed JFK... I don't have one piece of smoking gun physical proof... but if you were to look through a bunch of evidence that was factual you could piece together what actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this info is scientific.... but the problem is I am not a scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
       So someone would probably say - then how do you know you are right - in my case when I made all these discoveries the proof was all over that the ideas I had were right. I mean it was so overwhelming it's unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the problem is to really understand it you have to go through all the info.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I am decades ahead of the rest of society... that's why I wonder if its possible for people to understand this.  I had something that allowed me to see it where others couldn't though. Something happened to a family member of mine who I trust completely.

       What are your interests? Line of work hobbies etc. If you are someone who can help me get this info out to the masses somehow then I could go through the time necessary to take you through all this info. But it takes a LONG time.

       So people that could help would be someone with documentary making experience or video editing or marketing - to help with getting publicity etc. Or maybe a writer.. something like that.

       Do your utmost to keep your anonymity, but realise that some people you will confide in will not be trustworthy (cf. Bradley Manning) and could turn you in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure you divest yourself of everything you know to multiple third parties, and do what Snowden and Assange are reputed to have done - create a "doomsday cache" - to be publicly released in the event of anything untoward happening to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, a "would-be whistleblower" is much more at risk of being taken out, than someone who has already spilled the beans. Do not discuss your plans, and certainly do not threaten/blackmail anyone - to do so is to put your life in serious danger. If you think your anonymity is compromised, you will be safer going public as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: If you want to post anything "substantive"  on reddit, use a proxy (to hide you IP) and create a throwaway account.

       My understanding is that encrypted files have been posted on the internet by Assange and these have been downloaded thousands of times by people all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something suspicious happens to Assange, then the encryption key is publicly released (perhaps by his lawyer, or somebody he trusts) to allow the files to be read.

       You have to put to pen to paper and write a synopsis of your theory. It seems to me that you are procrastinating, and I think it's probably because you are worried that your ideas are going to be difficult to put on paper. But unless you do this, you will stuck in your current predicament for ever.

       Well you see I have tried to get help from people. But as I said it takes a long long time to fully learn all this. It took me years but I went through many dead ends and a lot of disinfo and misinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have tried teaching a few different people along the way. Some people get caught up in the disinfo as well so they can never see the truth. This is by design though.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now I am feeling like I should just release the info the best I can. Like right now for example I would like to make a website but I have things preventing me from doing this. Everything takes so much time to learn... it's all about time. Which is why I knew I needed help. Surviving in society right now is a full time job as it is.... let alone trying to navigate the issues I am on top of it all.

       You need to prioritise - so don't worry about the website just yet, that's like designing the cover of your novel before you've written it. You need to concentrate on the thesis which is going to be the content of your website. So, stop posting threads to reddit and knuckle down to it!

       See.. the problem is that you cannot understand the situation I am in without being in it. If I knuckle down and write this the way it needs to be written it would take me years. That would be working full time. I have already worked on this for over 4 years full time with no pay. If I did this part time it would probably never get done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought I could get some help but that is what I described about this being too unbelievable for people to even consider taking seriously. Everyone has been made hyper skeptical to the point they don't trust anyone who isn't in a position of authority. I have zero authority so people won't respect what i say at all.

       I have tried to explain this before...  but the only way you could completely prove elements of my discoveries is to get people to spend money to test them.
      </p>
      <p>
       My doubt isn't in my discoveries. It's in my ability to explain how I discovered them. I am a person who is GREAT at researching things and taking in information but I am terrible at conveying it to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take that issue and then apply it to one of the most complex and difficult things to explain imaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the only thing I am good at is research. So to get this info out I need help. But finding someone to help is impossible because of the stigmas attached to these subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you think about it it makes sense. Because all this info is out there. Others should have discovered this. The reason they haven't is because of those stigmas. Because everything in our society is completely controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they use media/information control as a method to prevent getting this info out properly.. as well as many other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are amny other issues with this as well.. things that have to be dealt with WHEN I release this info. too.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example what if I release the info and there is little interest because people think it sounds nuts. But some people see it and take the info and use it for their own purpose to get money. Then it may even look like I am copying them before I can get my info heard. And they may even change the info. The government themselves could and will probably do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's issues like this that make this so impossible to deal with.

       Are people really going to make money from this? And if so, is that a bad thing? I don't think Sir Tim Berners-Lee has any regrets about others making money from his invention of html/http/www - his place in history is assured.

       If they made money from it legitimately it wouldn't be a problem. But look how many try to make money illegitimately in the conspiracy community.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people do this with the info I am revealing then it damages my ability to get the info out even more. Especially if they are better or more able to get attention than I am. Then I will be drowned out and never be taken seriously.

       This is why If eel I only really have one shot to do this publicly. It's also why getting help is so difficult.

       Several redditors have given you constructive advice on this thread (and other similar ones that you have started). It seems to me that you have a sort of psychological block which is preventing you from taking action, and there is a real possibility that you will never take action unless you can overcome this.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, what you should NOT do is start another thread about this on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       - unless you can demonstrate that you have made some tangible progress.

       But see, you are jumping to conclusions. You don't know the situation I am in. Only I do. So while you think "redditors have given me constructive advice" you don't know all the issues I have with this situation.

       These things, simultaneously, and as widely and compellingly as possible (where applicable):
      </p>
      <p>
       id directly post online. I'd also send in the "letters to the editor" forums, and also package the core neatlyas a press release and send to busy reporters near deadline time. (by widely k mean worldwide. Both translated and not would go to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       of course safe deposit boxes widely, time capsule, and every web storage possible. Hard drives, mine and anyone who said yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       then, disguised. One, as a game (apps on all platforms, and online too), as a scene by a guide to future history by a character I made in sl, as a computer virus (that does not damage, but randomly displays the in for one paragraph daily, once daily), in the fine print for anything I made, as a YouTube rant, a support thread, an IRC chat (with myself if need be), private notes on all forums, social nets, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would submit it as poetry, as contest entries, as fan mail to people. I'd make.a quiz AP and the questions would have the info as answers. I'd recite the core out loud with parrots present, id hire a private detective and five him the info as facts of why I wanted his services. I'd set it up to lost in the future at every possible site, id send jt with no address thru the mails so it would languish. I'd do the I fo as a prepared speech for toastmasters, write it as a play and send it to producers, do an concept album, recorded, by as many names as would do it, and release the album on soundcloud, last fm, etc. I'd send it to the dumbest scandle blogs as an "expose" of their pet hate. I'd submit it as testimony at any forum I could (courthouse, a fake lawsuit;). I'd confess it, id request it from the DOJ under freedom of I fo act (as if it were controversial). I'd prepare it as a damning secret of various candidates for office (counting on human laziness to skim and share, with keywords to hook them in bold...id paint it on my house walls, put jt on a series of mugs and send as gifts, make it a recording to be read jf jm dead as "here's what the heirs get." id submit jt thru lobbyists, congress people, etc, in tedioz detail tbouar would go u read, id self public and pay to get it on record at the library of congress, ix bury it widely near shorelines everywhere, and plant false rumors of treasure. I'd sell it for ten bucks as "the secret to (name the desire). I'd make it the text of a subliminal app, id male it the "code" for se supposed open source app and put it on github, id use it as a patent application, id have seone sue me for stealing it ..
      </p>
      <p>
       basically id get jt on record, on devices, on tv, and sk on everywhere I possibly could. I'd try too  get several groups of people hunting it, jd have It formally residing az government info (and try to make them guard ir without really reading it) and so on. Anywhere I could, any country, form, venue, and language. I'd lay some savants to memorize it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       again, simultaneous publication where its possible, and ongoing as I found new ways. I would be very vocal about many of the places it was, but the ones hard.to guess would never be mentioned. Ways to find those if needed would be in many places, disguised as something valuable of a "bait" nature and also as itself, kept by people of principle (obscure a d famous)

       Keep in mind though the info is from many lengthy sources. Several books, documentaries webpages etc. This is copyrighted info. And it's not just all the sources. The different sources have some of the info but not all. To document all this info in one source would take years.

       Sure. So ongoing...but that's me. I tend to do things sometimes more completely than need be. I don't think tho it would take years to scan the info ito a machine, then generate portions as wanted, or share them, or send to storage? I didn't of course give details as I assume people can (if they wanted) think on the various thongs and how using a particular venue would a actually work (or if).  If it were a simply absurd number of hardcopy pages, id do whatever someone would do in any type of situation that was foe collecting, formatting, storing, and publishing something does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't that what done by court reporters during lengthy trials? Publishers of encyclopedias and mamoth fanasy series? People making games and movies also answered this as if I had all the money and access in the world. Why? To put forth as many ideas as possible. I guess I felt that was what was being sought, a way or ways to do it. O think of publishing because I was an editor, coding because my son codes, courtrooms because litigation and court drams abound, politicians and spiteful types who blog secrets, and so on because..

       I'm a longtime fan of activism,assange, occupy (lived at, got arrested at, etc) but I randomly saw the question and simply posted what arose. I generally take the view )until presented with details) that a question like "what would you do?" and  "how do people..
" and "has anyone ever/does anyone else?" and so on is wants to hear a range of options or experiences, to try pr to feel reassured or both.

       Btw, I'm not getting how copyrighted material from many sources -- public sources (not cc, just known by say, readers and proofers and so on), audiences, etc could be a secret that could be totally removed from public awareness. I didn't even catch that aspect when 
. It seems that its already secure from loss of public awareness (except thru apathy and shifting public attention ). Or it would take years itself to obliterate (tho steps in that direction carry the risk of making it a hot topic...)

       That's true but keep in mind one way for them to prevent the info from spreading would be to spread disinfo. So let's say I put out a kind of bibliography. Then the disinfo agents could put out multiple bibliographies and say that each different one was the correct one and then people would have no way of knowing which was real. Then we are back in the same boat as before - swamped with disinfo.

       Several redditors have given you constructive advice on this thread (and other similar ones that you have started). It seems to me that you have a sort of psychological block which is preventing you from taking action, and there is a real possibility that you will never take action unless you can overcome this.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, what you should NOT do is start another thread about this on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       - unless you can demonstrate that you have made some tangible progress.

       But see, you are jumping to conclusions. You don't know the situation I am in. Only I do. So while you think "redditors have given me constructive advice" you don't know all the issues I have with this situation.

       This is the problem when people make assumptions about things that they don't understand.
