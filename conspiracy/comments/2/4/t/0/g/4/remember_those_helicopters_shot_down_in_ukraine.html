       I can't post a link right now. I want you to read up on this and do some research on your own. This info hasn't made it to the MSM yet.

       I heard about it from professionals in the industry at a colleague's reunion this weekend: More than a dozen American private security experts and operators were killed in these surface to air attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       These colleagues I heard from are decorated professionals and contractors in the global security business. Please provide links in the comments below to reputable sources so we can spread this story. Thank you!

       It's funny because the resistance was originally in the West, and they were anti-Russian. Now we are seeing pro-Russian protestors...  with SAMs...

       Agreed, this is a full-scale rebellion and rejection of the coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ukraine used to be a military of conscripts up until October 2013 (aside the recent reinstatement), so many civilians are trained. That and they know where to ransack for RPGs and the like. Many of their weapons have been purchased off 'corrupt' soldiers or seized from government buildings. Not to mention you have all the defectors of the Ukrainian military who have joined the self-defense forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia does not need to meddle that much, if at all. If they are going to, it's going to be a complete intervention and not simply a proxy like the West is trying to do.

       above all else who benefits here? russia? yeah their econ is doing great and all these sanctions for what? an economically broke country on the verge of civil war? yeah that sure has a lot to offer to russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       on the flip side what does the USA stand to gain
- hurt euro economy (slowing down a competitor) 
- hurt russia (one of the few able to actually resist the USA global domintion)
- leave a flaming bag of dog shit on russias doorstep in the form of a messy civil war
- steal all ukraines gold, already done
- make russia either look crazy by forcing them to take over to stop the violence on their borders, or weak for not crushing it quickly
- takes the focus off their imploding economy
- create more war profiteering via the scare tactics boosting their arms export sector
      </p>
      <p>
       the list just keeps going, all russia would gain from annexing all of ukraine is some slightly better position on the euro plateau if a wwIII ground war happens and an epic fuck ton of debt, ukraine simply isn't worth it to russia to make up for the shit storm its created for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       on the flip side America has dumped 5 billion in to "democracy training" so they have an investment they want to have some sort of return

       They made that clear in South Ossetia, which was really just an NWO test to see what they'd do. This time I think NWO is counting on it; they want it to be proxy on their part (with covert and material aid), but direct on Russia's. Seems a bit complicated to pull off though; I think they want Syria so bad it's making them reckless and stupid.

       I agree it seems the West is trying to provoke Russia to intervene and then label them imperials.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I don't think the international community can really fault Russia for intervening eventually. How many people have to be killed by the Ukrainian military before it becomes a legitimate humanitarian concern? Meanwhile, the US and EU are saying, "go Ukraine! Kill more and more!" while Russia is trying to solve it peacefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the Cold War feelings and anti-Putin propaganda being spun, the West is not looking like the saint here at all. Even the old timers don't trust the US government anymore, no one does. People may not like Russians but when it comes to people being killed, people like even that less.

       Seems like
       <em>
        a coalition of the willing
       </em>
       has fallen by the wayside, and the US is nakedly grabbing it's 60% share of NATO and attempting to drag the rest along to someplace they'd rather not go. Sane leadership would take all those European no votes on Russian sanctions down at the UN as a sign; I think maybe
       <em>
        somebody
       </em>
       felt emasculated by Putin's master stroke during the Syrian chemical weapons thing, and that has to be put right before they leave office. We have an angry basketball player trying to play chess with nuclear weapons here, and I don't see how that can end well.

       well shutting Russia out of it's Crimean naval base would have isolated Syria and even iran almost completely as that is where all the Russian aid comes from, and probably why they were so quick to grab it losing that base would shut Russia out of the Mediterranean and middle east almost completely, which imho is exactly why the USA have such a vested interest in the coup they financed

       people seem to forget ukraine was part of the soviet union for a long time, most of these guys are former soviet military ffs, look at the NYT article they went digging and that is what they came up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       the west is pretty goddamn ignorant of anything beyond their own borders, they can be former spetznaz and still not be russians and have lived in ukraine their whole lives.

      <p>
       they checked the serial numbers on their weapons ffs nothing was newer than mid 90's, jesus fuck people use AK-47's to hunt over there, the west just makes it self look like ignorant fucks when they make these claims

       You say they were CIA first and then that they were "private security"? Either way, the world is a slightly better place without them. Ukraine is not a situation where the US can prevail militarily, and they shouldn't be fucking around trying to start another conflict.

       The US administration is trying hard to start a new conflict. They have been itching to bomb Syria as a stepping-stone to their ultimate target, Iran. But since this hasn't gone too well, they are trying to light a tinderbox in Ukraine. Any conflict is a good conflict as far as the US war machine is concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I haven't thought this out, perhaps you could explain why you think carrying out special ops on Russia's border is a good idea?

       i saw some stories saying the offensive started when they captured 20 blackwater (or what ever name they had to change it to due to war crimes this week) and disappeared them.

       it fits with the CIA director showing up and the sudden escalation of force too. there were rumors all along that they were there being paid by kiev

       To clarify: The information I was provided indicates the operators killed in these helicopters - and one lone survivor - are all highly trained CIA agents that have been leaked out into one or more security firms, like
       <a href="http://www.greystone-ltd.com/">
        Greystone
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I intended to specify that these operators were all American, highly trained and highly motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the future I will certainly be more specific - it's sort of a given in our business to assume that an FBI agent or CIA agent never really "retires". They move up the echelon. And the private global security business is, well, booming...

       above all else who benefits here? russia? yeah their econ is doing great and all these sanctions for what? an economically broke country on the verge of civil war? yeah that sure has a lot to offer to russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       on the flip side what does the USA stand to gain
- hurt euro economy (slowing down a competitor) 
- hurt russia (one of the few able to actually resist the USA global domintion)
- leave a flaming bag of dog shit on russias doorstep in the form of a messy civil war
- steal all ukraines gold, already done
- make russia either look crazy by forcing them to take over to stop the violence on their borders, or weak for not crushing it quickly
- takes the focus off their imploding economy
- create more war profiteering via the scare tactics boosting their arms export sector
      </p>
      <p>
       the list just keeps going, all russia would gain from annexing all of ukraine is some slightly better position on the euro plateau if a wwIII ground war happens and an epic fuck ton of debt, ukraine simply isn't worth it to russia to make up for the shit storm its created for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       on the flip side America has dumped 5 billion in to "democracy training" so they have an investment they want to have some sort of return
