       , to some subreddits that the news applies to. Then the user
       <strong>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/adamwho">
         /user/adamwho

       pops up and posts a comment with "spam, spam, spam" and linked to my posts.

       I check his history, and WOW! Here is a sampling:

      <blockquote>

        There is are examples of GM seeds being given away for free in developing countries. The Gates foundation does this work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sorry but labels such as 'organic' 'halah', 'kosher', 'non-GMO' are not science based and are little more than "lifestyle" labels. The legal issues are the interstate commerce clause. Basically, a state cannot regulate commerce between other states, which is what these individual state anti-GMO labeling laws do. Another is the first amendment which relates to if the government can force companies to label products without a compelling scientific reason.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many reasons why labeling is a bad idea:

       Thanks for turning me onto that sub.  I love it!  It's such a peaceful place with mellow people.  Then I came across his post (sure enough, in a thread with "gmo" in the title - he obviously found it from searching "gmo").  He sticks out like an undercover cop at a Grateful Dead show, posting such aggressive, hate-filled nonsense.

       Well, I don't trust anyone who calls themselves a sceptic in the first place.
       <em>
        Real
       </em>
       scepticism is the open-mindedness to recognize the possibility of any assumed truth being revised in the face of new evidence. Anyone with that mindset would just call themselves "rational", though. If you actually wear the label of a sceptic, it means that you're taking pride in being someone that refuses to believe something unless forced to, and really, what kind of people take pride in being stubborn and pig-headed? Should tell you all you need to know.

       To be fair, liking GMO's doesn't make you a shill or a fanboy. I studied biology/chemistry pretty extensively in college and the fact that a food was genetically modified doesn't make it dangerous. I just believe that studies need to be done to prove it's safety. Some have been done, some people discount them as corporate studies. I'm not sure what it will take to get one side to take the other seriously. What study, for or against, is enough?

       Agreed.  But we can't assume it's inherently safe either.

       I think I speak for the majority when I say that what will get me to take the pro-GMO camp seriously is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Allow independent studies to be done on GMO products to determine safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Prevent ex-Monsanto execs from entering the public policy sector (EPA and FDA primarily).  I would actually like to see this across ALL major governmental organizations.  I'm looking at you Big Pharma...
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Stop the heavy lobbying, campaign contributions, and PR carnivals.  Just be open and honest with your consumer.

       I agree with every single one of your points. Especially keeping Monsanto execs from entering public policy sectors. But I believe we need to expand that and make the laws so that NOBODY who has a stake in the private sector can work in a public sector position that is supposed to be a watch dog for said private sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only point was that a food being genetically modified does not inherently make it unsafe. But I do believe that independent studies need to be done to prove this. As I also said, studies have been done. But this seems to be such a polarizing issue that it's very hard to get either side to take each others studies seriously.

       While logical, this is a silly absolutist point of view.  It is the logical equivalent of asserting that until we wake up tomorrow, we MUST assume the world will explode.  It's logical, but neither rational nor practical.

       This is a classic nonsequitur and meaningful only for handwringers.  We can't assume anything.  We can't assume it's even a little bit safe.  We can't assume it's inherently unsafe.  We can't assume it's even a little bit unsafe.

       I agree completely with this.  But I still choose to form my own opinion in the mean time until significant evidence is produced that makes me confident in believing that they are safe or unsafe.  Given the questionable and highly suspect behavior of Monsanto &amp; friends and how their business practices are morally corrupt from my view, I'm choosing to deem these products as unsafe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm genuinely curious about the handwringing part though.  To me, it seems like you're the one doing the handwringing since by your logic you choose to stay perfectly balanced on the fence regarding this issue, thereby "wringing your hands" of getting involved at all.  Can you please elaborate?

       Well, crap.  Now you're being all reasonable and nice and I like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding handwringing, mine has little to do with yours. As such, I'm not sure of the relevance of whether I'm on the fence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not actually on the fence.  I've chosen a position, but I take both sides seriously.  Your three criteria listed above indicate their consideration is prerequisite to even seriously considering a view in opposition to your own.  I guess that's my point - why not take others' points seriously, even if you disagree?  Of course, a sense of moderation is required.  I don't take Bronies seriously, but its cause they're weirdos, not because of any philosophical or scientific or factual disagreement I have with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro-GMO's aren't idiots.  Anti-GMO's aren't idiots.  There is genuine disagreement.  Given the tremendous potential of GMO's, why not engage seriously in a rational consideration of the points being made by others without preconditions?  Addressing your three criteria:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is a very conclusory and charged element.  Pro-GMO's would argue existing studies are enough.  Why would they argue that?  There must be some reason.  Is it really simply because they are shills?  Maybe, but the alternative explanations for their argument are worth serious consideration in the context of their tremendous potential.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is a valid policy point, but says nothing substantively regarding the efficacy and validity of GMO's and their potential for good.  The tremendous utility for mankind of GMO's shouldn't be dismissed simply because the people who invented (discovered?) and managed them may be douchenozzles.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Again, this speaks to a  infrastructure that expands beyond consideration of GMO's and their benefits.  It expands beyond Monsanto &amp; friends, frankly, and into more broad considerations of capitalism, economics, and social contracts between government, individuals, and any subset thereof (including corporations).  Why not take GMO's seriously and consider the marketing strategy later, or at least concurrently?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay.  Fair enough.  But, I would caution against throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  GMO's have tremendous potential to ease significant suffering at potentially very little cost.  Just because Monsanto sucks doesn't mean GMO's do.

       The three criteria I posted were in response to the question of what will it take to get one side to take the other side seriously.  Since I identify with the anti- side, I listed the three main issues I have with not taking the Pro- side seriously.  In no way are they meant to be considered a “prerequisite to even seriously considering a view in opposition to your own.”  I keep an open mind and like to look at all the facts before choosing a side on such a hot-button issue.  I studied the science behind GMOs while in college and worked for several years in a lab on a project that involved using various methods to insert transgenes into an organism’s genome.  I fully understand the science and the molecular bio techniques that are used in the published literature.  After years of education and reading the literature, I have personally decided that I don’t think they’re safe.  The criteria I laid out must be met for me
       <em>
        to take the other side seriously
       </em>
       .  They are not criteria that must be met to consider another person’s opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, when I refer to the “other side,” it’s primarily Monsanto and the pro-GMOers on Reddit.  These individuals tend to be extremely close-minded and get very emotional, to the point that they stop talking about facts and resort to belittling me with smearing and swearing.  When I talk to my family and friends who are pro-GMO, it’s a different story.  They believed they were safe because the media tells them so.  They don’t dig into, much less understand, the science and tend to follow the status quo when forming their beliefs.  I used to get involved in heavy debates on this site with pro-GMOs.  I’ve had lengthy discussions regarding the science of specific papers they cited and I’ve indicated how the studies were flawed.  In 95% (maybe 100%, can't recall) of these discussions, the papers that were cited that supposedly defended the safety of GMOs were either published by Monsanto researchers, or received their funding from Monsanto.  That is a blatant conflict of interest and I don’t even read the papers without first looking at the authors and their organizational ties, and then the stated conflict of interest and appreciations at the end.  Now to address your points:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pro-GMOs typically argue that the current body of research is sufficient because they don’t recognize the conflict of interest I previously stated.  For every seemingly independent paper published (and there are few), the final conclusion is typically “more research needs to be done in this area.”  A few others have declared they’re perfectly safe.  And just as many have declared they’re unsafe.  What complicates all of this is the level of infiltration of ex-Monsanto researchers into the editorial staff of academic journals.  Monsanto typically publishes their research in
         <em>
          Food and Chemical Toxicology
         </em>
         .  A quick background check of their staff indicates that their editorial board has several ex-Monsanto scientists on it.  Even the prestigious journal
         <em>
          Nature Biotechnology
         </em>
         which was widely held in high esteem was found to be corrupt and fast-tracking Monsanto research for publication without peer review.  I’ve cited these facts before and am honestly too lazy to do it now.  If you’re curious and interested, I recommend you look into this.  Furthermore, the last time I checked, Monsanto does not approve of, or distribute their seeds for independent researchers to test the safety of consuming their fruit.  When research is published that indicates their products are unsafe, Monsanto quickly smears their methods and denigrates their character.  Results of any study, in any field of research, must be reproducible to be taken seriously.  Period.  That’s the foundation our scientific advancements are built upon.  If Monsanto makes it so that this is impossible, how then are we to decide if their findings are in fact true?  And for the record, I’m 99% sure I’ve never used the word “shill” on this site and I’m 100% sure I’ve never called anyone on this site a “shill.”  While I do believe they are among us, there’s really no way to be completely certain, and as soon as that word is thrown out, no one takes you seriously anymore (see below in this thread).

        <p>
         Again, the intent of my list was to describe why I don’t take the other side seriously.  This list has nothing to do with the potential benefits GMOs could provide mankind.  DestroyTheShills didn’t ask for a pros and cons list.  He asked “what will it take for either side to be taken seriously?”  If Monsanto wants me to take them seriously, they need to demonstrate that they’re willing to conduct business open and honestly.  This applies to the myriad other companies that I choose not to support with my insignificant purchasing power.  If anti-GMOs on Reddit want me to take them seriously, they need to focus on the discussion and not dance around the points I raise or insult me.  This is what you appeared to be doing with your post 20 hours ago.

       <li>
        <p>
         See point 2 above.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Based on the facts I outlined in point 1 above, until I see a decent body of evidence conducted by independent researchers indicating that GMOs are safe, and my peers (other scientists) are in general agreement with the validity of this body of knowledge, I’m choosing to deem GMOs as unsafe.  I will
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       have a deep-rooted distrust in Monsanto until they change their business practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that GMOs have tremendous potential to solve world hunger issues.  I also believe that is a solution to the symptom, not the problem, much like virtually every prescription drug on the market.  The problem is that the population of the planet is such that the traditional methods of agriculture are no longer sustainable.  We need to pursue other avenues to address this problem instead of trying to figure out how to alter the genes of a plant to increase yield and reduce “time on the vine.”

       No. Do your own research. Like I said,  I'm sick and tired of having this debate. If you're actually curious and not just trying to start an argument (as many of your posts seem to suggest), you can check my comment history. There's plenty there if you go 4-6 months back.

       Pesticides like glyphosate are absorbed by the plant and can remain in the plant for quite a while. In the case of Roundup, any danger is likely from the inert ingredients rather than glyphosate itself. Of course, those aren't specified and testing them for side-effects is not mandated.

       Seralini has published a few studies, but he's as big a shill as the pro-GMO forces, so you you have to take everything he says with a few tons of salt, as well.

       This level of sarcasm implies experienced knowledge with these subjects and the languaged used within. Its funny to see the parallels of your post and a "shill" post, meta meta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets just get down to basics. Shilling is an act of limiting discussion or creating an environment where the original subject cannot sustain conversation. You do not have to be doing this intentionally to "shill" nor do you have to be paid.

       I find that people who are against something without being a shill normally give reasons why. Because if they really believe something, they obviously need to convince others.
Shills or trolls will just come up with insults and no substantial evidence. Therefore I don't find this quite as amusing as you do, and I am glad it is being pointed out.
Only good things can come of it: either the person is young and dumb and will learn to give decent arguments, or they are shills and will know that we are watching them.

       The bot posts this to the JIDF warning board, and you're here with them within minutes.  No, that sounds perfectly reasonable.  Given both of your posting histories.

       Tell me how you BOTH found this thread, then posted to it at nearly the exact same time?   Simply coincidence?  Not from the link that was autoposted to conspiritard?  Really?

       Proof is quite easy to offer.  But when you come with all of your loser buddies from the JIDF rally board, your credibility is less than zero.

       If I worked for this JIDF thing you keep speaking of wouldn't that mean I would get a paycheck or something?  I don't for your information.  You're obviously an egotistical paranoid schizophrenic consider the username and you're ability to call everyone and everything a shill.

       I came here agreeing shills are real but to also to make the point that a few or more of the conspiracy crowd are becoming hypersensitive and throwing the shill word around like it's going out of style.  All I hear half the time I come here is "shills are vote brigading", "shills are downvoting me wah" and just like I figured some armchair warrior comes in and says I'm someone else? and that I'm a shill? I'll agree I'm still pretty new to Reddit but damn I'm not stupid.  I thought there were some adults left here.

       adamwho and Mr. Vargr are the same person, and has been widely known to provide a bullshit statement and ten back it up with his alternate account.  He is pro Govt lies (as in every conspiracy theory went exactly as the govt said), pro-GMO/Monsanto/poison, a Zionist firster(fistee), and doesn't deserve a second of your time.

       When the majority of someones main comments are to defend GMO's and the likes of Monsanto while using the word "conspiracy" to dismiss an argument, then you have to question their intentions. To me, he/she is a corporate shill, you can call him/her something else if you like.

       You're absolutely correct.  However...when that single topic is the one and only facet they present on Reddit, it's quite easy to determine if they are real or are a construct.  Many in this thread alone fit both your criteria and my criteria, identifying their shill likelihood.

       Your GMO understanding is so incorrect, it's not worth debating.  Helping with world hunger?  Increased yields.  Labeling as somehow optional, even though exactly ZERO long term independent human health studies have been performed on GMO.  And until they are, ALL GMO must be considered unfit for human consumption.

       what is with you guys calling people shills?  surely you understand that some people disagree with you... even if you believe them to be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       do you really think that there are corporate shills roaming reddit commenting on posts?  I suppose its possible, but I don't really see the point.  not like the reddit community is a powerful voting block or has a lobby or anything.  It seems more likely that this person happens to have the peculiar view that food labeling is harmful to capitalism... or perhaps simply worthless due to the misrepresentation inherent in food labels.
      </p>
      <p>
       personally I think Monsanto is one of the most evil companies existing, and people have a right to honest food labeling.... though I am not against GMO food in all circumstances (especially in developing countries) it shouldn't be hidden.  Labeling, if nothing else, allows those growing food naturally (expensively) to market their food at a higher cost to offset the cost of production.

       The internet is an enormous problem for industries and organizations with image problems, just look at the Sterling guy who is being forced to give up his multimillion dollar NBA team because he said something racist and the whole internet went into an outrage.  Remember when the US congress did a 180 on SOPA in a mater of a few days because of massive outcry that was organized exclusively through Reddit, Google, and other popular sites?  Remember how the Arab Spring was organized through chat applications, forums, and all kinds of social media?  Remember the recent #MyNYPD PR disaster for NYPD?  The internet is the place where unhappy regular people discuss the ways they are unhappy with other unhappy people and this is extremely dangerous to governments and industries that make a living off of shitting on regular people.

       In addition to being a huge potential problem, open communication on the internet is also the most powerful marketing tool in the world.  People trust what they perceive to be legitimate personal endorsements of products more than they trust overt advertisements (this is somewhat obvious, but there have also been several studies confirming this, I don't want to look them up right now but it should be easy to find).  Is it better to spend 8 million dollars on an ad campaign that may completely flop or even damage your company depending on how it's received by the public, or to pay a handful of minimum wage workers to run thousands of social media accounts spreading the idea that your product is great?

       Astroturfing is cheap effective marketing for consumer industries and an
       <em>
        essential
       </em>
       PR tactic for any large organizations for whom public image is at all important.

       good points... I guess it does make sense when you boil it down, thanks.

       I wonder if there are any former internet shills that have come forward.  surely there are tons of people that no longer do that for a living and feel shifty about essentially trying to convince people against their own interests.  there must be a few.

       I worry about those too which is why I thoroughly wash all food I buy. But that's completely separate from GMO unless I'm mistaken?

       Agreed.  But we can't assume it's inherently safe either.

       I think I speak for the majority when I say that what will get me to take the pro-GMO camp seriously is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Allow independent studies to be done on GMO products to determine safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Prevent ex-Monsanto execs from entering the public policy sector (EPA and FDA primarily).  I would actually like to see this across ALL major governmental organizations.  I'm looking at you Big Pharma...
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Stop the heavy lobbying, campaign contributions, and PR carnivals.  Just be open and honest with your consumer.

       Yes, we have two (very likely just the same person supporting themselves) individuals who would rather disregard even recent history and proof, and blame it on accidental behavior.  Never evil, horrid actions.  Just dumb luck.

       It's not l Ile Reddit is more influential than every television station.  Its not like the largest single location for Reddit use is a goddamn air force base.  Ts not like hundreds of millions.in o public finds have been spent controlling the discourse online.  And not like YOUR actions and methods are so rudimentary and simple to spot, right?
      </p>

       We see it time and time again.  If you think you're going to get away without being called out, you've got another thing coming, fool.  You're losing the battle, and have certainly lost the war.
