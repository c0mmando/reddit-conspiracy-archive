      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The QEG is a crisp, clean, and modern device based on Tesla’s public domain design and built with incredible engineering precision (for example it has over 300 precision cut steel plates each at 18 ½ 1,000ths of an inch thick). The QEG is portable, the size of an average home generator, can easily hook up to your existing electrical system, and weighs approximately 120 pounds. The QEG can power your entire home, several of them can power anything from a skyscraper to a cruise ship, and you will never have to pay an electric bill ever again.
       </p>
       <p>
        The building of the QEG Prototype was Crowdfunded by 600+ people. The plans, instructions for building and user manual will be open sourced to the public in March of 2014. QEG manufacturing and distribution will commence via independent local Cottage Industry Community Units in 20+ countries.

       I watched the three videos linked, and not one of them explained a single thing. They just show a noisy motor running and light bulbs on next to it...and we're just meant to fill in the blanks and assume it does what we're being told it does.

       How do you decide when to be skeptical of what someone tells you, and when to just mindlessly believe them? because it doesn't seem to be consistent here.

       So why do you crowdfund for a device that has never worked?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why do you build a huge expensive device (that doesn't work) when you could start off with a scaled down prototype?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why do they reference Tesla patent 390,414 that has to do with converting existing DC generators to have an AC output?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why do they reference Tesla patent 511,916 which has to do with using a metal spring in a steam engine?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does this seem so similar to the WITTS generator scam that took in all kinds of money and then didn't go anywhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you just want to send money to someone with an unproven idea, just send it to me. My ideas actually have more science behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ideas of resononce and back EMF can be more readily experimented with using a Bedini motor design and a Joule ringer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit., had the patents backwards, fixed now  (edit,
       <strong>
        it is just a regurgitated/renamed WITTS generator scam

       the 511,916 is about metal spring resononce in a steam engine.

       And 390,414 says " but I have found that the ordinary forms of continuous current dynamos now in use may be readily and cheaply adapted to my system, or utilized both as continuous and alternating current generators with but slight changes in their construction."

       Yes I watched the videos. I have acheaved resononce with my Bedini motor and joule ringer, resononce does not automatically equal an overunity power source. In other words it does not work.

       I agree, but while researching in the overunity area you learn quick to not get hung up on the distractions. And that's what these are. They are just there to make someone a buck and keep the resaerchers on wild goose chases when they could be working in the right direction.

       Yes but you get it from "lodestone" or AKA permanent magnets, which eventually wear out. You can't have perpetual motion (without load) with just magnets because they eventually stop gaussing.

       Photon's remain at c in a vacuum, have always been known/thought to slow in a medium. All that has changed is that scientists have achieved slowing the photons in a medium.

       The scientific consensus is that light always travels at

        c

       <strong>
        within a vacuum
       </strong>

       No one has ever shown a coherent physical framework or empirical evidence where this is not the case.

       What you're talking about is light slowing down in a medium... which has been well documented and theoretically predicted for many many decades.

       This is not a proof that photons

        can't go faster

       <em>

       than c. It's the proof that a clever engineering system can see the light propagate. They "just" have a very good triggering system and average over thousands of flashes... I use the same kind of technique (a lot slower tho) to do flow visualization in my lab.

       And before anybody else bring up that light go slower than c outside of vacuum, I know it does. I am assuming that

       If someone disproved or effectively avoided the laws of thermodynamics, the world would change over night. No amount of money or conspiracy could contain something so Earth shattering. Stop being so paranoid. This shit is a scam, just like all of the other machines just like it.

       You seem to be confusing laws of nature with rules.  Rules can be pushed, or even broken.  Laws of nature not so much.  Our understanding of the laws of nature can certainly change though.

       I don't mean to be rude, but what do people like you do when things like this turn out to be scams? Do you forget and jump onto the next silly idea or do you reevaluate your thinking? Like, how do people deal with being that wrong?

       It is called being "fractally wrong" or fractal wrongness. It is a pervasive enemy of rational thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read a decent write-ups many years ago, but Google hates me and won't show me the article anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       However one article I can link to that drove home how something can get so fractally wrong is about PHP (the programming language):
       <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">
        http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Just apply the patterns to someone's thought process and you can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically if you want to argue with the
       <strong>
        laws of thermodynamics
       </strong>
       with the assertion that "hey laws are made to be broken" or that science is fallable or some shit; you can probably assume that there is a lot more wrong thinking about other things as well. And not even assume, most folks that are so fractally wrong will reinforce the fact at great length .

       I see people accuse people of that fallacy all the time, but usually it is based on statements that don't actually assume that, just assuming that the government and those in power aren't all evil satan-worshiping monsters.  There's a lot of grey area between all evil and all good.

       Fossil fuels are bullshit, yes. Magnet-based free energy generators are a different, less harmful, but no less stupid sort of bullshit. People have been spinning magnets around in creative ways for hundreds of years. They have never managed to produce more energy than is put into them, and this generator will be no exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science and reason are tools in the search for good ideas, for ideas that work. Things like solar power, wind power, geothermal power, next-gen thorium, fusion. Ideas that are not bullshit. Magnet motors are bullshit and they have always been bullshit. Hitching the future of humanity to a pile of bullshit is a huge mistake. It's time to move on.

       Technically you are correct. But you should know that's not what I meant. I meant a video explaining how the whole thing works, with the entire setup shown. For all we know it's powered by an AC outlet.

       Sorry, I should have said "usable for human use energy".  Sorry for the confusion.  Sure, there are stars millions of light years away from us full of energy, but we (as humans on the planet Earth) can't exactly use that energy.

        Zero point, quantum field, holofractographic vacuum, source, whatever you want to call it- is real.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, it's real in the sense that quarks are real, quantum entanglement is real, gluons and mesons are real, but what do they all have to do producing energy in the real world? Exactly fuckall except for the fact that they sound cool and sci-fi-ey.
      </p>
      <p>
       You CANNOT, I repeat CANNOT 'extract' usable energy from this zero-point energy to be used at a large enough scale to power homes or whatever. I would go so far as to say you can't extract this energy at all, but I don't want to discount the possibility of maybe using the Casimir effect in NEMS systems, but even that seems unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple explanation to understand why you can't use this energy is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       To extract energy from a system, you need to create a potential difference. So if you have a rock lying on the ground, it doesn't have any potential energy relative to the ground; you can't use it to generate useful energy. Take that rock and bring it to a cliff and now you have created a potential difference between the earth and rock that is directly proportional to the height of the rock relative to the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with zero point energy is that you can't create a potential difference between the lowest energy point and something 'lower' than it: it's already as low as it's gonna get! The zero point energy comes from the mathematical solution to quantum mechanics and it's assumption that particles act like waves at the most fundamental level.  The uncertainty principle does not allow us to know the momentum and position of a particle with infinite certainty, so there is some 'fuzz' that's created that makes sure no particle has absolutely zero energy (since momentum is related to energy). When you go to macroscopic scales, all this fuzz basically averages out, leaving you with a normal classical explanation of the world. A world in which there is no free lunch.

       Electrons are not of the macroscopic world.  When we create energy, we are doing it on the microscopic level, where we play by the microscopic rules, and where your rock on a cliff analogy has no pertinence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking about a differential is certainly relevant in our visible reality, but the microscopic flux that we are only starting to understand, doesn't care about your differential.

       No. No type of natural variability in a system can be used for useful work, simply because the opposite variability is just as likely as the positive variability being sought after.

       It isn't that anyone thinks they've got it all figured out. It is the fact that there are
       <strong>
        real
       </strong>
       , tangible ways to generate power and after a decade or two of hearing about these sort of devices a person doesn't want to argue anymore and the shutdown is simple: you cannot get more energy output of a system than its inputs.

       There aint no such thing as a free lunch and quantum entanglement or reception or fuzzy universes or whatever the fuck these guys go on about is just snake oil. The crap quality of the videos and the fact that every single one plays like a fucking infomercial with long intros and way too much talking about nonsense rather than the science....

       Do we? as far as I'm concerned, the human race has only had itself to determine what is and is not. Our whole system could be flawed, and we could not tell because we have no reference. It could also be dandy. We know nothing for sure though, we just have faith it is right.

       I don't believe if you lived in the time of Copernicus you or most would be 
just as enlightened to say it was a paradigm shift. Don't flatter yourself.

       Unfortunately the one thing petroleum or fossil fuels have going for them is millions of years of heat and pressure. That makes it cheaper per joule or watt or whatever than anything else on the scales that it works on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually extracting and refining fossil fuel will be cost prohibitive compared to other means of generation. It has nothing to do with cleanliness or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       These goddamned "over unity" generator pairs are always being 'discovered' every year or two and they always rely on a non-renewable energy source somewhere. Permanent magnets (which, you know, aren't) or batteries or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone somewhere makes a mistake in a lab and accidentally discovers a way to make fabrication of solar panels or wind turbine bearings that makes the cost less (capex) to set up than currently, then you will see a shift toward 'renewable' energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expect our kardashev scale rating to be 1.0-1.2 before this happens though. We are evidently fracking north Dakota at only 9% efficiency, which is evidently still more worthwhile than spending that money on wind farms or other generator technology.

       it has to do with their fixed cost for the grid. they will have to pass on the maintenance cost to a smaller customer base, thus increasing prices for non-solar users. the effect of increasing prices would be more incentive to jump to use solar, which would result in a kind of positive feedback loop that ends with the big companies going away. so that's why. they are just trying to protect their own asses, no matter the bigger picture.

       Sterling D. Allan is a person that collects and gathers donations to sustain his website and his vacations by exploiting people that are gullible enough to believe in his doublespeak that promotes the veracity of free-energy scams without ever admitting those to work.

       His 12 years website has an immense list of all of these free-energy scams organized. One of my favorites is the scammer
       <a href="http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Searl_Effect_Generator_%28SEG%29">
        John Searl
       </a>
       that has been scamming for over
       <strong>
        54 years
       </strong>
       (since 1960) and has even created a
       <a href="http://northpointcharity.org/">
        charity organization
       </a>
       dedicated to gather donations for his scam. He claimed that his generator worked and has been working that lie ever since and making it even more elaborated every year.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day no one, not even him, has managed to replicate the machine and they haven't produced any version that would generate what was claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this man and that website and all of the scams in it have in common with this thread is that they are all selling the idea of something that has never been proven to be working. Almost every one of the scammers in that website have already been jailed and the few that are still safe are the ones that were smart enough to ask for
       <em>
        donations
       </em>
       instead of
       <em>
        investment
       </em>
       . Others, such as the one in this thread, sell the
       <em>
        plans
       </em>
       that don't even work.
      </p>
      <p>
       One implies
       <em>
        giving away
       </em>
       , the other implies
       <em>
        return expectation
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's make this even more simple: Buy the plans, assemble the machine and show us that it works. Once you get tired of trying to make it work over and over again because you think that perhaps you assembled it incorrectly, come here and delete this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing you are doing is spreading a scam and the moment you defend a scam with "benefit of the doubt" then you are replacing scientific validation with personal belief (same thing creationists do).
      </p>
      <p>
       This, right here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Note: This is not over-unity yet, but the theoretical possibility is completely there, and
        <strong>
         has been done by the creators.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is nothing else but a blantant lie that they tell to sell their product.

       Here is my problem with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the information they are providing, as well as the videos, all they do is appeal to emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       To paraphrase:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Look, we have this (insert technical jargon) device.  It will save the world.  Free energy!  No pollution!  Better world.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well,
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       want free energy and no pollution, and a better world!  So obviously I want this machine to work!
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read the information watched the videos, and they spend a lot of time talking about known physics, and barely even talk about the
       <em>
        mystery
       </em>
       physics in passing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think it would be the other way around.  Tell us how this device interacts with the "zero point field".  We already know how established physics work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this a scam?  Possibly, but I think it is more likely that these people really believe it will work.  Personally, I can only
       <em>
        hope
       </em>
       that it will work.  I'm not holding my breath.

       If the plans are available online for free, to anyone, that hardly seems like they're making any money. Yes, I know it was initially crowd funded, so 600 people decided to independently fund research into an alternative energy source; I don't think the contributions of 600 people (the kind of people interested and willing to listen to alternative energy theories) is going to make this company rich.

       Their indiegogo campaign raised about 18k, and they are still soliciting donations on gofundme (about 33k so far). They are certainly profiting from this, and that's just the income from public donations - who knows how much they've raised privately?

       I believe the point is it shouldn't be about money.
Most of the people trying to do this before were all secretive about it, on the hope they could market it and become rich.
These people were silenced, one way or another.
So it would appear the best way to have this actually come to fruition, would be to share it freely, willingly, if your motive is no longer money you can't be bribed.
If lots of people are doing it they all can't be "silenced".
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe there is much more to be done/perfected/learned yet, to get this where it needs to be.

       One thought I had was that maybe Tesla had a unique way of designing or wrapping his coils to work better with the interplay of the magnetic fields. 
Maybe he was a prodigy of understanding how magnetic fields work. 
Who knows...

       Also, sunlight you use to create electric current is subtracted from the energy that would be introduced in the system (in this case Earth's climate). Of course until the power subtracted is much less than the income (the whole solar power that hits the ground) this isn't noticeable, but if solar power increase greatly in its usage we could see some effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same reasoning of course works for "second hand" solar power, like wind and hydroelectric power (they both are form of energy taken from the same cycle, that is ultimately powered by solar energy).

       maybe not "free".  but what would you call enough energy to power a home for 50 years for $49.95.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technically not "free", but would you argue with "super super super super duper fucking cheap as shit"?  No "laws" broken.  Even a faithful capitalist like you must appreciate a good bargain ;)

       Agreed, and for anyone who wants to do their own research - Nikola Tesla for his inventions, Walter Russell for his science, Edward Leedskalnin for his work on Coral Castle, and then anything else that is related to frequency based energies can clearly point that nature has a way of creating these machines. All nay-sayers either lack innovation or understanding of these linked conceptions

       So here's my angle on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it is a scam.  No, it will not work.  Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, how can I make money from this?  Because there are obviously many people who believe such a thing is possible and would be willing to back that up with hard cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, let's say I knew about
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firepower_International">
        Firepower International
       </a>
       prior to its inevitable demise.  I could have shorted the stock and made money for nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there somewhere I can make a bet on this?  Say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Within 12 months there will be no independent third party with electrical engineering qualifications that will be able to verify a net positive energy output (
       <em>
        is this what is meant by over unity?
       </em>

       I so want these kind of advancements to be true, but given the implications of an actual, successful breakthrough being
       <em>
        the collapse of the complete current global geopolitics

       my favourite of the free energy scams was that guy on a few youtube vids with the small torroid looking devices powering light bulbs. i forget his name and i still don't know how he did it. 
anyway the whole concept of free energy and water powered cars has been hammered by con artists too much now. we should focus the energy on making things more efficient, cheaper solar panels n shit.

       The QEG is just the latest in a long line of scams by OPPT which is a pseudolegal cult currently operating out of Morocco. You can see a number of the leaders in the room in the videos claiming "resonance". Please don't fall for this nonsense.

       The problem is with this way of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The device does not need to be plugged into an electrical outlet to work. It needs an initial starter charge, which can be provided by either batteries or even a hand crank. We can remove the power company from the equation entirely. From what I can remember the initial charge is something like one ampere or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just like your car, it has a starter motor but that doesn't mean you have to be plugged into the grid to start your car in the morning.

       We all know the answer to that question. If you haven't seen the way they go after people who create things that threaten established industries, you haven't been paying attention.
People keep thinking we live in a free country, the sad truth is that is one big illusion. Everyone believes it, but almost nobody even thinks about questioning it.

       This is a scam, nothing more. All this is doing is using an existing power source to turn a motor which then generates an electric current in the coils.  In essence, it's doing literally nothing.

       Amazing the divided and heated attention and discussion this is getting. Why so much negativity I wonder? I haven't looked into it as much as I would like yet but can we give it some more time before we bash this to death? I know the laws of thermodynamics and all that but for me I see something like a wind turbine and I think well why not get that going and keep it going with something like a magnet. No longer needs wind to function then. If you can get it to spin with permanent magnets haven't you then essentially created energy from nothing? It requires and turbine and something to make it spin for electricity. Unless you build Tesla's ambient energy device which also does work its just not very powerful. So again why is it so far fetched that we can get something to spin without using fossil fuels or the like?

       The "make a thing spin around with magnets forever" type of device has a really, really long history:

       The magnet motor is one of the oldest scams in the book, on par with pyramid schemes and Nigerian princes. Given what we know about physics this sort of device is not possible. It's technically possible that some magnet-spinning device could overturn our entire understanding of physics, but they have the track record of the Washington Generals at this point.

       Okay, fine - maybe it's a scam, maybe it isn't.  I make no claims either way - again, I was strictly addressing your comment to the other guy which had no substance whatsoever.

       If it's a scam and you know it is, maybe in the future you could try explaining

       instead of just insulting some guy showing interest and asking questions about it which is what you did.

      <p>
       The problem is that it's extremely difficult to engage in a discussion with someone who doesn't understand the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're truly interested in this subject then you should learn more about engineering and physics so that you can really engage in an informed discussion.  The reason you're being met with negativity is that you're obviously speaking from a place of ignorance and then dismissing anyone who corrects you as being a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire post was just incorrect assumptions and uninformed conjecture, where exactly do you expect discussion to go from there?  Imagine jumping into a discussion on accounting and saying "well, I know the rules of math and all, but I think well why not just make 2+2=5?"  How are people supposed to respond to that?

       Show me where it says that all vaccines are life long protection against their targeted diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: When I went to China I had a polio booster, even though I had a polio vaccine as a kid.  So there's that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some kids are allergic to the vaccines, they rely on the rest of us to get vaccinated.  Some people are on immunosuppressants, they rely on the rest of us to get vaccinated.  Babies get vaccinated from whooping cough at 2 months, prior to that, they rely on the rest of us to get vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's that too.

       Am I wrong to believe injecting mercury into a child could be dangerous?

       I've read the injections cause alot of unnecessary and nasty side-effects. Including death. Am I wrong to question the safety of these mandatory injections?

       No what makes you a psycho is how quickly you would take away someones well being for your own perceived safety. You wouldn't feel guilty right?, you'd be proud.

       This mentality could allow the governments to force inoculate us and there isn't a damn thing anyone could say. It's probably the thing that I find most alarming if I'm being honest. So that's my point. Sorry if I offended you with my emotions.

       I admit I am a bit biased on the subject. I caught ill after getting a vaccination in early grade school. Ever since I've had a lazy eye. Photos confirmed this. I'm not saying they aren't necessary to keep the chances of it spreading at bay. I totally understand that. But rapid opposition to people who decide against this is even crazier in my opinion. Its their choice. There are a lot of risks. That is all.

       You need to define which mercury you're talking about, and then look into when, if ever, it is used today.  And then you need to look into what constitutes a harmful dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you need to consider, even in a worst-case-scenario (mercury!  everywhere!) how many people will likely be harmed taking the vaccine vs. leaving everybody unvaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're willing to do the cost-benefit analysis regarding driving in a car there's no reason you can't regarding vaccinations.
