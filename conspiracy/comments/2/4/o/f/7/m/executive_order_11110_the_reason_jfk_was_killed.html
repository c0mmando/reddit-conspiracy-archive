       Document 100.1.3.2.0       31   of    39........
  "The high office of the President has been used to foment a plot to
destroy the Americans freedom and before I leave office I must inform the
Citizen of his plight."  PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY(10 days before he was
murdered)
      </p>
      <p>
       On June 4, 1963, a virtually unknown Presidential decree, Executive Order
11110, was signed with the authority to basically strip the Federal Reserve
Bank of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at
interest. With the stroke of a pen, President Kennedy declared that the
privately owned Federal Reserve Bank would soon be out of business. The
Christian Common Law Institute has exhaustively researched this matter
through the Federal Register and Library of Congress and can now safely
conclude that this Executive Order has never been repealed, amended, or superceded by any subsequent Executive Order. In simple terms, it is still valid…
      </p>
      <p>
       President Kennedy's Executive Order 11110 [the full text is displayed
further below] gave the Treasury Department the explicit authority:
 "to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion, silver, or
standard silver dollars in the Treasury."
      </p>
      <p>
       "…... "The Federal Reserve is a total money-making machine. It can issue money or
checks. And it never has a problem of making its checks good because it can
obtain the $5 and $10 bills necessary to cover its check simply by asking
the Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving to print them".
 Any one person or any closely knit group who has a lot of money has a lot
of power. Now imagine a group of people who have the power to create money.
Imagine the power these people would have. This is exactly what the
privately owned FED is!"

       Exactly. It's disingenuous (and maybe even misleading) to claim that this was the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       reason they killed him.

      <ol>

         He wanted to work together on a
         <em>
          joint
         </em>
         space mission to the moon with the USSR.

       <li>
        <p>
         He began to have suspicions about Israel and their nuclear arsenal.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He was actively questioning and trying to get information about UFOs.

       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If TPTB had already taken over the US to the point where they could remove a sitting president like that, then I have a feeling that a simple executive order
       <em>
        probably
       </em>
       wouldn't have done much to affect their control of the money supply.

       The theories that you listed are more reasons as to why the government would want JFK killed. The Executive Order 11110 theory is wrong on many levels(as a commenter below explained in great detail).

       Executive Order 11110 is almost exactly the opposite of this. JFK wanted to eliminate silver certificates and replace them with Federal Reserve notes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kennedy
       <a href="http://archive.org/stream/EconomicReportOfThePresidentJanuary1963#page/n22/mode/1up">
        asked Congress in January 1963 for new law
       </a>
       (emphasis added):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I again urge a revision in our silver policy to reflect the status of silver as a metal for which there is an expanding industrial demand. Except for its use in coins,
        <strong>
         silver serves no useful monetary function.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1961, at my direction, sales of silver were suspended by the Secretary of the Treasury. As further steps, I recommend repeal of those Acts that oblige the Treasury to support the price of silver; and repeal of the special 50-percent tax on transfers of interest in silver and
        <strong>
         authorization for the Federal Reserve System to issue notes in denominations of $1, so as to make possible the gradual withdrawal of silver certificates from circulation
        </strong>
        and the use of the silver thus released for coinage purposes. I urge the Congress to take prompt action on these recommended changes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Congress passed the law and Kennedy signed it on June 4, 1963. He signed the executive order the same day because
       <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/UnitedStatesStatutesAtLargeVolume77_1963/UnitedStatesStatutesAtLargeVolume77#page/n80/mode/1up">
        the new law
       </a>
       removed the Treasury Secretary's power to print silver certificates by his own authorization. To allow the continued printing while the Federal Reserve notes were being readied, Kennedy signed the order, which delegated the president's authority under a different law.
      </p>
      <p>
       G. Edward Griffin, author of the anti-Fed book,
       <em>
        The Creature from Jekyll Island
       </em>
       , also rejects the theory that Executive Order 11110 had anything to do with Kennedy's assassination. See his article,

       Here's a newspaper article from the time:

        "Kennedy Signs Silver Bill"
       </a>
       <br/>
       <em>
        Spokane Daily Chronicle
       </em>
       , June 6, 1963, p. 34
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Colorado Springs, Colo. (AP) — President Kennedy announced yesterday President Kennedy announced yesterday the signing of a bill permitting the gradual melting down of silver bullion reserve for use in making coins.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measure was signed Tuesday but the announcement was delayed until Kennedy reached this silver producing state on the first leg of a five-day, five-state western trip.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the new law, pushed by the administration, the Treasury will be able to retire silver certificates paper money now backed by silver bullion as the bullion is melted down for coinage. The silver certificates would be replaced by federal reserve notes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new law also would permit eventual melting down of silver dollars for use in coins of smaller denominations.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to signing the administration bill, Kennedy
        <strong>
         issued an executive order permitting the Treasury to continue use of silver certificates for as long as necessary.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That was Executive Order 11110.

       Your copy pasta might fool the NEETS that silently browse this forum but your interpretation is subjective twsmith.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kennedy's EO-11110 gave the Treasury Department the absolute authority: "to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver dollars in the Treasury." Translate this into: for every single ounce of silver in the treasury, the gov can introduce new money into circulation based on the silver held there.

       I do. Kennedy didn't do anything about United States Notes. He eliminated silver certificates and allowed the Federal Reserve to start printing $1 and $2 bills.
