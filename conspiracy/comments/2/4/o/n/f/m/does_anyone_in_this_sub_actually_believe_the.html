On the other hand all the weird stuff surrounding this event makes no sense at all: the coroner(?) statements, the guy in fatigues, the nuns, the principal stories, the father&#39;s interview, the money raised, the signs, badges, and portapotties, the gun discrepancies, the non-use of medical personnel, and above all the secrecy.</p>

<p>i suppose we all fill in the blanks slightly differently and there won&#39;t be a consensus without more information emerging, via a leak or whistle-blower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s incredibly relevant weather this was a real incident or a complete hoax. Yes, the outcome in terms of consequences for society is basically the same weather this was real or a hoax, but just think about the implications of it being a hoax.</p>

<p>They had the police chief, state medical examiner, all these witnesses, Gene Rosen, the first responders, the media, the poster parents, even the president made a special appearance. Think of all the media appearances following the event, all the people giving interviews on Anderson Cooper, 20/20, and all those types of programs.</p>

<p>If this was a real incident there are quite a few questions left unanswered.</p>

<p>If this was a hoax then it was a deception on an epic scale.</p>

<p>Consider all the money that had to go into paying all these people off, all the manpower that would go into something like this, getting the media to play along. The fact that many of these people had recently moved to this area points toward this having been planned for many years in advance. The implication of all this is that there is an organization out there that is completely covert, yet has the resources and ability to not only pay for all this, but to get this many people including public officials to participate.</p>

<p>If that is the case, I say it is an extremely important detail, not inconsequential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the attempt to revive the assault weapons ban failed, but it DID make it to the senate. The never would have even been considered without this incident. There was no immediate impact, but I bet you that this emotional story has inspired some new anti-gun activists. Connecticut DID pass gun registration laws following the incident (which is being met by wide scale disobedience). Let us not forget that while no official law was passed at the federal level, the president did use this as an excuse to issue several new executive orders regarding guns. All backed by the story of Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>There will be more pushes in the future to make laws concerning firearms and mental health, and the new DSM now includes &quot;oppositional Defiant Disorder&quot; as a mental illness. Combine that with the fact that many psychologists are now publishing papers categorizing belief in conspiracy theories as a mental illness, and we see a possible way for individuals to be disarmed by means of psychological evaluation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have my own methods for dealing with them, but it&#39;s too ugly a process for schools as they are set-up.  Basically you just have to wrestle with them as they emote quite intensely.

    <div class="md"><p>so you think it is less coercive to force potentially disordered kids to wrestle with adults in an emotionally intense way than to have them (with parental consent, of course) speak to a trained child psychologist?  ok.  kinda creepy.</p>

<p>and i&#39;m assuming you have some clinical studies that shows coerced wrestling actually helps children with ODD?  because traditional counseling has been shown to be <a href="https://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/resource_centers/odd/odd_resource_center_odd_guide.pdf">a highly effective treatment</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Just because the planned outcome of an event (to restrict gun rights) failed in working doesn&#39;t mean that therefore it must not have been the intention.</p>

<p>Maybe the people who coordinated the event didn&#39;t realize Americans would simply double down on their gun ownership. The coordinators expected the death of children to put enough fear in people to give up their guns.</p>

<p>But again just because the outcome of more gun control failed doesn&#39;t mean the intention wasn&#39;t there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, i&#39;m not sure where you are getting that characterization or why you believe it means they had tons of cameras in the building.  SHES was a 50 year old school building in a low crime, generally upper class suburb of NYC.  the only real security it had was an active video feed and buzzer system for the front door.  that system was relatively new and i suppose could be called &quot;state of the art,&quot; but it&#39;s certainly not a network of cameras.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 85 tapes you refer to were not confiscated from the Pentagon surveillance system. The 85 tapes refers to the number of tapes cited by the FBI in the Maguire Declaration as being possibly responsive to an FOIA request . The tapes include a variety of video sources pertaining to the FBI&#39;s 9-11 investigation, including video of the WTC and video of investigations into locations linked to the suspected terrorists.</p>

<p>That FOIA request (which can be seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1GCeuSr3Mk&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded#t=972">this conspiracy theory video</a> at 17:28), specifically requested video recordings that showed the impact of flight 77. The FBI reviewed the 85 possibly responsive tapes and concluded that only one of them (the security gate tape with two vantage points) showed the impact. They thus disclosed only that tape in their response to the FOIA.</p>

<p>There is nothing stopping anyone from submitting an FOIA for the other 84 tapes. The contents of those tapes was listed in the Maguire Declaration and they would be relatively easy to request. The reason you don&#39;t have them is because no one actually requested them.  See
<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/archive/2006/doubletreeaffadavit.pdf">http://www.judicialwatch.org/archive/2006/doubletreeaffadavit.pdf</a> and, for a

<p>EDIT: I just have to note that this line of discussion is getting heavily downvoted despite the fact that no one has raised any objections to it.  I know there is no principled rule against people posting about things they&#39;ve previously researched in this sub (many top comments, after all, are nothing more than disjointed connections of dozens of links), so I can only imagine I am being downvoted because people have an issue with the substance of the post.  So what&#39;s the disagreement, then?</p>

<p>And, no, the info I provided doesn&#39;t change the fact that the video released is inconclusive.  But it&#39;s not meant to.  The background information I provided is offered to rebut the notion that the FBI is withholding other videos that show the crash.  There is actually no evidence that any other camera captured the impact of the plane (which is unsurprising considering security cams aren&#39;t typically aimed at the sky).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one, to my knowledge, has even requested the other footage.  The only footage requested was that showing the impact of the plane.  It is up to the requester to determine the scope of the FOIA req.  Nothing is stopping anyone from submitting an FOIA req for the other video confiscated.  If you don&#39;t believe the FBI&#39;s characterization of it, then you can request it and check for yourself.</p>

<p>As to my re-posting of my previous research, I really don&#39;t see what the problem is.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m trying to hide it.  I, like many on this forum, spent a good deal of time reading over competing theories and pouring through the available evidence re specific claims.  Sometimes, as was the case when I tried to get to the bottom of the pentagon videos claims, that has taken hours to do.  So why not continue to share the fruits of that research?  And how does doing so make me a &quot;bot&quot;?  It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve ever spammed info; I&#39;m only posting context-appropriate conclusions that I arrived at independently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that.  But the scope of FOIA requests are for the drafter, not the recipient, to determine.  If someone really wants the other tapes, it would be trivial to re-write the FOIA request to include them (especially since they were explicitly listed in the response to the first FOIA request.  Why has no conspiracy theorist submitted such an FOIA request?  I have no idea.</p>

<p>either it went down as the official story says, or it was a drill they went live, or a full blown MSM/govt hoax, or &#39;real&#39; event with MSM foreknowledge.</p>

<p>from the green-screen MSM footage and photos, the faked parking lot video, AND the fake firehouse studio planter, its clear that the MSM knew before the day. they filmed grieving parents at supposedly 2pm infront of the fake planter, that planter had to have been made before the day, ditto the composite video.</p>

<p>the SHES was a health hazard according to the cops own forensic interior photos, no way it could have passed any govt inspection, therefore a set for a production.</p>

<p>they used a domestic house cleaning company to supposedly clear up the blood and body parts in the school, breaking every CDC and OSHA rule in the book.</p>

<p>and of course the police scanner recording of them finding a teacher and 18 kids dead in the school kitchen closet, not part the official MSM/govt story.</p>

I feel the same way about the Boston Marathon. I sincerely believe the hoax and crisis actor stuff was planted to yank real theorists&#39; chains. It serves two purposes: discredits the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; and ensures armchair investigators like ourselves waste time tramping down the wrong paths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard (and discussed) this one before. Let&#39;s just clarify the two points you mention, because there seems to be some selective quoting there.</p>

<p>&quot;Intraoral gunshot wound <strong>with extensive injury to skull and brain</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The shooter received a bullet to the right rear lower portion of his head <strong>which exited out the top forward portion of his head and hat.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Note: the <em>wound</em> was described as intraoral - which in medical terms, just means it was somewhere in the mouth. Make a gun with your right hand and put it below and behind your right ear, like you would if committing suicide. That&#39;s the &quot;right rear lower&quot; section of your head - but it&#39;s easy to see that the path of any bullet then goes through the mouth - creating an &quot;intraoral gunshot wound&quot; - before exiting the top forward portion of your skull. </p>

<p>There is no inconsistency there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t quantum physics. Just basic biology. </p>

<p>The oral cavity basically occupies the whole width of your face. If you are shooting yourself in the head from at or below the lower jaw - as Lanza apparently did - there is almost no way for a bullet to &quot;exit the top forward portion&quot; of your skull <strong>without</strong> causing an &quot;intraoral gunshot wound.&quot;</p>

<p>I repeat: there is no inconsistency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. As your definition says, <strong>absolutely nothing</strong> about direction. Whether the bullet passed through from the front, the back, the sides or the bottom, it would still create an intraoral wound - one &quot;situated within the mouth&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh. The autopsy records an entrance wound. An exit wound. AND damage between the two. It&#39;s really not difficult. </p>

<p>But this is the problem so often seen with Sandy Hook theorists. An obvious, simple explanation is ignored, in favor of a far more convoluted and paranoid one. Someone stammers? THEY&#39;RE FLUBBING THEIR LINES!! Someone doesn&#39;t stammer? WHY AREN&#39;T THEY SHOWING EMOTION!!</p>
