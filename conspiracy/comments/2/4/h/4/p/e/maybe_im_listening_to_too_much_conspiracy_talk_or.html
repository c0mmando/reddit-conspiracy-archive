<p>Here are the 3 main subjects of my obsession, I feel like I&#39;m being lied to on an unthinkable scale. The more I see, the less I believe.</p>

<p>Holocaust - post war trials seem to have very little in the way of physical evidence</p>

<p>Moon landing - seems like an impossibility at the time, especially considering the van allen belts</p>

<p>9/11 - Overwhelming evidence of controlled demolition</p>

<p>Can anyone help me believe these world changing stories, I don&#39;t want to live in the matrix. Help!</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the replies and food for thought.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still very unsure about the Holocaust, I know the concentration camps existed and I know the prisoners suffered tremendously, what I doubt is the figures, they just don&#39;t add up for me and there is no physical evidence to confirm the typical numbers quoted.
A typical video that helps me form this opinion:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aN-RfitvK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aN-RfitvK0</a></p>

<p>This is a very emotionally charged subject, at the moment I am leaning towards it being a load of propaganda, making out the Nazis to be much worse than the reality to take the heat of the atrocities commited by other factions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certain that the official 9/11 story is an absolute fairy tale.
Fairly certain my opinion will never be changed on this.</p>

<p>Undergoing some reading about the moon landings, seems improbable but I&#39;m sure there must be more to it than I&#39;m seeing. Open to all facts and opinions on this. </p>

<p>No one seriously questions that WWII was a tragedy for many different groups . . . including European Jews.</p>

<p>The problem with using terms like &quot;Holocaust&quot; and &quot;denier&quot; is that they don&#39;t really mean much.  In fact, they are used as propaganda to shut down debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homicide.  We need further information to classify these deaths further though.</p>

<p>Putting people into camps because of their race or religion, whether as Japanese Americans or European Jews, was wrong.  At the time these groups were viewed as enemy aliens.  So while I think imprisoning them was wrong (even though the U.S. Supreme Court said it was constitutional), it was indeed legal at the time throughout Allied and Axis countries.  </p>

<p>So any deaths because of disease or bad work conditions or malnutrition at these camps could be described as <strong>negligent homicide</strong> or even <strong>murder</strong> if done in a way to guarantee death.  Granted, some claim these enemy alien populations, like in Germany, received fair treatment because many German soldiers received similar rations and also suffered from similar diseases caused by poor work conditions such as Typhus.  These diseases and lack of food were endemic in German camps (for both soldiers and prisoners) during both world wars.  </p>

<p>Some would also argue the Allies were jointly responsible for the camp conditions because they engaged in a campaign of total warfare and destroyed civilian infrastructure that supported the camps and thus probably caused some camp deaths (also many prisoners died from actual Allied bombs).  Indeed, the Allied strategy was to intentionally kill civilians in order to get Germany (and Japan) to submit.  So the Allies were also complicit in some form of <em>homicide</em> regarding German civilians, including prisoners in camps.  </p>

<p>There was also state sponsored <strong>legal homicide</strong> . . . in the form of executions for committing crimes (like sabotaging war material or escaping from prison) or the execution of partisans (fighters not granted protection under the Geneva convention because they didn&#39;t wear uniforms).  All sides in the conflict followed similar rules.  I don&#39;t doubt that many German officials and troops used the pretense of executing partisans when in fact what they were doing was <strong>murder</strong> of Jews based on their religion, race, and nationality.  There is some evidence German officials prohibited this and punished officials for engaging in this but plenty of evidence they looked the other way or encouraged this as well.</p>

<p>Then of course there is the natural consequence of forcing Jews to emigrate first to Palestine then plans to make them emigrate to other places (most likely Eastern Europe).  This obviously puts a strain on a population and will result in death.  So the Germans are responsible for these consequences.  They are also responsible for resorting to war and all the deaths that inevitably lead from that (and German civilians suffered just as much because of the war).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how many died and it&#39;s hard for anyone to tell us with any certainty (as even historians that support the official story would say).  </p>

<p>It could be in the millions but my educated guess is that would be pushing it.  Some of the evidence from the Germans and Red Cross indicate hundreds of thousands died in the camps, mostly from disease.  Probably hundreds of thousands died in the Eastern Occupied areas.  I suspect Soviet numbers there are heavily exaggerated because the Soviets were prone to exaggeration in these matters and evidence suggest the Russians prioritized evacuating Jews before the Germans arrived (<em>see, e.g.</em>  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Hundred_Years_Together">&#39;200 Years Together&#39;</a> which is difficult to find an English translation for).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ovens existed.  They are called crematoria.  It&#39;s the hygienic and preferred way to dispose of bodies.  Lots of people were dying of disease so they needed to dispose of the bodies properly.</p>

<p>Also, there is no way that the crematoria at say Auschwitz cremated the numbers of people claimed.  If you look into the logistics you would see how fanciful the claimed numbers and methods used were.  For instance, the inmate collaborators, the Sonderkommandos, claim far less time to burn each body and claim they doubled bodies up, etc., which are all suspicious claims.  </p>

<p>Mass shooting may have occurred.  Certainly in the Occupied territories in the East.  Executions were also conducted in the camps for &#39;crimes&#39; like sabotage of war material, etc.  The American defense lawyer defending a German officer in the underground camps working on the V2 rockets argued that the executions were perfectly legal and exactly the same policy the Allies would use in their production facilities.  If you got caught sabotaging ammunition or a ship in an Oakland, CA facility, say, and it could result in a U.S. service member death, what do you think the penalty would be?</p>

<p>Sigh indeed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think I&#39;m pretty much on your page here. And remember, a conflict in some small details does not render all other details impossible. It&#39;s definitely possible that there were lies being told in these situations but they do not mean the whole thing was a hoax.</p>

<p>For example, I read that entire wagging the moon doggie analysis and while I was unconvinced that the moon landings were faked, I&#39;m pretty sure NASA was up to some shady stuff a few times just to make it look like they were in-step with the Russian space program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO, it is the Achilles heel to bring down the whole cartel. It&#39;s straight up government numbers, where they are hiding TRILLIONS in investment holdings in foreign and domestic fortune 500 companies. In fact, with all the money that has been made from investments using public monies, as evidenced in the comprehensive annual financial reports, not only should we not have to ever pay taxes again, but we could theoretically be getting a DIVIDEND check from the government! If you&#39;re interested, look up Walter Burien and Clint Richardson. Those two dudes are the best authorities when it comes to analyzing CAFRs.</p>

<p>9/11 was an obvious inside job - <a href="http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;amp;artid=167">this video</a> is long but is by far the best I&#39;ve seen on the subject.</p>

<p>As for the Nazis/Holocaust?  There was <em>a lot</em> more to the story than most are aware of and the &quot;6 million Jews&quot; number is almost certainly millions higher than the real number.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend Anthony Sutton&#39;s book &quot;Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler&quot; as a starting point but there are many others.</p>

<p>Moon Landing: (possibly happen but the video is probably an hoax)<br/>
My problem is Moon radiation(neutron, cosmic ray...) how could it affect the film (look at what happen to ccd in an environment filled with radiation: if there is no light but radiation trajectory of particle will appear on the ccd...) and the astronaut?<br/>
<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/10915/radiation-on-the-moon/">http://www.universetoday.com/10915/radiation-on-the-moon/</a><br/>
also the take off, if they went to the moon maybe they could not go back due to engine failure link with long radiation exposition ....<br/>
Anyway if they did it, it was very stupid to go up there with human, too risky for their health  </p>

<p>9/11 WTC7 is too obvious, controlled demolition</p>

<p>There is plenty of solid evidence that this number was referenced and spoken about many times by many people <em>before</em> WWII/the Holocaust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These figures come from the same Polish (Soviet puppet) authorities that claimed 3.5 million were killed at Auschwitz (per the first Auschwitz trials, e.g. Hoss&#39; trial).  This number has now been reduced to about 1 million.  </p>

<p>These same Polish authorities collaborated with Soviet officials in hiding Russia&#39;s crimes in Katyn--where they executed Polish officers and blamed it on the Germans:</p>

<p>Moon landing - seems like an impossibility at the time, especially considering the van allen belts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Van Allen belts aren&#39;t actually as dangerous as you think, and this argument is based of an outdated understanding of the belts. Firstly, the astronauts were only in them for a relatively short amount of time. Secondly, they actually made the capsules somewhat resistant to the radiation by using an an &quot;an aluminum sandwich consisting of a welded aluminium inner skin, a thermally bonded honeycomb core, and a thin aluminium face sheet. The steel honeycomb core and outer face sheets were thermally bonded to the inner skin&quot;. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt#Implications_for_space_travel">source</a></p>

<p>Finally, the astronauts actually received a fairly small dose of radiation. To quote NASA:</p>

<ul>
<li>In fact, the astronauts&#39; overall exposure was dominated by solar particles once outside Earth&#39;s magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity. <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s2ch3.htm">Source</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That is just the Van Allen belts, there are tons of other evidence we went to the moon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Holocaust - post war trials seem to have very little in the way of physical evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We definitely have evidence the Holocaust happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m still very unsure about the Holocaust, I know the concentration camps existed and I know the prisoners suffered tremendously, what I doubt is the figures, they just don&#39;t add up for me and there is no physical evidence to confirm the typical numbers quoted. A typical video that helps me form this opinion:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Nazis were nothing if not meticulous. We have quite a decent idea of numbers.</p>

<p>9/11 is a whole other can of worms that I&#39;d really rather not open.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_Vashem">Yad Vashem</a> has collected a list of about 3 million names. The Nazis also kept extensive records, which give us a very good idea of death tolls. Finally, even the Nazis claimed that the number was that high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shifting numbers and lack of certainty even from historians on the &#39;official&#39; side are very telling.</p>

<p>Two prominent historians that mostly support the &#39;official&#39; Holocaust story, Professor Raul Hilberg, author of &#39;The Destruction of the European Jews&#39;, and Gerald Reitlinger, author of &#39;The Final Solution&#39;, put the numbers for all Jewish deaths at 5.1 million and as high as 4.6 million, respectively, but admitted that the numbers are not based on reliable information.</p>

<p>Also, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg put the number of dead at 6 million and this was when they had heard the Hoss &#39;confession&#39; that 3 million were killed at Auschwitze (and a time when the Soviets were claiming 4 million killed there).  So obviously the 6 million number was based on the Aushwitz estimates.  But the Aushwitz figures were later revised down by at least a couple million but the total 6 million number stayed the same.  The 6 million number has been bandied about before and during the war and is used as a shibboleth.</p>

<p>So when people point with such certainty to 6 million and claim it&#39;s &quot;denial&quot; to question that number (even though historians on their own side can be accused of this!), they are engaging in propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not mad, but I would advise you to not spend too much time thinking/reading about things which you cannot ultimately know, nor do you have any control over.  A healthy skepticism and an understanding that commonly accepted historical accounts are often bogus is all you really need to know.  Delving deeper into conspiracy theories can be a regrettable use of time and energy.  That being said, let me share my thoughts on the 3 events you bring up, all of which I have spent too much time reading, listening, talking, and thinking about. </p>

<p>Holocaust: The Nazis killed a lot of people.  If you have studied Hitler and the Nazis at all, you know that they wanted all the Jews, Russians, and many other peoples gone.  That being said, some unreliable sources of evidence used against the Nazis right after the war has wrongfully become official historical fact.  The Jewish victims of the Nazis have also hijacked Nazi crimes to portray them as uniquely anti-Jewish, while many other minorities who were systematically murdered get little more than footnotes in history books.  The truth of the Holocaust might differ a bit from what they taught you in school, but there&#39;s no question that the Nazis killed a lot of innocent Jews in cold blood.</p>

<p>Moon Landing: To believe the Apollo missions took men to the moon and back time after time is an act of faith.  It was over 40 years ago, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings">The third party evidence of the moon landing</a> is not very conclusive.  I first doubted the Apollo missions when <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=moon+landing+national+parks&amp;amp;oq=moon+landing+national+parks&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3590j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=91&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">I started seeing propaganda</a> supporting <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:H.R.2617:">legal action to make it illegal for anyone to go anywhere near any of the Apollo sites</a>.  They say they want people to stay away to preserve lunar history, but since Neil Armstrong left the damn camera on the moon, I&#39;d say checking out the landing sites would do more for lunar history than making them forbidden!</p>

<p>9/11: The official 9/11 story is that 3 steel frame buildings in NYC collapsed due to fire damage on 9-11-2011.  No other steel frame building has ever collapsed due to fire damage ever.  As a mathematician, the odds of the only 3 steel-frame-fire collapses happening in the same place on the same day is an impossibility.  There are many other logically sound ways to conclude that the official 9/11 story is BS.</p>

<p>In fact the Germans, famous for being calculatingly ruthless murderers, devised the most efficient system for mass murder the world has ever seen:</p>

<p>First you transport them across vast regions at no small expense to your country, next you feed and house them for an undetermined amount of time.  Following that, you take great pains to prevent the spread of lice and typhus between your helpless victims, sacrificing precious medical supplies during war time when supply convoys are tied up transporting live human beings to the only crematoriums and suitably-sized holes in Germany.</p>

<p>Then I guess you gas them in shower rooms, which are by no means air tight; what with the windows. Probably coulda done it anywhere, come to think of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are political realities you need to consider too.  Germany was as civilized country and the government had to be somewhat discrete in killing civilians within their borders.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t as easy as it was for the USA killing indians where nearly the entire white population viewed them as savages.</p>

<p>But seriously, the gas chambers were probably bullshit along with a lot of other details.  Still, how can you seriously question that Nazi Germany killed a ton of civilians because of their ethnicity?</p>

<p>The real conspiracy of the Holocaust is in how it&#39;s been remembered.  The history of WWII is now taught with Jewish persecution as one of the most important aspects of the war, while in reality the persecution of Jews is only one chapter in the book of atrocities which comprised WWII.  Whether or not gas chambers were used or if Hitler knew the details of the relocation/labor/death seem like minor details of little consequence.</p>
