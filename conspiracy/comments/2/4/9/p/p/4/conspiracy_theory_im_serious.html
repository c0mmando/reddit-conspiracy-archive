        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys,
Had you ever had that feeling when someone spies on you? Or even multiple people?
I had the occurence to meet a guy in a shop who at some point weirdly asked me where I&#39;m from and what I&#39;m doing in &#39;here&#39;. While saying that his left eye twitched suspicously and I left while saying that I&#39;m buxing stuff right now.
The second occurrence happened yesterday. I chilled with a seemingly nice drugaddict girl who wears no shoes outside. We smoked some weed and chilled together and at some point sexual tension came up. We flirted with each other but nothing has happened. After we smoked the second joint we divided the rest of the weed and were making ready to leave, but for some fucking reason she wanted to know my &#39;lifestory&#39; after she told me hers. I then asked her twice if she&#39;s a spy and whether or not she&#39;s been honest to me. She never declined my accusation and even said very silent that I got her. And after telling her that I wouldn&#39;t care about the consequences but that she has to tell me who&#39;s up to me, she said something I forgot, and then asked me rhetorically how stupid I am? In the end she gave me one of the condoms we bought together, as a gift.</p>

<p>Today i got so paranoid that I was wonderig the whole day whether or not I&#39;m right. That indeed someone is up to me. Someone trying to stop me from going on in my life, for a reason. So I came up with the idea that she might has prepared the condom. I tested it out by blowing into it and indeed, there were multiple holes in it. </p>

<p>Now I am wondering whether or not she&#39;s done that in anticipation in me having sex with her so I impregnate her, or was she betting on the fact that I would have sex in general, so coming to the point that she was on a mission, sent by someone to sabotage or well, hinder me from doing whatever.</p>

<p>Why, you asking? I&#39;m really paranoid about someone &#39;bad&#39; is trying to stop me, maybe even kill me if all matters fail, because I&#39;m so special that I need to be killed. Somewhat like a superhero/villain relationship, in that the villain is trying to control humanity and me, the hero trying to stop him.</p>

<p>I should add that I have this gutfeeling that I am right, that I&#39;m going to die soon, mostly because of that.</p>

<p>But what are your opinions on both subjects? Any input fron you is appreciated. Even the negative.</p>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>It is highly likely that the strain of weed you are smoking is causing the paranoia.  Take a T break for a few weeks and see how that changes things.  When you are paranoid and high you see things differently and remember things differently. </p></li>
<li><p>Related to number 1, its likely your memory is different because it is now filtered through a high mind and paranoia.  Anything you remember after getting high should be suspect due to the possibility of weed induced paranoia as a filter. </p></li>
<li><p>I know someone with a twitch in their right eye.  It does it all the time no matter what they are talking about.  A twitch in the eye doesn&#39;t mean anything when you know nothing about the person. </p></li>
<li><p>All this hinges on the idea that you are worth taking time to stalk and kill.  Examine your life and see if you have done anything or learned anything that could put you at risk.  visiting a conspiracy forum doesn&#39;t count.  Its very likely many conspiracy theories are created out of whole cloth to make conspiracy theorists look stupid.  So going to a forum would be something they probably approve of.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you have done nothing and not seen or heard anything, and the paranoia continues after the T break, consider a shrink.  Its not normal to feel constantly paranoid and can be dangerous to your heart and brain health.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Above all, stop worrying.  If you die, you die.  You will eventually no matter what.  Gut feelings mean nothing.  You can&#39;t know when you will die so take that thought and quash it for your own benefit. </p>

<p>I have always felt like I have a force working against me. You could call it bad karma or grimlins or evil or whatever...But always a force working against me. Even unexplainable events. Murphy&#39;s law never takes a break with me.  It has always seemed like I have to exert more will and effort to accomplish my simple goals, then everyone else. I have to force things to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s super weird, dude.</p>

<p>Last week I went out and met a guy I played football with a year ago and after a day or two I suddenly received notifications of him on facebook although I never really got them before.</p>

<p>Also after I chilled with this drug addict girl I came back home and checked my facebook once again and for some fucking there was this notification of the girlfriend, whom I&#39;m not friends with, of a guy I used to know, but never did anything on facsbook with him, saying that he&#39;s his drug..</p>

<p>Maybe I am paranoid but all of this is weirding me out and is making so much sense in my head, but what do you think?</p>

<p>I think I am something special, so special that I&#39;m a thorn in someone&#39;s eye. I can&#39;t say who or what in particular, just that it I can&#39;t joke about.</p>

<p>That I am a &#39;good&#39; human being and that the or a &#39;bad&#39; person wants to get rid of me, bzt not by killing me, yet. Trying to seduce me with drugs through the girl in the story firstly and secondly sabotaging my future life so I can&#39;t achieve what I am up to, whatever that is. </p>

<p>I just think that she was sent, which may souns ridiculous, but that&#39;s life, right?</p>

We&#39;re all being watched/tracked to some extent, but it seems like the people who actually get &quot;true attention&quot; are the people who are doing something those in power don&#39;t like - such as investigating a story which would expose something they&#39;d rather not have exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aite, imma be real with you.  Here it is, 5 am.  On reddit.  You sound like you may be a paranoid schizophrenic.  Do you hear voices?  Im not trying to be mean, honestly.  There is a possibility it also could be gangstalking, but this is from the stalking wiki:</p>

<p>False claims of stalking, &quot;gang stalking&quot; and delusions of persecution
See also: False accusations</p>

<p>In 1999, Pathe, Mullen and Purcell wrote that popular interest in stalking was promoting false claims.[23] In 2004, Sheridan and Blaauw said that they estimated that 11.5% of claims in a sample of 357 reported claims of stalking were false.[24]</p>

<p>According to Sheridan and Blaauw, 70% of false stalking reports were made by people suffering from delusions.[24][25] Another study estimated the proportion of false reports that were due to delusions as 64%.[26]</p>

<p>Multiple news reports have described how groups of Internet users have cooperated to exchange detailed conspiracy theories involving coordinated activities by large numbers of people called &quot;gang stalking&quot;, often described as involving the use of &quot;psychotronic weapons&quot; and other alleged mind control techniques. These are generally reported by external observers as being examples of belief systems, as opposed to reports of objective phenomena. Some psychiatrists and psychologists say &quot;Web sites that amplify reports of mind control and group stalking&quot; are &quot;an extreme community that may encourage delusional thinking&quot; and represent &quot;a dark side of social networking. They may reinforce the troubled thinking of the mentally ill and impede treatment.&quot;[27][28]</p>

<p>In Davis (2001), he reported &quot;very rare&quot; [29] instances of victimization that were alleged to be true but only falsified to gain attention, secondary or the specific purposes to exploit or manipulate others called &quot;Falsely Alleged Victimization Syndrome&quot; or FAVS.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb for this, in my opinion, is to think of any reason why someone would put so much effort into stopping or hurting you.  Do you have some valuable information?  Do you know something you shouldnt?  If not, you&#39;re probably ok.  One more thing, don&#39;t do any drugs.  It will make this paranoia/break from reality worse.</p>

<p>I really hope you are not actually being gangstalked.  If you have any other evidence then two people asking you a couple questions, please, share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s super weird, dude.</p>

<p>Last week I went out and met a guy I played football with a year ago and after a day or two I suddenly received notifications of him on facebook although I never really got them before.</p>

<p>Also after I chilled with this drug addict girl I came back home and checked my facebook once again and for some fucking there was this notification of the girlfriend, whom I&#39;m not friends with, of a guy I used to know, but never did anything on facsbook with him, saying that he&#39;s his drug..</p>

<p>Maybe I am paranoid but all of this is weirding me out and is making so much sense in my head, but what do you think?</p>
