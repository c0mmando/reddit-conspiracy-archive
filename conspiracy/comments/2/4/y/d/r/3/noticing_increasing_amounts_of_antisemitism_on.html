       Wasn't Lebensraum about giving a certain set of people a place to live, only it entailed removal of the current people who lived there? It seems as though Zionism differs only in method. How you place 'commie' with these two I don't understand.

      <p>
       Judaism
       <strong>
        should
       </strong>
       have a homeland, as history has shown that their culture is unsafe from attack. That homeland has come at the detriment of others due to their insistence on religious grounds of it being located in a certain place. Fine, it's a done deal. However, to continue to expand by driving off the local populace, at least without just compensation, is wrong, and I firmly believe that saying so is not racist.

       I placed "Commie" with everything else because in some places it holds just as much of a bad connotation as Zionist and Nazi as a poor label for people.

       as a counterpoint to your argument, I don't consider myself antisemitic at all.  I have no problem whatsoever with Jewish people.  However I don't support Zionism, and I feel that as you put it "just giving people a home" is a very evil thing when you do it by killing, torturing, persecuting and displacing the people who already live there.

       Certain groups get insulted in this sub all the time, people mock Christianity all the time. People have been indoctrinated that any criticisms of Jews is antisemitism. Also people see what Israel does to the Palestinians, for example, then those Jewish people are just being protected by 'Murica. I think you view people criticizing the Jewish elite as a hatred for all the Jewish people. We criticize America's elite, but it is not a criticism to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the small amount of % of Jewish people they do take contain a higher percentage of influence in certain things like Hollywood. Also there might be some validity about discussing the Ashkenazian Jews (European Jews) are the ones that control Hollywood or people like Ben Bernaki being one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone should hate jews, blacks, or whatever race because of race or culture, but I don't think a criticism to certain aspects of jewish influence makes it antisemitism.

       Yes but do they claim Christians infiltrate and destroy society, control the government and media, steal our money and manipulate our political process? All while tied in with some racist notion that Christians aren't white?

       Well let's look at who runs the world finances, the Rothschilds, who claim to be Jewish. What is our current economic model of the world, to keep the masses struggling and an upper elite to dominate the world's finances. If money controls our politics, then yes the Rothschilds, Jews, are manipulating our political process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think people have something against the average person who happens to be Jewish. It just happens that there is a significant influence from people who are Jews in today's society.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ignore jewish influence on today's society is ignorant of you. The common joke amond comedians is don't make fun of the Jews or they will never work in Hollywood again. It is a joke, but there is some truth that the there is some truth. It comes down to sources people trust, like modern day jews being Ashkenazi Jews, or Khazars, so it may not be a real criticism against actual jews like the ones who should be in Israel or the Ashkenazi Jews who do occupy Israel and influence in today's society.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just a different perspective and I am not disputing that there are some people who are just racist, but I don't believe that is the case for most.

       When was the last time you heard someone decry the Irish influence on today's society? Why do you think people single out Jews but when it comes to, say, the Italians, nobody thinks to bring race / ethnicity into it? And are you aware of how many people of Irish descent there are in our government and places of power?

       The USA and Israel pact has probably more to do with the negative view. There is a jewish influence in USA and around the world. Rothschilds have a tremendous influence in the money supply around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe it is just our government ruining America then yes, you should criticize the people in the government like the Irish descent you say. I believe that places like the federal reserve have more influence, who has had half of their presidents be jewish. I believe the people who are running the world are ones who claim to be Jewish.

       I understand how you can conclude that the Federal Reserve is the seat of power, sure. I just don't understand why after that you start searching for a race / ethnicity angle and conclude that it's really a Jewish thing.

       There is a few people here that are actually probably racists and I don't agree with it but you can't say if a Jewish person or a group of Jewish people does something wrong then it can't be discussed. It'd be like saying that you can't criticise Muslims because a lot were slaughtered in the crusades, you can criticise a black man because of slavery and you can't say anything bad about Jews because of the Holocaust. Everyone is on an equal footing in my eyes and that means everyone is open to criticism regardless of historical horrors. I'm also open to free speech and don't want to see this sub turn like the others where domains are banned because a group of people don't like it. That leads to the levels of discussion being narrowed so it doesn't even exist.

       The down vote button is there for a reason and if you spot people being abusive or racist, report it to the mods.

       No problem and I don't really disagree with your comment that there is a little more racism here (from certain users) but it's a very small but vocal minority. People try and use that to accuse the whole sub of being racists. I've been here for over three years under different accounts and I've honestly seen less than ten bonafide racists that regularly post racist material. Then there's people that come here and post racist material for ulterior motives and that is to make the racism look worse than it is. That person (in one instance) was a moderator of several large sub-reddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's racists here but there's also an effort by groups of people to make it worse. This sub is one of the most open in terms of allowed discussions and it should stay that way. Just down vote actual racism and call them out if you feel you should.

       Racism of any sort is abhorrent. Worse, especially for people who fancy themselves "free-thinkers", its presence in a person renders them much more controllable. Not as much as being fanatically religious, but more than not being artificially predisposed to it.

       "Anti-semitism" is a meaningless propaganda term.  Palestinians are equally if not more "semitic" than Israeli Jews (many of which have European lineage) if you use the original definition.  Do your research.

       A Jew is not a Zionist. It's like square-rectangle. Not every Jew is a Zionist. But all Zionist happen to be Jewish. Another example.  Not every African American is good at basketball. But in the NBA almost every player is African American. I don't get this racism argument.  I am not anti Semitic.  I have a Jewish roommate that I chose.  I've had other Jewish roommates. The Zionist use the cloak of the persecuted Jewish so when somebody says something they are called anti Semitic.

       Here's how the Jewish virtual library (
       <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/zionism.html">
        http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/zionism.html
       </a>
       ) defines Zionism:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The term “Zionism” was coined in 1890 by Nathan Birnbaum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Its general definition means the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By that definition, it would seem like anyone of any religion or race could potentially agree with Zionism. Anyone who agrees the Jewish people (be it race or religion, I guess) should have sovereignty over Israel is a Zionist. Not all squares are rectangles, in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not how the terms Zionism or Zionist are used in this sub.

       What other group of people have a "right" to land
       <em>

       I literally just said "it's not a factor" them being Jewish did not even occur to me until after I was their roommate.  So I didn't think if them as Jewish.  And your black friend quip points out nothing. I knew somebody would go there. But if I have a roommate, discover he's Jewish and continue to live with him happily, then get a new roommate and again discover he's Jewish.  Again nothing. It WAS NOT A FACTOR. I don't get what you don't understand. You don't even know me yet you're sure I'm anti Semitic? I didn't make it about race ever this post did and people like you that can't separate the intended use of the word.  Some people use Zionism in relation to the definition you presented .  Others see it a different way .  It's you who are racist as you're bringing race into.

       How on earth did I treat my roommates differently because they're Jewish? That's the point I've been making. I didn't even factor that into my thinking of them as a person.  This is a witch hunt.  You did bring race into it. The thread was about race. I denied being anti Semitic and racist because I am not racists. Sure I note that my friend mike is black.  The same way I note my friend Scott is tall.  It's physical characteristics that you can't deny you notice.  But I do not treat or view anybody differently because of race or religion.  So just denying you're a racist makes you a racist?

       Anybody who follows a faith puts a label on themselves. It is the duty of an accepting normal human to not factor that into their judgement of the person. Yet they still are labeling themselves Jewish. And if I've had two, I believe things have gone quite well.  Never fight or anything.  Good friends. I do not treat him differently from when I didn't know he was Jewish to now. Therefore this "label" you're saying I put on him a) doesn't exist b) does not affect how I view or treat him. Good bye.  Good try though.

       Of course, you're not going to understand that because you can't see that your roommate is, in your mind, your Jewish roommate and not your roommate, and that's the problem.

       And no you shouldn't call out bigotry, you should argue against the message instead of the messenger.  If the statement that struck you as bigotry is so blatantly bigoted than it should easy to argue against.  Unless of course the accusations of bigotry themselves are nothing more than a knee jerk defense mechanism to avoid actually debating the topic at hand.

       This is how the rule reads, it doesn't say that offensive comments or posts will be removed.  It doesn't say that racists domains will be banned or that racists users aren't allowed.  If the OP can follow the rules then its allowed.  Nobody is forcing you to click the link.

       I think he's most likely referring to the irony of someone with a little bit of power in a
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       actually abusing that power to the extent that his enforcement of rules is based on his opinions on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're giving the impression that you only enforce rules against people that disagree with you, but if someone breaks the rules by being as bigoted as you are, you do nothing.  In fact in another comment you told people not to report bigots, but rather to debate them on the merits of their bigotry.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is absurd guidance to give as a moderator.  You have to know that.  People come to this subreddit to discuss people abusing power, and they run into moderators that scour other subreddits banning people for what they say elsewhere on reddit, and only enforcing rules against people they personally disagree with.  I wouldn't call it scary, I'd call it unsettling.  And obviously very ironic to see someone power tripping in

       It seems you're a bigot because you just devoted an entire comment to defending antisemites by attacking "Zionists".  If you're going to be an antisemite, at least have the courage of your convictions to just say it.  Subtly hinting at it and beating around the bush seems a little passive aggressive to the reader.

       Can you cite a time when you've admitted you were wrong, and someone else was right?  If not, we both know exactly who you are, and it's pointless to further discuss anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, your hatred of Conspiratard seems more than a little paranoid.  I get the impression that you spend more time browsing it than any of their actual contributors.  If there's an entire community that doesn't like you personally, it's far more likely that there's something wrong with you, than something wrong with everyone else.

       You don't strike me as the kind of guy that does much self reflection or self improvement though, so I'll just be on my way and leave to with your denial.

       That's your example?  In which you complain about other mods not letting you have enough power, then finish by patting yourself on the back for being the best of them all?

       I can't tell if you're serious, or if your entire online persona is some elaborate satirical performance art piece that I'm not understanding.

       That's a relief.  So I take it that means no one has to worry about being banned for being critical of you right?  I'd imagine a man of your honor and integrity can handle criticism without being petty.  Especially after you just came out as such an advocate of being critical of everyone.

         Flytape makes an impassioned post denouncing hatred and anti-semitism of Hitler era Germany. Nah just kidding. He defends Nazis, promotes Hitler&amp;#x27;s propaganda and tries to reason why racist links and discussions are left up in /conspiracy

       Perhaps we should wait until their kill count reaches the millions before we raise awareness of their xenophobic collision course with national socialism?

       That seems to be what you're suggesting, that current atrocities don't really count until they reach or surpass those of Nazi Germany.
