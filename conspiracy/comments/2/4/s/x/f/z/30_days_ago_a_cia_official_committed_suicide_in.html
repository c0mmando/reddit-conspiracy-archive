       This article in the
       <em>
        Washington Free Beacon
       </em>
       was the only source of info (all other articles merely repeated the vague details from the Free Beacon)

       Even stranger still was the TIMING of the release of the article: 11:46 PM on a Friday night. It was also just one day after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence had voted to release the $40 million Torture Report which looked into CIA actions in the post-9/11 era. There was also some hearings on Benghazi that week as well...
      </p>
      <p>
       So NO ONE at any news organization has been able to follow-up on this in the past month?

       Does U.S. law apply anymore to the office complexes and malls which house the public/private intelligence agencies? Some of you may not know that, just as college students populate college towns--there is now a huge, wealthy community which is employed by the public/private intelligence sector and has invaded areas around DC...some of the office complexes look like 4 story commercial office buildings--but, in fact, go underground 12 stories...some complexes have their own malls so the agents don’t have to go to a store with regular ol’ Americans...

       I live right near where the suicide happened and have gotten no information about it. Are you in the NOVA area ? There are cia annexes all of this place. I even found one on Google maps in the Reston area . There is also a German "military base " here as well. I wonder if most people know there are foreign troops on our soil ? I drove by the building and it just looked like an office building but still very interesting

       This would imply that news organizations still did any of their own investigative reporting instead of being told what to say.

       I agree, though - very suspicious death.  I wonder if it ties into the "suicide by nailgun" and all of the other ludicrous "suicides" in recent months.

       I wondered the same thing while reading the pegasus file.They allude to the fact that the cabal was trying to recruit people for a while and they had difficulty. Tatum also says that people in the black ops world tend not to last too long.
      </p>

       I guess you have to be a power-hungry psychopath to work with these people. The chance that they get killed is a risk worth taking to them considering the power and money they could gain.

       any update on that suicide/murder of the female FBI agent/specialist, the one who gave the two day testimony at that $2 billion fraud trial, according to news, she went back to the hotel and shot herself.

       There was another CIA agent who committed "suicide," Frank Olson, by "jumping" to his death. Another way to describe what happened is that he was dosed unwittingly with LSD, hit in the head with a hammer, and tossed. Why ask questions though?

       Trying to sell this with a sprinkle of Benghazi was probably a bad choice. When I see Benghazi, it's like Orley Taitz and the Birth Certificate hunt.

       Did he say he has the right to it?  I don't see anybody saying we have a right to the information.

       However, it is suspicious that they are withholding information and not reporting on it.  It's odd to say the least.

       Personally, I don't think it's common knowledge to not release someone's name if they commit suicide and worked at the CIA, so if someone thinks it's odd, that's justified in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, it's odd to release the fact that a CIA operative committed suicide if you
       <em>
        aren't
       </em>
       going to follow up on the story.  If it's sensitive information why even tell people it happened?

       They have to release at least the death.  If the CIA agent just went "missing" then there would be far more suspicion, especially from the family.  If it was deemed a suicide then most people will just forget about it within a day or so.  I know nothing about the situation, but generally suicides are investigated and reported pretty thoroughly.
