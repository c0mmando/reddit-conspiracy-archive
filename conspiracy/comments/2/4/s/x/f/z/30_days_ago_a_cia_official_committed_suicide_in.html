<p>Even stranger still was the TIMING of the release of the article: 11:46 PM on a Friday night. It was also just one day after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence had voted to release the $40 million Torture Report which looked into CIA actions in the post-9/11 era. There was also some hearings on Benghazi that week as well...</p>

<p>So NO ONE at any news organization has been able to follow-up on this in the past month? </p>

Some of you may not know that, just as college students populate college towns--there is now a huge, wealthy community which is employed by the public/private intelligence sector and has invaded areas around DC...some of the office complexes look like 4 story commercial office buildings--but, in fact, go underground 12 stories...some complexes have their own malls so the agents don’t have to go to a store with regular ol’ Americans...</p>

I even found one on Google maps in the Reston area . There is also a German &quot;military base &quot; here as well. I wonder if most people know there are foreign troops on our soil ? I drove by the building and it just looked like an office building but still very interesting</p>

<p>This would imply that news organizations still did any of their own investigative reporting instead of being told what to say.</p>

<p>I agree, though - very suspicious death.  I wonder if it ties into the &quot;suicide by nailgun&quot; and all of the other ludicrous &quot;suicides&quot; in recent months.</p>

<p>I guess you have to be a power-hungry psychopath to work with these people. The chance that they get killed is a risk worth taking to them considering the power and money they could gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s common knowledge to not release someone&#39;s name if they commit suicide and worked at the CIA, so if someone thinks it&#39;s odd, that&#39;s justified in mind.  </p>

<p>Plus, it&#39;s odd to release the fact that a CIA operative committed suicide if you <em>aren&#39;t</em> going to follow up on the story.  If it&#39;s sensitive information why even tell people it happened?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have to release at least the death.  If the CIA agent just went &quot;missing&quot; then there would be far more suspicion, especially from the family.  If it was deemed a suicide then most people will just forget about it within a day or so.  I know nothing about the situation, but generally suicides are investigated and reported pretty thoroughly.  </p>
