       Why do you guys think that this sub has so many people that hate and ridicule all the common topics we discuss here? I don't like to talk or learn about planes so I'm not interested in r/planes. But I would never go into
       <a href="/r/planes">
        /r/planes
       </a>
       and waste my time telling them how stupid they are and that they are idiots for being interested in that topic.

       is the only sub I know of that has a separate dedicated sub that exists only to mock it,
       <a href="/r/conspiritard">
        /r/conspiritard
       </a>
       (correct me if I'm wrong). What are these people wasting their time for? Why would anybody spend their time trying to knock down ideas unless they felt threatened by those ideas?

       You're onto a conspiracy in and of itself.  The majority of 'tard's power users are dedicated to pointing out every single instance of anti-israel expression on reddit....to the point of being almost paranoid/delusional about it.

       I had a prolific conspiratard mod call me a jew-hating anti-semite for doing nothing more than asking questions about 9/11. I was very confused how he made that logical leap, but then I learned more and now it makes more sense. He was just ahead of the curve and must have known where the evidence would eventually lead any 9/11 reseacher.

       Zionists have their own internet legions to marginalize and distort information, plus people knee jerk defensively, like a pack of monkeys when presented with ideals that threaten their world perception. So many people are so inbred on infotainment and the CIA's M.K. Ultra, so in a way you have to sneak the information in past their media trained firewalls, with humor such as what George Carlin did.

       I have noticed there are certain dedicated users who only respond to certain topics.  Without naming names, I know which ones will show up and argue based on the topic.  Like anything 9/11 related brings a group of users who only argue against 9/11.  I never see these people create new discussions or threads here related to 9/11 in this sub, only playing the role of devils advocate.   Why all the effort to make sure the people "know" the official story is correct?   I mean we are 13 years removed from 9/11 and you have people on this sub who only come here to scream at you saying you are not allowed to ask questions about 9/11.  What does that say?

I do see the crossover.
Personally I find it hard to take the opinion of a doxxing guy who got shadowbanned who made a stalker sub that was SUPER sad that only you used, who spends all his waking moment talking about conspiratard seriously.
This is a sub for making fun of theorists. But you personally see thgis as a place where we just love and defend Jews, right?
The thing is, if you were able to recognise anti-semitism and say "This is anti-semitic" whenever a literal holocaust denier posts, then we wouldn't have a leg to stand on when we say "those guys REALLY tolerate anti-semites, don't they?"
Instead you focus on how the other side uses the word "anti-semite" as if that's relevant.
Honestly it baffles me you wander outside

       The JTRIG leaks proved that the government does in fact pay people to post propaganda on message boards. Reddit is one of the largest communities on the internet, you don't think a few parties would want a piece of that traffic?

       Please refrain from making shill accusations against other users in the sub. It's against the rules here, contributes nothing to the conversation and/or debate, and is most often factually inaccurate.

      <p>
       You're free to discuss the existence of shills in general, perhaps even expose those in other subs. Just try to avoid referring to anyone who happens to disagree with you or whom you have unsubstantiated suspicions about as a "shill" when posting here.

       Yeah, no. That's not quite how it works. The vast of majority of shill accusations are simply removed, regardless of who posts them. Occasionally, I'll issue a warning. Given the nature of this post, I decided a warning would be best, primarily to clarify why we have this rule to other users.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as I mentioned prior, one is still free to discuss the existence of shills openly, programs such as JTRIG or JIDF tactics, or even perhaps call out other users as alleged shills who had posted in another sub. If you, on the other hand, decide to levy such an accusation against another user here in this sub, as the phrase is often over used and used without justification, and as we have a rule against doing so for that very reason, the comment will simply be removed in most instances. And again, a polite warning may be issued if one user is harassing another in the process, if the a user makes these accusations excessively and without justification, or in other rare instances wherein a mod considers it necessary to clarify their position in enforcing said rule, so that the users here are more aware of the reasoning behind it.

       Most of the images posted there are very petty and point out minute elements of a particular "conspiracy theory", never actually succeeding in contradicting or even addressing the larger idea.. very close-minded people on there, just trying to maintain their worldview.

       I think it's different because of the attitude of the different groups. r/Conspiratard reminds me of the r/EnoughPaulSpam or r/EnoughObamaSpam subs. It exists to mock/ridicule the opposing opinion, and to organize downvote brigades. To me, it's like the jerks in high school who have no lives other than hating other people because they a certain way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people here (not everyone) are concerned about vaccines based on evidence or research they have read which stated vaccines are potentially more harmful than helpful. It's more out of a sense of caution and debate than organized juvenile ridicule.

       I've seen examples of civility and uncivility in both subreddits, but it's mostly just this one that sees the

       If people are concerned then they can discuss things in a rational, civil manner.  Some can do this, others can't.  I believe OP is referring to the latter.  I also believe that you know what OP meant and that I shouldn't have to explain it.

Not vaccinating your children because you believe it causes autism directly threatens the health of those who cannot be vaccinated. For instance.

       Just curious, did you spend more than 2 hours researching vaccines or did you just let someone else do the thinking for you when it comes to your kids safety?

       I had childhood whooping cough. Vaccines weren't available to my parents. It left me with permanent lung problems. I am now a research scientist, and I honestly believe that anyone who has access to vaccines for diseases that kill or cause permanent damage, and choose not to use them because of the risk of complications, are idiots who have been fortunate enough to have never experienced those diseases.

       Part I, this is my own research, you can self verify my sources if you want and see if any of these dots line up for yourself. Its also important to note that Vaccinations do kill children, its right there in the vaccination funds own stats
       <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html">
        http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html
       </a>
       , so for every life it "saves" how many will be killed and how many will suffer your fate, a fate it was supposedly manufactured to prevent. That is not to say that vaccinations are not without their uses, but as the industry is now, well, you'll know if you read it out and check the sources for yourself, and form an informed opinion for yourself, you'll know that our consent on this issue is totally manufactured, as in
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">
        manufactured consent
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people get their information on vaccination from propaganda from corporate, government subsidized mainstream media sites, you've been lied to pretty hard and here's why, I'll try to explain it as expediently as I can, and there's a tons of info on vaccination production which I don't think you or anyone else outside of this subreddit, is fully aware off, to the excruciating detriment of us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know, that the U.S. created
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">
        Vaccinations Courts
       </a>
       , and a
       <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html">
        Vaccination Fund
       </a>
       which can easily deflect lawsuits aimed at the Big Five Pharmaceutical Corporations. Not only that, in this government created,

       for short can decide, a government apparatus, can decide what the cause of harm is to your person, instead of a normal court of law. This all flies in the face of the fact that the rates of Autism have exploded since
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html">
        2000 where 1 in 150 U.S. children had autism to now there being 1 in 68 children with Autism as off 2013

       . In Canada for boys its worse!,
       <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.ca/about-autism/facts-and-stats/">
        1 in 42 boys will contract Autism this year, though for girls 1 in 189 will develop Autism as of 2014
       </a>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been already cases which have obviously shown, by lawyers and doctors of victims that vaccination induced
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy">
        encephalopathy (brain disease)
       </a>
       lead directly to Autism.
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/post2468343_b_2468343.html">
        Not only has this been clearly shown in a court of law
       </a>
       , where HHS, a government body openly decided against damning evidence of medical professionals which clearly showed the direct link between vaccination and autism. They have repeatedly in every case said that vaccination do not cause Autism, only in this corporate judicial system is this nightmare possible.

       What motivation does big pharmaceutical have for making shoddy drugs and selling it to the public?
       <a href="http://vactruth.com/2012/11/30/2011-billions-vaccine-manufacturers">
        Merck alone earns more then 1.5 billion dollars from child vaccinations, the other four each receive over a billion from the government

       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/post2468343_b_2468343.html">
        the government also shields and buries cases which clearly have seen a direct causal link between vaccinations and Autism

       People love to say stupid uninformed things like, vaccinations are solid science, or why would scientists and doctors kill us with totally defective pharmaceutical products? Vaccine drugs not even effective in preventing outbreaks, but are the actual sources of current day outbreaks themselves. Fact, vaccinations last only a few years, actual viral infection and normal body white cell response creates a
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">
        life time of immunity from the virus itself
       </a>
       . Fact, most doctors receive
       <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/health-concerns/vaccines/do-doctors-have-financial-incentive-get-their-patients-fully-vaccinated">
        financial incentives
       </a>
       from big pharmaceuticals to immunize your children with a full bombardment of drugs(vaccinations), often at birth or in the first critical months of their lives. Some people for some reason think Doctors and Scientists are morally superior beings, that is one of the greatest perceptual fallacies in North America. These people operate with the naive and blind trust of the public when in fact they're just human beings out to make a quick buck. Do these people care enough to actually research vaccination development? Probably not, arm chair citizen researchers know more about it then doctors because they've actually done the research themselves. It should be obviously noted that doctors are not gods, the medical sphere is massive, specialization takes years in one specific study. Their knowledge and understanding of other medical fields is particularly acute and limited, it's not such a stupid idea that an internet researcher could know far more about drug vaccinations then a medical family physician, lest we forget
       <a href="http://tenpennyimc.com/2011/12/24/why-do-doctors-push-vaccines/">

       Here's the other kicker, vaccination production, vaccinations aren't made in just chicken eggs, they've made from cows and monkeys as well. So what, farm animals, what's the problem there?
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeMYl_UH8Mo">
        Bayer made a batch of vaccinations from HIV infected monkey's and sold it in the North American market, when it was discovered the FDA and the U.S. federal government allowed Bayer to sell the HIV laden drugs to other countries, countries in Europe, Asia and in Aids ridden Africa so that they could turn a back a profit on it. Why did they use HIV monkeys? because these African monkeys where cheaper to purchase then monkeys from other countries. Not only that not one person in Bayer was held legally responsible for this in the United States, yet in every other country they sold it in, their executives where hunted in the individual countries judicial system.
       </a>
       Here's the other problem, we cannot filter out the
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1m3TjokVU4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">
        dna of these animals from which we create vaccinations, this means viral contaminates like HIV, madcow(prions), antibiotic super viruses can spread from animal

       to vaccine to human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note on antibiotic super viruses/bacteria: Pigs, chickens and cows are all given hormone boosters to quicken the development of muscle mass and milk production.

       has already been shown to be dangerous to humans who even eat or drink cow byproduct of any kind as the U.S. is the only G7 member to allow it for commercial use in the development of food product. Animals are also given huge amounts of antibiotics to keep them healthy in super
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_animal_farming">

       </a>
       , it spreads quite a bit the group. Some of these animals are diverted and sold to vaccination development. The other fun fact is that

        eggs are one of the primary carriers of salmonella food poisoning

       You welcome!, be sure to read up and share, we need to yank people out of the machine, because the stupidity and ignorance of others is a detriment to us all... and even our civil liberties... To collect this info took a fair amount of time, maybe a month or two after I awoke from finding the real independent media. I just argued with others in the Canada subreddit of an one for some times and a few other people found me ringing it out and they dropped a ton of information on me, which helped significantly to inform my opinion on vaccinations and the pharmaceutical industry.

       I mean, my point was kind of not to freak out, because shit just happens.  For the vaccinations, the numbers showed reactions in less than 1 in a million doses, which is much less than the problems during a real outbreak.

       The Hepatitis A outbreak was this one:

       It's a virus that goes away however, not very serious, unlike Hep B which stays around.

       I'm afraid berries and drugs are not the same thing, one is heavily manufactured, in such that the scientists who do produce the drugs always notify the corporate end of any, undesirable effects. In every single case of litigation faulty drugs were sold with the full understanding of their defects, which were intentionally hidden, and that they could easily cause significant damage to the consumer. With a vaccination court and a vaccine fund, there is virtually no incentive for them not to release cheap and defective garbage into the market, these pharmaceutical CEOs are all chronic and greedy psychopathic liars, this is a risk that is being planted against us by the corrupt government with intentional malice and

       This is true, while only

        1/4 of the cases before the vaccination fund were given compensation
       </a>
       , this does not account for the vaccination court, or the fact that people and their doctors are brainwashed against the association of vaccination to injury of their persons. The number of actual claimants given the extremely obvious, manufactured consent of the public could easily be in the millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing that I was pointing out was that vaccination is not the cure all that people like to think it is, as exampled by Polio during its endemic period was treated heavily with the usage of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT">
        DDT
       </a>
       , it was
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yagO9jngMWk">
        literally sprayed on every single thing imaginable
       </a>
       , this garbage is a known neural toxin, just like regular pesticides people spray currently on their front lawns in cities that've yet to ban it. DDT also caused symptoms of Polio, which is unsurprising as both cause brain damage, also to note only one strain of polio is lethal, as it damages the brain stem. The other thing is that people with healthy diets, such as a
       <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/sugar-facts-myths-zmaz71sozgoe.aspx#axzz30zLmrF5X">

       </a>
       diet had extremely low infection rates, around and below 6% as shown here from the

        30min-37min mark
       </a>
       , which compared to the 60% infection rates of sugar eaters is quite remarkable. Sugar is
       <a href="http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/health-effects-of-sugar">
        extremely detrimental to your overall health, white, brown, its all heavily processed sucrose, so that tidbit about it being an enabler of infection doesn't come as much of a surprise now...

       Guess you're still not seeing the obvious, vaccinations while useful are not as necessary as you or the government's corporate,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">
        manufactured consent
       </a>
       leads on. Outbreaks in polio and other viruses where brought on by poor sanitation, DDT(chemical insecticide based on Agent Orange), poor diets(sugar and processed foods). Same thing today as well, except the government can actually, and effectively contain and stop lethal outbreaks, such as SARs without a vaccine. All kids need are the basic one timer vaccines, measles, rubella, but even there I've yet to adequately if at all research those, also doctors here informed me that the hepatitis shots are rather pointless unless you plan to travel to a brick nation or a third world country, along with this is the $1000 hepatitis C cure pill, sure not so cheap presently, but hopefully conveniently affordable in a few years. The point is that all this extra crap is unnecessary, flu shots aren't necessary, its total B.S. all you need is a system that keeps sick nurses and doctors out of the system when their ill, same for responsible employers, but this country does not value the well being of the individual or the employee, also it doesn't help the fact that

       The final and massively colossal problem is Autism, 1 in 68 as of 2013 for U.S. kids,

        1 in 48 boys, 1 in 189 girls in Canada will have it
       </a>
       , the explosive growth of this is directly attributable to vaccinations and the now annual vaccination rounds by those "trustworthy" pharmaceutical corporations. Suing won't even help you because the government is corrupt beyond redemption. It also costs a small fortune to rehabilitate children with low to mild forms of autism, let alone children with severe autism. Autism effectively destroys the economic capability of children with it, and makes them into an enormous financial liability to themselves in their economic prospects and to their parents, which is something that can severely impede them given that we've had two depressions in the last thirteen years, one being 2001 and 2008, well unless you're involved in the military industrial complex, the banks, the hospitals or the insurance companies who now have a colossal new pool of insured suckers thanks to the unconstitutional Obamacare bill which forces people to pay for insurance, without a choice, a bill written by an active insurance executive now CEO in the medical industry, who goes by the name of

       I was wondering if thimerosal alone was the problem, but it doesn't seem to be (as far as autism is concerned).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since 2001, no new vaccine licensed by FDA for use in children has contained thimerosal as a preservative and all vaccines routinely recommended by CDC for children younger than 6 years of age have been thimerosal-free, or contain only trace amounts of thimerosal, except for some formulations of influenza vaccine. Unfortunately, reductions in the numbers of children identified with autism have not been observed indicating that the cause of autism is not related to a single exposure such as thimerosal.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe it's something else, but it just doesn't seem likely to be because of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is definitely known, however, that older fathers increase the likelyhood of autism.  Weaker sperm, so IV also counts as a risk factor.  I know two men who became first time fathers in their 40s, and several couples who have had IV.  That, in combination with greater identification of autism (and what counts as autism) are more likely to explain the rise.

       This is a weak premise, and not even a feasible explanation for the explosion of Autism since 2000, parents are having children later in life due to the severe economic disparity created by the banks in the recurrent deflations they cause. However this minority of aged parents is to small to explain the systemic spread of Autism, let alone the lack of anything hard to substantiate such a claim directly to autism. Vaccinations are given to a majority of children,

       Thimerosal isn't even the worst of it, even without it the effects are still the same, the information in the original links which include some videos about vaccination production clearly show why vaccines are so toxic, this is not including the facts that people who're freshly vaccinated are often the source of outbreaks.

       Note on Asia Pacific and Chinese seafood which is sold as a majority of seafood product in North America, you do not want to buy it from China because obviously your asking for trouble, and second the radiation from Fukushima Daiichi is scheduled to hit our shores this year, in which there has been elevated levels of radiation detected already in the ocean water. The government is not reporting this to the general public to protect their regional ally in the Asia pacific as efforts progress to contain the Chinese military. All fish from the region likely contains traces of radioactivity from the failed reactors, even as early as of last year as Tuna migrates straight of the eastern coast of Japan where concentrations of radioactive materials are highest...

       The mercury in fish is relatively recent, due to large scale industrial pollution (e.g. from over 30 years of continual dumping in

       I was making a comparative analysis to the typical intake of tuna consumption here versus the direct intravenous injection of the mercury based preservative into the blood stream at a significantly higher concentration. You're also correct to reference my own quote, mercury is not safe at any level, but people still like shrug it off with comparisons of other things as some sort of justification for its use in vaccination. Mercury in fish is quite the concern, I too have pondered consumption of tuna for some time, especially since almost all of it at local stores comes from "Thailand" which is basically the Asia Pacific, as well it doesn't help that the country is in the ecological shadow of China...

       Can't copy and paste the whole pdf here without it looking like soup, I had to rearrange the formatting for the pdf quote manually which took some time, you may need to update your adobe software to view the document.

       , though the Japanese government seems to have in large part contained the bay and cleaned up a significant amount of bay sledge, and now the nets guarding the bay from fish have been removed as of 1997 followed by a government declaration of the bay as a safe site. Though it took the government four decades to acknowledge responsibility and an apology for the pollution of the bay, so take that safe site warning with a grain of salt...

       <p>
        From the beginning doctors are taught only the basic theories about of how vaccines work. They are told vaccines are safe and beneficial, and are directed to follow the ever-expanding vaccination schedules designed for children and adults. The vast majority robotically follow the recommendations, never questioning the safety or effectiveness of the directives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most physicians no doubt believe they are contributing to the health of vaccinated individuals and promoting the greater good of society. Few, if any, connect the deterioration of our nation’s health with the bloated vaccination schedule that now injects 40 doses of 16 vaccines into tiny bodies by five years of age. Indeed, more recently trained doctors may look at a truly healthy child as an anomaly. Their only experience has been treating children with diseases that are vaccine-induced but somehow thought to be part of “normal development.” When did doctors start believing that speech delays, sensory-integration disorders, asthma and eczema are normal parts of childhood? Why have doctors – and parents – accepted that attending OT, PT and speech therapy are “normal” parts of growing up?
       </p>
       <p>
        There are not-so-subtle financial incentives that drive doctors to become vaccine pushers. I have read that pediatricians can earn a significant percentage of their income from vaccination, meaning, vaccines they push vaccines on their patients to keep a positive balance sheet. After all, a medical practice is a business, with sizable expenses such as malpractice insurance, staff salaries and rent. For physicians who are employees of a hospital system, there are fee quotas to meet so they can receive bonuses. Many of the vaccines in the inventory are expensive (for example, Gardasil and MMR) and some have very short expiration dates (i.e., flu shots and Flumist). Purchased vaccines need to be administered for costs to be recouped, and adding a shot, or shots, to a routine office visit generates more revenue. There is little doubt that financial pressures play a role in the thought process of those who push vaccination.

Indeed, more recently trained doctors may look at a truly healthy child as an anomaly. Their only experience has been treating children with diseases that are vaccine-induced but somehow thought to be part of “normal development.” When did doctors start believing that speech delays, sensory-integration disorders, asthma and eczema are normal parts of childhood? Why have doctors – and parents – accepted that attending OT, PT and speech therapy are “normal” parts of growing up?
       </p>
       <p>
        There are not-so-subtle financial incentives that drive doctors to become vaccine pushers. I have read that pediatricians can earn a significant percentage of their income from vaccination, meaning, vaccines they push vaccines on their patients to keep a positive balance sheet. After all, a medical practice is a business, with sizable expenses such as malpractice insurance, staff salaries and rent. For physicians who are employees of a hospital system, there are fee quotas to meet so they can receive bonuses. Many of the vaccines in the inventory are expensive (for example, Gardasil and MMR) and some have very short expiration dates (i.e., flu shots and Flumist). Purchased vaccines need to be administered for costs to be recouped, and adding a shot, or shots, to a routine office visit generates more revenue. There is little doubt that financial pressures play a role in the thought process of those who push vaccination.

       The man who "debunked" the links between vaccines and autism also happened to "live tweet" the Boston Crime Spree and took a photo of the famous "Boston Naked Man" and pretended that it was someone other than the Boston Marathon Bombing suspect. In other words, he is a paid liar who shouldn't be taken seriously.

       Most people get their information on vaccination from propaganda from corporate, government subsidized mainstream media sites, you've been lied to pretty hard and here's why, I'll try to explain it as expediently as I can, and there's a tons of info on vaccination production which I don't think you or anyone else outside of this subreddit, is fully aware off, to the excruciating detriment of us all.

       for short can decide, a government apparatus, can decide what the cause of harm is to your person, instead of a normal court of law. This all flies in the face of the fact that the rates of Autism have exploded since

       There have been already cases which have obviously shown, by lawyers and doctors of victims that vaccination induced
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy">

        Not only has this been clearly shown in a court of law
       </a>
       , where HHS, a government body openly decided against damning evidence of medical professionals which clearly showed the direct link between vaccination and autism. They have repeatedly in every case said that vaccination do not cause Autism, only in this corporate judicial system is this nightmare possible.

       What motivation does big pharmaceutical have for making shoddy drugs and selling it to the public?

       People love to say stupid uninformed things like, vaccinations are solid science, or why would scientists and doctors kill us with totally defective pharmaceutical products? Vaccine drugs not even effective in preventing outbreaks, but are the actual sources of current day outbreaks themselves. Fact, vaccinations last only a few years, actual viral infection and normal body white cell response creates a

        life time of immunity from the virus itself
       </a>
       . Fact, most doctors receive

        financial incentives
       </a>
       from big pharmaceuticals to immunize your children with a full bombardment of drugs(vaccinations), often at birth or in the first critical months of their lives. Some people for some reason think Doctors and Scientists are morally superior beings, that is one of the greatest perceptual fallacies in North America. These people operate with the naive and blind trust of the public when in fact they're just human beings out to make a quick buck. Do these people care enough to actually research vaccination development? Probably not, arm chair citizen researchers know more about it then doctors because they've actually done the research themselves. It should be obviously noted that doctors are not gods, the medical sphere is massive, specialization takes years in one specific study. Their knowledge and understanding of other medical fields is particularly acute and limited, it's not such a stupid idea that an internet researcher could know far more about drug vaccinations then a medical family physician, lest we forget

       Here's the other kicker, vaccination production, vaccinations aren't made in just chicken eggs, they've made from cows and monkeys as well. So what, farm animals, what's the problem there?
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeMYl_UH8Mo">
        Bayer made a batch of vaccinations from HIV infected monkey's and sold it in the North American market, when it was discovered the FDA and the U.S. federal government allowed Bayer to sell the HIV laden drugs to other countries, countries in Europe, Asia and in Aids ridden Africa so that they could turn a back a profit on it. Why did they use HIV monkeys? because these African monkeys where cheaper to purchase then monkeys from other countries. Not only that not one person in Bayer was held legally responsible for this in the United States, yet in every other country they sold it in, their executives where hunted in the individual countries judicial system.
       </a>
       Here's the other problem, we cannot filter out the

       Side note on antibiotic super viruses/bacteria: Pigs, chickens and cows are all given hormone boosters to quicken the development of muscle mass and milk production.

        Operating room nurse Pauline Taylor knows her refusal to get a flu shot is based on faulty logic.
       </p>
       <p>
        But ever since she got sick after getting a shot a few years ago, she's sworn off the vaccine.
       </p>
       <p>
        "I rarely get sick. The only thing I could narrow it down to is that I had gotten this shot," said Taylor, who works at University Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. "I know that it's not a live virus. It just seemed pretty coincidental."

        <strong>
         nearly 60 percent of health care workers fail to get a flu shot.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        That's despite recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that all health care workers get vaccinated, from hospital volunteers to doctors.

        "We don't think that demonizing those who choose not to be vaccinated is an appropriate response," states United Nurses of Alberta president Heather Smith, who also challenges the official view that flu immunizations are effective. Other nursing associations agree. The Ontario Nurses' Association plans to file grievances against hospitals that require them to either become vaccinated or wear a face mask. In the U.S., National Nurses United, the country's largest organization of nurses, cites a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that found increased flu vaccination rates didn't lower death rates among the elderly, as is often claimed, or among any other age group either.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stated National Nurses United president Karen Higgins last year, "nurses, joined by many physician organizations and researchers, reject the notion that vaccination is a fail-safe solution to prevent the spread of the flu virus... there are health reasons why some elect not to be vaccinated.
        <strong>
         Some vaccine products have been withdrawn, as when Bell's palsy developed for many recipients
        </strong>
        . It has just been reported that 800 European children contracted narcolepsy, an incurable sleep disorder, after receiving the swine flu vaccine." The notion that the flu vaccine can be both ineffective and harmful, a CDC survey confirms, is common among health care workers.

       Financial incentives for medical care workers to vaccinate:

      </p>
      <p>
       Most doctors do not know anything about the real nature of vaccinations, they're just as brainwashed as the general public and not only that, their financially incentivized to believe and push this garbage on us.

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From the beginning doctors are taught only the basic theories about of how vaccines work. They are told vaccines are safe and beneficial, and are directed to follow the ever-expanding vaccination schedules designed for children and adults. The vast majority robotically follow the recommendations, never questioning the safety or effectiveness of the directives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most physicians no doubt believe they are contributing to the health of vaccinated individuals and promoting the greater good of society. Few, if any, connect the deterioration of our nation’s health with the bloated vaccination schedule that now injects 40 doses of 16 vaccines into tiny bodies by five years of age. Indeed, more recently trained doctors may look at a truly healthy child as an anomaly. Their only experience has been treating children with diseases that are vaccine-induced but somehow thought to be part of “normal development.” When did doctors start believing that speech delays, sensory-integration disorders, asthma and eczema are normal parts of childhood? Why have doctors – and parents – accepted that attending OT, PT and speech therapy are “normal” parts of growing up?
       </p>
       <p>
        There are not-so-subtle financial incentives that drive doctors to become vaccine pushers. I have read that pediatricians can earn a significant percentage of their income from vaccination, meaning, vaccines they push vaccines on their patients to keep a positive balance sheet. After all, a medical practice is a business, with sizable expenses such as malpractice insurance, staff salaries and rent. For physicians who are employees of a hospital system, there are fee quotas to meet so they can receive bonuses. Many of the vaccines in the inventory are expensive (for example, Gardasil and MMR) and some have very short expiration dates (i.e., flu shots and Flumist). Purchased vaccines need to be administered for costs to be recouped, and adding a shot, or shots, to a routine office visit generates more revenue. There is little doubt that financial pressures play a role in the thought process of those who push vaccination.

       I honestly think some of it can be attributed to the larger elite push to ridicule and marginalize discussion of real issues affecting our world. This is being done through many media platforms-- and I think that, possibly, people are being employed on the ground level to spread the message that what we think about in an environment like this subreddit is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       worth pursuing and does

       Oh, I gotcha now.  It seems like any relatively large subs that do not toe the liberal, left-leaning, progressive line (which is easily reddit's primary demo) inevitably get their own groupie subs.

       If you had billions of dollars to lose in the way the current system works it would work only make sense to spend a small fraction of it to maintain the illusion and drown out the skeptics by hiring some people to do exactly this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could even write software that would let you work very efficiently (handling multiple identities, finding the relevant threads, giving you answer templates). So you wouldn't even need "legions" of people.

       They do. Some professionally, others are genuinely scared and when one puts forth an idea that contradicts their narrative they lose their shit. This is common for the average citizen because they have a self-serving life narrative and who are you to tell them they are wrong?

       But to answer your question: because its dangerous. It is dangerous to think differently, especially in a society that is ever so encroaching on the abilities of those that are able to entertain a thought without believing it as true. Those that can use critical thinking skills well enough to see the forest for the trees are a threat to status quo - and as such, need to be belittled and marginalized until herd mentality is back and normalcy returned.

       to ridicule us, &amp;
       <em>
        if

       they are legitimate r/conspiratard users &amp; not sockpuppets/JTRIG, well I've seen a few excuses for why they do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They sometimes claim that they "work with conspirat*rds" &amp; use r/conspiratard to vent, which to me is essentially cyber-bullying of people whose beliefs they dislike, because coworkers stress them out for believing differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another excuse is that "conspiracy theorists hold society back" which is honestly such a fucked up thing to say they count on there being no response due to the asininity of the proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly it's that they are either Israeli firsters/nationalists, or just think that Israel represents Jewish people worldwide, &amp; therefore any criticisms of Israel is antisemitic despite Israels behavior, &amp; not because people can freely oppose war, oppression &amp; Zionism.

       Some of the shills are issue-specific. There are lots of them who come out of the woodwork on Sandy Hook threads - which is coincidentally a conspiracy which clearly involves quite a number of people (who may be quite nervous about their scam being revealed).

       Do you find it curious that no one from any side seems to be pushing the State to obtain Lanza's medical records and autopsy results? He's dead, why should they be kept quiet? No one seems the least bit curious about it. Even the warrants they did release had redacted spots that no one questioned. I guess because instead of black lines, they put blank spots. Ugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the threads, you see two opposing factions: "don't even talk about it, shut up, kids died, have some respect" and "nothing happened, no one died, it's an elaborate hoax with crisis actors" but no middle ground or anyone actually trying to get the State to release real information about what caused this. You'd think that releasing information would be of utmost importance to at least the hoax-theory pushers. Or gun proponents. Or gun opponents. Or the community itself. The entire case is filled-to-the-brim with FUD.

       I think its funny how people blindly believe the government and reported news which they think is perfectly OK. The same goes for any major corporation that wants your children to sit in front of a TV.

       A lot of what you see from that crowd is a violent reaction to ideas that make them uncomfortable.  It's basically cognitive dissonance given a home, complete with a peer group to pat you on the ass when you keep the evil spectre of uncomfortable questions and viewpoints away from their fragile worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said a bunch of dumb stuff does get posted here, but the best and most logical solution is to ignore it or downvote it if you so wish.

       I lurk on this subreddit even though I think almost all of the theories are not true. I think it's important to have other view points on my news feed to contrast the rest of news I get from reddit. Even if reading the post makes me instantly think about how bs it is, at least I thought about it.

       Do you want the real answer?  Not the 'they're threatened, ideas are dangerous, they're shills' circlejerk answers.  At least, my real answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real answer is that I was a person who grew up believing many conspiracy theories, and it wasn't until I was in my late twenties that I really realized how and why they were wrong,  I made an idiot out of myself many times.  I lost friends who tried to argue with me.  I would help others avoid my fate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't ridicule however.  I argue to help expose the truth, and often just get downvoted or called a shill/ disruptor of topics.

       The sub has lost its appeal. At its best, there is an unsolved mystery being discussed, and people take artfully attempts to theorize explanations. They also pour over details and find eerie coincidences and things that don't make sense.

       At its worst, it is attacked by political "news" sites.

       But then they would say so in their posts. 
" I believe in some conspiracy theories but this one is ludicrous because XYZ, here is a reason your theory has been disproven...etc"

       People are capable of believing in some conspiracies, yet not all; the truth is largely irrelevant.

       Your premise is full of fallacies, making it difficult to answer.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         People don't hate and ridicule "all the common topics" discussed here. You are making a broad generalization that you can't back up with fact. Using "all" is a common tactic of someone unwilling to look at the issue in detail. People have differing opinions on multiple subjects. I agree with posts here, and disagree with others. That is the common state for members of this subreddit. You saying "all" is a clear attempt to limit discussion of the real issue.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This subreddit makes the effort to attack/challenge many different areas of people's lives, unlike
         <a href="/r/planes">
          /r/planes
         </a>
         . The comparison makes no sense. This subreddit is here to create controversy. It makes no sense to be surprised that is does what it is designed to do.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That other subreddit doesn't exist just to mock this subreddit. Based on your claim, I went over there for the second time ever. There are only a few submissions referencing this subreddit. So, again, you are making an assertion not based on fact. A fallacious appeal.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Why would anyone spend their time knocking down ideas? That is what this subreddit does all day, every day. The real question is why are you so upset that people might have an opinion that differs from yours?

       That sounds like a far-fetched conspiracy theory. Do you have links to any credible sources that can help collaborate your wild-eyed allegations?

       Also, if I claim that your silly ideas have been debunked a thousand times, that means they have actually been debunked, right? Thats how debunking works?
