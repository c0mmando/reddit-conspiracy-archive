        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have HID headlights and sometimes if I don&#39;t toggle the high-beam stick, they won&#39;t turn on all the way.  Apparently, last night I was driving on a low-speed road without having them turned on all the way.  I passed a stopped police officer and he put his car in reverse (this is in a 25 MPH zone) so I instantly stopped because it was apparent that I was getting pulled over.  Growing up, my dad always taught me to visibly put my hands outside of the window so the cop knows I&#39;m not fumbling around with anything, which I did before he even had a chance to put his Whoop-Whoops on.  He walks up with his hand on his gun holster and says <strong>&quot;You got a gun or anything in there?&quot;</strong>  to which I replied <strong>&quot;No sir, I just wanted you to see my hands.&quot;</strong>  <strong>(This guy is an apparent redneck Nazi; crew cut, not a hair out of place, staunch southern accent, blue eyes, blonde hair, squinty, untrustworthy eyes; the works.)</strong>   He walks up closer and kind of pokes his head in a bit as he asks <strong>&quot;How much marijuana you got?&quot;</strong>  I kind of chuckled a little because I totally thought he was joking.  I just got back from taking my lady on a date and my car was showroom fresh, not to mention that I haven&#39;t had any green leaf in my car in over a month.  After it processed for 0.005 seconds that he was being serious, I said <strong>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;I smell marijuana.  It&#39;s best if you just go ahead and tell me how much you have.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;I don&#39;t have any.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Are you sure about that?&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Yes, I&#39;m telling you right now that there is no marijuana in here.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;I think I&#39;m going to have to search this vehicle.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;I don&#39;t consent to searches.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Well, if I think I smell something, I don&#39;t need your consent.  I&#39;m gonna need your license and registration, and I need you to step out of your car as well so I know you&#39;re not messing around in there.&quot;</strong>  (Just for the record this is in North Carolina, US.)</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Alright, but I don&#39;t consent to searches.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>So he goes back to his car and I get out with my hands out on my sides to go stand at the back of my car.  As soon as I got to the back of the car, another cop pulls up.  He walks up and his demeanor is much more friendly and genuine than the first <strong>&quot;How are you doing tonight bud?&quot;</strong> </p>

<p><strong>&quot;I could be better.  I apologize for not having my headlights fully engaged but I don&#39;t appreciate your partner accusing me of having marijuana when I know for a fact that I don&#39;t.&quot;</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>&quot;I understand, but my partner has to listen to his senses you know.  He thinks he smells something, he has to do something about it.  Have you ever been in trouble?&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;No, I&#39;m a nutrition major with a minor in chemistry, I play football, baseball; never even got a parking violation.  And he doesn&#39;t smell anything; he&#39;s trying to take advantage of a college kid who he thinks is ignorant to the law.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The first cop walks up again and says
<strong>&quot;Look, I&#39;m smelling marijuana and I see all of those air fresheners you have in your car.  Why do you have all of those air fresheners?&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;I have OCD.  Want me to take you to my apartment too?  I can show you how clean that is, as well.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;If you don&#39;t cooperate, I&#39;m going to have to get the K9 unit out here.  If he hits, I&#39;m gonna have to search it.  Is my K9 gonna hit?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>At this point I was getting pissed and I have an advanced nutrition final in the morning so I replied <strong>&quot;If you want to, get your dog.  I have nothing to hide but tell them to hurry, I have shit to do.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll give you one more chance.  You can just give it up now or the dogs are on their way.  Do you have any pot in your car?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m livid at this point, but still level-headed as I reply <strong>&quot;Unless you planted it in my car, no.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>After the two exchanged a glance, the first cop handed me my license and registration and said <strong>&quot;I&#39;ve called the dogs off, I&#39;ll let you off with a verbal warning.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even answer him.  I looked at the other cop and said <strong>&quot;Have a good night, thank you.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hands outside the window?  I wouldn&#39;t give so much.  Sit naturally, both hands on the top portion of the steering wheel.  Have your window down as much as need be before the cop approaches.  Moving to put it down as, or after, he approaches can cause tension.</p>

<p>And you spoke too much.  Say as little as possible.  Ultimately, you can&#39;t &quot;win&quot; and even truthful statements can be construed and used against you.</p>

<p>I hate the statement, &quot;I&#39;ll let you off with a verbal warning.&quot;  Fucking pig didn&#39;t &quot;let you off&quot; as he had nothing incriminating to begin with.  The only thing he &quot;let you off&quot; from was ruining your night with bully-tactics.</p>

<p>It can (in some states) even lower your insurance rates, since it helps prove fault in case of an accident.</p>

<p>It is legal to video/audio record a cop in all 50 states. It is, in fact, considered 1st Amendment protected speech.</p>

<p>See Glik v. Cuniffee (2011)</p>

<p>I&#39;d use a livestreaming app though, so the video is safe if the cops &quot;seize the phone as evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>wow, i really feel for you, and totally think your medicine should be legal. that said, it&#39;s not, and the decision to always have a little bit weed on you seems irresponsible because of the possible consequences (eg, getting booked with your kids in the car and having CPS open an investigation). you shouldn&#39;t even need to have it on you all the time, unless you&#39;re driving around high, which is totally socially irresponsible, regardless of &quot;what a good high driver you are&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through a very similar experience in central middle-of-nowhere-Illinois. We were pulled over because we missed a turn onto the interstate in the middle of the night, had to turn around to catch it, and apparently this was &quot;suspicious&quot; behavior. The cop immediately claimed to smell alcohol in the car (there was none, of course), and while I wasn&#39;t driving (I was in the passenger seat), I did most of the interacting with the cops by immediately denying their request to search the car and by refusing to give up my ID or any personal information as a mere passenger. </p>

<p>They retaliated by making us sit there for over an hour and bringing out the dogs. The dog didn&#39;t find anything, and miraculously, they didn&#39;t <em>claim</em> the dog found anything in order to gain access to the vehicle. But the whole ordeal was a major pain in the ass. Basically, we were held captive for nearly two hours over absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Sounds like you handled it well too, but I&#39;d try to offer even less information in the future (people&#39;s first critique is always that you&#39;re talking too much, but keeping your mouth shut is easier said than done in the heat of the moment - and the cops are counting on that being the case, actually). I&#39;d also just leave my hands on the steering wheel, rather than outside the car. Barely crack your window just enough to hear what the cop is saying to you and to be able to pass your papers back and forth. Don&#39;t roll it down all the way. Don&#39;t give them the opportunity to stick their faces inside your car and claim to smell a damn thing.</p>

<p>Is all this going to make the cop more combative? Probably, a good portion of the time. The less you give them, the more most of them will be chomping at the bits trying to pin something on you, or at least get in your car. Be prepared for that too. Stand your ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my favorite is &quot;smell alcohol&quot; which due to an oddity in human physiology, is impossible. Humans cannot actually smell alcohol. You can smell things that tend to contain alcohol, but you cannot smell the difference between near beer- which contains little to no alcohol, and beer of high alcohol content provided they used the same recipe. So anytime they say they smell alcohol- they are either lying or are smell things associated with it. </p>

( sometimes I forgot this is still american and you can do what you think is best right? ) nope cop had a little attitude about that, and then says he smells POT too. I don&#39;t smoke pot and actually; this was my mom&#39;s car. So that proves right there, they just say lies, and hoping you will admit to something so then can get you in further trouble. He made me get out of the car and frightened me pretty much. He let me go with a warning too. I mean, no ticket in exchange for being accused of drugs by a lieing cop.

Every tactic they used were designed to strike terror into us, and to scare us into admitting guilt.
I still had a little respect for police officers before that interaction. Now my view is more &quot;fuck the police&quot;, and &quot;don&#39;t talk to the police.&quot; It&#39;s seriously disgusting how they are trained to misuse their power and to threaten people.

Just reading this makes my stomach cramp. This is not at all what the police are for.
Here in Britain you&#39;d have got stopped, they&#39;d have told you about your headlights.
Next they would have looked at your tyre threads and your tax disk.
If all is ok and the cop is a human then you are on your way.</p>

<p>I have heard some stories where the cop was desperate to find something and got a guy for not having enough windscreen fluid.</p>

<p>However this &quot;I can smell marijuana&quot; rubbish is the most corrupt thing after taking all your possessions and that seems to happen only in really dodgy countries [and the U.S.A].
Possession of weed doesn&#39;t even cut it here any more in the UK. You get a slap on the wrist and a caution, so it ain&#39;t worth planting it.</p>

I turned left at the next light and he pulled me over. First, he accused me of trying to run away from him, then he tried to search my vehicle for pot. I didn&#39;t have any on me and I was refusing to consent to any searches. He spent about 15-20 minutes in his car with my license until another cop pulled up behind him. The two cops talked for about 30 seconds, then the cop walked back to my car and told me it was lucky day because he had another call to attend to. </p>

<p>Turns out I actually was really lucky because my buddy had a bag of weed on him. Even though it was his and not mine, I&#39;m sure that dick would have still tried to pin something on me. </p>

It would be bad enough if he asked you and you told him, but you sat there and volunteered your life story in a traffic stop that you self-initiated.
