      <p>
       I have HID headlights and sometimes if I don't toggle the high-beam stick, they won't turn on all the way.  Apparently, last night I was driving on a low-speed road without having them turned on all the way.  I passed a stopped police officer and he put his car in reverse (this is in a 25 MPH zone) so I instantly stopped because it was apparent that I was getting pulled over.  Growing up, my dad always taught me to visibly put my hands outside of the window so the cop knows I'm not fumbling around with anything, which I did before he even had a chance to put his Whoop-Whoops on.  He walks up with his hand on his gun holster and says
       <strong>
        "You got a gun or anything in there?"
       </strong>
       to which I replied
       <strong>
        "No sir, I just wanted you to see my hands."
       </strong>
       <strong>
        (This guy is an apparent redneck Nazi; crew cut, not a hair out of place, staunch southern accent, blue eyes, blonde hair, squinty, untrustworthy eyes; the works.)
       </strong>
       He walks up closer and kind of pokes his head in a bit as he asks
       <strong>
        "How much marijuana you got?"
       </strong>
       I kind of chuckled a little because I totally thought he was joking.  I just got back from taking my lady on a date and my car was showroom fresh, not to mention that I haven't had any green leaf in my car in over a month.  After it processed for 0.005 seconds that he was being serious, I said
       <strong>
        "Excuse me?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "I smell marijuana.  It's best if you just go ahead and tell me how much you have."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "I don't have any."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Are you sure about that?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Yes, I'm telling you right now that there is no marijuana in here."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "I think I'm going to have to search this vehicle."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "I don't consent to searches."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Well, if I think I smell something, I don't need your consent.  I'm gonna need your license and registration, and I need you to step out of your car as well so I know you're not messing around in there."
       </strong>
       (Just for the record this is in North Carolina, US.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Alright, but I don't consent to searches."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So he goes back to his car and I get out with my hands out on my sides to go stand at the back of my car.  As soon as I got to the back of the car, another cop pulls up.  He walks up and his demeanor is much more friendly and genuine than the first
       <strong>
        "How are you doing tonight bud?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "I could be better.  I apologize for not having my headlights fully engaged but I don't appreciate your partner accusing me of having marijuana when I know for a fact that I don't."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "I understand, but my partner has to listen to his senses you know.  He thinks he smells something, he has to do something about it.  Have you ever been in trouble?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "No, I'm a nutrition major with a minor in chemistry, I play football, baseball; never even got a parking violation.  And he doesn't smell anything; he's trying to take advantage of a college kid who he thinks is ignorant to the law."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The first cop walks up again and says
       <strong>
        "Look, I'm smelling marijuana and I see all of those air fresheners you have in your car.  Why do you have all of those air fresheners?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "I have OCD.  Want me to take you to my apartment too?  I can show you how clean that is, as well."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "If you don't cooperate, I'm going to have to get the K9 unit out here.  If he hits, I'm gonna have to search it.  Is my K9 gonna hit?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I was getting pissed and I have an advanced nutrition final in the morning so I replied
       <strong>
        "If you want to, get your dog.  I have nothing to hide but tell them to hurry, I have shit to do."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Alright, I'll give you one more chance.  You can just give it up now or the dogs are on their way.  Do you have any pot in your car?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm livid at this point, but still level-headed as I reply
       <strong>
        "Unless you planted it in my car, no."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       After the two exchanged a glance, the first cop handed me my license and registration and said
       <strong>
        "I've called the dogs off, I'll let you off with a verbal warning."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't even answer him.  I looked at the other cop and said
       <strong>
        "Have a good night, thank you."
       </strong>

       Hands outside the window?  I wouldn't give so much.  Sit naturally, both hands on the top portion of the steering wheel.  Have your window down as much as need be before the cop approaches.  Moving to put it down as, or after, he approaches can cause tension.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you spoke too much.  Say as little as possible.  Ultimately, you can't "win" and even truthful statements can be construed and used against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate the statement, "I'll let you off with a verbal warning."  Fucking pig didn't "let you off" as he had nothing incriminating to begin with.  The only thing he "let you off" from was ruining your night with bully-tactics.

       Hijacking the top comment to point out that you can get a decent personal dashcam for under $100 nowadays. Check Amazon.

       It can (in some states) even lower your insurance rates, since it helps prove fault in case of an accident.

       It is legal to video/audio record a cop in all 50 states. It is, in fact, considered 1st Amendment protected speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       See Glik v. Cuniffee (2011)
      </p>

       I'd use a livestreaming app though, so the video is safe if the cops "seize the phone as evidence".

       well if the stop was due to his headlights not engaging than that is what the warning is for. I'd hate to play devils advocate, but it is was something that the cop had on OP.

       so, dickishness withstandling, this cop was trying to get you to non-verbally signal that you were terrified he was going to search you. this works really well on stoners, because they're paranoid and will instantly make a "he knows!" face, start shaking, pleading etc...

       this is just not at all corruption, this is just a cop using psychological tactics to try to run drug interdiction, as unpleasant as it may be.

       If it was about the headlights, then why did the cop not focus on the headlights? From OP, the cop did not even mention the headlights. Besides, THE WAR ON DRUGS IS EVIL AND WRONG. If not for the war on consciousness (drugs), then cops probably would not act like such dicks. Fuck the police.

       cops are allowed to lie to you. if he actually smelled it ('my senses detect marajauna in your vehicle'), he would have searched the car.

       i don't like any of this, but this is not the result of a single cop acting out of line, but of a guy behind on his quota using approved tactics to try and drum up "business"

       They tried to give me a combination of medication, tramadol, morphine patches, codine... Used them for a month, noticed loads of unpleasant side effects especially with my digestive system and the pain was still there just weirdly distant.

       wow, i really feel for you, and totally think your medicine should be legal. that said, it's not, and the decision to always have a little bit weed on you seems irresponsible because of the possible consequences (eg, getting booked with your kids in the car and having CPS open an investigation). you shouldn't even need to have it on you all the time, unless you're driving around high, which is totally socially irresponsible, regardless of "what a good high driver you are".

       Were are just supposed to sit, shut up, and roll over, eh? The war on drugs is the real irresponsibility here. Socially responsible people don't use violence at the point of a gun to enforce morally reprehensible laws. Fuck the police.

       yes it is, and you should vote for the law to change. your 'fuck the police' internet bad ass attitude will only show you the inside of the jail when you could other wise be let off. seriously, you gain nothing from having a shitty attitude about public servants, except knotted up panties.

       dude you have a really shitty attitude, i'm trying to help you out here. you're the one entering discourse with a shitty attitude, contributing nothing and then accusing me of starting a fight. if you don't want to either have a civil discourse, or be told you have a bad attitude, shut the fuck up, at least until you have something to contribute other than your super unique rebellious teenager attitude.

       I contributed enough to get my point across that police are not civil servants and brutality is out of control. These same police will cover up their crimes even for murder and the get off scott free. I am sorry you have such a hard time getting to what I am saying and ignoring my "shitty attitude". Peace, dude.

       Meh I don't have kids and the punishment here is a verbal warning for small amounts, and no I don't drive high but I do stay around at different places a lot, girlfriends etc. I use it at night usually an hour or so before I go to bed, the pain dulling effects then last about 36 hours on me but every night is an easier routine.

       One time I got busted with 1lb of pot. It got weighed at the scene, before going into evidence, and 2 more times prior to my final hearing. The quantity was considerably smaller each time, finally getting down to 7g. I asked my lawyer why I was being charged with a pound when it clearly said in the report they had 7g as evidence, and he told me to stfu. This was a long time ago when it was a much more serious offense.

       i'm also in NC...i've been through this exact scenario so many times. i'm a longhair though, and we've been picked on since the 60s around here.

       it's exactly like the "driving while black" thing. you have a nice car and long hair, then you're a dealer. shitty car with long hair? user.

       they usually start stammering and apologizing when i hand them the concealed carry permit with my license (it's required in NC)...i'm a "Card Carrying Good Guy"...literally. vetted by law enforcement, and statistically less likely to be a criminal than a fellow cop.

       unless you get one of the anti-gun cops that think only THEY should be armed...then you open up a whole other world of shit.

       to be fair, there are a LOT of crew-cut-sporting, roided out, military wanna-be motherfuckers with serious rage issues in police departments down here (heh. everywhere, really). they flush out of basic and decide that "a cop is almost the same as the military" and go that route.

       profiling may work (sometimes), but is bad, mkay? pulling someone over just because they "look sketchy" to you is abusive. they've gone through this with race before, and they still get bit by it a LOT. you'd think they would learn.

       When did I say it was good? I'm just pointing out that it's hypocritical to be fine with the assumptions OP made about the cop based on his haircut, but act like it's horrible for cops to make assumptions about people based on their haircuts.

       The hands outside the window.... Don't ever do that again unless they request it. Put them on the steering wheel. Their training focuses on the "good citizen" keeping their hands on the steering wheel. Stepping away from the "script" probably triggers their "keen senses."

       I went through a very similar experience in central middle-of-nowhere-Illinois. We were pulled over because we missed a turn onto the interstate in the middle of the night, had to turn around to catch it, and apparently this was "suspicious" behavior. The cop immediately claimed to smell alcohol in the car (there was none, of course), and while I wasn't driving (I was in the passenger seat), I did most of the interacting with the cops by immediately denying their request to search the car and by refusing to give up my ID or any personal information as a mere passenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       They retaliated by making us sit there for over an hour and bringing out the dogs. The dog didn't find anything, and miraculously, they didn't
       <em>
        claim
       </em>
       the dog found anything in order to gain access to the vehicle. But the whole ordeal was a major pain in the ass. Basically, we were held captive for nearly two hours over absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like you handled it well too, but I'd try to offer even less information in the future (people's first critique is always that you're talking too much, but keeping your mouth shut is easier said than done in the heat of the moment - and the cops are counting on that being the case, actually). I'd also just leave my hands on the steering wheel, rather than outside the car. Barely crack your window just enough to hear what the cop is saying to you and to be able to pass your papers back and forth. Don't roll it down all the way. Don't give them the opportunity to stick their faces inside your car and claim to smell a damn thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is all this going to make the cop more combative? Probably, a good portion of the time. The less you give them, the more most of them will be chomping at the bits trying to pin something on you, or at least get in your car. Be prepared for that too. Stand your ground.

       my favorite is "smell alcohol" which due to an oddity in human physiology, is impossible. Humans cannot actually smell alcohol. You can smell things that tend to contain alcohol, but you cannot smell the difference between near beer- which contains little to no alcohol, and beer of high alcohol content provided they used the same recipe. So anytime they say they smell alcohol- they are either lying or are smell things associated with it.

       Dude when someone has drank alcohol you can smell it on their breath. Yeah its not vodka smelling, but all alcohol smells the same once you've processed enough to be exhaling it.

       So remove 'cops' and 'marijuana' and that you're in your car and replace it with 'door to door sales man, vacuums, house.'

       They are simply sales agents for the state that can seriously fuck your life up (if you don't know the law and stand your ground).

       That's what cops do. I once was pulled over for an illegal Uturn which I did do, and drove a little extra to pull into local stop and Shop as that is the safe thing to do and I hate when cops pull people over on the street and cause traffic issues, so I did want I wanted. ( sometimes I forgot this is still american and you can do what you think is best right? ) nope cop had a little attitude about that, and then says he smells POT too. I don't smoke pot and actually; this was my mom's car. So that proves right there, they just say lies, and hoping you will admit to something so then can get you in further trouble. He made me get out of the car and frightened me pretty much. He let me go with a warning too. I mean, no ticket in exchange for being accused of drugs by a lieing cop. I don't know I guess that is a good deal or no?  I should of filed a complaint. I'm sure it would of went nowhere though.

       wow.  but here's the thing you did wrong.  don't even answer the question of whether there is marijuana in the car.  don't even go there.  don't say that "i have nothing to hide" and act as if having marijuana in your car would have made it legitimate for him to arrest you in the first place.

       I had a very similar experience a couple weeks ago. Unfortunately, we did have weed on us, people got scared, gave into the bullying and we were furthered threatened/ put into the back of cars. Every tactic they used were designed to strike terror into us, and to scare us into admitting guilt.
I still had a little respect for police officers before that interaction. Now my view is more "fuck the police", and "don't talk to the police." It's seriously disgusting how they are trained to misuse their power and to threaten people.
Edit: redundancy

       Not trying to be rude, but OP you didnt experience corruption, you experienced standard operating procedure these days in america.  If you were back and not in college you would have experienced some corruption.  Glad you got off, I just want you to know how bad it truly is, this is nothing compared to how bad the police have gotten

       It is corruption if a guy can just make something up and you have to agree or else...
Just reading this makes my stomach cramp. This is not at all what the police are for.
Here in Britain you'd have got stopped, they'd have told you about your headlights.
Next they would have looked at your tyre threads and your tax disk.
If all is ok and the cop is a human then you are on your way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have heard some stories where the cop was desperate to find something and got a guy for not having enough windscreen fluid.
      </p>
      <p>
       However this "I can smell marijuana" rubbish is the most corrupt thing after taking all your possessions and that seems to happen only in really dodgy countries [and the U.S.A].
Possession of weed doesn't even cut it here any more in the UK. You get a slap on the wrist and a caution, so it ain't worth planting it.

       Similar thing happened to me in my early 20's. I was talking to a friend in front of a convenience store. When I left the store I noticed a cop was tailing me. I turned left at the next light and he pulled me over. First, he accused me of trying to run away from him, then he tried to search my vehicle for pot. I didn't have any on me and I was refusing to consent to any searches. He spent about 15-20 minutes in his car with my license until another cop pulled up behind him. The two cops talked for about 30 seconds, then the cop walked back to my car and told me it was lucky day because he had another call to attend to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out I actually was really lucky because my buddy had a bag of weed on him. Even though it was his and not mine, I'm sure that dick would have still tried to pin something on me.

       You pulled yourself over and stuck your hands out the window... then you proceeded to have show and tell time with the cop about what you do and your mental health, all without him even asking you for this info. It would be bad enough if he asked you and you told him, but you sat there and volunteered your life story in a traffic stop that you self-initiated. I have never even heard of someone pulling their self over before you. And you think you handled it ok. LOL!

       I would also think you were a terrorist because of this. Just be happy they didn't throw you in a FEMA camp. Stop doing subversive things like having too many air fresheners and this won't happen again.

       profiling may work (sometimes), but is bad, mkay? pulling someone over just because they "look sketchy" to you is abusive. they've gone through this with race before, and they still get bit by it a LOT. you'd think they would learn.

       you gotta wait until they commit a crime, you know? otherwise it's just harassment.

       We shouldn't be wasting law enforcement resources on people who smoke pot, though. And the ignoring of the fourth amendment is criminal.
