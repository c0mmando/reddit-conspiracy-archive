       It's just like real life - ever hear a schizo talk to themselves? People couldn't care less. However, when you start making points that make sense and connecting dots that are in plain view but no one wants to acknowledge that is when people start to address you directly and attack your character, sanity, etc.

       There's a video I saw of a guy confronting a small anti-abortion crowd outside of a clinic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crowd wasn't encroaching on anyones personal space, they weren't shouting offencive words or displaying disgusting images. Yet the cameraman confronted them.
      </p>
      <p>
       He confronted them not simply because he believed their ideas to be false, but also because they were dangerous. Does him confronting them mean their ideas make sense, are correct or are true? I wouldn't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, vaccination is often a topic of contention here. The pro-vaccination crowd doesn't voice themselves because they think the anti-vaccination crowd is making sense and connecting dots, they voice themselves because they think anti-vaccination is false and dangerous.

       Sure, not necessarily, but there is an inherent granting of legitimacy any time you address a point/issue made by someone else.  As I said, no one argues with schizophrenic people. Sometimes, that legitimacy being granted is warranted, and other times (like many "panelists" on the 24-hour news networks, it is just a sideshow, distraction, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       People laughing at schizophrenics are assholes. They're mentally ill.
Someone confronting anti-abortion protesters is an asshole. They have a right to have/voice their opinion as long as they are not being violent.

       Right. Laughing at the mentally ill is an act you would frown upon. But what about laughing at the sane, whom hold 'insane' beliefs? For example, those that believe in ghosts, UFO's, psychics etc.

       Sure, you have the right to confront whomever you want, but I would say that someone that doesn't realize that confronting an anti-abortion protester is a waste of time, might be an asshole themselves. OR, if they do recognize that it is a waste of time, but still do it anyway to feed their own ego, then they are also an asshole.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't mean that the anti-abortion people aren't assholes too. I feel that many of them are, personally. A lot of this world seems to be people being assholes to each other because someone else is an asshole - I think that behavior is unproductive.

       Now that you've edited it, sure. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's the thing - intelligent pro-vaccine shrills actually don't sincerely believe their own propaganda - that all vaccines are perfect and wonderful candy saving us all from peril and that pharmaceutical companies are benevolent deities who can't do anything wrong. Eat the cake, Annie Mae.
      </p>
      <p>
       They actually just believe that most people are idiots who don't understand nuance and that when it comes to the medical world, it's all or nothing, anti- or pro- and if they concede that we do need work harder, everyone will stop accepting vaccines altogether (which is asinine, but what can you do).They're anti-nuance and grey and subtlety. And by spewing this stuff they don't even wholly believe, they are actively setting human health backwards by insisting that nothing be discussed nor researched (not to mention the doctors who reject patients who ask even to stagger the vaccines a bit off the guidelines). There is ABSOLUTELY a middle ground between no vaccines at all and 27 shots before the age of 15 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never met a single person in real life that doesn't understand that and can't speak to that, but they are often afraid to voice common sense because of the attacks they get on social media by the "you're killing my baby by not getting your Gardisil
       <sup>
        tm
       </sup>
       !" propaganda. I actually don't know any real 100% anti-all-vaccines people. I do know people that think it's gotten out of hand and are suspicious of the propaganda, though.

       So, yeah, the other commenter's point still stands - the pro-vaccine zealots would not fight quite so hard and so dirty to squelch discussion and debate if they thought those who question all vaccines efficacy and safety didn't have a few good points.

       No. If you were to claim that hygiene didn't matter in regards to personal health, you would receive staunch opposition - Because you're being an idiot by spreading misinformation. It's not because you've got some amazing truth that people are having difficulty swallowing. That's all there is so it.

       Resorting to fact-free angry personal insults during a debate is not a hallmark of one secure and confident in his or her views. Readers discern this, even if they don't comment on it openly. You may want to think about the efficacy of your debating style.

       Who said anything about ignoring? All I said was to not worry. Just vote, comment, and reply as needed. That is all we can do. If you want to do more, then you take it upon yourself to fight the vote brigade.

       Go to your user page when you aren't logged in - if it says "user not found", you're shadowbanned.  There's also a blogspot "check" you can go to, just search for it on whatever search engine you use.

       is brigading - there are some wise comments from officers in there mixed in with only a small number of jackbooty ones...honestly, the thread actually brought my spirits up. Some good discussion there. The other subs, well...kind of what you'd expect from statist babies that don't respect the rule of law and just want to discredit
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       , for the most part, but still, there's still some good discussion going on if you dig in a bit and skim over the shrill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big issue here is that the crossposted links and comments therein basically accuse most of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       of condoning violence towards officers, which is a lie meant to discredit the sub in general. I didn't see anything in the thread itself that matched the titles (and some really good discussion throughout) while reading it for like 20 minutes - I had to access the redditlog link from SRD, I think, to even locate wtf they were talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's creepy, watching this campaign to discredit and silence this subreddit. We should always be watching /new, but I think it's even more important right now.
