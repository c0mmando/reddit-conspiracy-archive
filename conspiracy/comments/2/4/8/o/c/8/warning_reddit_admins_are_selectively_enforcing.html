       I've been a part of the reddit community for about 5 years, and have just had my account shadowbanned. In the 5 years I've been participating here, the admins of this site have claimed to take a "hands-off" approach to censorship except in cases where there are clear violations of the rules (such as spamming, using multiple accounts to vote on one post, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently this is no longer the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was shadowbanned for the following comment, a response to
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/23p696/meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped_bring_down/cgzc0yc?context=3">
        qgyh2 who was responding to davidreiss666

        this submission
       </a>
       on
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       about its moderators:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You have more power in this subreddit than anyone. If you didn't like what
        <a href="/u/davireiss666">
         /u/davireiss666
        </a>
        was doing (and to be fair, no one does), you could have stopped it.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         You
        </strong>
        have all the power here, so if anything in this subreddit is broken, it's because you are too much of a megalomaniac to let go of the control you have.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         You
        </strong>
        are the reason that this subreddit is no longer default. It is your actions or inactions that have led to this point because of what has happened while
        <em>
         you are in charge
        </em>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I don't hide my hatred for
        <a href="/u/davidreiss666">
         /u/davidreiss666
        </a>
        , but
        <a href="/u/qgyh2">
         /u/qgyh2
        </a>
        , you are one and the same.
       </p>
       <p>
        As far as 5 million redditors are concerned, you're both either megalomaniacal children with severe inferiority complexes or feckless puppets for whoever is paying you.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For 4 years and 10 months, I've been subscribed to
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       . I've participated consistently in the community, posting comments and rarely submitting pertinent links. I am obviously
       <em>
        very interested
       </em>
       in the moderation and censorship of a community that I have spent a lot of time in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Officially, after demanding an explanation, the reason given for my shadowban was "vote-brigading".
      </p>
      <p>
       For participating in a community I'm subscribed to, that I've consistently participated in for nearly 5 years, I'm being shadowbanned... because I made this specific comment after
       <em>
        returning
       </em>
       to that submission from a link on
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/redditcensorship">
        /r/redditcensorship
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If we ignore for a moment all of the communities on reddit that share links to other parts of reddit, this justification is still flimsy at best and egregious censorship at worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was already reading and participating in the thread in question before I "re-discovered" it through a link in another subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       moderators were going through and deleting and re-instating various threads to make them more difficult to follow (see
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/23p07b/meta_the_mods_of_rtechnology_are_still_censoring/">
        here
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/23pnes/9274278_meet_the_reddit_power_user_who_helped/">
        here
       </a>
       ) I'm now forced to wonder if this was an intentional tactic to "bait" people to be shadowbanned. Obviously there are a lot of people that are very interested in what the people in control of these communities have to say - and a lot of people who have an opinion to express about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now we're being banned for participating in communities we are subscribed to... if we don't sit on that single subreddit 24/7 refreshing it 10 pages deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people has
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/23prf9/meta_admins_are_now_shadowbanning_accounts/">
        this happened to
       </a>
       who haven't made a new account to speak out about this censorship? Did every person that replied to qgyh2 and criticised him also get banned? Or was it only those who happened to return to that particular submission from another part of reddit after seeing that qgyh2 finally had the guts to reply?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously this is not an issue of "vote-brigading". The moderators of
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       , upset by the response their heavy-handed censorship has received, have asked the admins of reddit to step in and ban people for criticising them.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the day I finally received an explanation for my shadowban,
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/243j64/upsychopathic_rhino_breaks_down_and_debunks_and/">
        3000 people voted on these comments
       </a>
       after finding them through
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       . Did the admins ban all of the people who participated in that "vote-brigade"? Do the admins ban people who participate in the comments of threads when they're found from SRS, AMR or
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like those subreddit's mentioned above, I've been variously subscribed to
       <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">
        /r/SubredditDrama
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/ThePopcornStand">
        /r/ThePopcornStand
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/HailCorporate">
        /r/HailCorporate
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/PoliticalModeration">
        /r/PoliticalModeration
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="/r/shill">
        /r/shill
       </a>
       , etc. in the time I've participated on Reddit. Like thousands of accounts frequently do, I have occasionally found myself participating in the linked threads. Do threads like
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/246wsh/is_it_morally_acceptable_to_kill_police_officers/">
        this
       </a>
       get people banned? Did the people who created the comment graveyard
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/245nkk/someone_states_that_frozens_immense_popularity/">
        in this vote brigade
       </a>
       all get banned?
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, the admins do not enforce the "vote-brigading" rule for the purposes of preventing "vote-brigading". It's a rule that is kept on the books in order to censor dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit's admins have selectively decided to implement a certain rule to silence people who criticise their pet moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the most powerful moderators in one of the largest subreddits on the site have
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/user/anutensil">
        essentially
       </a>
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/user/maxwellhill">
        stopped
       </a>
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/user/qgyh2">
        participating
       </a>
       in the site because their actions have made them so despised, admins are now shadowbanning users who attempt to communicate with these moderators when they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       eventually have the guts to try explain themselves.

       Can confirm this is happening. My main with 60,000 karma, much of it from r/conspiracy was shadowbanned a week ago for "Vote brigading" even though I've never deliberately vote brigaded anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a BS excuse used to silence people who spread the truth about censorship here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I would also like to add that "shadowbanning" is completely ineffective in its current format. It is meant to ban bots and spammers without them realizing - however it is simple for a bot to intermittently log out and check their user page to see if they're shadow-banned or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real reason Shadowbans are used is that it is a largely automated, one size fits all, hands off approach, and the Admins don't have to give you any reason or justification for your ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will never know why you were shadowbanned unless you pester the admins for days with messages to reddit.com, until they respond (often never).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit seriously needs to scrap using shadow-bans and implement a real ban/appeal system that tells you why you were banned, gives you a chance to appeal if it was wrongful, and in which you can communicate with a real person hired for that specific job who can investigate the facts on a case by case basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is common for legitimate users who have broken no rules to be Shadow-banned and eventually (often many weeks later) unbanned. Check out
       <a href="/r/ShadowBan">
        /r/ShadowBan
       </a>
       for examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we will continue to see more selective application of rules to silence dissent as corporations and governments gain more power over Reddit in future.

       I couldn't tell at first, because I thought the OP was being ironic. Are people here just in denial? The same exact thing happens right here if you speak on certain key topics which run against the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure many here have also experienced being banned and/or having their posts deleted for nonsense reasons. Even if they are later undeleted, the post is on the second or third page and is never seen.
      </p>

       I've just had to learn to avoid those topics entirely.

       Does your vote matter in this instance? I just don't know the entire story behind it, but vote brigading is calling for a mass of people to come in and either upvote or downvote a post. Creating a bot or multiple accounts for voting would also be considered brigading. But your one simple vote couldn't be considered a "brigade", could it?

       I don't know. I assume that if you follow a link posted here to another part of Reddit and vote anywhere in that thread, they can accuse you of vote brigading and use it to shadowban you.

       It is obvious they are selectively enforcing this rule though.

       Agreed! I say, what's the point of voting if you can't vote in anyway you please? If Reddit and moderators are upset b/c votes aren't going the way they want them to, then it's quiet clear that said moderators have an agenda, in which case, they should not have the power to shadowban, unless the person in question is abusive or filled w/ rage, hate, and ignorance associated w/ trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, Reddit is ruled by humans and their bots, which I admit are sometimes cool, but annoying at times... I wonder if there are any bots out there programmed to be shills...

       Apparently, it is now. That is precisely why I had been shadowbanned a few months prior. I was told I had "participated" in a vote brigade simply for voting in another thread, one that was linked from this sub but not asking for votes in any capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, I have been careful not to repeat that mistake, and advising others to do avoid doing so as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeat: DO NOT vote in any thread upon following a link from another. It only gives the admins, and those users who I suspect have now been granted administrator privileges, the ability to censor any user critical of their agenda, to ban you arbitrarily whenever they please under false pretenses, while maintaining the advantage of plausible deniability.

       I appreciate the feedback. I have to say, the other mods have demonstrated that  they're more than capable and deserve a lot of credit in their own right. As for myself, I generally prioritize what's in the best interests of the sub and its users first and foremost when moderating, yet no less extend that same courtesy and fairness to any other user, skeptics and contrarians included, so long as they do not harass or mock other users here or cause any problems in general. And while I may not always agree with every rule in every sub, I understand as a newer mod here I have to abide by these rules and enforce them as reasonably as possible. It's also kind of nice to know that I'm now in a position to take direct action against those who wish troll the sub or cause problems for other users, banning the worst offenders on the spot, giving leniency to most if not all others (within reason) and allowing those banned to plead their case, often extending second chances to those who deserve them and demonstrate they would not continue to violate the rules or disrupt the sub in general.

       It would have to be determined by evaluating historical patterns. There is no way one vote could every be considered brigading. It's like saying someone is a big fan of the Jonas Brothers because they purchased one mp3.  That's ludicrous. But if they purchased every or most songs as they were released, you would have plausibly conclusive circumstantial evidence (sorry about the poor analogy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if people had multiple accounts, I would not feel it a beach of privacy if they used IP addresses as a factor in determining if one person is behind one or more accounts (Google uses IP addresses to associate accounts all the time).
      </p>
      <p>
       I am just thinking out loud in these comments, but you could build a very detailed data analysis engine which could provide support for a user's brigading (or any other forbidden/unfair conduct on Reddit) and ban them...never having to resort to shadow-banning again.

       When a link is posted with the intent of brigading, any person who clicks that link and then downvotes is actively engaging in that brigade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brigades are made up of single votes from individual users, who are acting en mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one vote can most definitely constitute brigading, so long as it's a part of an actual brigade, which is where the difficulty comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must look at the context to determine whether or not a brigade has actually occurred.

       Ok, you are right. But your vote cannot be considered brigading on its own....even if you and 2000 other people happen to vote the same post down or up in the same ten minutes.

       The only way would be for them to establish you had done the same thing 3, 4, or 5 times in past.  If you were observed taking part voting with the same people all of whom are subscribed to one sub (for example) at that point one could presume your intention each time was to brigade (or the presumption would be reasonable).

      <p>
       Otherwise, it's just a witch hunt.

        But your vote cannot be considered brigading on its own....even if you and 2000 other people happen to vote the same post down or up in the same ten minutes.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Unless you all "happened" to click the same link which was implicitly provided for the purpose of brigading, which makes every single individual vote count as a brigade vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Context makes whether a brigade is actually occurring or not pretty obvious, especially when viewing the net total via RES.

       Well yes, if you all clicked the same link which advocated brigading for a certain post. But I think we are are saying the same thing.

        You need to reasonably show intent
       </strong>
       (if one were to follow basic legal doctrine)...

       But you could write a script that would look at every user's past behavior from logs...and then it would be rather easy to establish this. I don't know why they don't... unless they want the flexibility to ban someone without cause.

       I have been banned on my main for brigading here. All I ever did was follow from ctard links and vote on the stuff I thought deserved downvoting (which sadly is quite a lot), so it really goes both ways. Personally I think it's retarded either way as long as there is no botting or a concentrated effort ("everyone go there and vote" etc).

       Conspirtards are the biggest offenders of vote brigading.. In fact, that is ALL conspirtards are. And my feeling is that the only reason they do it, is b/c some are paid shills and then the rest are just village idiots. They've got their heads so far up their ass, there's really no contest, they all smell like shit.

       Ironically you need an ALT account to come into the thread and see if your comment shows up. I learned this from
       <a href="/r/conservative">
        /r/conservative

       . Hang out there if you want to learn about insane levels of censorship.

       Like I said, comments can also be shadow-deleted individually by mods, not just admins. So you will see the comment logged in as yourself but not as someone else, if it was 'shadow deleted'.

       That would make too much sense.  my privatejoker account was like 4+ years old i think and had tens of thousands of thread and comment karma...gone like that because i clicked a link and then clicked a downvote arrow.

       Not to sound cold, but honestly, you can't take reddit this seriously. Reddit go co-opted a while ago. It still has it's uses in terms of browsing and there are still some reddits (generally the smaller ones) that are about community. But generally speaking, reddit has become a forum filled with posts from PR firms or vendors trying to sell stuff under the guise of 'opinions'.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the powers that be will let reddit simply exist as a forum for free exchange of ideas you've got another thing coming.

       This is the biggest concern. Since Reddit is one of the most visited sites on the internet with millions of unique visits, it's vitally important the masses understand just how disingenuous its content and moderation can be.

       Unfortunately you really couldn't be more right, and I haven't been living under the delusion that reddit is a nirvana of free speech and grassroots activism for a long, long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However this is definitely the first time I've seen the admins stepping in on behalf of mods whose feelings have been hurt, and I have directed many contentious comments to inept moderators in my time here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels like the censorship peg just jumped a few notches now that the admins are acting as the personal banhammer of moderators who can't censor effectively enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know reddit is largely controlled by a cabal of power-hungry moderators (whose reasoning and goals we can only speculate on), but now it's becoming clear that the admins are going to be banning people who challenge the status quo by criticising those mods.

       The thing is, with Reddit, the concepts of free speech and censorship don't apply. You're using a site and the administrators (and mods, to an extent) have complete control over what you can and cannot post. I've seen a handful of people get shadowbanned for simply talking about A_ntique J_etpack. Is it aggravating? Absolutely. However, if you want to post criticism about Reddit or any of the higher-ups, Reddit probably isn't the best place to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's any consolation: look for another community outside of Reddit. There are significantly better websites in terms of both content and users. Most have some sort of paywall in place (pay for an account) to keep shitheads out, but the sites are out there. They don't have nearly as many users, of course, but Reddit is filled with ads, memes, forwards from grandma, and pictures of cats. Save yourself the frustration and find another website that won't sap away at your will.

       When you are shadowbanned, your account is basically "hidden" from reddit. While you will still see all of your comments and your user page, no one else will. You can still "make" comments and submissions, but they won't be seen by anyone but yourself. It's often only noticed when comments stop receiving votes and replies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell if you're shadowbanned by logging out and visiting your user page. If you get a "page not found" error, but you can still see your user page while logged in, then it usually means you're shadowbanned, or you can post on
       <a href="/r/shadowban">
        /r/shadowban
       </a>
       to find out for certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your case,
       <a href="/u/subdep">
        /u/subdep
       </a>
       , you are definitely not shadowbanned right now, because I'm replying to your comment.

       Shadowbanned = banned from the entire website, except no one tells you. You can keep posting away except no one can see anything you post.
      </p>
      <p>
       go to
       <a href="/r/shadowban">
        /r/shadowban
       </a>
       if you ever think you've been shadowbanned, you can check there. Normally, unless you're "brigading" or posting sandy hook addresses you're fine though

       I knew what happened at Sandy Hook, and I know what doxxing is, so I just sort of put them together to figure it out. I don't know that saying "posting Sandy hook addresses" is a common enough phrase for people to know exactly what they mean though.

       Agreed. I have most of the default subreddits blocked (thanks to RES) and every once in a while, I'll run into something interesting, but Reddit has been wholly forgettable for years. I realize I sound like a hipster, but even in late 2009 when I finally created an account, Reddit was already degrading quickly. It was all bacon and narwhals when I joined, but now it's nothing more than clickable ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       More often than not, if something looks suspicious on the front page, I'll check the account out. It's usually &lt;1 month old with a few "that looks cool" and "hahaha that was funny" comments. Yet, this picture with a brand front-and-center and &lt;30 comments is somehow the number two post on the site.

       When users rejected flash/video ads was something of a tipping.  Reddit looked for other ways monetize a fast growing site, so we got reddit gold, which was lame, and regular shills - some female name was the first to be outed I think.  SOmeone will know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, since then there have been a number of corporate shill accounts that are managed and somewhat protected from normal rules, because they are viral promoting one thing or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, reddit gets massive amounts of traffic, and big business it's attracted a lot of business who want  exploit it - so there are a ton of very subtle campaigns to make sure every knows that the new product X gives you  a whiter brighter smile.
       <em>
        It's debatable  whether reddit is party to this, or whether they act to combat it (since it can happen without reddit getting a penny)
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally,  in a world where 10 bucks buys 1000 twitter followers, what do you you this it can do for reddit votes ?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit:  also, because of this amount of traffic for the the large subs, its dumb for reddit to still pretend they have 'volunteer mods' in place who run it as they choose.  those millions of pages views simply cannot be left to 'volunteer mods' to managed.

       IIRC, marketing accounts need to get permission from admins to advertise. They'd (admins) much rather they (advertisers) use the designated ads instead of cluttering with viral submissions, but there are so many astroturf/sockpuppet accounts that it is impossible to get rid of them without a dedicated team. The admins say they don't make a whole lot of money from ads on Reddit, but the site is still flourishing. I think it has a lot to do with the privacy changes over the past couple of years. They're selling our browsing history to agencies for use on sites including, and other than, Reddit. Adblock and Ghostery have no effect on this form of advertising.

       Way to keep at it. I lost interest when the front page was flooded with rage comics and, later, memes. I still check
       <a href="/r/all">

       once a day since RES gives us the ability to block specific subreddits. I can't imagine how different Reddit must have been in 2007.

       It was very different. There was some comedy. But no memes. Very few front page posts were images. Now we see extremely high % of memes and/or images on the frontpage, often 23 or 24 out of 25 frontpage (
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       ) items will be images that open in RES.

       There was a lot greater focus on technology and science news as well as interesting world news events which are still visible if you head over to

       Generally it was a lot more nerdy/geeky. Now it feels a bit like someone distilled the top 4chan and facebook posts then combined them into some strange noxious mixture..

       Look at the magazine Bon Appétit: half of the ads are disguised as articles. And the magazine is 3/4 ads, 1/4 very half-ass content. Reddit is owned by the same company.

       Up vote.  Bans for all sorts of things are common now.  Didn't used to be this way.  A mod doesn't like your user name, or doesn't think you fit in with what they are trying to market... Banned.

       I am NOT on Reddit for the cat pictures, Bacon or narwhals. I am here for the infinite intelligence of mankind, to watch the ideas and revolutions spread. I'm here to slowly move towards the Star Trek future. I am here for Occupy Wall Street, I am here for Arab Spring, I am here for a Edward Snowden, I'm here for a Julian assage and wiki leaks. I'm here to overthrow the billionaire's that control my life and country that I love so much. I am here because I can only bring change to&amp;through the hearts and minds of the people. Reddit is my only legitimate outlet other than becoming a terrorist or some hippy on a corner with a protest sign. I love reddit and I take it very seriously.

       ) is no longer visible to the public, and the admins have refused to provide any response other than "banned for vote-brigading". Over the last few days since discovering my shadowban, I have repeatedly asked for clarification and to open a dialogue about these types of bans and the reasoning behind them but have been stone-walled.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the admins do have the integrity to finally respond to this accusation to diffuse the situation, I can definitely envision them trying to use "a different instance" of vote-brigading to justify a ban that was conveniently applied just after I criticised their pet moderators, because their rigorous application of this rule means that they have surely been getting around to shadowbanning me for 4 years since my first post on a
       <a href="/r/bestof">

       I lost 3 accounts over the last few months to "vote brigading" and met the same brick wall when I questioned it.

       I made sure after shadowban #1 NOT to vote on anything linked here so either that's a generic excuse or their process is just wrong.

       Oh and coincidence that this span of time has involved me railing on bip0larbear and jfqueeny?  Seems like a big coincidence...i'm waiting for another shadowban soon.

       Sorry to ask an obviously easy to comprehend question, but can you ELI5 this whole "shadowbanning"? I just got banned from r/abandonedporn. I got my post removed for not having the pic size posted. I admit I flipped my shit and got pissed, but now this has become a situation that seems to be growing and I would like to me more informed. Thanks!

       Shadowban is noticeable when you log out from your account and try to view it but instead of your usual summary (comments, submissions etc.), you see a reddit's equivalent of 404 - see
       <a href="/u/Fluck">
        /u/Fluck
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/u/kattoo">
        /u/kattoo
       </a>
       (the latter was my own page). You can still log to your user, but your submissions, comments and PM's sent to others are invisible to anyone but you.

       Shadowbanned = banned from the entire website, except no one tells you.  You can keep posting away except no one can see anything you post
      </p>
      <p>
       You just got banned from one subreddit, you can make a new account to post there if you want
      </p>
      <p>
       go to
       <a href="/r/shadowban">
        /r/shadowban

       if you ever think you've been shadowbanned, you can check there.  Normally, unless you're "brigading" or posting sandy hook addresses you're fine though

       We may not know the true reason: whether it be for their self induced power trip or it's something much more sinister. But we do know one thing. The system on reddit is rigged more for a few people than others. Sounds familiar no?
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is what is the motivation for doing this and why do this? Are they ignoring the chance for repercussions? Or is there something deeper where they don't care about the consequences because they've already accomplished their goal?

       I lost my 5 year old main for the same thing. I wish I had pressed them for more specific reasons because I really don't think I brigaded. They took days just to tell me why I was shadowbanned though.

       I was banned for calling out admins on selective censorship. Regulars would recognize my uname, but for now I'm enjoying faux-anonymity. Any reasonable admin woulda banned ppl like davidreiss666 long ago. He's a very slick operator.

       I've said several times that the mods of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       should just create a separate forum somewhere that allows discussion without the reddit admins being in control. I believe this subreddit is important to reach the greater masses of reddit. But an external forum could complement it in a great way. Unfortunately non of the mods seem to take this seriously or want to pay the 10 dollars a month for a host.

       It still is mainly about ads and premium services. That's why they need to cleanse the site of alternative discourse by censoring dissent and controlling the flow of information

       I was shadowbanned for vote-brigading and also came to the link as an individual with no intention or belonging to any 'brigade'.
This shadowbanning is really immature and winds me up beyond rationality.
Why not ban someone, give an explanation and let them defend themselves?
Instead you are taken for a fool, posting without knowing that you are banned.
I find that practice almost childishly sadistic: "Haha, you are banned and still posting because you don't know, how funny."
      </p>
      <p>
       Who enjoys this extra sting?
Just be adults and do what you think you have to do without embarrassing, humiliating and condescending the recipient because in the end those you accuse may not actually have done anything wrong.

       So this bot is showing us potential vote bridging from other subs lol I like it. Not that I think anyone is vote bridging. If you click any of these links and vote or comment you could be banned lol.

       It's really dumb to punish someone for participating in a thread (which is the entire reason reddit exists) simply because they got there without clicking the 'subscribe' button. It's essentially the same as a friend inviting you to hang out and talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       So dumb, in fact, that I figure it's real purpose must be to provide a justification for censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, it's a wonder I haven't yet been banned. I just click the links and read the comments and participate, I don't look at the sub or the url.

       Yeah it makes no sense t all. Now when I follow a link to something I want to participate in I just open a new tab and find it through normal means.

       I don't get what this accomplishes except to waste people's time. What if I organically follow a link and find myself involved in the discussion? Am I a bad person? What about

       I would like to resubmit my solution for reddit.  Make the moderators selectable or de-selectable for each user.  No more censorship, rather the moderators can hide "poor" content and set up rules for those who wish to use their services.  No more banning, no more censorship, each user can decide who gets to filter content for the pages they are viewing.  If you don't like what
       <a href="/u/davidreiss666">
        /u/davidreiss666

       is doing, remove him from moderating/filtering the content that you see.  See to many trash links, add him back to use his moderation services... its all up to you.

       This is brilliant! And for that matter, let us upvote/downvote admins and mods, let us see how many users have them selected/deselected, have a comment thread for each mod where people can leave accolades or complaints.. Total transparency.

       This is not true at all. It includes a custom CSS that may or may not hide upvote/downvote arrows depending on the subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't disable voting at all. And if you have subreddit stylesheets disabled (as most do I believe) it won't even show any difference at all.

       Reddit appears to currently floating in some sort of a hand basket and the direction appears to be a place of fire and brimstone.
      </p>
      <p>
       What with the shill mods, the shill accounts, the up and down vote bots, the fact you can buy a mod account, the fact you can buy several normal accounts, and anything I may have left off here... I seriously hope this site gets the axe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like a microverse of the macroverse; we as a society need a revolution to change the course we're on, otherwise the system will collapse and crush most under the weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, reddit is just a shitty albeit addictive site, but appears to be playing out the same song and dance.

       I have another question. What is "no participation" mode and what benefit does it serve?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were to make any inference, it would be that one only has "standing" to vote or comment if they would have otherwise read it on their own or subscribed to it, etc. If that's the case, it's absurd...to preclude redittors from voting on a thread just because it is linked to by another thread says a lot more about sacrificing fair and honest opinion by creating some specious rule necessary because of the rampant corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is trying to avoid up-, down- vote brigading, I would think just reading the server logs to keep track of "group behavior" would be sufficient. People suspected of that conduct world warned and after an appropriate amount of violations would formally banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean come on! This is the age of algorithms and metrics...It would be so easy to find conclusive patterns of brigading by users just by watching their behavior and comparing it to others who exhibit the same behavior, and who also subscribe to the same sub, who read the same x-post, etc. etc.

       Thanks for the kind words! I've definitely written some very contentious stuff in my time here, I can't say I'm surprised about eventually being censored. I'm more surprised about the stated reasoning behind it.

        It's not drama, a handful of mods use SRD to promote their new subreddits by creating drama with alt accounts. This is all to get the casual redditor/hivemind to link to the imaginary network in the default subs to generate interest in the imaginary network and grow subscribers. I really wish I had proof of how far the rabbit hole goes, but outside some modmails I was included on, I can't prove anything.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meh, 5-10% of reddit knows this post is a ad for the imaginary network and moves on. The rest of the SRD that doesn't know any better spams links to the imaginary network, like they found something cool that no one knows about yet.
Once the mods creating the fake drama see the spike in traffic or the SRD post hit the front page, they laugh (in the mod mail) at how dumb reddit/srd is for believing their bull shit.

       It used to be the act of drumming up drama for a submission in another sub, then going over there and voting with bias, like some kind of "mob attack."
      </p>
      <p>
       From OP's post one can only assume that reddit admins have expanded the definition to include everyone that votes or participates in a thread after arriving in it via a link from another sub. Which is grade A absurdatronic, and they should be ashamed of themselves if that system is working as they intend. I think the more likely answer is that it's automated like others in this thread suggest. So many reports by users or mods or whatever and you get banned by some algorithm that they didn't really put much effort or thought into. Equally absurd but more excusable than the former because I wouldn't put much thought into that type of shit if I ran a company, just hire some dude to handle it. Who knows, though.

       If Reddit admins aren't even holding to Reddit guidelines, or otherwise reasonable habits, its a pretty scary thing. The amount of bans and censorship is skyrocketing lately. We've been banned from both
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/college">
        /r/college

       on separate occasions for very unclear reasons. How can mods be expected to behave reasonably if admins are not?

       It seems like in the past censorship was an issue that made the front page once every year or two and when it did it was a big deal. Now it seems like things are being censored daily and no one cares.

       I don't think reddit mods need to exist for monitoring content (ensure nfsw, stopping spam). Downvotes that hide posts allow the community to decide if a post is appropriate or not, we don't need people to decide for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather have mod deletion powers removed and changed to "hidden", canceled with enough upvotes.

       When a new company offers the same features as reddit without the censorship and overzealous moderation, i'll be there. Reddit can hang out with myspace in the "dun goofed" part of the internet.

       This is obviously govt and corporate PR shills that have worked their way into admin positions, or admins that have been co-opted by govt or corporate interests. I mean, if you were an admin, would you shadowban somebody for $1000?

       For what it's worth, my previous account
       <em>
        nokilli

       was banned after when messaging the admins and calling davidreiss666 a "racist Jew".
      </p>
      <p>
       If I recall correctly, he had deleted a submission I had posted about how the Norwegian terrorist who killed all those people in 2011 was a zionist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, despite being, like OP, a five-year member.  Reddit Gold.  Good karma scores.  Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Messaged
       <em>
        hueypriest
       </em>
       about it.  Said I was banned for cheating.  Pure shit.  And he couldn't even keep his story straight.  First said it was "activity on my account" that caused the ban, but when the alleged offense became clearer--that I was supposedly upvoting my own submissions--he later had to retreat and say it was "activity from my IP address".
      </p>
      <p>
       And then when I told him I was sharing a proxy with about 100,000 other users of my shit ISP, a fact which he must have been aware if indeed he was looking at the logs, he just gave up and I never heard from him again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never heard from him again because the filthy little douchebag got caught in a lie.

       The sub reddit "morbid reality" is full of abusive admins who will silence anyone who dares speak out about the abuses of government. A lot of stuff on there is so close to the truth that the admins have to keep the masses from putting all the pieces together.

       The best thing to do is just keep posting comments calling out mods and shills, doesn't matter if it is a alt account or not.  They can try to censor but this is an "anonymous" message board after all.  Keep the heat on the mods, make solid points and shoot to get as many people to see them as possible.  Admins/Mods have limited resources, they may have the goal of rigging Reddit but it's easier said than done.  I'd say we're winning.

       Hey guys, a while ago I've heard there's an alternative reddit for things like politics and world news without heavy bias moderation. Any one know of this site? I can not remember it.

       I had a 5 year old main with hundreds of thousands of karma and was shadowbanned for 'vote brigading FROM CONSPIRACY'.

      <p>
       Notice how they always say from conspiracy. If you follow a link from
       <a href="/r/bestof">
        /r/bestof

       that's not a vote brigade, but somehow if you do it when discussing conspiracies it's horrible.

       Shadowbanning is a way to ban someone (or a bot) and hope they never notice.  Telling people what shadowbanning is, and how to tell if it's been done to them defeats the whole purpose of it.

       When a site gets infiltrated by corrupt mods and freedom of speech diminishes, I tend to stop posting there and take my opinions to new forums or subreddits. Think of it like an immune system to fight shills. If we keep on the move, then we can stay out in front of the herd and the shepherds.

       I got banned from r/morbidreality for an off the cuff comment I made.  The mod who blocked me seemed to follow my posts, about 6 months later a question on askreddit wanted to know about those who have been banned.  I commented on that, then that same mod replied to my comment, putting me down and embellishing my original comments.

       I've never done anything about it, but it seems like some mods take their roles way to seriously, and it's ruining this website.

       Is there an alternative site to reddit out there, even if it's only small? If so, perhaps we could promote it here? I think those of us who are here for discussion about important things (and can do without memes and cats) need a new place to call home free of corporate and government censorship.

Perhaps it's b/c so many shills have been infiltrating any and all relevant subreddits that may make it to the front page of Reddit. 
There's a lot of socks, specifically on Reddit. A high percentage of Internet traffic (in America &amp; [interestingly] India) comes to read  Reddit.

       Same here, even though I got there as an individual, not belongingbto any brigade. I read the posts and dwnvoted those I disagree with. Something I always thought was the point of reddit. Yet because I am subscribed to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       I was believed to belong to some group that planned to vote brigade. 
Not only were the mods wrong [as I hate vote brigading] but they also banned me from all of reddit. 
Neither fair nor logic.

       Does criticizing average users coincide with the Reddit dictatorship . . . or is that fine, do to their rank?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh… Sorry… I didn't specify social class. 
...Silly me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm referring to criticizing serf members: members with low-karma / new members.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am under the assumption that individuals with high-karma are also untouched by criticism.

       Why is this a stickied post? The OP wrote this in another thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a mental institution for some people and those people shouldn't be released onto the internet. As someone who isn't ashamed to admit going there, I know first hand that there are some downright lunatics in that subreddit."
      </p>
      <p>
       and this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I think you need to scan
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       a little deeper if you think you'll get many honest answers to a survey like this. You are clearly one of JP Morgan's JTRIG JDIF dissident locators. You think I'll give up my info so you can sell me out to the lizard people UFOS?
Jokes aside, you wouldn't be interested in this information from anyone who's willing to give it to you. Anyone that's spent any significant amount of time in that subreddit will be way too paranoid about the implications to offer even that banal information freely.
I'll admit to being especially paranoid on reddit because I'm allergic to aluminium, so I have to leave my head uncovered which leaves my thoughts open to remote probing."

        The truth is, the admins do not enforce the "vote-brigading" rule for the purposes of preventing "vote-brigading". It's a rule that is kept on the books in order to censor dissent.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm beginning to suspect this is likely the case. I was shadowbanned once, immediately after posting probably the most controversial article regarding Israel and their culture I had to date, and was told it was because of a "vote brigade".
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then I've encountered instances wherein a mod from another sub appeared to have had access to this sub's mod mail, one who had issued me a thinly veiled threat to ban my account. This, coming from a user who was not an administrator, but appeared to have been granted administrator privileges.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been other incidents since that lead me to conclude this may be the case: that certain users have been granted administrator privileges.

If she is new to sex or is generally a nervous person she is going to have an extra tight twat. She needs to relax and get used to sex, but when that happens she will be a woman and will have full power over men with that vagina of hers.

       I'm really sorry you got banned.  But can someone explain how people on reddit being jerks equals a conspiracy?  This used to be my favorite sub reddit, but I feel like we've gotten a little too sensitive and a little too quick to start crying wolf.

       I'm a developer and I'm from Australia, but honestly, the biggest thing in tech news at the moment is the ongoing discussion about net neutrality. I am very glad that this discussion is getting the acknowledgement it needs on the largest technology forum on the internet. It will have worldwide ramifications for a long time, whatever happens.

       Even if you're right you can just not use reddit. Like, there are other websites which foster open discussion, or you can create one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you can just create a new account.

      <p>
       IMO deleted comments constitute censorship more than anything.

       That's really not fully true. There are plenty of other forum sites. Few are as big and bipartisan as Reddit. It's not a traditional government, but, in cyberspace, it's a superpower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fifty years from now, maybe most of our lives will take place in virtual reality inside the Internet, and sites like Reddit will be as powerful in our lives as a brick and mortar country.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I think it's extremely important to take ideasike fairness and freedom of expression on big forums seriously. Right now, we can say "it's just a website," but websites could eventually be where we effectively live.

       This post is actually about the admins that have control over the entire site and every subreddit, it doesn't really have anything to do with moderators of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       (who from my understanding are inclined to leave posts untouched except in exceptional cases or when it's obvious spam).

       I criticised the moderators of
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       , and was shadowbanned by
       <strong>
        admins
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to clarify: moderators control individual subreddits, admins are employed by Reddit to monitor the entire website.

       It doesn't matter how menial, a public forum whose administrators and moderators use scummy tactics like shadow banning to support unfair and likewise deceitful rules deserves to have that laundry aired publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you bring your kid to a playground and the playground's owner slaps your kid's hands off the slide ladder every time he tries to climb up, you're going to be like, what the fuck guy? Why are you doing that? And the owner remains silent, just slapping your kid's hands off whatever he's trying to play with. You're going to be like, look this playground fucking sucks dude, why even have a playground if you won't let my kid play?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a playground though right? No big deal, there are plenty of them. No. It is objectively better to persist, ask people in the neighborhood why the owner won't let your kid play, tell them what he's doing every time your kid tries to play, and discuss the issue publicly not only to find out some answers but also to inform others that the playground is doing some shady shit that concerns their lives too.

       I enjoy coming to Reddit. I enjoyed going to Digg. Before that I enjoyed going to CollegeHumor. I don't need any of those sites to enjoy myself, but they are/were great resources to shoot the shit and kill time. That's it. I don't feel this ownership of this website or some strong tie to it, but I also enjoy reading what people submit and what they comments on. If a moderator of a specific subreddit is an asshole that doesn't really bother me.

       It matters not if this is a website or Town Hall this is the place we choose to discuss the ideas and problems of the world and how to fix them if that ability is being taken away from us or heavily manipulated to confuse us, that is a very significant issue.

       I'm a developer and I'm from Australia, but honestly, the biggest thing in tech news at the moment is the ongoing discussion about net neutrality. I am very glad that this discussion is getting the acknowledgement it needs on the largest technology forum on the internet. It will have worldwide ramifications for a long time, whatever happens.

       When you are shadowbanned, your account is basically "hidden" from reddit. While you will still see all of your comments and your user page, no one else will. You can still "make" comments and submissions, but they won't be seen by anyone but yourself. It's often only noticed when comments stop receiving votes and replies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell if you're shadowbanned by logging out and visiting your user page. If you get a "page not found" error, but you can still see your user page while logged in, then it usually means you're shadowbanned, or you can post on
       <a href="/r/shadowban">
        /r/shadowban
       </a>
       to find out for certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your case,
       <a href="/u/subdep">
        /u/subdep
       </a>
       , you are definitely not shadowbanned right now, because I'm replying to your comment.

       Shadowbanned = banned from the entire website, except no one tells you. You can keep posting away except no one can see anything you post.
      </p>
      <p>
       go to
       <a href="/r/shadowban">
        /r/shadowban
       </a>
       if you ever think you've been shadowbanned, you can check there. Normally, unless you're "brigading" or posting sandy hook addresses you're fine though

        It's not drama, a handful of mods use SRD to promote their new subreddits by creating drama with alt accounts. This is all to get the casual redditor/hivemind to link to the imaginary network in the default subs to generate interest in the imaginary network and grow subscribers. I really wish I had proof of how far the rabbit hole goes, but outside some modmails I was included on, I can't prove anything.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meh, 5-10% of reddit knows this post is a ad for the imaginary network and moves on. The rest of the SRD that doesn't know any better spams links to the imaginary network, like they found something cool that no one knows about yet.
Once the mods creating the fake drama see the spike in traffic or the SRD post hit the front page, they laugh (in the mod mail) at how dumb reddit/srd is for believing their bull shit.

       Shadowbanning is a way to ban someone (or a bot) and hope they never notice.  Telling people what shadowbanning is, and how to tell if it's been done to them defeats the whole purpose of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask a mod here about that link, they're the ones that told me it kept being added to the spam filter whenever i tried to post it.
