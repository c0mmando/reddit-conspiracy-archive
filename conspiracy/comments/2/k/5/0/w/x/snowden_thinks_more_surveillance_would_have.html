<p>They were certainly not pushing the Snowden narrative in the least.

<p>The corporate media could not simply ignore Snowden, least they look like nothing more than a government controlled mouthpiece trading access for their integrity, so they had to put up the fascade of coverage in an attempt to ease the blow of the revelations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I somewhat agree, maybe something along the lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_fallacy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_fallacy</a>.  The Brian Williams thing alone is certainly not enough to make the argument, I think it was more along the lines of a pattern of behavior that makes the scenario more suspicious.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m still torn over the whole Snowden thing.  There&#39;s several things that seem odd to me.  the media attention vs. that of other whistleblowers, the discrepancies on how many documents GG has received and why he hasn&#39;t released more, Omidyar essentially buying GG and the documents, and more.  </p>

<p>And I&#39;d like to believe he were the real deal.  But given CIA and NSA&#39;s propensity for disinfo and psyops, it&#39;d be hard to convince me 100% he were real without him getting convicted and doing or hard time or being assassinated, and maybe not even then.</p>

<p>I guess my outlook is to read the revelations, but with the idea in the back of my mind that it may very well be limited hangout disinfo, and take his personal opinions with a large grain of salt.  Even if he&#39;s real, it doesn&#39;t mean his opinions or views on the bigger picture are necessarily that wise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems painfully obvious that the institutions tasked with governance use fear as their primary motivational tool and as justification for their very existence. </p>

<p>The NSA revelations are indeed a narrative sanctioned by those in power and their purpose is to instill a sense of omnipotence in a world that seems to be holding the power structure in a perpetual state of contempt.</p>

<p>Easy access to information has created an unprecedented crisis of confidence and credibility for the old guard and false flags and imagined enemies are laughably silly. Now they want you to know how powerful they are because they know all your porn preferences and that X-Men leak you downloaded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are referring to James clapper, who lied to congressional inquiry on the subject of NSA bulk collection and survellience. The individuals on the panel of the congressional committee knew the details of the program, and that clappers testimony was fraudulent. The congressional committee exposed clapper of contempt and this contempt was made public by Snowdens disclosure. Either way, with or without Snowdens revelations, the congressional members of that panel understand their attempted deception, having prior knowledge of what his truthful answer should be. </p>

<p>That being said, there is more than one civilian planner running the NSA for their career. Some of them have spoken and given public appearances on the topic for policy planning groups, think tanks and private research institutions. To equate clappers contempt of Congress, to a perpetually lying, forged and narcissistic director base, is not consistent with the facts. I am not defending them, nor do I like or trust them, I am saying this so you will better understand. These are technocrats, not actor&#39;s. </p>

<p>Clappers lying under oath, has nothing to do with Snowden apart from being the inspiration for the leaks . </p>

<p>That being said please broaden your inquiry base and methods of acquiring information . The more you know the less severe and paranoid your opinions become. That Snowden is all the things that you assert is a hypothesis, one which once you conduct the research to prove it&#39;s veracity, does not bear out in reality. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t trust the MSM, maybe you&#39;d trust someone like a whistleblower that seems to slip through everyone&#39;s fingers and gets full media coverage.  Yeah that&#39;s the ticket.  </p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t expect one person to know the ins and outs of 9/11 especially the detailed insider operations that many of us suspect took place.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t his stance on 9-11 that makes me suspect him.  There are other glaring red flags.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>again, that&#39;s totally not true. you can download literally every document he&#39;s released on pastebin, and there are thousands upon thousands of them. i haven&#39;t read through close to all of them, but i&#39;ve seen a number of highly technical documents describing actual products and software the NSA has... and they are verified by another leak from another source, who claims that some of them are being sold internationally to businesses.</p>

<p>i can&#39;t argue that everything he released is of vital importance, but it definitely does not look fake or easily accessible to me. it is real stuff. whether he&#39;s a CIA shill, i can&#39;t say for sure, but i think it&#39;s prudent to hold out until we have more info before drawing conclusions like this and alienating more moderate thinkers. i also think it&#39;s silly to expect him to publish documents detailing the entire architecture of PRISM or something. that might prove that he&#39;s got it out for the NSA, but remember, he <em>doesn&#39;t</em> have it out for the NSA. his narrative is that he wants to show the people that they&#39;re being spied on, and let them <em>vote</em> on it. he says he wants to give people the option of <em>informed consent</em>, and you&#39;ll see him talk about that in any extended interview he&#39;s done.</p>

<p>he has said numerous times that he has to be really careful about what he releases, because he doesn&#39;t want to hurt the US government too badly. he&#39;s probably limiting what he releases, because he doesn&#39;t want to damage our reputation so badly that it breaks the economy and hurts the american population. or release documents that create a hole in our national security or whatever. the NSA was yammering on about what a fucknut he was and how we were gonna have massive terrorist strikes because of him, and we didn&#39;t. now you can take that as a sign that this is all one big puppet show, or you can look the other way and suspect that it means what snowden <em>said it means</em>, which is that he&#39;s intentionally releasing only the documents that he has personally vetted as &quot;safe.&quot;</p>

<p>as for the number of documents, keep in mind that this is one man, and a very busy man at that, reading and analyzing each and every document he is going to release. he saw what happened to chelsea manning and julian assange after they dropped thousands of documents without scrubbing each one clean. they were totally vilified, and they made virtually no impact because their carelessness got them labeled by the mainstream as terrorists. <strong>it was snowden&#39;s self-control, exhibited by his withholding most of the documents, that got him airtime with the mainstream media.</strong> and even then, they mostly tried to bash him, and failed to deliver his most important points... then censored him a couple times, even. i can definitely see where all this would lead someone to believe that he&#39;s an agent provocateur, believe me, i saw them do it in the 9/11 truth community with the &quot;no plane&quot; and &quot;directed energy weapon&quot; theories. in fact i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if david icke is a fucking CIA shill... we already know about alex jones&#39; ties to stratfor, and david icke is a regular guest on jones&#39; show.</p>

<p>but i don&#39;t see evidence suggesting snowden is a shill. it is just a logical guess, and it&#39;s just as likely as the other, more kosher possibility that he is who he says he is. until some kind of physical evidence pops up i&#39;m not gonna buy it, because it&#39;s a leap of faith. a rational, logical person would see both sides of the argument and say it&#39;s a coin toss, because there is no real physical proof for either option. and that&#39;s the trouble with these things, isn&#39;t it? it&#39;s easy for them to infiltrate us with this kind of shit because we can neither confirm nor deny (heh) any of it. but right now i see he did some serious damage to the NSA&#39;s reputation, he got people thinking, and he got a lot of people very pissed off.</p>

<p>i can also see why he takes the stances he does... it&#39;s the same reason every politician claims they&#39;re a hardcore christian, isn&#39;t it? sometimes you have to omit your more radical &#39;opinions,&#39; even though you know them to be true, in order to appeal to the uninformed, sheepish masses. if he were to come right out and say every terrorist attack on the country has been a false flag, he would be branded a crazy conspiracy theorist and the documents would all show up on CNN as &quot;debunked.&quot; he&#39;s also pretty vague about these topics, so it could be that he&#39;s rolling out this surveillance stuff, avoiding anything inappropriate, so that he can build up some credibility. and once he feels he can&#39;t be knocked down, he might release the big stuff.</p>

<p>again these are not even opinions, just my guesses. they&#39;re no more valid than yours. but still, these are all just guesses, which is why i&#39;m thinking it&#39;s better to wait until we have more information before making conclusions like this. i also think it makes us look bad, and some of the info that gets posted here (and only here, as far as reddit goes) is <em>vitally important</em>. i wouldn&#39;t want anybody to leave or feel iffy about some of the <em>demonstrably true stuff</em> posted here, just because of some rather radical guesses on the front page. also these all seem to be coming from the same guy, george_tenet, and it just feels suspicious to me. he posted almost exactly the same thing last week... and neither one has any new information, no &quot;news&quot; of any sort, just his opinion. and after he posts it he proceeds to rail on anyone who disagrees, sounding really silly. i&#39;m not saying he&#39;s a shill, trying to make his own theory look stupid as a way of discrediting conspiracy theories in general, but hey that&#39;s just a guess as well. either way he looks like a chump, rambling on about shit for which he has no evidence. again, either it&#39;s discrediting the real, evidence-based posts in here, or it&#39;s actually harming us in more devious ways.</p>

<p>fuck chomsky because he doesnt talk 9/11, right?</p>

<p>fuck assange because he thinks 9/11 truthers are annoying, right? </p>

<p>&quot;oh, but wait... snowden cant talk about 9/11... because his credibility!&quot;</p>

<p>little do you know, snowden toes the official story on 9/11</p>

<p>It&#39;s not what Snowden is &quot;revealing&quot;. It&#39;s what Snowden is NOT revealing: the parameters of discourse have been defined for you by Snowden.</p>

<p>TPTB used Snowden to let the 99% know just how powerful was/is their surveillance technology.</p>

<p>TPTB&#39;s surveillance technology is so powerful and advanced, that the majority of the 99% didn&#39;t even know about the extent to which they/we were/are being surveilled. How could you hope to scare the shit out of the sheep you control if the power you have over them is so advanced that they&#39;re not even AWARE of it?</p>

<p>You have to make them aware of your ability and power over them first, right?</p>

<p>How else are you going to keep them scared and intimidated if they don&#39;t even know the big bad wolf is always watching them?</p>

<p>Enter a stool pigeon that puts forth just enough of a limited hangout to let everyone know that &quot;Yes. TPTB are that advanced in their technology.&quot; but doesn&#39;t really tell the people anything that wasn&#39;t already available and public knowledge before hand. Just give the pigeon enough of a platform that he&#39;ll be listened to exclusively.
This is exactly what&#39;s happened w/Snowden.</p>

<p>That dude has gotten so much frickin&#39; press over this whole issue, and yet he hasn&#39;t actually made any real mention of just HOW advanced the technology really is. What he&#39;s mentioned has kind of been out in the mainstream for a while now. He just consolidated it for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>Now that Snowden has said what he&#39;s said NOW everyone is scared and up in arms about &quot;government surveillance!!&quot; The sheeple are even MORE scared of the big bad wolf now than ever before now that they know that big brother&#39;s been watching them this whole time.</p>

<p>That&#39;s been the main point behind Snowden&#39;s info. He&#39;s an agent TPTB have used to keep the people all the more controlled and scared and agitated and on edge than before. After all, a people on edge and in conflict and agitated are a people much, much easier to control.</p>

<p>And Greenwald? He&#39;s just the delivery mechanism&#39;s delivery mechanism.</p>

<p>In a time of universal deceit - telling the truth is a revolutionary act.</p>

<p>What is a limited hangout? Combine MKULTRA (psy-op) with COINTELPRO (combating dissent) with Operation Mockingbird (propaganda)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A limited hangout, or partial hangout, is a public relations or propaganda technique that involves the release of previously hidden information <strong>in order to prevent a greater exposure</strong> of more important details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Snowden came out in June 2013. It&#39;s been more than a year... the latest leaks have been that all phone calls are recorded in Afghanistan, or that the NSA/FBI spied on 5 Muslim activists...... and this is groundbreaking? </p>

<p>What types of policy changes have occurred the past year?</p>

<p>Snowden gave everything to 2 journalists who know work at The Intercept, a nice new online blog news thing which was funded by a billionaire who gave TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO START.</p>

<p>But yes, has Greenwald told you anything new?</p>

<p>A limited hangout, or partial hangout, is a public relations or propaganda technique that involves the release of previously hidden information in order to prevent a greater exposure of more important details.</p>

<p>It takes the form of deception, misdirection, or coverup often associated with intelligence agencies involving a release or &quot;mea culpa&quot; type of confession of only part of a set of previously hidden sensitive information, that establishes credibility for the one releasing the information who by the very act of confession appears to be &quot;coming clean&quot; and acting with integrity; but in actuality, by withholding key facts, is protecting a deeper operation and those who could be exposed if the whole truth came out. In effect, if an array of offenses or misdeeds is suspected, this confession admits to a lesser offense while covering up the greater ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snowden released documents proving that every single thing you do online is collected, analyzed and watched. He confirmed, in one disclosure, what all of us have been saying for years. He provided to news agencies, slides and full disclosure on surveillance programs which indicate complete cooperation from microsoft/facebook/google/yahoo and the general high tech community. He provided proof that computer hardware and systems is intercepted while shipped and installed with backdoor technology. Greenwald is on record, because of Snowden, saying that the NSA&#39;s operational plan is to watch every single electronic communication of everyone on the entire planet, permanently and to store the associated information, which can be used for blackmail, or worse. This is the single largest leak in the history of whistleblowers. He sacrificed his freedom and liberty and the nation which he loves, to protect its citizens from deception.</p>

<p>He provided you with all the evidence you need to assume the worst, which you take and then insult him for it. You are despicable and pathetic.

<p>and here you are picking bones about what he &quot;didn&#39;t reveal,&quot; as if you expect him to spend his time giving you more data than what he already sacrificed his life to give you. he has to go through each and every page that he releases, so that he doesn&#39;t accidentally release information that gets america killed or destroys our economy. and he has already gone through thousands upon thousands, and here you completely spit on his sacrifice, his immense devotion to his country, and demand more. you belittle what he has already done, you do worse than take it for granted. you say he did something wrong, even...</p>

<p>well what the fuck have <em>you</em> done for us? what have you done to inform the american people? what have you done to fight back against our slavery? make a couple posts on reddit about your theories and opinions, failing to provide even a sliver of evidence that could convince <em>anyone</em>? you do less than nothing. you discredit our entire community, you fill this sub with ludicrous opinions that make us look like crazy, paranoid rednecks without even a remote understanding of the scientific method. you prevent people from keeping an open mind and digging through this sub for the truth... for the posts, meticulously crafted by <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> redditors <em>on their own time</em>, spending hours compiling incontrovertible evidence, and condensing it in such a form that it can convince people, and by extension, actually save the world. you are preventing people from seeing that, because when a new person finds this forum, and the first thing they see is this garbage excuse for a post, chances are they are going to scoff and close out of the window, simple as that.</p>

<p>I assume that the documents infringe on the relationship between what would and would not put the journalist in jail for releasing. How do you know it&#39;s only 5% that have been released, have you seen the documents? How do you know what percentage reinforce eachother or overlap? Do you put it outside of possibility that all of the relevant details have been released? Why don&#39;t you throw away your life to whistleblow something? Oh thats right, because you think 9/11 is an inside job FOR your job, and you work at wendys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(assuming wikileaks isn&#39;t a CIA honeypot) </p>

<p>supposedly, one of the downfalls of wikileaks was that the &quot;wiki&quot; part never seemed to catch on. there were big dumps but there were too few people working with the data and organizing it and looking for interesting bits to share...</p>

<p>so many of these leaks were for nothing.</p>

<p>now along comes Snowden and he releases it drip-by-drip, under the theory that they can get a new headline out of every release. if he released it all at once, it would overwhelm the consumers and fizzle out.</p>

<p>however, considering he has only released a little bit thus far, he may want to do a little calendar math and decide how long he wants to string this out.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>super true? i would guess that less than 10% of the country do not know who snowden is. ever single person i&#39;ve talked to about snowden has known who he is. that&#39;s just a ridiculous claim. also last week you made the same claim as you just made here, that the rest of us are stupid because we didn&#39;t know how severely the NSA was surveilling us. as if you somehow knew all about their programs, and you were this godlike secret hacker entity who just knew all about the NSA before snowden released the documents. as if this shit was no surprise to you, because you&#39;re so special.</p>

<p>honestly i don&#39;t want to insult you but it seems like a lot of these massive walls of text you&#39;re throwing up are totally devoid of information. just a bunch of your opinions regarding how high above the masses you are. it just comes off as really pretentious. also we all know you&#39;re full of shit when you say you knew all about the NSA&#39;s programs before they were released by snowden. nobody believes you dude, so i don&#39;t know why you keep pumping out these subtle brags. it&#39;s the 2nd time i&#39;ve seen, but looking at the rest of your posts it seems like it&#39;s part of a pattern of behavior. we really don&#39;t need this kind of stuff, what we need is evidence. not logical conclusions, but tangible evidence.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t even disagree with you, i think it&#39;s possible that your conclusions are right. but you&#39;re doing nothing for the theory by yammering on about your opinions, and how everybody else is stupid because they didn&#39;t see this coming. some of us have shit we have to do all day which prevents us from hacking into NSA&#39;s secret database and scouring through thousands of files until we know exactly what the NSA is doing. not that you actually did that, but based on your posts it would seem that&#39;s what you want us to believe.</p>

<p>that aside, Snowden&#39;s very first &quot;leak&quot; about Verizon was a limited hangout. </p>

<p>for those who were not aware, Snowden&#39;s revelation about Verizon sending customer data to the NSA was new info and probably somewhat shocking, especially to Verizon customers. </p>

<p>but for those who were aware, Snowden&#39;s revelation wasn&#39;t even a half-truth. he singled out an individual company to finger, when he knew good and well that all companies were compelled to do it. so we have to ask what was the motivation for Snowden (NSA) to attack Verizon, and to downplay the full extent of NSA spying? in my book, thats the definition of a limited hangout.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no other option? So you&#39;re telling me that anyone who doesn&#39;t believe 9/11 or Boston were inside jobs are either ill informed or lying? I hate to tell you this, but the majority of people (yes, that includes well-informed people), do not believe 9/11 was an inside job, and almost no one believe Boston was one (even such idols to this sub like Richard Gage). So to then claim that this somehow proves anything is ridiculous.</p>

<p>to demonstrate how you are either ill-informed about Boston or a shill, ill just ask 2 questions.</p>

<p>1) can you explain what FEMA deputy director Richard Serino was doing at the Boston Marathon finish line 15 minutes before the &quot;bombs&quot; exploded, and why did he decide to leave 15 minutes before the biggest terror attack on US soil since 9/11</p>

<p>2) what exactly was FEMA deputy director Richard Serino doing at the Boston Maraton in previous years? </p>

<p>So you&#39;re telling me, that because he left for any reason whatsoever, it&#39;s automatically because he knew what would happen? You&#39;re kinda jumping to conclusions here, since there are innumerable other possible explanations (i.e. had a meeting to go to).</p>

<p>i used to believe that, but then one day i decided to actually look at the evidence and see why conspiracy theorists believe what they believe. turns out they have some pretty solid backing, and that the info i was getting from the MSM was either outright lies or half-truths</p>

<p>Please show me the so-called WMD&#39;s that were the rationale for invasion and occupation of Iraq. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t expect anyone to agree with me 100%, just as i don&#39;t agree with anyone else 100%. but, you can tell a lot about someone by how they react to the evidence. do they ignore it, dismiss it, debunk it, discuss it, or do they stalk you and your family and send threatening packages in the mail?</p>

<p>No, i&#39;m asking you to explain why FEMA deputy Richard Serino was at the Boston Marathon Finish Line on April 15, 2013, when he should have been &quot;on the job&quot; as a federal employee who was stationed in Washington DC, and why he claims he left 15 minutes before the bombs went off when clearly he never left at all.  </p>

<p>i already know why he was there... and he was &quot;on the job as a federal employee&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, we already know why Richard Serino was at the Boston Marathon Finish Line in previous years. He was running security drills as incident commander under the DHS Urban Shield program, just like he was in 2013...</p>

<p>which is why we know Richard Serino is involved in planning the Boston Marathon Bombing, how the Bombing was just a security drill, and how the security drill was passed off to the public as islamic extremist terror.</p>

<p>that is why the Boston Marathon Bombing is called a &quot;hoax&quot; and a &quot;false flag&quot;</p>

<p>This is why Richard Serino resigned in disgrace from FEMA, and why Janet Napolitano resigned in disgrace from DHS, and why Richard Deslauries and Robert Mueller resigned in disgrace from FBI, and why Ed Davis resigned in disgrace from the Boston Police, and Tom Meninio, and Steve Abraira, and Jack Pirozzolo, and Roderick Fraser</p>

<p>First of all, you&#39;re trying to change the subject. We were not talking about WMD&#39;s nor the invasion of Iraq. Secondly, it turns out that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29631829">there was quite a bit remaining</a>.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re failing to account for bias on your part. Because you already have a bias in how you think they <em>should</em> react, you will judge them based on this. That is what I&#39;m trying to explain, which is that because of this, it becomes a &quot;either with me or lying&quot; kind of issue.</p>

<p>No, i&#39;m asking you to explain why FEMA deputy Richard Serino was at the Boston Marathon Finish Line on April 15, 2013, when he should have been &quot;on the job&quot; as a federal employee who was stationed in Washington DC</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s because they failed to catch this before it happened. Seriously, this is not hard to understand.</p>

<p>Some context here would be great. Who made this, when was it released, etc..</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m in no way claiming that this is the right answer, I&#39;m merely pointing out that your theory does not somehow hold more ground than anything else I could come up with off the top of my head (in fact, it holds even less water than the vacation thing, which took me all of 10 seconds to come up with). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>yes, but some explanations have evidence to support them, and some do not. your explanations thus far have zero support.</p>

<p>I find it ironic that you claim this, despite your claims having even less evidence than mine. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please cite a source for your rather far-fetched claim that Richard Serino left the crime scene of the Boston Marathon bombing 15 minutes before the bombs went off and that &quot;he had something to do&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alright, to continue with what I&#39;ve said before about theories, here is a list of any possible explanations I can come up with off the top of my head (non exhaustive, and not necessarily correct)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Important phone call</p></li>
<li><p>Got bored</p></li>
<li><p>Intentionally left the scene before the bomb went off so he wouldn&#39;t be there, despite the fact that this would be suspicious, which he would obviously realize were he aware that the bomb would go off.</p></li>
<li><p>Had to check on security in a different area</p></li>
<li><p>Family emergency</p></li>
<li><p>Knew a guy running in the marathon, and went to catch up witht hem and say hi</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Seriously, the list is pretty much endless, and any of these could be acceptable answers (except probably not the long one, for the reasons already pointed out)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sorry, my conclusions are based in evidence. your conclusions are baseless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Said evidence being? Cherry picking and misinterpreting evidence hardly counts as evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my logic is that if FEMA deputy Richard Serino was running urban shield security drills at the Boston Marathon in previous years,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which would lend credence to any one of my points regarding meetings, phone calls, or security checks, as opposed to your rather dubious claim. Again, this is not to say that any of those are absolutely the reason, rather, any of them are more likely than your theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>please cite a source. i don&#39;t recall any of these people ever admitting any fault. they all slithered away after they were exposed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They stepped down, because they quite obviously failed to stop this before it happened. I have no clue how this would imply that they were behind it, especially considering that stepping down just served to draw <em>more</em> attention to them and their actions.</p>

<p>so the root question remains, what was FEMA deputy director Richard Serino doing at the Boston Marathon Finish Line on April 15, 2013?</p>

<p>was Richard Serino a federal employee? yes.</p>

<p>was April 15, 2013 a federal holiday? no.</p>

<p>would Richard Serino likely have been scheduled to work on that date, at that time, and place? yes.</p>

<p>did Richard Serino work the Boston Marathon in previous years as incident commander for similar security drills? yes.</p>

<p>is it more likely than not that Richard Serino was doing in 2013 what he was doing in previous years, which is, running security drills? yes. </p>

<p>did Richard Serino create and give a presentation entitled <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>, where he outlined a &quot;hypothetical&quot; emergency management situation where the Boston Marathon Bombing was hit with a terrorist attack? yes.</p>

<p>was Richard Serino at the scene of the crime when this exact scenario played out? yes. </p>

<p>was Richard Serino &quot;on the job&quot;? </p>

<p>or was Richard Serino on vacation? </p>

<p>all of this is verified. all of this is documented. </p>

<p>your theories are creative-imagination based, not fact based. </p>

<p>However, considering he&#39;s done security drills there before, and it&#39;s a rather large public event, I&#39;m rather unsurprised he would do this. So again, I&#39;ll ask if you actually have evidence he was behind this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, the main difference is that I am not claiming my theories to be fact, unlike you. All I&#39;m saying is that given the same information, you could come up with any number of theories, pretty much all of which sound more plausible than yours.</p>

<p>and the part where FEMA deputy director Richard Serino is documented being at the crime scene before and after the event. Richard Serino has no alibi other than being at the crime scene.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/04/richard-serino-returning-boston-after-four-years-top-fema/mbKnNtdyJZg4lwwnunm05I/story.html">http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/04/richard-serino-returning-boston-after-four-years-top-fema/mbKnNtdyJZg4lwwnunm05I/story.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As he has been for many years, Serino was at the finish line for the Boston Marathon this year, but left about 15 minutes before two bombs were set off, killing three people and wounding more than 260 others. He rushed back to the finish line and watched as the EMS first responders, other public safety employees, and citizens rushed to help.</p>

<p>“They did an unbelievable, amazing job that day,’’ Serino said of Boston EMS and other first responders who stepped in to help complete strangers. “They really saved lives. They made a huge difference. I couldn’t have been more proud of the people I used to work with.’’</p>

<p>However, considering he&#39;s done security drills there before, and it&#39;s a rather large public event, I&#39;m rather unsurprised he would do this. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. now you are starting to understand why other &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; say the exact same thing i say, and why we are talking about Richard Serino at all.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll ask if you actually have evidence he was behind this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you mean aside from the evidence already provided that you ignored in favor of promoting wild-imagination based alibis?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All I&#39;m saying is that given the same information, you could come up with any number of theories, pretty much all of which sound more plausible than yours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve got a few more theories about what Richard Serino was doing:</p>

<p>1) Richard Serino spent his vacation time at the Boston Marathon, but this year he was just a marathon observer and not the incident commander of security for the national security event.  Richard Serino ate ice cream with Martin Richard an hour before Martin died, but then got explosive diarrhea and soiled his pants, necessitating him to excuse himself so he could clean himself up, just before the fake bombs went off</p>

<p>2) Richard Serino spent his vacation days milling around the Boston Marathon finish line, giving $20 blow jobs so he could get enough money to support his crack addiction. He had just got done earning a few hundred dollars, so he was ready to go find his dealer and get his fix and he left the crime scene just before the fake bombs went off.  </p>

<p>of course, neither of these scenarios have any basis in evidence, but they sound plausible right?</p>

<p>of maybe FEMA deputy director Richard Serino was doing in 2013 exactly what he was doing in previous years, which is being the incident commander for Boston Marathon security, when a hypothetical scenario they spent years &quot;rehearsing&quot; juts happened to come true</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/06/07/before-police-could-plan-for-terrorist-attack-real-thing-happened/ufxjb9O0RXyzVZNPFyGkiI/story.html">you&#39;d pretty much have to be an idiot to believe this</a></p>

<p>yes, exactly. their failure to pull off false flag terrorism and get away with it. nobody has ever suggested they resigned because they failed to prevent the attack. you are the first person who has ever made that claim. not even the rats fleeing the ship ever admitted wrongdoing, with the possible exception of Boston Fire Chief Steve Abraira, who resigned after 13 of his 14 deputies signed an open letter of no confidence, because the fire chief should have done what exactly?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not satisfied, since you have yet to give me <em>a single shred of evidence that the bombing was a false flag</em>. All you&#39;ve done is claimed that because Serino was at the marathon, he must have been in on a false flag, to which I  pointed out that that is a rather unfounded assumption, since there are any number of theories one could make on what he was doing there. </p>

<p>What is with you and this friendfeed thing? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, Janet Napolitano and Richard Serino knew their guilt had been sufficiently proven such that they resigned ASAP, and hoped the story would just go away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you didn&#39;t actually prove this, you just made unfounded assumptions about their motivations. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>nobody has ever suggested they resigned because they failed to prevent the attack.</p>

<p>And conversely, no one has ever suggested it was because of their &quot;failure to pull of false flag terrorism&quot;.</p>

<p>is there some reason you are reluctant to cite a source for any of your alternative theories? </p>

<p>i suspect the reason is  because your theories are baseless, and therefore theres is no source to cite.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love being skeptical about everything, but sometimes people don&#39;t even stop to think what information/files would actually be in a database.</p>

<p>Lets run with the premise that the gvt did 9/11.  Why would an official organization keep detailed files over their own involvement?  Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to erase everything that would ever show their involvement so when things get leaked, e.g. because of a Snowden, there wouldn&#39;t be any evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are referring to James clapper, who lied to congressional inquiry on the subject of NSA bulk collection and survellience. The individuals on the panel of the congressional committee knew the details of the program, and that clappers testimony was fraudulent. The congressional committee exposed clapper of contempt and this contempt was made public by Snowdens disclosure. Either way, with or without Snowdens revelations, the congressional members of that panel understand their attempted deception, having prior knowledge of what his truthful answer should be. </p>

<p>That being said, there is more than one civilian planner running the NSA for their career. Some of them have spoken and given public appearances on the topic for policy planning groups, think tanks and private research institutions. To equate clappers contempt of Congress, to a perpetually lying, forged and narcissistic director base, is not consistent with the facts. I am not defending them, nor do I like or trust them, I am saying this so you will better understand. These are technocrats, not actor&#39;s. </p>

<p>Clappers lying under oath, has nothing to do with Snowden apart from being the inspiration for the leaks . </p>

<p>That being said please broaden your inquiry base and methods of acquiring information . The more you know the less severe and paranoid your opinions become. That Snowden is all the things that you assert is a hypothesis, one which once you conduct the research to prove it&#39;s veracity, does not bear out in reality. </p>
