       Over the past year I have seen reddit be anti-cop and anti-government to any that speaks out being down voted bad. Go to any reddit page that has police or government abuse and just look at the comments. And look at the ones that speak for the cops and you will find that they are in fact cops.You can tell with how they comment and what they comment on.And well cops are not that smart and kind of think a lot a hivemind.Easy to spot. The NSA is harder to tell. Mostly because if they were stupid they wouldn't have their jobs for long.  But does that go against free speech. I know they have rights to but they work for the public. And Well I just see this as wrong. Plus this worries me a lot because the one I seen as cops are very racist and hate the public. They see us all as scum and this is a problem.

       Funny as that it's a given? And everyone should know? That they are on reddit I get. But as for the way they answer is what worries me. As for funny no or you have no since of humor. Maybe stating the obvious. Funny No. Maybe even terrible grammar. But not funny sorry. Maybe you need to get out more. Just helpful hints.

       exactly, what reason do they have to troll and interfere in social and general discourse and politics. none as far as govt orgs go.

       now marketing companies can legally troll, attempt to shape opinion, thats what marketing companies do.

       Firstly, is English your native tongue? If not, then no problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some information to digest. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics there are approximately 461,000 cops operating in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, compare that to how many reports and videos we see of cops behaving badly (mainly police brutality and other injustices).
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take a guess, a generous guess I would say, 10,000 videos, maybe 20000 including hand written complaints etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's roughly four percent of the entire police force allegedly behaving
       <em>
        badly
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is at all accurate, then it should be no surprise that people often like to put the police brutality stories into some sort of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if officers who surf Reddit like to chime in and defend the majority of law enforcement who do uphold justice, then so be it.

       4% or 1 in 25, thats scary numbers. especially as the other cover for the 4%
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe double that for the ones who manage to silence their critics, bury them or jail them on fake charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       so maybe 10% or maybe even 20%...

       Of course something needs to be done about police misconduct. All misconduct ought to be dealt with, regardless of how many police officers abuse their power.

       How many go unreported. Here where I live the sheriff got caught phoning to tell the head DA(he was banging her and selling her drugs and keeping money on the side)  that the FBI and KBI was looking in to her for buying coke and crak from her informants.Did you hear or see it on the news?. What happened to them you may ask? Nothing he lost his job and she moved the next town over for more money. So I have to ask myself how many was in on it. How many knew that this was going on. There is only 24 cops on the force. They all knew. No good cop would let this go. If you can't police yourselves you can't police anyone. That makes them crooks.
Added: YES I speak English and only English. Have TBI makes it hard to write or think in straight line. Sorry but if I had five cents for every time someone asked me that.

       Hmm them the facts sir. Trolling is more than just harassing to get arise out of people. And they are more just trying to defend their #thinblueline crap. And more than likely getting tried they are hate more and more everyday. If you are a cop I kind of feel for you. But cops have done this to themselves.
  Even you yourself know they use reddit. 
So if officers who surf Reddit like to chime in and defend the majority of law enforcement who do uphold justice, then so be it. 
They are going to get what they been training for a SHTF. And they made it happen.
