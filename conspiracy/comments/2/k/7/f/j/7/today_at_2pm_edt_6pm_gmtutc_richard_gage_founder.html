       Thanks for your work at ae911truth...just had a couple questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         We know the WTC steel was quickly shipped off--much of it to be recycled in China and India--but, what were the most important pieces to analyze for a proper investigation? and what percentage of these pieces were investigators given access to? was WTC 7 handled the same as the Twin Towers?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wondering if you think the victims (and their families) have been silenced with a non-disclosure agreement which Feinberg’s 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund may have contained...
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       <strong>
        edit
       </strong>
       : unfortunately, I won’t be able to stick around for the AMA--hope someone can copy/paste these questions in the AMA...definitely will check it out later this afternoon...thanks to the mods and ae911truth--hope to see more AMAs in r/conspiracy!!!

       Hey smokinbluebear,
      </p>
      <p>
       to answer your first question..the most important pieces to analyse were (and still are) where the horizontal steel beams connected with the outer steel frame. These are the most likely points for the explosives to have been positioned.
       <br/>
       I'm not sure the exact percentage investigators had access to: but the investigators looked at the debris without considering alternative explanations. That's not science.
       <br/>
       WTC7 was handled jsut as unscientifically as the towers in my opinion. You can't see a building collapse at free fall speed, symmetrically, into its own footprint and not want to look deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       For your second question. Its important to highlight the points and evidence that cannot be refuted. There's no good evidence that anyone has been silenced. I remain on the fence for that discussion.
      </p>

       were being used for the clean up. Can this not explain the cut beams? Do you have any photos of beams with these cuts that are taken before crews went in with the Oxy-Fuel torches?

       Its the beams that appeared to be cut before the clean up started that are of interest

       Excellent, please provide a link to pictures with time stamps or something to prove they were taken before clean up, evidence is the most important thing. I don't mind if someone else links me either. I have also asked a question right under your original post and it would be awesome if you could tackle that.

       That comment is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I was trying to tell people that this wasn't the Gage AMA, as two MOD's in this thread also did in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just trying to make sure that users who mistakenly asked Gage a question in here would also ask it in the actual AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good thing too, because the start of this AMA was a bit of a mess and time was lost because of this mistake, as Gage and the MOD's mentioned.

       Usually for AmA's people get assistance from a representative at reddit, where the opening post has a certain format including a twitter photo to show that the person is who they say they are. I can't understand, with all the advanced notice, why this wasn't done according to standard procedure.. argh!

       Had this been done right, it would likely have hit the front page where you can get 10's of MILLIONS of readers..!!!

       I was hoping I could get you to address a few things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.)
       <strong>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhyu-fZ2nRA&amp;amp;t=1m59s">
         Lack of sound

        on 9/11.

       Explosions are faster than the speed of sound, and cause a loud bang.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtH6ZAkwmRo&amp;amp;list=UU-gaHD4XcTMUZazsBjAC5lQ">
        This
       </a>
       is an example of a recent controlled demolition. Mic clipping (when the signal gets overloaded it distorts and it is called “clipping”) can be seen and heard in the video linked. Why can we hear conversations as

      </p>
      <p>
       2.)
       <strong>
        Molten metal
       </strong>
       . The claim is that molten metal flowed through the site however there are no pictures. When the site began to be watered down and when the storm came days later the site was soaked. Water expands at about 1600X’s it’s original volume when it hits a surface at 100°C, why were there no steam explosions in these

        material glowing
       </a>
       on the ground surrounded by paper, how is it that metal so hot it is glowing, ignores the paper around it?
      </p>
      <p>
       3.)
       <strong>
        Seismic data
       </strong>
       . Why did the destruction of the towers (1,2 &amp; 7) not result in a
       <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/LCSN/Eq/wtc_pal_ehe_500.gif">
        Seismic Signal
       </a>
       that was of enough significance? How is it that there was no primary or secondary wave for the destruction of any of the towers? Only surface waves were present (earth recovering from weight lifted off). As I understand you are an architect from the San Francisco Bay Area, how is an architect from a very active earthquake region
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9VvSBwVT_A&amp;amp;t=4m19s">
        is not instantly interested
       </a>
       in the seismographic data? If the buildings came down due controlled demolitions wouldn’t the seismic data be the smoking gun?
      </p>
      <p>
       4.)
       <strong>
        Lack of debris
       </strong>
       .
       <a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/shattered/search2.jpg">
        This
       </a>
       is a picture taken before 5:20pm on 9/11 (we know this because WTC 7 is standing in the back left).  The tiny 1-2 story WTC 1 “pile” is seen at the right center of the picture, it is dwarfed by the 8 story WTC 6 building (seen in the back right behind WTC 1). How does explosives or thermite, thermate, nano thermite, super-thermite or thermitic material account for the lack of debris? The twin towers were made out of around 5700 outer column
       <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/wot/wtc_ch2b/fig-2-3.jpe">
        prefabricated units
       </a>
       , why is that not reflected in
       <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/wtc/images/wtc-photo.jpg">
        this photo
       </a>
       or in the one mentioned before? Surely there was no steel removed or “shipped to China” when
       <a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/shattered/search2.jpg">
        this picture
       </a>
       was taken, again how does a controlled demolition and thermite or its variants result in this?
      </p>
      <p>
       5.)
       <strong>
        Thermite. Thermite, thermate, nano thermite, super-thermite and thermitic material; why does it keep changing?
       </strong>
       As I understand it is essentially iron oxide and aluminum, if the towers were turned to dust as we see in the videos and pictures, should we not expect there to be iron and aluminum dust in the debris since the towers were made out of iron and had aluminum cladding? It is claimed that there were non-ignited thermite chips found in the dust. If the heat was so intense then how didn’t it set off the thermite chips? Also shouldn’t there have been lots of bright flashes everywhere? Not just a glowing red substance pouring out of places, but a blinding light as seen in YouTube videos about thermite? How was it that the thermite was able to act so quickly, accurately and on time? From all the videos I’ve seen it appears to be rather slow and nowhere near the speed needed to bring anything down in sequence. Why was thermite not mentioned in Stephen E. Jones &amp; Bob McIlvaine’s
       <a href="http://www.ocio.os.doc.gov/s/groups/public/@doc/@os/@ocio/@oitpp/documents/content/prod01_003034.pdf">
        RFC
       </a>
       ? The word thermite is in a link within the document but that was added later, why would Jones not mention or discuss thermite within his RFC?
      </p>
      <p>
       6.)
       <strong>
        1400+
        <a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/member/e285f631afb1.jpg">
         Destroyed cars
        </a>
        .
       </strong>
       I have seen an interview of yours where you say falling pieces of thermite fell onto the
       <a href="http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/dewpics/Image8.jpg">
        cars
       </a>
       and burned them, how does this explain abrupt boundaries, plastic materials not melting, rubber not melting, missing door handles, entire engines missing or flipped cars. If thermite was falling and was hot enough to cause the destruction of 1400 cars, then why were people not burned, why was
       <a href="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b108/janedoe444/ARG/010911_WTC6_911_1328.jpg">

       </a>
       all over the ground not burned and why where there
       <a href="http://debunking911.com/street1.jpg">
        leaves
       </a>
       on the trees above or right next to these destroyed cars?
       <a href="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b108/janedoe444/ARG/toasted/Image19.jpg%7Eoriginal">
        These vehicles
       </a>
       were on West Broadway behind WTC 7 (building on the front right) so we know this image was taken before 5:20pm and was a good distance from WTC 1 &amp; 2. How can such destruction be attributed to thermite or fire?

       Hey Richard, 
There are skeptics of your organization who question your salary and how you use donations. From personally working with you I know you sometimes work upwards of 70 hours per week. Can you divulge more information on how you go about deciding wages for yourself and others, and explain your workload?  This is a huge issue for the people who try to discredit you.

       Hey 9-11-2001,
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your question. Glad to hear that you're part of our important work!
       <br/>
       As a non profit organization we're obliged to ensure that the majority of our income is used only for our goals: research and communication of the questions of what really happened on 9/11.
       <br/>
       Salaries are determined only by looking at what other non profits pay for similar positions, and let's not forget the armies of volunteers without who our jobs would be much more difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often we find that we need to request donations to support a specific activity. ReThink911 was such an example.

       For the "title" section, "Hi, I’m Richard Gage, founder of Architects &amp; Engineers for 911Truth. Feel free to ask me anything!" is perfect.

       Hey Richard, many theories get thrown around in discussions here, specifically Judy Wood's space beam stuff which you have thoroughly debunked on your website
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/faqs/505-faq-3.html">
        http://www.ae911truth.org/faqs/505-faq-3.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering some people are just researchers, rather than professional engineers etc, many can be sucked into baseless theories that "sound good" because they do not understand certain observations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you explain to the users here why it it critical to have verifiable facts and tangible sources,
       <strong>
        all backed up by multiple credentialed experts
       </strong>
       and how that has made your organization and E.S.O documentary so successful?
      </p>
      <p>
       And is there any expert that supports your group who caused huge breakthroughs for 9/11 truth? Dr. Bob Bowman and Dr. Lynn Margulis are amazing! May they rest in peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great work

       Hey 9-11-2001
      </p>
      <p>
       AE911Truth has become successful simply because we stick to the evidence. Judy Woods DEW (I like space beam though) is as laughable as NISTs 'office fires'.
      </p>
      <p>
       When evidence is independently verified, its very difficult to debunk, and that the kind of evidence we need to keep our focus on.

       energy balance caluculations clearly show that an enormous amount of energy is unaccounted for and unnaccountable by fires and gravitational colllapse.   this is the end of the story.  no argument.  that they didn't test for explosives in the dust is criminal.

       Hi Richard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't aware this was the AMA, but yes, it's criminal that the insurance companies paid out without looking at the obvious causes of collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       knowing we're living in a world ruled by such audacious criminals isn't easy to take, how do you manage?

       Shouldn't there be a NEW THREAD for this AmA, along the traditional lines..?
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't anyone work with Richard to help him set it up, with an opening statement or something, along with the traditional twitter photo proof, like every other AmA on Reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought we wanted something that might hit the front page?

       Hey Beneneb,
      </p>
      <p>
       Our mission is to raise awareness of the questions of 9/11.
       <br/>
       It doesn't take scientific research to know that a 47storey building cant collapse due to 'office fires'.
       <br/>
       I'm sure you'll be aware that NIST havent published a single, peer reviewed scientific paper in relation to 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also sure you'll  understand that getting the required funding from what are most usually government or corporate sources ...for this subject is impossible. It cost Steve Jones his job.

      <p>
       Richard,
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, I would like to thank you for your courage in speaking out about such an important issue and what many of us here establish as our ‘Kennedy Moment,’ who here remember that day extremely vividly. Most here from the US will agree that this event was both a crucial and pivotal moment for not only geopolitics as it was for us in our individual lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, most of us here have researched the event extensively and can all agree that at the very least, the facts of that day are not supported by our government’s Official Version.™ While not getting into the specifics of the events, we all agree that our government used the events as an excuse to pass legislation that has greatly limited our civil liberties, and have set of a chain of events that has forever expanded our police state in both the militarization of local police forces and the establishment of an entirely new governmental department dedicated to ‘keeping us safe.’ This has also expanded the surveillance state that has expanded exponentially in the past 13 years with the global applications of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one am no longer satisfied with being just knowledgeable and content with ‘knowing’ what really happened (as well as being disgusted by what it has done to this country and planet with the cascade of events that have taken place), I am eager for change in our current system, but know full well that the pervasive effects of unlimited campaign financing effectively make those who are not career politicians with access to these types of monies, silenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your estimation, what percentage of the American public who were affected by that day agree with the above statements? I imagine we both agree that our current representatives will not open a new, independent, criminal investigation for the events on 9/11 due to the taboo nature of the subject in American culture and dialogue.
      </p>
      <p>
       A representative democracy or republic was meant initially as a system of government for regular people to serve their people, and it was regarded as a privilege. Career politicians are diametrically opposed to how this system is supposed to work, as they are dependent on their campaign financiers to fund the PR machine required to keep them in power. With the advent of services such as kickstarter and indigogo, could your foresee a system where candidates are crowdfunded (and possibly unified by certain key issues), and legislation can be organized in an open-source manner? I believe if this is feasible, the time is NOW.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said (and I apologize for the lengthiness of the comment already), do you agree that at this point, the only real way for a new investigation to occur is for our governmental system to be repaired? For this, the only remedy I can imagine is a complete reboot, with career politicians being voted out and individuals free of the shackles of corporate money replacing them, who will finally be able to represent their constituents properly, and who can open a new criminal investigation, and slowly roll back the legislative behemoth implemented in the 13 years since 9/11. In my view, this can only be established by motivated citizens who are unhappy with the status quo, and are willing to unite with others who may not agree politically or ideologically on what the mainstream media state as ‘major issues,’ for the greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you see this happening? Again, thank you for all that you do for those that are unable to speak out for fear of being socially ostracized and difficult to employ in certain fields (I am in academia myself).
      </p>
      <p>
       All the best,
      </p>
      <p>
       Jim
      </p>

       Hey jafbm,
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your question!
       <br/>
       If AE911Truth had bribed a senator, then what value would his testimony be?
       <br/>
       AE911Truth is dedicated to finding and sharing evidence for the truth of what happened on 9/11.
       <br/>
       The evidence speaks for itself, and I believe, like so many others, that once those people in the know feel its safe to speak out: thry will.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we must make it safe for them to do so.

       Because nobody will notice what you're doing unless a "real" person says something publicly.  You can't get a celebrity like Brad Pitt or George Clooneey to speak up about it, can you?

       Hey Beneneb,
      </p>
      <p>
       Our mission is to raise awareness of the questions of 9/11.
       <br/>
       It doesn't take scientific research to know that a 47storey building cant collapse due to 'office fires'.
       <br/>
       I'm sure you'll be aware that NIST havent published a single, peer reviewed scientific paper in relation to 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also sure you'll  understand that getting the required funding from what are most usually government or corporate sources ...for this subject is impossible. It cost Steve Jones his job.
