    <div class="md"><p>Academia has long been the battleground of cultural marxist revolutionaries and ideologues working, knowingly or unknowingly, under the aegis of the financial elites. For over a decade, the establishment has dismissed skepticism of the official 9/11 story as pseudo-intellectualism at best and schizophrenic antisemitism at worst. In the highly charged, politicized, foundation-grant-suck-up environment that is academia, It doesn&#39;t take a genius to know that promoting alternative 9/11 theories in the classroom is tantamount to career suicide.</p>

<p>My question to you is, are you really dumb enough to be asking this question honestly and earnestly, or were you simply trying to rhetorically entrap Mr. Gage by mischaracterizing his remarks?</p>

<p>That said, your original reply subtly exaggerated his comment to imply that those responsible for 9/11 have exerted direct operative control over the curriculum of post-secondary schools, whereas the reality is both more nuanced and more obvious: by already having the right sorts of people (aka people who like to avoid career suicide) established in positions of authority in government, media, and academia, skepticism of 9/11&#39;s official story simply became the intellectual taboo that it is today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that the <em>implication</em> of an inside job based on circumstantial evidence and conjecture is not verifiable in the minds of Academia.</p>

<p>On the contrary, there&#39;s <em>not enough</em> evidence to pass judgement.  Conjecture and circumstantial evidence should never be used as a substitute for unequivocal and irrefutable evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said this before too:  Innocent people have been put to death or incarcerated for seemingly &quot;strong&quot; circumstantial evidence.  Some are lucky enough to have irrefutable DNA evidence vindicate their innocence.  No matter how much circumstantial evidence there seems to be, it still does not irrefutably prove the ultimate idea that our government orchestrated and masterminded 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting but there are a ton of things just simply not true here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the first time in our history, Americans have to be fearful of what they say, of what they write, and of what they think. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely and utterly false. McCarthyism, for example.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, both are totalitarian ideologies. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, completely false. If you look at communism as an example, one potential position resulting from a marxist perspective, you&#39;ll find an explicitly anti-state system.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure how to address the claim that &quot;political correctness&quot; is totalitarian as the author doesn&#39;t even give us a clear exposition of what these &quot;tenets&quot; are. Just vague claims of &quot;legal trouble&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, the cultural Marxism of Political Correctness, like economic Marxism, has a single factor explanation of history. Economic Marxism says that all of history is determined by ownership of means of production.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is not true. Do you agree with this statement? Because if you do, I&#39;d like to know why. I don&#39;t know how someone who has studied marxism could arrive at this conclusion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cultural Marxism, or Political Correctness, says that all history is determined by power, by which groups defined in terms of race, sex, etc., have power over which other groups. Nothing else matters. All literature, indeed, is about that. Everything in the past is about that one thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So political correctness is cultural marxism, but this still isn&#39;t defined. I don&#39;t know what the guy is talking about. I don&#39;t know what cultural marxism is or where this is expressed within such a framework. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Third, just as in classical economic Marxism certain groups, i.e. workers and peasants, are a priori good, and other groups, i.e., the bourgeoisie and capital owners, are evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, incorrect. A marxist analysis does not hold these prescriptive judgments on individuals based on class.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the cultural Marxism of Political Correctness certain groups are good – feminist women, (only feminist women, non-feminist women are deemed not to exist) blacks, Hispanics, homosexuals. These groups are determined to be “victims,” and therefore automatically good regardless of what any of them do. Similarly, white males are determined automatically to be evil, thereby becoming the equivalent of the bourgeoisie in economic Marxism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I can&#39;t be certain of who this individual is referring to, but feminist theory does not at all express this black and white viewpoint. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fourth, both economic and cultural Marxism rely on expropriation. When the classical Marxists, the communists, took over a country like Russia, they expropriated the bourgeoisie, they took away their property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is begging the question with regards to property.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, when the cultural Marxists take over a university campus, they expropriate through things like quotas for admissions. When a white student with superior qualifications is denied admittance to a college in favor of a black or Hispanic who isn’t as well qualified, the white student is expropriated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is not true definitionally and this is not true legally unless you assume that the white student owns that position at the school by default of their being white.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And finally, both have a method of analysis that automatically gives the answers they want. For the classical Marxist, it’s Marxist economics. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what way does &quot;marxist economics&quot; &quot;give the answers they want&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the history goes back, as I said, to World War I, as do so many of the pathologies that are today bringing our society, and indeed our culture, down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is meant by this statement? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marxist theory said that when the general European war came (as it did come in Europe in 1914), the working class throughout Europe would rise up and overthrow their governments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No this is incorrect. Marx was not attempting to make absolute predictions about all capitalist economies. He made observations about how this mode of production operates and made certain general predictions (eg the rate of profit prediction which was really just a revised argument already made by Ricardo and Smith before him). </p>

Check out the podcast the History of Rome. It&#39;s a good place to start on how and where democracies go wrong and he also talks about the bias of the historians at each period he&#39;s referring to. However, you don&#39;t have to start there, but please read something from respected historians, who put their own cultural beliefs aside and try to examine the past for what it was. Reading conveniently simplified and inaccurate history is really quite painful.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re doing is fallaciously conflating &quot;b&quot; with &quot;a&quot; by asserting through non-sequitur that &quot;a&quot; necessarily leads to &quot;b&quot;. You&#39;re also just sort of lazily implying ad hominem attacks to discredit &quot;a&quot; rather than detailing what exactly it is about either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; you find wrong on its own merits (as any premise or argument ought to be evaluated). </p>

<p>You also demonstrate a severe ignorance of what exactly is being discussed (eg: marxism, communism, progressivism) and couch it all under this nebulous term of &quot;political correctness&quot;, which is just an easy catch-all phrase for things you don&#39;t like other people talking about (which is really fucking ironic).</p>

<p>C&#39;mon, you know how liberal and/or critical of the U.S. government some college courses are? also, have you read the requirements for approval for a institution to accept financial aid? They are pretty lax. got a accredited degree program? your in. got a program that provides training 
for gainful employment in a recognized occupation? your in. You don&#39;t even need the government to recognize it as school if its on a native reservation and run by natives. </p>

<p>Neither does the 911 truth movement. I could easily argue that a similar level of &quot;data&quot; is present in <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/">concave theory circles</a>, does that mean it should be discussed in classrooms? Its not peered review science. Having a critique of the NIST report isn&#39;t evidence towards a government conspiracy, and isn&#39;t any more worthy of classroom discussion than a critique of the natural resonance explanation for the tacoma bridge collapse.</p>

<p>No. They are just as silent about concave earth theory, are they muzzled on that too? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The goal of a structural forensic investigation is to take the evidence at hand and to come up with the most probable explanation for the collapse/failure based on our understanding as engineers of the loading, geometries, and material properties involved.</p>

<p>Based on all information I&#39;ve seen, and you know looking at the event 11 years after the fact (when I took the class), the &quot;official NIST report&quot; covers the most probable collapse scenarios for each building based on the evidence/information available. I know it&#39;s not what you want to hear, go ahead and downvote me.</p>

<p>What a lot of people fail to realize is that in a forensic investigation there are almost always questions after the fact that can&#39;t be resolved, because we never have 100% perfect information. Original design drawings get amended and Steve forgets to redline that one sheet, minor changes in the field occur during construction, some steel erector doesn&#39;t tighten a few bolts down fully, a building owner decides to change something small ten years in that changes the loading distribution, some minor defect gets worse over time, etc. etc. there are a million small things that can happen that affect our idealized frame analysis of a structure. The best that people can do is formulate the most likely hypothesis that explains the phenomenon without relying on Martians. If you want to claim Martians, you better have very strong evidence to back up your theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the NIST report did not &quot;come up with&quot; the idea that the buildings fell due to fire caused by airplane strikes - they started with that as an assumed fact, and then went on to find the most likely way that the buildings would have collapsed <em>due to fire caused by airplane strikes</em>. </p>

<p>They did not entertain any other possibility, and did not come up with the most probably explanation of the original cause. It&#39;s like doing an autopsy of a person who was shot in the chest, and assuming that the bullet killed them - even if the bullet wound appeared to be post-mortem, didn&#39;t bleed, or strike any major organs, and the body was also missing their head. &quot;Well, we know they were shot, so obviously the bullet killed them - now let&#39;s figure out the most likely way they could have died from a bullet wound. Must have nicked an artery and bled to death internally&quot; Then, the mortician writes up a report that tries to explain how the bullet killed them, completely ignoring the fact that the body had evidence that the person died because their head was chopped off - in fact, doesn&#39;t even mention the head in the autopsy. Just assumes the cause of death is the bullet because they were told the person died of a gunshot by the police beforehand - even though that policeman had blood all over him, a blood-soaked chainsaw in one hand, and the missing head in the other hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you conspiratards obsessed with this free fall speed thing? NIST admit it fell at free fall speed. If you did even the slightest amount of research you&#39;d know this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a video, it appears that WTC 7 is descending in free fall, something that would not occur in the structural collapse that you describe. How can you ignore basic laws of physics?</p>

<p>In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008; available at <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/media/NIST_NCSTAR_1A_for_public_comment.pdf">http://wtc.nist.gov/media/NIST_NCSTAR_1A_for_public_comment.pdf</a>), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions. During the public comment period on the draft report, NIST was asked to confirm this time difference and define the reasons for it in greater detail.</p>

<p>To further clarify the descent of the north face, NIST recorded the downward displacement of a point near the center of the roofline from first movement until the north face was no longer visible in the video. Numerical analyses were conducted to calculate the velocity and acceleration of the roofline point from the time-dependent displacement data. The instant at which vertical motion of the roofline first occurred was determined by tracking the numerical value of the brightness of a pixel (a single element in the video image) at the roofline. This pixel became brighter as the roofline began to descend because the color of the pixel started to change from that of the building façade to the lighter color of the sky.</p>

<p>The approach taken by NIST is summarized in Section 3.6 of the final summary report, NCSTAR 1A (released Nov. 20, 2008; available at <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201A.pdf">http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201A.pdf</a>) and detailed in Section 12.5.3 of NIST NCSTAR 1-9 (available at <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201-9%20Vol%202.pdf">http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/PDF/NCSTAR%201-9%20Vol%202.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:</p>

<p>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
    Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
    Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity</p>

<p>This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—was due primarily to Stage 1, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above. In Stage 3, the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only at free fall for a small amount of time. It&#39;s 40 per cent lower than free fall. </p>

<p>It manages to fall at essentially free fall as the force above is so huge that the building below cannot support its mass and collapses. Any reaction force from below is negligible. As you can see it takes a second for sufficient energy to build up. Buildings are built to take the force of just a few stories above them, not a moving mass. </p>

<p>(I can tell just by your comment) that you really don&#39;t even have any business jumping in this discussion with people such as myself who&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours researching the topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you some sort of parody account? Top. Minds. </p>

<p>I actually have a degree in engineering that has a decent amount of focus on the structural side. I&#39;m not an expert by any means but I actually have a background in the field. </p>

<p>Edit:Literally in the report. Floors 13 till 5 collapsed, the above floors where not supported. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eventually, a girder on Floor 13 lost its connection to a critical column, Column 79, that provided support for the long floor spans on the east side of the building (see Diagram 1). The displaced girder and other local fire-induced damage caused Floor 13 to collapse, beginning a cascade of floor failures down to the 5th floor. Many of these floors had already been at least partially weakened by the fires in the vicinity of Column 79. This collapse of floors left Column 79 insufficiently supported in the east-west direction over nine stories.The unsupported Column 79 then buckled and triggered an upward progression of floor system failures that reached the building&#39;s east penthouse. What followed in rapid succession was a series of structural failures. Failure first occurred all the way to the roof line—involving all three interior columns on the easternmost side of the building (79, 80, and 81). Then, progressing from east to west across WTC 7, all of the columns failed in the core of the building (58 through 78). Finally, the entire façade collapsed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good analogy. I&#39;ve often used it myself. I&#39;ve been conducting a forensic analysis of the World Trade Center dust, and it certainly does not point to fire as the mechanism of destruction. My dust samples do not contain a trace of thermite, though, which is a contradiction to the &quot;traditional controlled demolition&quot; theory promulgated by many in the 9/11 truth movement. Thermite is never used to demolish buildings, either, so there&#39;s that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, if you assume the fire was started by anything other then the airplane fuel where is the hard evidence? The only evidence I hear about is a few people saw something strange happen a few days before hand or heard strange sounds.</p>

<p>You can say they were destroyed/covered up of course but then you are using abstract thinking. If you use photographic evidence then you need to take in ALL photographic evidence. There is substantially more photographic evidence that the planes hit the buildings and released their fuel than their are of virtually any other evidence. If the evidence is overwhelmingly one sided most of the merit will fall on that side.</p>

<p>So you have hard evidence and photographic evidence that it was the jet fuel on one side and theoretical circumstantial evidence on the other. The scientific method sides with hard evidence over any theory. It doesn&#39;t mean the theory is wrong it means that we only base fact on hard evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well of course planes hit the buildings and the fuel burned. Like you said, there&#39;s plenty of proof of that. </p>

<p>What there isn&#39;t (solid) proof of is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>That those were the planes we were told they were. </p></li>
<li><p>That the planes were piloted by the suspects (and not by computer). </p></li>
<li><p><strong>That the fires caused the 3 buildings to collapse.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>I cannot prove an alternate story. But the official story has also not been proved. <em>Any</em> conclusion will be at least part theory (hypothesis, really), because so many things can&#39;t be known - the data is not there. </p>

<p>But I have never claimed that I know exactly what happened that day. I claim that the official story has holes and inconsistencies, and therefore is not fact.</p>

<p>To blindly believe what has been reported to us is a mistake. Why? Because we have a <strong>MASSIVE</strong> amount of evidence throughout history that the people who are in the position to give out that kind of information will <strong>always</strong> report what is beneficial to them (to the extent that they believe they can pull it off), regardless of its relationship with truth. </p>

<p>When I talk about &quot;the government&quot;, I&#39;m not talking about a cohesive group of public servants who are all working together and who all have the same knowledge and intent. Government by nature is a helter skelter collection of people and institutions with different purposes and goals, with different access to information, and with different agendas and people to whom they answer. Anyone who has had a government job knows that it&#39;s a huge clusterfuck. </p>

<p>People use that as evidence that no government could ever pull off a conspiracy. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s actually the reason that conspiracies <em>can</em> be put into effect. It&#39;s not a government acting as a single unit with hundreds of thousands of people complicit, all keeping their mouths shut. Conspiracies are almost always created by a very small group of people who work <em>through</em> the system to achieve a goal. Because of the chaos and complexity, many things can happen without anyone ever catching on.</p>

<p>As a &quot;truther&quot;, my point of view is that the official story has problems. My goal is to question everything. Until someone can prove beyond any reasonable doubt what happened on 9/11/2001 and the days leading up to it and the aftermath, I am suspect of the story. Because it is very simple to look at the story and ask &quot;who benefits from which version?&quot; </p>

<p>The people who benefit from the official story are the same people who were neck deep in all of the events, calling the shots - the Bush administration used 9/11 to push their agenda of war with Iraq, increased power to spy on and detain and torture whoever they like, etc. - if you study the papers written by Cheney and Rumsfeld, you&#39;ll see very clearly that 9/11 was like Christmas to them as far as pushing agendas they have openly called for through their very long careers. So that group benefited <strong>hugely</strong> by 9/11, and by the acceptance of theofficial story. </p>

<p>The owner of WTC benefited massively. It&#39;s easy to find the details of the financial problems that those real estate holdings were causing him, and how 9/11 solved it <em>and</em> added a nice profit from insurance. So the official story is of extremely great value to Larry Silverstein. Like Woodward &amp; Bernstein, &quot;follow the money&quot;.</p>

<p>There are other people involved who benefited, but I think you see my point. </p>

<p>Bin Laden had less clear motive to orchestrate the events of 9/11. No one seems to analyze that angle. What did he gain? Attention, sure. Infamy, yes. Revenge? Only if you believe he is the Bond villain evil scheming caricature that he was portrayed as by the West. I can&#39;t really say what he was or wasn&#39;t, because the only information I have on him has been filtered through Western media and propaganda. Supposedly, his strategy was to lure the US into invading a Muslim country, anger Muslims against the West, and destabilize the US (and world) economy through a war of attrition. If that is true, then 9/11 was a major victory for Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>But unlike the doctrines written by Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rove, those agendas aren&#39;t quite as indisputable. All of the position papers and statements from them, they stand by and it&#39;s very clear where they stood and what they have said through various think tanks and political forums. With OBL, there is more ambiguity - the CIA has admitted to authoring fake Bin Laden videos and propaganda. And everyone knows that there are allegations that he was some sort of CIA asset at one point in the past, and had ties to the players on the American side. There are some leads to a US-Saudi-hijackers link - the censored 28 pages of the 9/11 commission report for one (all of that is unsubstantiated, but it does open one to questioning the origins and agendas of the supposed &quot;lone gunmen&quot;). </p>

<p>So Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda benefited as well, but there is some reason to be suspicious of parts of that story, and if it was purely a case of striking a blow at the Great Satan or whatever. It appears to be more complex, as things of this nature almost always are. And throughout history it has been the rule rather than the exception for the major players in world events to have ties and connections and multiple agendas. </p>

<p>When we talk about, see films about, or read history books about any government from the past, or outside of ours, it is never questioned that there are dirty dealings and false flags and double agents and corruption of all types. Lies, assassinations, and personal agendas. But for bad reasons, most people want to believe that <em>our</em> nation doesn&#39;t do those things. We are the first country in the history of the planet that is made up purely of &quot;good guys&quot; who never bend the rules, never pursue personal gain by manipulating the system, and who don&#39;t fight dirty. If one were to write the story of 9/11 but with the characters and period details changed to be about the Roman Empire or something, then we would all be perfectly fine questioning the absolute truth of what the government had told it&#39;s citizens. If it was Russia and Putin, we would all be like &quot;those dirty fuckers!&quot;</p>

<p>So when you look at <strong>MOTIVE</strong>, several groups stand out - and many (most?) of them are the ones who were neck deep in the events of 9/11, and also just happened to get everything they wanted as a result of 9/11.</p>

<p>When you look at <strong>MEANS</strong>, there are also many question marks. Would some of the richest and most powerful people in the world (Cheney/Bush/Rumsfeld/Silverstein/Israeli power players) have the means to manipulate money and documents and stories and planes and high tech building explosives and stool pigeons? Absolutely. If you look at the &quot;inside job&quot; group, they are rich and powerful enough to do just about anything imaginable. </p>

<p>Now, on the other side, the &quot;terrorists&quot;. What means did they have? The hijackers were very low sophistication level outsiders. Could they have managed to get into the US, get some quick and dirty flight training, avoid detection, get box cutters stashed onto the planes, and successfully maneuver 3 out of 4 planes into hitting their targets perfectly - so perfectly that two planes completely demolished three buildings through means that have never been done before or since, in all of the history of mankind? I see how it can be explained without any one step or situation sounding completely implausible, but taken as a whole, it&#39;s a pretty miraculous feat. </p>

<p>When you talk about <strong>OPPORTUNITY</strong>, did the hijackers have that? It appears that they did. At least we are told that they did. They all made it into the US, and despite being on watch lists and under some level of suspicion remained here (even past expired visas) long enough to pull it off. That&#39;s the story we&#39;re told. We&#39;re also told that they were able to board the planes without problem, and take them over and fly them without being stopped (except for the uber-patriotic wet dream flight 93, of course). We&#39;re told that they did. But again, for all that to happen without any one step along the way going South takes a lot of luck. A whole lot. </p>

<p>Did the &quot;inside job&quot; lot have the opportunity to create a false flag attack? The POTUS &amp; his pals, the most powerful people in the world, can easily make their own opportunity. They have access to systems, people, and means of manipulation that most people can&#39;t fathom. They too would need everything to go right. But they have the ability to stack the odds in their favor. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s my macro view of why I am suspicious of the official story. When it comes to the NIST report specifically, I look at it in a similar way. Who is involved? What is their motivation? What assumptions are made? Are facts given flexibility, or are theories tested rigorously over and over again in order to eliminate all doubt? How many leaps of faith are required? Are they eager and forthcoming with their methods of coming to conclusions - or are they oddly secretive about how some numbers and ideas become presented as &quot;fact&quot;, or are we just told that rigorous and state of the art methods were used (just don&#39;t ask us what they were!!!)? Do they explore every single possibility, or only the ones that lead to a preconceived notion? Do they thoroughly debunk any other possible explanations? Or do they just pretend that other hypotheses do not exist? Is evidence cherry picked to support a certain conclusion, or is every single bit of data investigated as thoroughly as possible?</p>

<p>NIST looks and acts sketchy. The have a very strong motivation to come to a certain conclusion. How much has the report affected the way buildings are designed and built, so that the same problems could be avoided in the future? Are they eager to show off their brilliant deductive work, and use it to change things?</p>

<p>I want proof, not &quot;this is most likely if you only look at it from one angle&quot;. I don&#39;t have to prove an alternate theory in order to question the prevailing one - I only need a reasonable doubt. And there is lots of that. </p>

<p>For me, almost every single aspect of the official report is ludicrous to the extreme. Practically nothing about it rings true.</p>

<p>When you read a scientific article in an academic journal, do you just take it on face value? As an ex editor of academic journals, one gets used to spotting where the authors have massaged the interpretations and analysis to emphasize the correctness of their hypotheses. That&#39;s what I would call &quot;subtle&quot; lying. The NIST report is on the opposite end of the spectrum. It&#39;s so blatantly false that you can&#39;t even pick it apart (well, some have but the overwhelming sentiment is that the whole think should be discounted immediately). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you&#39;re coming at this from a very biased perspective. I don&#39;t know if the CIA hired people to fly those planes or they were actually rednecks from Alabama and Cheney wanted to use them as an excuse to invade Iraq and Afghanistan. I have no insider knowledge or training that gives me any special insight into the motivations of the hijackers or political leadership of this country. I&#39;ll leave that to the people with master&#39;s degrees in middle eastern history and foreign policy of the United States.</p>

<p>All that I know is that I spent 6 years in university, getting a master&#39;s degree in structural engineering, and based on what I have seen, the NIST report gives the best explanation of the physical mechanism for the collapse of these buildings based on the evidence available. The criticisms of this theory that I have seen mostly derive from a combination of lack of understanding by the layman of structural engineering practices (and material science in particular), and trying to fit evidence to match preconceived biases.</p>

<p>In forensics, you are supposed to go into it with a blank slate absent of preconceived biases, follow where the evidence takes you to the most logical and justifiable conclusion. Most conspiracy theories related to the collapse of these buildings are heavily tainted with selectively using evidence to justify a preconceived story.</p>

Not to mention, it was a <em>much</em> smaller building than the WTC 1 and 2, meaning that there were less floors and less metalwork on the interior overall, making the likelihood of an error a slight bit smaller overall. In a massive skyscraper like 1 and 2, it&#39;s honestly not that unlikely for something to have gone wrong in design, but WTC 7 was the size of a large hotel in a major city, really. I don&#39;t find it all that likely that expert engineers and builder that were in charge of building the WTC&#39;s, especially 7 would have made such a grave mistake as to make 7 fall from some debris.

    <div class="md"><p>I love the critical experts on here that clearly have never even read the report. Nowhere is it claimed in the NIST report that damage from debris falling caused the collapse of Building 7. Fuck, if you just read the FAQ section you would know that.</p>

<p>The fires started by the falling debris which burned out of control due to the failure of the lower levels&#39; sprinkler system (which was fed by a water main that was severed when WTC1 and 2 came down) caused thermal expansion of the girders which severed connections to a key column which failed due to euler buckling with the loss of lateral restraint blah blah blah. Just read the damn thing. They even go so far to say that even without any damage from debris the fire alone would likely have caused the collapse.</p>

<p>Thermal expansion is a real concern in design and can generate enormous stresses when not properly accounted for. It&#39;s one of the major reasons why roller supports and expansion joints are a thing in structural design. The design engineers likely assumed the sprinkler system would activate in time to put out a major fire before the girders could reach such temperatures and expand to such a degree. Structural design is based on likely situations, reducing the likelihood of collapse down to a certain acceptable threshold. There has to be an acceptable level of risk, otherwise you just dump money into a pit and burn it. What happened on 9/11 was not designed for, and the building failed.</p>

IIRC, I saw a first-hand video where they actually caught the sound, but of course that kind of thing is <em>very</em> easy to fake, so it should be taken worth a grain of salt, really.</p>

<p>Also, there are reports (indisputable) that &#39;repair crews&#39; were doing maintenance on elevator shafts in the WTC, and that they had access to the core of the building when doing so. Reports indicate (disputable, of course) that it&#39;s very easily possible for a group of infiltrators posing as the repair crew could have planted Thermite, C4, or another highly explosive, corrosive, or thermal device/element on to the frame of the WTC buildings.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying to believe one way or the other on the WTC 1 and 2 buildings just from what I&#39;m saying I&#39;ve read (I can&#39;t seem to find the same sources I see myself for some reason, but I&#39;ve scrolled through others saying the exact same thing- Google is magical), I&#39;m just saying that all things considered, it is <em>extremely</em> curious and unlikely that all these things fell in to place to bring down the towers and 7.</p>

<p>Another important thing that continues to catch <em>my</em> attention: Larry Silverstein, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Silverstein#World_Trade_Center">temporary owner of the World Trade Center Buildings 1, 2, 4, and 5 as of July 2001</a>, took out an insurance policy and actually won <em>twice</em> the amount that he should have gotten from the WTC lease&#39;s insurance policy due to the (highly bullshit, in my opinion) idea that there were actually <em>two attacks</em>. Plus, <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/9-11_conspiracy_theories">Silverstein was, of course, not in the building as he usually was in the morning on September 11th, 2001</a>, but that one (of the two) is more likely to be coincidental. Although, worth noting, there were also no survivors from the level of the restaurant he usually spent his time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, those people are dumb.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see the arguments by and credentials of these so-called engineering experts. Most of the engineers I&#39;ve seen in AE9/11 are like..biomedical engineers..who know about as much about this topic as I do about pacemakers or prosthetics, zilch.</p>

<p>As for the last argument, it&#39;s wholly illogical. It&#39;s always the first time for something to happen...until it happens. Ever heard of Galloping Gertie? Structures can behave very differently based on their individual design parameters, and fires have their own sets of characteristics. Just because there hadn&#39;t been a fire that had brought down a high rise building, doesn&#39;t mean that there couldn&#39;t be a fire that could bring down a high rise building, especially in a building where the sole fire protection system malfunctioned due to the cutting of its supply for the lower 20 stories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to give you an interesting experiment to do:</p>

<p>Go and build a platform on top of 4 support columns made of reinforced steel beams, then build a couple more levels on top of it. Use something foor the flooring that will allow very hot fires to burn next to two of the support beams, or 3 of the 4. See how the thing falls.</p>

<p>Guess what, it won&#39;t pancake down in on itself, it will begin to weaken on one side and the weight on top will bend the steel until the structure begins twisting over, eventually the top will fall off to one side. What happened on 9/11 makes <em>no sense</em> in the context that we have been offered in the officially-offered conspiracy theory(which is literally what it is). It&#39;s the most ridiculous theory out there, on par with &quot;aliens shot laser beams at it from space weapons platforms&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It did happen, though. What this means is that whatever equations you set up to do the calculations weren&#39;t appropriate. I&#39;d start with the concept that the buildings fell within their own footprint. They most certainly did not! Those buildings exploded all over lower Manhattan. They didn&#39;t fall into their own footprints. In fact, if you look at early pictures of Ground Zero, the area where WTC 1 and WTC 2 used to be contained the least amount of debris. There weren&#39;t tall piles of building debris in the footprints of the buildings. The debris was scattered widely. Again. This does not happen with controlled demolition.</p>

The exterior of WTC 7 fell mostly into its footprint, but by 5:30PM, most of the building was already destroyed.

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t twist. You tried putting words in my mouth, again. I asked you to stop doing that. It&#39;s childish and reveals that you have no argument. Here&#39;s a &quot;straight out sentence&quot; for you:</p>

<p>I posted a statement that WTC7 had a small debris field. You said &quot;not really.&quot; Then, when I revealed that the statement I posted was from the &quot;official story,&quot; you started to run away from your own statement. You then tried using WTC1 and 2 as examples because you knew you were wrong, but couldn&#39;t admit it for some reason.</p>

<p>so, <strong>again,</strong> </p>

<p>&quot;The collapse of WTC 7 had a small debris field as the facade was pulled downward, suggesting an internal failure and implosion… The average debris field radius was approximately 70 feet. &quot; - FEMA - straight out sentence. </p>

<p>Additionally, NIST (the &quot;official story&quot;) states that:</p>

<p>&quot;The collapse of WTC 7 was caused by a single initiating event—the failure of a northeast building column brought on by fire-induced damage to the adjacent flooring system and connections&quot; - NIST - straight out sentence</p>

<p>&quot;This is the first known instance where fire-induced local damage (i.e.,buckling failure of Column 79; one of 82 columns in WTC 7) led to the collapse of an entire tall building&quot; - NIST - straight out sentence</p>

<p>&quot;21. Did debris from the collapse of WTC 1 cause damage to WTC 7&#39;s structure in a way that contributed to the building&#39;s collapse?</p>

<p>The debris from WTC 1 caused structural damage to the southwest region of WTC 7—severing seven exterior columns—<strong>but this structural damage did not initiate the collapse. The fires initiated by the debris, rather than the structural damage that resulted from the impacts, initiated the building&#39;s collapse after the fires grew and spread to the northeast region after several hours.</strong> The debris impact caused no damage to the spray-applied fire-resistive material that was applied to the steel columns, girders, and beams except in the immediate vicinity of the severed columns. The debris impact damage did play a secondary role in the last stages of the collapse sequence, where the exterior façade buckled at the lower floors where the impact damage was located. <strong>A separate analysis showed that even without the structural damage due to debris impact, WTC 7 would have collapsed in fires similar to those that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001.</strong> None of the large pieces of debris from WTC 2 hit WTC 7 because of the large distance between the two buildings.&quot; - NIST - straight out sentence</p>

<p>As for the &quot;bombs&quot; statement, yes, there is direct evidence that the &quot;official story&quot; cannot account for the government measured VOC spikes/dates.</p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<p>So, the &quot;official story&quot; does not support the evidence. Thermite does. And yes, WTC7 did have a small debris radius. </p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

The vast majority of the material fell outside the footprint of those two buildings. Most of it was in the form of this incredible dust, but there were lots of steel beams left over, too. Only a minority of these steel beams ended up in the footprints of either of the Twin Towers. I walked down to Ground Zero from my apartment on Day 3 after the attacks, and you could barely see anything above a ten foot fence. Over to one side, you could see some taller pieces sticking up, but where WTC 1 and WTC 2 used to be? Nothing. You couldn&#39;t see a thing from street level two blocks away above that ten foot fence. The debris pile over the footprints was rather short.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand what is being implied by &quot;into their own footprint&quot;. Obviously there was <em>too much dust and matter</em> for it to all fit within the square that the building stood on. What he is saying is that the top pancaked down onto the &quot;bottom&quot;(lower half of the structure after failure). This would require a universal, across-the-boards failure, not a fire weakening steal on one side, or two sides, at one specific level of the building.</p>

<p>Ever played Jenga? Have you ever seen the tower collapse straight down in on itself after pulling one piece or two pieces? Go build a model with modern engineering standards and light a couple of floors on fire, see which way it falls and how the weight distribution forces it off to one side.</p>

<p>Things just <em>do not happen</em> the way NIST said 9/11 happened. It is a joke to believe otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but with Jenga (and every example of controlled demolition), you end up with the highest point of the debris pile centered in the middle, right below the center of mass of the building. This did not happen with 9/11. The low point of the debris pile was above the footprints of each of the Twin Towers. This is not how it is commonly described. It&#39;s commonly described as having mostly fallen WITHIN the footprint, when the vast majority of it fell OUTSIDE the footprint (of each of the Twin Towers).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is the point you are making relevant? It stems from a base of you being pedantic and nit-picking meaningless misinterpretations of phrases (like &quot;into it&#39;s own footprint&quot;) instead of accepting and understanding the obvious and correct suggestion that is implied by it&#39;s use.</p>

<p>Of COURSE that many stories of a super-structure aren&#39;t going to all be contained in it&#39;s original &quot;footprint&quot; during or at the end of a total collapse. Obviously. That isn&#39;t actually relevant to the use of the phrase &quot;into it&#39;s own footprint&quot;, and you should really be smart enough to realize what is <em>actually</em> being (correctly) implied in it&#39;s use, instead of being self-sabotaging and needlessly technical. If you need someone to explain to you what it means, look up a video of the event occuring and see how the towers tops fall right in on themselves and remain going straight down that way throughout the whole event. They don&#39;t weaken on one side and topple over, they don&#39;t weaken on multiple sides and twist/crunch under the increasing weight now lacking load-bearing support columns to hold them up - the building loses support at every critical point at exactly the same time <em>all the way down</em>. Do you know how we know that? Because it&#39;s <em>on video</em>, and how those towers behaved is <em>not</em> how tall structures which are weakened at one point on one level(or multiple individual points at a few levels, in the course of a pure accident or fires) behave. Sorry to be the one to break it to you, but <em>fires simply don&#39;t do that</em>.</p>

<p>If I am having a heart attack and say &quot;I&#39;m having a heart attack&quot; - right now, you would be the doctor coming up to me and saying &quot;no you&#39;re not because your heart isn&#39;t conscious and can&#39;t attack you so that isn&#39;t actually happening and you&#39;re wrong&quot;. The point that doctor(you) is making is not actually relevant, and is really, really stupid - even though it&#39;s technically correct in that my heart is not actually conscious and cannot therefor &quot;attack me&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I fully agree. I was only arguing that it doesn&#39;t make sense ( to me ) to say the towers didn&#39;t come down within their own foot print b/c we have never demoed anything that size so there is no comparison. The argument that they were not demolished by explosives b/c they didn&#39;t fall right is kinda a no go b/c you can&#39;t point and say &quot; there. That&#39;s what blowing up the tallest structure in the world ( with another next door also coming down ) looks like. Were they hit by planes, definitely. Did the collapse get helped along by explosives?  That is the question. And even if you had a comparison of size by demolition you&#39;d have to first fly jetliners into them to get an accurate comparison. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing, though, is that the towers didn&#39;t come down in their own footprint. If you look at pictures taken immediately after the damage, even before WTC 7 fell, you&#39;ll note that there isn&#39;t a TALL pile of debris centered over the footprints of WTC 1 and 2. It&#39;s rather short actually. The debris fell almost entirely outside the footprints of those buildings. This is evidence of explosions, although not necessarily explosives. You don&#39;t need to fly airliners into a gigantic building to test whether or not they could damage it. All you have to do is smash an aluminum baseball bat against a single steel beam. Go ahead. Bring some friends and take turns. Bring 100 aluminum baseball bats. No matter how many times you smash that same steel beam, it will always ruin the baseball bat and stay almost untouched. In a collision, what gets destroyed is the physically weaker object.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I agree. The physically weaker object usually takes the brunt ( I say usually because wierd stuff happens during tornadoes but this was not those conditions ). I don&#39;t mind talking about it. Maybe I should be clear and say I don&#39;t know what brought them down but I&#39;m fairly positive it was much more than the aircraft. My argument is only.... We don&#39;t have a demolition of this magnitude to use as a comparison so saying that the buildings did or did not stay within their respective foot prints to proove it was or was not a demolition seems invalid.   There are many other good facts having to do with physics and melting points and such that would seem to indicate that there was much more going on than the crashes. The only major problem I have us explaining away the amount of people that would have to keep quiet about the job. That&#39;s a hard one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s at least one angle that allows you to see the mechanical penthouse on the roof that is supported by interior columns. This is our one visible clue from the outside of what is happening on the interior of the building. It clearly collapses in an irregular fashion (either west to east or east to west, can&#39;t remember), and prior to the exterior of the building beginning to collapse. This suggests a complete interior collapse, followed by the interior member framing pulling the exterior walls down with it.</p>

<p>The freefall claim is thoroughly debunked. Measurements of the roof line using video tracking software as it collapses shows that it is significantly slower than freefall speed. There&#39;s a section in the FAQ that addresses this. Furthermore, if the hypothesis of an internal column collapse preceding the collapse of the exterior columns/walls is correct, much of the beginning of the collapse is not being included in the time measurement. By the time the collapse visibly begins from many angles from the exterior, the building is significantly overstressed due to the loss of the interior framing and offers very little resistance to the loads acting upon it, hence why it would appear to collapse at near free fall speeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, now this is an argument that&#39;s compelling and not just bullshit. I don&#39;t like that they didn&#39;t release the input files. Yes, they more or less detail how they get the data, but I ddidn&#39;t like not having all the inputs. But I&#39;d say, given the testing done, and the information released, it&#39;s not a really big deal. It just means you have to collect your own data from all the footage released just like they did in order to run your own simulation.</p>

<p>But I&#39;d like to mention one thing about the conspiracy theory about 9-11. It&#39;s not a theory. It&#39;s thousands of them. That&#39;s why we &quot;shills&quot; can&#39;t disprove everyone of them, because they range from &quot;there were no planes&quot; to &quot;the orbital invisible teapot did it&quot;. So there isn&#39;t a falsable theory. Unlike NIST&#39;s which is falsable. It probably isn&#39;t 100% accurate, but it&#39;s the more plausible scenario.</p>

<p>You are lying or NIST is lying.  Shyam Sunder the lead investigator said &quot;The study has identified thermal expansion as a new phenomenon that can cause structural collapse.  For the first time we have shown that fire can induce a structural collapse.&quot;    </p>

<p>And again with the fucking freefall, you guys are fucking delusional and pulling facts out of your ass. You are saying WTC 7 would take 2.5 seconds to fall at free fall speed. So basically, you&#39;re saying WTC 7 was 30.6 meters tall, which is the height from where something would reach the ground in 2.5 seconds at free fall speed (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%3D%281%2F2%29*9.81*2.5%5E2">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%3D%281%2F2%29*9.81*2.5%5E2</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, dumbass.  I said that there was 2.5 seconds of free fall.  Not that the whole building collapsed in 2.5 seconds.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please, you don&#39;t know shit about the simplest of high school physics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually its you that doesn&#39;t if you don&#39;t get how by its very nature a progressive collapse can&#39;t involve any amount of free fall.  In this case 2.5  seconds.  That would mean that in an <strong>instant</strong> it was as if 8 stories of structural components were simply not there.  By its very nature a progressive collapse can&#39;t happen in an instant.</p>

<p>You are lying or NIST is lying. Shyam Sunder the lead investigator said &quot;The study has identified thermal expansion as a new phenomenon that can cause structural collapse. For the first time we have shown that fire can induce a structural collapse.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It probably is the first time it actually happens, but thermal expansion has been taken into account for steel buildings since long time ago. It&#39;s important even in concrete buildings, as I recall seeing the gaps for thermal expansion in the EHE-98 (Spanish standard for concrete buildings back in 98). I really don&#39;t know if it&#39;s never caused a collapse, but it has definetely caused damage before (such as cracks in concrete buildings or deformations in steel ones). And this is not the usaual thermal expansion, we&#39;re not talking &quot;it&#39;s summer and it&#39;s hot outside&quot; expansion, we&#39;re talking about a really hot fire.</p>

<p>By the way, people seem to forget a fucking skyscrapper fell near this building, that&#39;s some structural stress to be taken into acount.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, dumbass. I said that there was 2.5 seconds of free fall. Not that the whole building collapsed in 2.5 seconds.</p>

<p>Okay, so there was free fall during 2.5 seconds. I&#39;m going to throw a [citation needed] just to learn a bit about it.</p>

<p>And by the way, if it wasn&#39;t a demolition caused by the fires, what was it? The NIST report tested for blasts, but really, anyone who has been near any decent amount of explosives when they go off knows that explosives are loud as fuck. And if it wasn&#39;t a controlled demolition with explosives, what was it?</p>

<p>Not a shill, just a person who&#39;s read the official version. Unlike you. You say they never told anyone what data they used. Except it&#39;s totally detailed in the NIST report. You don&#39;t get that long of a report saying &quot;A wizard did it&quot;. They detailed their data, the programs they used for simulating, where did they obtain that data and how they obtained it. A simple read of the NIST &quot;short&quot; report (the one with the hundred and something pages) would make you to quit blatantly lying (although unknowingly). The data is all there. You just have to want to look at it.</p>

<p>By the way, all the arguments for the official version have been peer reviewed. Haven&#39;t seen any peer reviewed article against. I&#39;d guess it&#39;s because peer reviewed articles demand you use the scientific method, instead of saying things for the fun of it.</p>

<p>Jet fuel burns at 1000 degrees at the most. Steel requires 2800 degrees to melt.</p>

<p>Also, all supports in a skyscraper have to fail at the exact same time to cause the building to go into free fall. This can only be done with explosives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I was really confused with your use of degrees there. I assumed we were talking Celsius (which the report uses most of the time) or Kelvin (international system). Farenheit are just not widely used in science.</p>

<p>Second of all, you just proved you haven&#39;t read a single word of the official version. Nowhere in the official version does it say that steel melted. NOWHERE. And if you find any page of the official report saying the steel melted because of the fires, please, point me to it. </p>

<p>Third, you just proved your total disregard of facts, saying the building goes into free fall. For starters it doesn&#39;t. The official report goes on about how they calculate the falling time, and thus the speed, but we don&#39;t even have to go that &quot;sciency&quot; to disprove this bullshit. You just need to see the debris ejected lateraly. They fall faster than the rest of the building. So either those debris have some magical acceleration on the y axis to make them accelerate at more than 9,81 m/s<sup>2</sup> or they were falling at free fall speed and the building wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>2200 architects and engineers support different parts of Richard Gage&#39;s theories. Thousands worked in the official report, from all over the world. So it&#39;s not a numbers game. But if you want to play the numbers game, you just have to see, 2200 architects and engineers think it was a demolition, the majority of us don&#39;t (at least in my experience, and I probably know more engineers than you do).</p>

<p>As always, you&#39;ll dismiss most of my message and you&#39;ll try to fight a small part of my argument. I don&#39;t mind, it just goes to show what happens when you try to disprove science with made up facts.</p>

<p>For a fire to bring down a skyskraper, it wouldn&#39;t have to melt the steel. It would have to weaken it. Melting happens at 1538ºC, the huge dip in strenght starts at 430ºC and ends at more or less 700-800ºC where steel has lost most of its strenght.</p>

<p>The NIST report cites the fires as being the reason as to why WTC7 fell. Nowhere does it say it fell at free fall speed. And if you could find any scientific paper saying WTC7 fell at free fall speed, please, do enlighten me. But if you want a scientific paper calculating the speed at which WTC7 fell, I refer you to the official report on WTC7 by the NIST, chapter 3.6 &quot;Timing of collapse initiation and progression&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, that video is full of shit. Hey, let&#39;s have this one camera angle that only shows 60% of the building, it&#39;s not like the official report took data from all different sources available. And more so, seeing as I have indisputable proof, let&#39;s send this for peer review. Except, what has more ground in science... a closed comment youtube video.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve disproved nothing? Free fall speed in both the towers and WTC7, and your claim of steel having to melt for a building to fall. By the way, it&#39;s not me who&#39;s saying the official version is false, then never actually bringing the official version.</p>

<p>Seeing as you&#39;re going to keep with the &quot;shill&quot; argument and disregarding any data I give, and you just move on with the next argument in your list, I&#39;m going to head off to sleep.

I just hope that if anyone is reading this AMA with doubts of both sides, he or she will see the arguments for and against. And on one side he&#39;s just going to read &quot;Shill shill shil shill, omg lizardking&quot;, which makes me rest easy.</p>

<p>But hey, I&#39;m all open for discussion still. You&#39;re saying that all the report is a one big lie. Ok, you don&#39;t make a big lie without smaller lies. The lie starts somewhere.</p>

<p>So please, link me to a mistake or deliberate error or lie in the official report. Page and everything, as to avoid what happened before, saying &quot;the official report says steel melted&quot; when it doesn&#39;t. So as to keep the discussion true to the report (which you say is false), if you&#39;re going to fight the official version, tell me where is it wrong, instead of making strawmen.</p>

<p>And now to address this last video. What message are you trying to convey with it? It&#39;s just a series of videos of the building falling, and definitely not at free fall speed. I don&#39;t know how many controlled demolitions would demolish first the east penthouse and then the rest of the building, but if you watch 2:35 on your own video, you can see the first of the 3 columns buckling and thus the east penthouse falling. Then, after a few seconds and a new load distribution, the other 2 major columns give up. Just like NIST report said, ovserved and simulated.</p>

<p>By the way, dindn&#39;t think of going this route yesterday: Okay, let&#39;s say the NIST report is &quot;one big lie&quot;. What is your theory about 9-11. Cause I don&#39;t know which theory you think it&#39;s true. See, there&#39;s only one official version, but there are like 20-30 different conspiracy theories.

When the site began to be watered down and when the storm came days later the site was soaked. Water expands at about 1600X’s it’s original volume when it hits a surface at 100°C, why were there no steam explosions in these <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0405/ofr-01-0405.html">“hot spots”</a>? In addition, how was <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/Molten.jpg">earth moving equipment</a> able to operate on these hotspots? Their <a href="http://www.liebherr.com/ME/de-DE/140227.wfw/id-14405-0/measure-metric/tab-5735_1517?file=%7E%2FcatXmedia%2FmeOLD%2FDocuments%2FR9250-GB-US-TB-Arctic-2008-02%5B1%5D_7887-0.pdf">hydraulics would have seized</a> up way before reaching the <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0405/ofr-01-0405.html">NASA “hot spots”</a> temperatures of around 700°C. We saw pictures of <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/www.investigate911.info_911moltensteel.JPG">material glowing</a> on the ground surrounded by paper, how is it that metal so hot it is glowing, ignores the paper around it?</p>

<p>3.) <strong>Seismic data</strong>. Why did the destruction of the towers (1,2 &amp; 7) not result in a <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/LCSN/Eq/wtc_pal_ehe_500.gif">Seismic Signal</a> that was of enough significance? How is it that there was no primary or secondary wave for the destruction of any of the towers? Only surface waves were present (earth recovering from weight lifted off). As I understand you are an architect from the San Francisco Bay Area, how is an architect from a very active earthquake region <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9VvSBwVT_A&amp;amp;t=4m19s">is not instantly interested</a> in the seismographic data? If the buildings came down due controlled demolitions wouldn’t the seismic data be the smoking gun?</p>

<p>4.) <strong>Lack of debris</strong>. <a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/shattered/search2.jpg">This</a> is a picture taken before 5:20pm on 9/11 (we know this because WTC 7 is standing in the back left).  The tiny 1-2 story WTC 1 “pile” is seen at the right center of the picture, it is dwarfed by the 8 story WTC 6 building (seen in the back right behind WTC 1). How does explosives or thermite, thermate, nano thermite, super-thermite or thermitic material account for the lack of debris? The twin towers were made out of around 5700 outer column <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/wot/wtc_ch2b/fig-2-3.jpe">prefabricated units</a>, why is that not reflected in <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/wtc/images/wtc-photo.jpg">this photo</a> or in the one mentioned before? Surely there was no steel removed or “shipped to China” when <a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/shattered/search2.jpg">this picture</a> was taken, again how does a controlled demolition and thermite or its variants result in this?</p>

<p>5.) <strong>Thermite. Thermite, thermate, nano thermite, super-thermite and thermitic material; why does it keep changing?</strong> As I understand it is essentially iron oxide and aluminum, if the towers were turned to dust as we see in the videos and pictures, should we not expect there to be iron and aluminum dust in the debris since the towers were made out of iron and had aluminum cladding? It is claimed that there were non-ignited thermite chips found in the dust. If the heat was so intense then how didn’t it set off the thermite chips? Also shouldn’t there have been lots of bright flashes everywhere? Not just a glowing red substance pouring out of places, but a blinding light as seen in YouTube videos about thermite? How was it that the thermite was able to act so quickly, accurately and on time? From all the videos I’ve seen it appears to be rather slow and nowhere near the speed needed to bring anything down in sequence. Why was thermite not mentioned in Stephen E. Jones &amp; Bob McIlvaine’s <a href="http://www.ocio.os.doc.gov/s/groups/public/@doc/@os/@ocio/@oitpp/documents/content/prod01_003034.pdf">RFC</a>? The word thermite is in a link within the document but that was added later, why would Jones not mention or discuss thermite within his RFC?</p>

<p>6.) <strong>1400+ <a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/member/e285f631afb1.jpg">Destroyed cars</a>.</strong> I have seen an interview of yours where you say falling pieces of thermite fell onto the <a href="http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/dewpics/Image8.jpg">cars</a> and burned them, how does this explain abrupt boundaries, plastic materials not melting, rubber not melting, missing door handles, entire engines missing or flipped cars. If thermite was falling and was hot enough to cause the destruction of 1400 cars, then why were people not burned, why was <a href="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b108/janedoe444/ARG/010911_WTC6_911_1328.jpg">paper</a> all over the ground not burned and why where there <a href="http://debunking911.com/street1.jpg">leaves</a> on the trees above or right next to these destroyed cars? <a href="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b108/janedoe444/ARG/toasted/Image19.jpg%7Eoriginal">These vehicles</a> were on West Broadway behind WTC 7 (building on the front right) so we know this image was taken before 5:20pm and was a good distance from WTC 1 &amp; 2. How can such destruction be attributed to thermite or fire?</p>

<p>Hopefully I have listed a few of my fellow redditors concerns above. If there is any information that I have gotten wrong feel free to PM me with the proper evidence. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dueVm1UGvXo">WTC 1 Turning Into Dust Slow Motion HD</a></p>

<p>Where did all this molten metal go to? Is there a giant metal block somewhere that was made from molten metal run off?  How did a collapse/bombs/molten metal not result in any significant damage to the bathtub? Clean up had to be halted because the earth moving equipment was damaging the bathtub. How does earth moving equipment damage something that 2 110 story buildings didn&#39;t?</p>

<p>There should be around 5700 outer column <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/wot/wtc_ch2b/fig-2-3.jpe">prefabrication units</a>. Why is this not consistent with what we see on the ground <a href="http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0110/images/jn08.jpg">immediately</a> after the event and a <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/wtc/images/wtc-photo.jpg">couple weeks later</a>?</p>

<p>And once again. If water converts into steam at approximately 100°C, then why was there not one steam explosion during the 90 or 99 days that those 700°C+ temperatures were present. The site had continuos water being poured on it and it rained on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011108030654/http:/www.courttv.com/assault_on_america/0914_rain_ap.html">14th</a>. How did this not cause a single steam explosion. If temperatures were as high as NASA has inferred, why aren&#39;t these <a href="http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0110/images/jn08.jpg">water pools</a> boiling? According to that NASA data is should be 819°F right there. That picture was also taken on 9/11.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/images/wtc2.jpg">LIDAR</a> composite image that shows the site on the 16th-23rd of September 2001. How do you get rid of almost 1 million tonnes of debris that quickly? If you download a <a href="http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3456634/8000_Photos_World_Trade_Center_9-11">picture collection</a> and look through it you will be able to start placing them in a rough order by looking at the environment around it (certain things move and it gives you a timeline). Anyways if you do that you will begin to see that there was not much rubble to begin with. You begin to realize that the videos aren&#39;t lying, the building is mostly turning to dust before it hits the ground.</p>

<p>As for the &quot;meteorite&quot; does that account for anywhere close to 200 000 tons of steel? I don&#39;t have a sample of it, if you have a few reports on it I&#39;d love to see them just PM me the links.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you are getting at here.  No smartass, they didn&#39;t move the steel out of there on the day of 9/11.  Most of the debris from the buildings are sitting in their respected footprints and surrounding vicinity.</p>

<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/01/23/china.wtcsteel/">Here is a link</a> describing the amount Chinese and Indian corporations purchased of ground zero steel thanks to Bloomberg and the Port Authority.  Let&#39;s do the math from the article.  China gets 50,000 tons and India gets four shipments of 33,000 tons each.  That&#39;s a total of 182,000 tons of steel.  </p>

In other words, clean up was much much slower than people are led to believe and they assume that after weeks most of the debris belonging to the towers had been cleaned out and shipped off. In reality the majority of the debris wasn&#39;t on the ground to begin with, it had turned to <a href="http://www.mdzol.com/files/image/141/141480/4aab77ed847ca_565_319!.jpg?s=38b1e9c40d71edbcdb397e898bb597bf&amp;amp;d=1409671509">dust</a> before a gravity driven collapse was a possibility. </p>

<p><a href="http://drjudywood.com/articles/dirt/dirtpics/010913_5316_large.jpg">This</a> picture was taken on the 13th. That ambulance is ground level parked in front of WTC 1. You can see the base of WTC 1. When comparing it with other pictures you find that it is only a few stories high. How can this be? Where is all the material? Some suggest it is in its basement. In WTC 1 there were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvdNHaOBGk4">14 people in stairwell B</a> scattered over the bottom few stories. All 14 survived, which means that if 110 stories had to fall into its own footprint it they would have to carefully navigate around a single stairwell. Here is a photo of <a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/dirt/dirtpics/010918_3946_hole_s.jpg">WTC 2&#39;s basement</a> on the 18th. It looks considerably empty. So if the debris isn&#39;t on the ground and it&#39;s not in the basement, where is the debris? <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/photos/docs/hudson4.jpg">Dust cloud</a>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what that material is. I don&#39;t have a sample, I don&#39;t have a bunch of scientific papers on it. I would be happy to get some. There are many ways to fuse materials, why do we assume that heat would have did that when we don&#39;t have any court admissible evidence about it. I really don&#39;t want to speculate on things that I don&#39;t have any information on. And if that was as hot as it needed to be to melt together, where was a single steam explosion when all the <a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/dirt/dirtpics/011028_5508cbh1.jpg">water</a> was draining through the site?</p>

<p>How can the NASA information be pertaining to heat when there was <a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/dirt/dirtpics/NYC14164_lake.jpg">workers and water</a> where the temperature was supposedly around 700°C? When water hits something at a a temperature greater than 100°C it expands in volume by 1600X&#39;s, why was there not a single steam explosion if all this molten metal, thermite and meteors were present. If temperatures are as high as stated in the NASA data (especially for 99 days) how can we conceive that there was not a single steam explosion when the water hit the 700°C temperatures? </p>

<p>Way to dodge the question.  Asking for perfect information is a sure sign your motives are less than genuine here.  Truth appears to be less important than your agenda.  (Put in a good word for me)  </p>

<p>Now answer the question.  Enough bullshit.  How was that hunk of steel, concrete, and carbonized materials formed without heat?  You say there are many ways to fuse those materials.  Put up or shut up.  Outside of heat, and/or extreme pressure (which will produce heat) I don&#39;t know of any other way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to get you here or be a prick or anything. I honestly cannot think of anything else that would be present in that situation that would be glowing and dripping. From all my experience as a human being I cannot fathom anything other than molten metal.</p>

<p>This may be my own lack of epxerience or knowledge which is why I ask, because I have no idea what you might even imagine it could be.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have an analysis of lots of things that day but some thing don&#39;t require an analysis, we can figure them out based on our knowledge of the world. I&#39;m just wondering if this is one of those things.
I mean, we all know that the fireball upon impact was caused largely by the fuel in the plane. Did we have an analysis of that? No, but we know it.</p>

A dripping glowing substance on video does not prove that there is molten metal or thermite.

<p>Material missing from WTC 6 and WTC 5 is mind boggling. I think the smoking gun is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HUlcXWF.png">WTC 4</a>. What can cause a building like that to have most of it&#39;s main body &quot;erased&quot;?</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/CCqRzAo">OSHA has the answer</a>.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed. <strong>OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take those videos to court and try to use them as evidence, see how far you can get. I&#39;ve seen them all before many times, the first one is pretty surreal. The sound, the guys reaction. Doesn&#39;t something not seem right? Doesn&#39;t the explosion sound odd? And the guy with the masks reaction makes me even more uneasy. I don&#39;t dismiss witness testimony, but from going through a lot of them I&#39;ve begin to see that they are using words within their normal vocabulary to describe things that are extraordinary. <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110116.PDF">People said</a> they were <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110171.PDF">picked up</a>, by God or an angel or a <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110376.PDF">gust</a> and floated down staircases and they floated down a block or <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110506.PDF">dove under a ESU truck and when they finally got up to come out the vehicle above them was gone</a>. <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110255.PDF">FirefighterTodd Heaney said</a> &quot;When I got to the front of the building, it tossed rigs down the street like it was- lie they were toys. They were upside down, on fire&quot;. We assume or are told that the tower falling created <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/9110354.PDF">gusts</a> strong enough to pick up and throw a firetruck down the block. Why are there still <a href="http://debunking911.com/street1.jpg">leaves</a> on the trees? Wind strong enough to throw a firetruck would strip a tree of it&#39;s leaves right? And wouldn&#39;t fire burn the leaves off? Not to mention burn all the paper around it setting the whole street on fire? These people are using the words they know to describe something that happened to them. And it seems to be the same with hearing &quot;explosions&quot; and seeing &quot;fire and smoke&quot;. </p>

<p>Consider this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o9pp9Q2_uM">911 call from Melissa Doi</a>. She was on the 83rd floor of WTC 2. She says that the floor is completely engulfed, and its very very very very hot. She says &quot;OF COURSE THERE IS SMOKE&quot; and we can&#39;t breath. Not once during the whole conversation do you hear someone coughing. &quot;Everybody is having trouble breathing some people are worse&quot;     &quot;Of course this is smoke! I can&#39;t breathe&quot;  &quot;I think there is fire I don&#39;t see it it&#39;s too hot&quot;.     When people overheat they get sluggish while their bodies shut down, she has an excited tone. And if the building is filled with smoke then how are they alive? How are they not coughing? Smoke is what usually kills people in the fire, it displaces the oxygen as well as consumes it all. And there is always coughing. My point is many many witnesses are describing things in the best way they can and it&#39;s important to really think about their situation by looking into the conditions surrounding them.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/c2IX76s.jpg">graphic</a> of the approximate size of WTC 1, 2 &amp; 7 and the Seattle kingdome as a reference. The seismic reading is listed. WTC 1 2.3, WTC 2 2.1 and WTC .6. The Seattle kingdome had the same seismic impact as WTC 1 (2.3) but the towers had 30X&#39;s the potential energy of the kingdome, how is it that the towers didn&#39;t make a bigger impact? How is it that WTC 7 had such a small signal. Also seen in the picture are solid blocks at the bottom 20 floors, 16 floors and 36 feet. This is the size the building should have been in order to get such a low seismic signal. The picture above was created using data from the <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/LCSN/Eq/wtc_pal_ehe_500.gif">Palisades in New York</a>. Also all 3 towers only created surface waves. There was no primary or secondary wave, I can&#39;t find the links explaining the lack of primary or secondary waves but you can look at the kingdomes wave side by side and see the differences.</p>

<p>And thermite is pretty slow. Most people that I run into say that thermite plus explosives brought the buildings down, so I was more or less referring to the sound of the explosions since thermite is just a cutting agent. Hopefully I addressed some of your concerns. Have a good one</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering what you think about the implications of the gusts of wind and the anomolies in the Melissa Doi call you mentioned. Do you have any opinions of what these facts might imply? Or do you not even go there? I get the impression that you&#39;re not totally satisfied with either AE911&#39;s story or the offiical story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first point about lack of sound. And any of those other points you wish to address.</p>

<p>1.) <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhyu-fZ2nRA&amp;amp;t=1m59s">Lack of sound</a> on 9/11.</strong> Explosions are faster than the speed of sound, and cause a loud bang. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtH6ZAkwmRo&amp;amp;list=UU-gaHD4XcTMUZazsBjAC5lQ">This</a> is an example of a recent controlled demolition. Mic clipping (when the signal gets overloaded it distorts and it is called “clipping”) can be seen and heard in the video linked. Why can we hear conversations as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TkNZrkSB7I&amp;amp;t=2m2s">WTC 7 is destroyed</a>? Why is there no evident clipping on most of the WTC tower destruction videos? How can explosives be that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdIiyBFlPr8">quiet</a>, furthermore how is it that the amount of explosive power needed to turn 2 110 story buildings and a 47 story building into dust failed to overcome all <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nop21vuK8tU&amp;amp;t=3m30s">foreground noise</a>? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, this sounds like it was pulled right from a sound library. Please provide other links of videos that pick up this sound. (I&#39;ve seen this video many times)</p>

<p>I never disputed that people heard what sounded like explosions throughout the day. I just want to address that it doesn&#39;t happen as the towers are being turned into dust. And in general that bombs cannot turn a building to dust.</p>

<p>When a building is going to be demolished there is a very careful process of removing almost EVERYTHING from that building. Why?

    <div class="md"><p>My recollection from a longer version of that video is that it wasn&#39;t that near WTC7 (it&#39;s about 5 blocks away) and it wasn&#39;t anywhere near the time of the WTC7 collapse.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to validate the time (I believe it has been done before though) but just looking at the shadow length alone suggests this was much earlier in the day (the sun was only 9 degrees from the horizon at 5:20pm - <a href="http://youtu.be/JnLcUxV1dPo?t=6m6s">here&#39;s what the shadows at that time actually looked like</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the WTC 7 how do we know when it took place. The streets are covered in dust so it was after 1 of the towers was turned into dust. It could have been after both towers were though. I had posted this in a comment before:</p>

<p><strong>First off, this sounds like it was pulled right from a sound library. Please provide other links of videos that pick up this sound. (I&#39;ve seen this video many times)
I never disputed that people heard what sounded like explosions throughout the day. I just want to address that it doesn&#39;t happen as the towers are being turned into dust. And in general that bombs cannot turn a building to dust.
When a building is going to be demolished there is a very careful process of removing almost EVERYTHING from that building. Why? Because anything that is in front of a window will turn into a projectile and will be accelerated faster than the speed of sound. Why don&#39;t the buildings around the towers look like they have been machine gunned? There are even many windows have have a round hole through the first pane but the second is untouched.

<p>Also firefighters report that their scott packs were spontaneously combusting. Could this not account for the loud bangs?</p>

A. ...&quot;I remember getting a drink of water out of their cooler there, and then we just started to put out the car fires, and the rigs were going, ambulances. I mean, there must have been 50 of these things burning heavily.  The Scott cylinders and the oxygen cylinders were all letting go. They were all blowing up left and right.&quot;</p>

A. ...&quot; There was a Deputy Chief&#39;s rig on fire that was extended to 113&#39;s rig. There was a big ambulance, like a rescue company truck, but it wasn&#39;t a rescue company truck. It was a huge ambulance. It must have had Scott bottles or oxygen bottles on it. These were going off.  You would hear the air go SSS boom and they were exploding. So we stretched a line and tried to put that out. He could only use booster water.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an audio engineer. Mics that have preamps built into a camera often have a smaller dynamic range, causing things to clip easier.  In the link of the controlled demolition in Ottawa I posted I used professional recording equipment and there was still no way around clipping.  If there is a controlled demolition going off near you there is NO mistake in what is happening. Those blasts hit you right in the core and rattle your teeth, and they certainly clip microphones and make any other noise around you inaudible. </p>

<p>Thank you for bearing with me. I noted you spent a lot of time compiling questions, and |I am sorry I have to ask you to focus on just one.  </p>

<p>Your question breaks down into 3 separate ones, but i think you&#39;re point is that explosives would have produced louder sounds than is apparent in videos(?)  </p>

<p>I must admit you raise a good point.  I am not sure what the sound characteristics of something like nanothermite might be but and advanced explosive would put a higher percentage of it&#39;s energy into heat &amp; light, and less into wasted sound energy.</p>

<p>Which would immediately be converted into sound as the surrounding air absorbed that heat and light. That&#39;s how a blast wave works. Were you kidding when you wrote that, or what?</p>

<p>If the videos show no explosions, and  witnesses claim there were explosions, video evidence trumps witness testimony. </p>

<p>If there were explosions, they would occur prior to the collapse (to cause it) and wouldn&#39;t have other sounds to compete with so they&#39;d be heard quite clearly on video, even at distance. </p>

<p>very little. the official story admitted that the WTC1 and WTC2 came down in a &quot;progressive collapse&quot;, but failed to admit that this is actually a known, tried-and-true method of controlled demolition. </p>

<p>therefore, as demonstrated in the official story of 9/11, there is no Thermate/ Thermite necessary, given that the progressive collapse will do the work for you, once the collapse is initiated. </p>

<p>so, for a progressive collapse controlled demolition, the crew would only need access to whatever floors that airplanes allegedly hit.</p>

<p>The columns used in that &quot;demonstration&quot; are nowhere near the size of the trade center columns, so it&#39;s a useless demonstration.</p>

<p>Also notice the <em>blindingly</em> bright light when the thermite is ignited?  Yeah, there was nothing at all like that on 9/11.</p>

<p>This is literally the most idiotic thing I&#39;ve read in a while, so congratulations I guess.</p>

<p>What if the planes are off target by a dozen floors?</p>

<p>How do you keep the thermite from <em>immediately igniting</em> once the massive fireball of an airplane explosion envelops them?</p>

<p>i dont believe that muslim extremists were piloting the aircraft, so i don&#39;t think they would have missed their mark, kinda like the fancy flying that hit the pentagon. </p>

<p>Except that the columns are nowhere near the size of the trade center columns, so you haven&#39;t proven that thermite could do the job without melting through the casings...casings that would have been attached to every single support column you intend on severing with your magic powder.</p>

<p>this is actually a valid point. </p>

<p>before this AMA, i would have thought Richard Gage to be a good guy, but his reaction to evidence that doesn&#39;t fit his narrative makes me skeptical of his bias toward pushing the thermite theory over the mini nuke theory, kinda like how <em>loose change</em> is a misdirection, with its &quot;revelation&quot; of Operation NorthWoods, which may or may not have been a forgery custom created for <em>loose change</em>. convenient, huh? </p>

<p>that was amply demonstrated. the goalposts are moving from &quot;can&#39;t shape charge thermate&quot; to &quot;experiment isn&#39;t the same size as WTC&quot;</p>

<p>in any event, the official story is that airplanes hit the twin towers, and the damage from the impact weakened the buildings such that the upper floors progressive collapsed all the way to the ground, or lower.</p>

<p>we are supposed to believe that a progressive collapse and a controlled demolition are two different things, when in fact progressive collapse is a form of controlled demolition.</p>

<p>this is why, according to the official story, a progressive collapse brought down the buildings (without explosives)</p>

<p>and why, according to conspiracy theorists, a progressive collapse brought down the buildings, as a controlled demolition, perhaps with some explosives (theoretically no explosives even necessary, according to official story)</p>

<p>Wow. Something like that might even explain those tarballs of mixed steel and concrete that could <em>not</em> have possibly occurred due to fuel or office fires.</p>

<p>And since its physically impossible for a building to <em>accelerate</em> its fall through a standing structure, the government&#39;s story is, quite simply, impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Richard,</p>

<p>Thanks for all you work and efforts.</p>

<p>My questions is - with all the resources now available to A&amp;E49/11T, why hasn&#39;t there been an effort to put forward, as a single point of reference, a comprehensive rebuttal to the NIST Report(s), along with Engineering and Science papers submitted for peer review and publication?</p>

<p>Also, given the height of the twin towers, and the timed speed of their destruction (to within about 6 seconds of absolute free fall in nothging but air), isn&#39;t there a straightforward proof requiring nothing more than grade 10 level physics (ie: laws of motion), along with a simple thought experiment, and if so, where&#39;s the physics paper for that?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve given this a LOT of thought over the years, and I&#39;m just not at all satisfied with Richard&#39;s response, to be perfectly honest.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make any sense not to be making a push in this direction. </p>

<p>It could BEGIN with the papers published over at the Journal of 9/11 Studies. </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking something that would look like a report by a reputable, multidisciplined, architectual and engineering consulting company with expertise in building forensics and of course, structual engineering. </p>

<p>Then, out of the single, larger report, spin off some papers for review and publication.. </p>

<p>Man would that ever get the ball rolling far and wide in a hurry - plus, it would invite replies in the form of attempted debunks of the singular, authoritative NIST debunk by A&amp;E49/11T, which, from what I&#39;ve come to understand, would simply not be possible or hold up under scientific scrutiny and analysis because they would have to violate the laws of physics to do so. </p>

<p>Everyone would be all over it.</p>

<p>and the kicker</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>“NIST claims their computer model can account for the observed phenomena, so let’s look at NIST’s model – except we can’t.  The software they used to do the modeling is available, but their model actually consists of all the numbers and measurements and assumptions together with any tweaks to the system they might have used to get it to come out the way they wanted.  If that information were released, their results could be checked by anyone with the appropriate skills and software tools.  But NIST has not released the numbers.  All we have been shown are some of the selected animated outputs they were able to get their model to produce… The very fact that NIST has not released their model strongly suggests they don’t want their results checked.  In other words, their results are intended to be taken strictly on faith.”</strong>

<p>They do not release their model data for peer review, therefore their model is a fraud and the investigation is compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their results are what matters. For example, if someone performed elemental analysis on a sample (say, the WTC dust) to determine its composition and presented their results, but wouldn&#39;t release their samples(just like Harrit), the study is not considered a fraud. Its considered a fraud when other people repeat the experiment with their own samples and can&#39;t replicate the original papers results. Or even better, when they can point out mistakes in the original paper.</p>

<p>But like I said, the findings of the NIST report are widely accepted by the scientific community. Other people in relevant fields have <a href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/1216">created their own collapse models</a> that independently corraberate NISTs findings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody said the report went through the peer review process; it was never intended to do so. However the scientific community have independently replicated NISTs results. You don&#39;t need the exact input data to check if its results are accurate, and most if not all papers pass peer review without the reviewers explicitly running through every calculation made in the experiment. Thats actual science, not the high school ideal that you&#39;ve been taught. Do you expect the people who peer reviewed CERN&#39;s higgs experiment to pour over trillions of bits of data they accumulated? or recheck any experiment performed on the new 20 Petaflop supercomputer built at ORNL? no, they focus on replicable results, which means they generally make sure the experiment followed a clear and accurate methodology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, let me help you.  I read it.</p>

<p>On October 1, 2002 Congress passed the &quot;National Construction Safety Team Act&quot; which authorized NIST to assemble teams and investigate the collapses of the World Trade Center Buildings.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://www.nist.gov/cfo/legislation/Natl_Const_S_Team_PL.pdf">www.nist.gov/cfo/legislation/Natl_Const_S_Team_PL.pdf</a></p>

<p>NIST released the public comment version of its &quot;Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7&quot; in August of 2008 and the comment period closed 2 weeks later on Sept 2008.  Note:  The report I am referencing here is NCSTAR1A, a summary, and if you were to read it all it’s about 77 pages.</p>

<p>In October of 2008 NIST released its final version of &quot;Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7&quot;. </p>

<p>After reviewing the Draft for public comment and the final release of NCSTAR 1A it is important to note the changes that were made for section 3.6 as an example of how NIST incorporated Freefall into their report.  <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/</a></p>

<pre><code>             - Draft for public comment pages 40 and 41 section 3.6

                                                      VS

                      - Final release pages 44, 45, 46 section 3.6
</code></pre>

<p><strong>&quot;Responding to the criticism, NIST in its final report issued in November 2008 did finally acknowledge that Building 7 descended at free fall.  According to NIST, “This free fall drop continued for approximately 8 stories, or 32.0 meters (105 ft), the distance traveled between times t = 1.75 s and t = 4.0 s [a period of 2.25 seconds].”)</strong> </p>

<p>Why is this an issue? Because the lead NIST engineers said free fall could NOT happen in a natural collapse. <a href="http://youtu.be/J_mqJUsqeLA">http://youtu.be/J_mqJUsqeLA</a></p>

<p><em>This</em> alone warrants a new investigation!!!</p>

<p>Second point:</p>

<p>Alright, so.  The standard called “full disclosure” in which all data and methodologies to  support a hypothesis are to be shared so that other scientists can independently verify (replicate) the results has been violated.</p>

<p>In this case, although the software is available, NIST has withheld the data. If  the model in the report is to be considered scientific and valid for supporting statements and conclusions in the report then the standard of “full disclosure” must be met. </p>

<p>I called Michael Newman (NIST Public and 
Business Affairs) via telephone and from email confirmation by Patrick Gallagher (NIST Director).  The document below is authentic and, put plainly, <strong>makes the model faith-based.</strong>  The investigation is therefore compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you claim to have read it, then cut and pasted some <a href="http://www.santabarbaracounty911truth.org/starters-guide.html">text you found online</a> rather than demonstrate some individual thought. Its really telling when you clearly don&#39;t even know what NIST set out to do, then try to pass some text you found on-line as your own response. </p>

<p>Its clear you haven&#39;t read it because you&#39;ve compared it to murder investigations, and can&#39;t seem to grasp that it was never meant to be submitted for peer review. </p>

<p>If you decided to exercise free thought for a change, rather than parroting what others have told you, you can find the NIST report <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/">here</a>. And on that page they list the objectives: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The specific objectives were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following the initial impacts of the aircraft and why and how WTC 7 collapsed;</p></li>
<li><p>Determine why the injuries and fatalities were so high or low depending on location, including all technical aspects of fire protection, occupant behavior, evacuation, and emergency response;</p></li>
<li><p>Determine what procedures and practices were used in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of WTC 1, 2, and 7; and</p></li>
<li><p>Identify, as specifically as possible, areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Its goals read the exact same way as any investigation into any engineering disaster, not murder investigations or scientific papers. They try and figure out what the problems were so that they can improve the safety of others. Are you also calling every investigation into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft">airline disasters</a> (which have drasticly improved airline safety) a fraud since they never were submitted for peer review? </p>

<p>If you want to complain about peer review, lets talk about Harrit&#39;s thermite paper, or perhaps <a href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/1216">science that intend on (and passed) peer-review that independently confirms NISTs fire induced collapse model</a>.</p>

<p>NIST never offered any such model for the &quot;collapse&quot; nor did they even effectively deal with it, offering a collapse initiation hypothesis only, while declaring that what ensued thereafter was &quot;inevtiable&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello Richard, i am a student (who gained employment today in a NYC establishment!!) studying Civil and Structural Engineering.</p>

<p>We had an open day the other day for all the engineering students, our section had five FAIA members who openly joked that the official reports were a joke and not worth bothering with, such that it could damage our learning.</p>

<p>This had probably 100+ students start to question the official account, 9/11 had never come up, ever, in our studies.</p>

<p>The lecturers refuse to talk about the event on campus, administration will not meet with the student body to discuss the benefits of learning about the engineering aspects in regards the three skyscrapers collapse.</p>

<p>May i ask, where is this pressure coming from and how do you think engineering students can best address it?</p>

<p>In American history there are two types of events. There are ordinary events which the information systems of the country can understand and transmit. There are also deep events, or meta-events, which the mainstream information systems of the country cannot digest. I mean by a “deep event” one in which it is clear from the outset that there are aspects which will not be dealt with in the mainstream media, and will be studied only by those so-called “conspiracy theorists” who specialize in deep history.</p>

If that information were released, their results could be checked by anyone with the appropriate skills and software tools. But NIST has not released the numbers. All we have been shown are some of the selected animated outputs they were able to get their model to produce… The very fact that NIST has not released their model strongly suggests they don’t want their results checked.

    <div class="md"><p>Some questions:</p>

<p>1) Why did we not hear explosions in the WTC 7 videos?
There are many reports of explosions in the twin towers during the collapses, however it does not seem the same for WTC. There also isn&#39;t much visible evidence of brightly burning thermite.</p>

<p>2) Some debunkers claim that independent researchers and scientists have done their own investigations and have agreed with NIST, how do you respond to such claims?</p>

<p>3) If AE911truths goal is to spread awareness of the truth, why have they not written any peer reviewed papers proving their claims? Surely this would help spread awareness.</p>

<p>4) How do you believe explosives were planted in WTC 7, 1 and 2 
seem plausible to fit with explosives, however WTC7 seems like a much harder job</p>

<p>5) What do you think in the strongest piece of evidence proving the official story is wrong and explosives were used?</p>

<p>6) Last question, you might not be able to answer this though. Seeing as there was much controversy over the peer review of the nanothermite paper, would it not have been best to republish the paper in a different journal? Why was this not done? (sorry if you cannot answer this).</p>

<p>EDIT: I thought of 1 more :) sorry. Do you have any opinions on the group &#39;project for the new american century&#39; and their infamous quote of a &#39;new pearl harbour&#39;?</p>

<p>Thank you for your question.<br/>
Its really quite simple.  </p>

<p>Imagine the 2 towers after they were hit: there&#39;s an upper section and of course the larger, lower section.<br/>
As an analogy imagine you are standing with a large bowling ball resting on your head. Your head can support the weight, right?<br/>
Now imagine that same bowling ball drops 6inches onto your head. can you still resist the bowling ball?<br/>
Yes of course you can. </p>

<p>Its really that simple, but you&#39;d be amazed how many people don&#39;t understand simple physics.<br/>
This is why it is so important we bring people&#39;s attention to these issues.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a fundamentally flawed understanding of physics that this guy is pedaling. We are interested in kinetic force, NOT static weight. I want you to do an experiment at home. Take the thickest book you have and a styrofoam cup. Place the book gently on top of the cup. It holds! Now take that book and drop it onto the cup. Cup is crushed. The top floors built up momentum (as an actual engineering term) as the floors damaged by the planes gave way. The amount of force required to stop that momentum is directly proportional to how fast you want to stop said material. The impact deceleration between two steel bodies is incredibly high (in other words, it takes a very short period of time for the velocity of the moving body to reach zero in the initial direction of movement) That means the amount of force imparted on the stationary object is much, MUCH higher than the original forces induced by the same weight. So it isn&#39;t a matter of the lower structure being able to support the weight of the structure above, it is a matter of the supporting structure trying to decelerate the falling part of the building. Simply put, if this guy is actually arguing what his example implies he is arguing, he has ABSOLUTELY no idea what he&#39;s talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have addressed the airliner argument in other posts. The planes were travelling over twice as fast (three times as fast in the case of flight 175) as the design constraint.  Given the masses of the planes, that translates into TEN TIMES more kinetic energy absorption as the design limit. To add to that, the building design did not account for several thousands of gallons of Jet A burning for an hour at 1500F. So let&#39;s review; the impact was ten times more energetic than the design limit, taking out a large fraction of the structure (the WTC buildings had a load carrying exterior, so these plane impacts were particularly devastating to integrity) then the remaining structural material was heated to 1500F. At that temperature, structural steel loses around 70% of its strength. So you have a ~60% compromised structure with its remaining structure being massively weakened by heating. That adds up to one screwed building. Also, the building did NOT accelerate at 1g. The lower structure DID provide resistive force, but if you complete the momentum equations, once the upper part of the building started to fall, the force needed to stop it was multiple times the structural limit, i.e. The structure failed when struck. I haven&#39;t read as much about wtc 7, but I do know the estimated temperatures were comparable. Even if falling debris damaged a smaller portion of the structure, the heat would have still made the building collapse. The reason it hasn&#39;t happened before is because none of the other buildings had structural compromise added to the equation.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The planes were travelling over twice as fast (three times as fast in the case of flight 175) as the design constraint.</p>

<p>Where are you getting this?  According to this document and its sources (<a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a>), the towers were designed to withstand an impact from a jet traveling at least 600 mph, which is faster than either jet was traveling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given the masses of the planes, that translates into TEN TIMES more kinetic energy absorption as the design limit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, incorrect, but even if it weren&#39;t... how is this relevant?  Obviously the towers survived the initial impact.  The kinetic energy didn&#39;t knock the towers down; it was transferred into destructive force on the columns, windows, and other materials in the tower, leaving only the tower as it was, with some minor structural damage and some fires.  WTC engineers have said that &quot;one could cut away all the first-story columns on one side of the building, and part way from the corners of the perpendicular sides, and the building could still withstand design live loads and a 100-mph wind force from any direction.&quot; (<a href="http://rethink911.org/evidence/twin-towers/implausibility-of-the-official-theory-twin-towers/">http://rethink911.org/evidence/twin-towers/implausibility-of-the-official-theory-twin-towers/</a>).  Obviously the planes did less damage than this.  The point is that the towers were extremely over-engineered, and just judging from the damage that was visible, there&#39;s no way the towers would have collapsed, especially straight down through the path of greatest resistance, while spewing out large sections of steel supports radially in all directions at high speeds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>several thousands of gallons of Jet A burning for an hour at 1500F</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  First of all, most of the jet fuel was consumed by the giant ball of flame you see immediately following the impact.  The remaining fires could not have been much hotter than ~500F (<a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/wtc/how-hot.htm">http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/wtc/how-hot.htm</a>), which is not hot enough to melt, or significantly weaken, steel.  Again, even if it was, in order for the building to collapse straight down like it did and not sideways (like this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1oceE_67MM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1oceE_67MM</a>, or this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqRN63iDTqA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqRN63iDTqA</a>), the columns that failed would have needed to fail in a perfectly symmetric way; that is, the columns on the <em>opposite</em> side of the tower from where the plane hit collapsed at the same time as those on the <em>same</em> side.  How is that even remotely likely?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the building did NOT accelerate at 1g</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one said this.  The towers experienced <em>constant downward acceleration</em>.  That is, there wasn&#39;t a &quot;jolt&quot; when the falling part of the building met the solid, undamaged part of the building.  This is impossible if you assume that the lower portion of the tower was completely undamaged.</p>

<p>And actually, WTC7 <em>did</em> experience free-fall, which is acknowledged by NIST (<a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtc7.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtc7.cfm</a>).  Again, how do you explain this without explosives?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the Jet fuel was consumed by the giant ball of flame...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t even know where to begin to explain how wrong this is. You have absolutely no understanding of the energy content of hydrocarbon fuel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>columns would have to have failed in a perfectly symmetrical way</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again completely false. Where did you get your degree in forensic structural engineering? Cascade failure of beams that hot would occur quickly enough that it may as well have happened all at once. There doesn&#39;t NEED to be a jolt, and there wouldn&#39;t be, considering once the top of the building started falling the forces needed to cause said visible jolt are astronomical. But I wouldn&#39;t expect you to understand that.</p>

<p>Finally, we weren&#39;t talking about WTC7 now, were we? Yes, it did experience MOMENTARY freefall, and if you read even a few sentences of the report past what you&#39;re referring to, the free fall acceleration duration almost perfectly coincides with the amount of time it would&#39;ve taken for the falling structure to hit more sound structure. A catastrophic failure of a load bearing member means just that. One second it provides resistive force, the next second there is no resistance. So momentarily the above structure falls.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done with this conversation, because it is obvious all of the information you have regarding the collapse was gleaned from conspiracy websites, and you have convinced yourself they are the only reliable source. That makes civilized discourse impossible. So you are entitled to your beliefs, and I&#39;m going to stop trying to change them, but that doesn&#39;t make them right</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would still be resisting gravity. If you are standing, you are by definition, resisting gravity. </p>

<p>It is not about damage at all. If I am correct, he is talking about free-fall, and about how free-fall (i.e. at the rate of gravity) is not possible when there is something resisting the gravity. For example, if you are jumping from the top of a building and there are a bunch of blankets in your way, you won&#39;t be free-falling, as the blankets would be resisting the force at which you are falling. </p>

<p>Now this is my understanding of what he was trying to say, but yeah its really confusing the way it is phrased, and so only he really knows for sure. If he was speaking in terms of damage done the person, clearly a bowling ball falling from any significant height is going to be damaging to the person, and so that would make hardly any sense in terms of an analogy. You wouldn&#39;t need to be that smart of a person to know that. So I am giving him the benefit of the doubt, by saying he likely didn&#39;t mean that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That analogy doesn&#39;t scale at all. Its simple physics. You drop a object from 6&quot; its going to have much less energy/momentum than if you drop it from 12 feet. You don&#39;t need to scale distances down, since a building falling 12feet is going to increase the energy by the same factor as any object would (ignoring air resistance). </p>

<p>Also, it doesnt account for the fact that the supports in a building need to be attached/aligned to support the rest of the structure. After it started falling it would be a miracle if the broken supports somehow all reconnected allowing the impact to be distributed evenly across the remaining support structure. Otherwise parts of floor XX is trying to support every floor above it, which is not something the WTC was designed to handle. The load was distributed to the core columns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? Theres video evidence of the exterior columns in the towers <a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/uploads/ats23891_WTC2bowing.jpg">bowing</a> and snapping. Thats actually happening right at the floor joists of the 79th floor in that picture, so I guess I am wrong. It would collapse about 2 stories, not one, minus a few feet of sag before the columns snapped, that puts it closer to about 20 feet rather than 12.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree that Orangutan&#39;s reply does not address why the tower continued collapsing after it started to. What I&#39;m saying is that the quote from the WTC engineers (“one could cut away all the first-story columns on one side of the building, and part way from the corners of the perpendicular sides, and the building could still withstand design live loads and a 100-mph wind force from any direction”) implies that the damage caused by just an airplane was not sufficient to <em>start</em> the collapse. </p>

<p>Exactly, It wasn&#39;t sufficient. We know this because the towers did not immediately collapse. The fires in combination with the damaged support structures initiated the collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if an entire floor was completely, spontaneously removed, the part of the building above the missing floor would have no more potential energy than it did with the floor there.  But an entire floor wasnt removed, most of the building was perfectly intact with zero air gap between the crushing part (top of building) and the crushed part (bottom of building). Since we know that the lower part of the building was pushing up exactly as hard as the upper part was pushing down, we would expect the upper part to disintegrate in about as much fall as the height of the upper section. Instead what we saw was the upper part disintegrate the lower part all the way to the ground. At some point, the upper part of the building should have disintegrated enough to not be able to crush the bottom part.</p>

<p>A pyroclastic flow (also known scientifically as a pyroclastic density current) is a fast-moving current of hot gas and rock (collectively known as tephra), which reaches speeds moving away from a volcano of up to 700 km/h (450 mph). The gas can reach temperatures of about 1,000 °C (1,830 °F).</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t see anyone being incinerated by what essentially was just big clouds of fast-moving dust.</p>

<p>There was nothing &quot;pyroclastic&quot; about them at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stores are pretty much equal to each other. So if two equal objects collide an equal force is applied to both, so they should destruct each other at approximately the same rate. So the upper part that began falling should have diminished completely after it had traveled by it&#39;s height into the bottom part. After that there should be nothing left to continue the collapse.</p>

<p>If there was a weak part in the bottom part of the building which would have severed we would have seen the collapse continue from that point, but it didn&#39;t happen like that either. It was like a pile driver crushed the building down. I didn&#39;t see that pile driver anywhere.</p>

<p>Even if the top part of the bottom portion of the building was heavily severed because of the fires, the collapse would still have slowed down until there is nothing left to do more damage. But the buildings were destroyed to the first floor and beyond, absolutely nothing left.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert on the matter, but my common sense says what happened is very unprobable or even impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, completely tangential analogy but I guess it still proves my point- the guy who starts fighting will get beaten up, but he will still get a few hits down to the 4th or 5th person in line. </p>

<p>So the force of the top falling is just &#39;diminished&#39; into the bottom portion right? Considering the top floors were speeding up as they fell (due to gravitational acceleration) and gathering mass from collecting the next floors on the way down, would you say with confidence that you know the lower floors have the structural integrity to resist that load?</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t already, try reading the NIST FAQs. They explain the physical concepts behind the building collapse quite clearly <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtctowers.cfm</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT: For a quick briefer on the difference between static and dynamic loads, check this out: <a href="http://www.pdhcenter.com/courses/s164/s164content.pdf">http://www.pdhcenter.com/courses/s164/s164content.pdf</a>. The collapse of the towers should make sense then.</p>

<p>I was more thinking he would get to second or first. One at a time I said, not trying to hustle his way down slapping everyone.</p>

<p>The speeding up part is one thing that I don&#39;t get either. There seemed to be absolutely no resistance to the top part making it&#39;s way through.</p>

<p>Yes I would say that eventually the force from the top part would diminish into the bottom after the mutual destruction ends. In case of WTC that didn&#39;t happen for some reason and the collapse continued to the bottom. If it was not assisted, the top part should have slowed while going into the bottom part and at the same time keep getting smaller and smaller. I could see the &quot;mass gathering&quot; part happening if the building didn&#39;t have those columns in the middle to support the structure. I can&#39;t say with confidence that I know anything about WTC except that they don&#39;t exist anymore, but it still seems obvious to me that the columns would have had the integrity to support the load from that small portion that begun falling. But what happened looks like they didn&#39;t and immediately were destroyed without any effort.</p>

<p>Edit: read the NIST FAQ. Not much in it except that what they say about the bottom part not being able to resist the load. Also that 40 stories of core colums were standing for a long time after the collapse is interesting, would like to see the images / video footage for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So the upper part that began falling should have diminished completely after it had traveled by it&#39;s height into the bottom part. After that there should be nothing left to continue the collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean by &quot;diminished completely&quot;?  Are you referring to the speed of the moving pile, or are you referring to the amount of rubble?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m bothering wasting my time, but here is a quick &quot;back of the napkin&quot; calculation that I&#39;ve seen in a couple places to explain the speed of the collapse.</p>

<p>When the first tower finally buckled at the point of impact of the plane, the top section would have dropped at near free fall speed through nothing but air for roughly 12 feet at least.  In that amount of time, that 35 story pile of rubble would have gotten to around 19mph.</p>

<p>Now, that 35 story pile of rubble moving at 19mph impacts the first floor of the structure beneath it.  Here is where the &quot;equal and opposite&quot; physics stuff comes in.  The amount of force necessary to pulverize <em>the first floor impacted</em> is equal to the amount of force needed to slow down that falling pile slightly.  So, the first floor impacted is pulverized and the pile is slowed down to something like 11mph.</p>

<p>Once that first intact floor collapses, it&#39;s weight is <em>added</em> to the falling mass.  Now instead of 35 floors worth of rubble, you have 36.  Also, once that first floor gives way, the rubble has <em>another</em> 12 feet worth of air to fall through before impacting the second intact floor.  So now you have 36 floors worth of rubble <em>starting out at 11mph</em>.  By the time it impacts the <em>second</em> intact floor, the pile is moving at ~27mph.</p>

<p>So with every floor destroyed, the rubble pile <em>grows</em> in mass and <em>increases</em> in speed.</p>

<p>The reason they were still standing is because the floors peeled themselves away from the core and perimeter columns as they collapsed on themselves. That&#39;s also the reason why the collapse inside the building seemed to outpace the collapse of the shell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first glance it&#39;s certainly counterintuitive.  Buildings don&#39;t <em>normally</em> collapse from office fires.</p>

<p>The thing is, the fires on September 11th weren&#39;t normal at all.  First of all, the fire suppression systems were completely severed by the first 2 towers collapsing, so the fires in WTC 7 had free reign to burn out of control without a drop of water.  Secondly, the fires were going on as many as a dozen non contiguous floors or more, fed by office furnishings and diesel powered generators, and burned for over 7 hours.</p>

<p>The FDNY personnel onsite could see the building in major distress 3 hours before it came down.  They had a structural engineer onsite consulting, and not only did he predict that the building was going to collapse, but he also nailed the exact timeframe for the collapse.  </p>

<p>Clearly the thought of a controlled demolition that would have been a major shock to everyone onsite doesn&#39;t jive with the reality on the ground.  Given that other structural engineers have done their own collapse models separate from NIST and come to essentially the same conclusion, I&#39;m OK with deferring to the experts and the people on the ground on this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point about the building getting stronger as it progressed downwards. The bottom building columns are always bigger than the upper parts of those same columns, and as the building collapsed there was less weight to support because the building turned to dust and was blown every direction,  even up.</p>

<p>this is exactly the physics question we have been posing to each other lately. if you were given a hammer and a cement block, how much physical labor would it take to hammer that block to a fine power? your arm would get tired before the job was done. </p>

<p>also interesting is why the cement turned to dust instead of randomly sized broken pieces. </p>

<p>this is one reason the official story doesn&#39;t hold up. but it may also be part of the reason that the Thermite/Thermite theory doesn&#39;t hold up. </p>

<p>molten granite is another. </p>

Yes of course you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you simply drop the hammer onto the nail with the force of gravity alone, the nail might be &#39;pushed&#39; in slightly, but i seriously doubt it will be driven in. for it to be driven in, you&#39;d have to apply much more additional force than gravity.</p>

<p>for instance, when i see nails being hammered in real-life, the hammer is either swung with significant additional force from the human musculature to drive the nail in, or repeated hammerings are required to gradually push the nail in. </p>

<p>and in any case, the hammer is FAR HEAVIER than the nail. a more accurate analogy to the WTC, where a fraction of the entire building caused the collapse of the entire building, would be the nail resting on the hammer, and dropping the nail onto the hammer. in a hundred percent of the cases, i believe the nail will bounce off the hammer.</p>

<p>so, as the static load (potential energy) of the upper part of the building started to collapse and became a dynamic load (kinetic energy), did the floors below the collapse experience an increase in load, a decrease in load, or did the load stay they same? </p>

<p>What do you think actually happens in a controlled demolition?</p>

<p>the building support super structure is systematically, symmetrically removed, hense the phrase &quot;controlled&quot; demolition. asymmetrical failure should cause asymmetrical collapse. if you were sitting in a 4 legged chair and one of the legs broke, which way would you fall? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Richard! Huge fan here.</p>

<p>Have you watched <em>9/11- The New Pearl Harbor</em>? In my opinion it is by <em>far</em> the most comprehensive investigative documentary surrounding the events of 9/11 ever made. If you haven&#39;t, I implore you to watch it as soon as you get some time for a 5 hour documentary (yes, 5 hours). If you have (or when you watch it), would you consider having AE911Truth endorse the film? It does not have nearly the publicity that it deserves, and the filmmaker Massimo Mazzucco encourages free duplication and distribution of the film, so there would be no legal issue to sort out. </p>

<p>Thanks for doing this AMA by the way!</p>

<p>What amount of nano thermite is required to cut a single typical beam in WTC7 - that is what volume would that occupy and how much would it weigh?</p>

<p>Also, how does scaling affect the amount of force applied by objects in motion, or how much support they require to remain intact?</p>

<p><a href="/u/smokinbluebear">/u/smokinbluebear</a> couldn&#39;t be here and asked someone to submit their question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We know the WTC steel was quickly shipped off--much of it to be recycled in China and India--but, what were the most important pieces to analyze for a proper investigation? and what percentage of these pieces were investigators given access to? was WTC 7 handled the same as the Twin Towers?</p></li>
<li><p>Wondering if you think the victims (and their families) have been silenced with a non-disclosure agreement which Feinberg’s 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund may have contained...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Richard Gage&#39;s response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey smokinbluebear,</p>

<p>To answer your first question..the most important pieces to analyse were (and still are) where the horizontal steel beams connected with the outer steel frame. These are the most likely points for the explosives to have been positioned.
I&#39;m not sure the exact percentage investigators had access to: but the investigators looked at the debris without considering alternative explanations. That&#39;s not science.
WTC7 was handled jsut as unscientifically as the towers in my opinion. You can&#39;t see a building collapse at free fall speed, symmetrically, into its own footprint and not want to look deeper.</p>

<p>For your second question. Its important to highlight the points and evidence that cannot be refuted. There&#39;s no good evidence that anyone has been silenced. I remain on the fence for that discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey dubgong,  </p>

<p>Thank you for your question.<br/>
Is that a video of one fo the towers?<br/>
I have studied many videos of both the collapses of the North and South towers and have not seen this particular anomaly before.  </p>

<p>I am speculating of course, but I would say this is fake.<br/>
If you can find any evidence that this existed prior to, say, 2003..It would be helpful.<br/>
I have doubts when something like this only emerges in 2014. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of a fake video in which WTC7 was seen to have obvious scattered explosions, and a Flying Saucer.  </p>

<p>(but just because I am skeptical doesnt mean you&#39;re wrong: keep gathering evidence!)</p>

<p>My question is, do you realistically think the truth will ever come out to the mass public? It&#39;s kinda disheartening to see how close minded a lot of people are, even in the face of <strong>strong</strong> evidence. I wish I knew more people like the ones around this sub because frankly it&#39;s a little lonely.</p>

<p>Sorry my question doesn&#39;t relate to architecture or engineering. I don&#39;t for one second believe the official story, so I don&#39;t have anything technical to ask about.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for doing this. Takes serious cojones and I wish you even more success in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the arguments that I hear a great deal is regarding the explosive charges which can be observed as debris/explosions coming off the building traveling down just below the line of collapse. To my mind I have always thought it reasonable that rather than exploding charges this is actually debris being blown out of the building as a result of the air evacuating the collapsing levels.  When you have a whole floor worth of space which you are collapsing in a second it is likely to violently push out all the air right?</p>

<p>Your appearance on cspan was a big deal. How did they go about contacting you for an appearance? Were you surprised? And what was their reaction, if any? Any follow ups? Great interview, avoided the theories and stuck to the irrefutable evidence. That video has been viewed 210,000 times on cspan website alone. </p>

There was a small bit of an engine on the pentagon lawn. It&#39;s surprising how stupid or oblivious people are. &quot;A huge plane crashed into a building. Then all the parts of the plane just evaporated and all that was left was a huge hole. Move along now. Nothing to see here.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Richard, 
I&#39;m thrilled to be to ask you a question. According to one poll 65% of Canadians support the bombing of ISIS. If in 2014 you haven&#39;t got that war is racket yet, I think it&#39;s safe to say you probably never will. So this says to me that the majority of the population has decided to remain ignorant about the ongoing militarism of this country and it&#39;s allies. What am I do to? The world is collapsing into total war and the future looks bleak from so many angles, how can help people see what&#39;s going on, to look deeper, when the vast majority of the people don&#39;t want to talk about it (and those who do can&#39;t help but being irrational?) Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks for your great work, which is indisputable, so much so that I wonder why the powers that be let you get away with it. You once said you&#39;ve never been threatened, has this changed? I&#39;m really surprised that there aren&#39;t attempts to shut you down. You are living proof that freedom of expression is still alive and well in your country. Please comment. Thanks! </p>

<p>I absolutely agree that the work done by those skeptics and professionals subsequent to the report is crucial to determining the truth of what occurred that day; I asked about the report only with regards to what information (or lack there) contained within your organization might hope to one day correct or perhaps expand upon. For example, the NIST failing to provide the data behind their collapse model of building 7. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? It takes a proper demolitions team <em>weeks</em> to setup a controlled demolition which includes placing hundreds of high energy charges, running miles of det cord, but more importantly removing a massive amount of the structure maually.</p>

<p>Clearly it was impossible to remove any of the structure manually -  that work couldn&#39;t have gone unnoticed - so if anything the explosive load would have to be even higher. Instead of using a supersonic high explosive as it typical in demolition (which would have been obvious from the sounds) they apparently had to use some sort of thermite - which has never been used in building demolition.</p>

<p>So this team of however many people rigged a building to collapse, unnoticed and without any of the typical structural preparation, and did it with basically untested incendiary materials? To me it seems to be a <em>massive</em> leap of faith to believe that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so on the one hand, it would take weeks of careful preparation and lots and lots of explosives to bring down a building like #WTC1 in a controlled demolition, </p>

<p>but on the other hand, a random airplane crash can somehow accomplish in minutes the same thing that would normally take weeks of careful preparation and lots and lots of explosives to accomplish?</p>

<p>you can&#39;t really have it both ways. either buildings come down relatively easy from being randomly hit by a plane, or buildings don&#39;t come down very easily and require lots and lots of explosives for a controlled demolition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well sure, if you&#39;d been able to model the dynamics of the collapse well enough in advance I guess it might have been possible to know that removing only a small section could result in the collapse.</p>

<p>However if it was vital to destroy the building in a very specific way then you&#39;d have to emulate the existing wisdom on demolition. For the Twin Towers especially it would require incredible precision to deliver the result that some claim would be impossible without explosives.</p>

<p>Also, frankly, you can have it both ways either. It was either possible for a small localised failure to create the collapse we saw, or it could only happen as observed if it were a classic controlled demolition. If the latter then it would need a lot of explosive power.</p>

<p>As for radio detonators - yup, it&#39;s possible, but we&#39;re talking about hundreds of carefully synchronised detonations.

<p>what? you know theres plenty of ways that the metal could have gotten red hot in that pile right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve asked many people, no one has ever answered... So I&#39;l ask you...</p>

<p>The molten metal was allegedly days or even weeks after the collapse. It&#39;s asserted that &quot;simple office fires&quot; or &quot;jet fuel&quot; would be unable to produce molten metal.... So how would thermite or any controlled demolition explain this curious event?</p>

<p>While it&#39;s certainly true that thermite will melt steel, that melting will only continue for as long as the reaction is taking place. Once the fuel is consumed and the reaction stops so does the melting - things cool down and solidify again.</p>

<p>How then could thermite explain molten metal days or weeks after the collapse?</p>

<p>even the iron in the casting process in a foundry goes from as liquid as water to solidified enough to manipulate in only a few hours. </p>

<p>Well yes, and if you look at what it takes to create massive heat from traditional combustion, the key is usually insulation and ventilation from below. It seems likely to me that the debris pile, pilling air from the subway tunnels, could have generated such conditions. </p>

<p>Although that said the documentation for the &#39;flowing rivers of molten metal&#39; is pretty limited - the reality of what was happening beneath the debris seems far from clear I think.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I saw those pictures too, along with the claim that there were 15 <em>kiloton</em> nuclear weapons below the towers - verified by Edward Snowden it was claimed, if I recall.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no geologist, but that looks more like erosion than melting to me. My impression is that melted granite would have a much more glassy appearance. There&#39;s also not a lot of context for the images. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the problem is that the interview has been edited - aside from &quot;...maybe the smartest thing to do is to pull is, ahh, and they made that decision to pull...&quot; it&#39;s impossible to know exactly what the full interview actually was. There is very clearly an audio edit immediately before &quot;and then we watched the building&quot; - he could have said any number of things in there, and the editors have compressed it for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s perhaps surprising that an unedited extract of the interview was never released to counter this persistent talking point, but I&#39;m not sure how long it was between that documentary going to air and the &quot;pull it&quot; quote becoming such a big deal, so it&#39;s very possible that the original footage was no longer in existence by then.</p>

<p>In countries like Egypt only a tiny minority of the population believes in the official story, and if I am not mistaken even the President of Egypt at one point expressed doubts.  So in places like that were questioning the official story is more socially acceptable why don&#39;t engineering departments at universities ever look into the facts?  Or do they?</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t have a question directly related to A&amp;E, I am curious about your conspiracy theory perspectives. What are your views on some more &quot;accepted&quot; theories, such as the NWO, depopulation agendas, chemtrails, central banking, and mainstream media manipulation? Do you think 9-11 opened up your mind to these possibilities or were you thinking about them before? Do your co-workers and volunteers share similar theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello Mr. Gage, my question is what you think of former Senator Bob Graham discussing the redacted 28 pages of material from the 9/11 Commission Report ? </p>

<p>Former Senator Graham has stated that what is in those 28 redacted pages directly links Saudi Arabia to the 9/11 hijackers. If that is the case, do you think that a grassroots effort by your organization could place pressure on certain key elected officials to introduce more bipartisan legislation to get the 28 pages declassified ? </p>

<p>In other words, could it really be that simple ? Now I&#39;m aware how secretive the federal government is with their classified documents, like how there are still documents that relate to the Kennedy assassination that are classified. Do you think that the 28 classified pages could be the holy grail of the 9/11 truth movement ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Richard, many theories get thrown around in discussions here, specifically Judy Wood&#39;s space beam stuff which you have thoroughly debunked on your website <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/faqs/505-faq-3.html">http://www.ae911truth.org/faqs/505-faq-3.html</a></p>

<p>Considering some people are just researchers, rather than professional engineers etc, many can be sucked into baseless theories that &quot;sound good&quot; because they do not understand certain observations.
Could you explain to the users here why it it critical to have verifiable facts and tangible sources, all backed up by multiple credentialed experts and how that has made your organization and E.S.O documentary so successful?
And is there any expert that supports your group who caused huge breakthroughs for 9/11 truth? Dr. Bob Bowman and Dr. Lynn Margulis are amazing! May they rest in peace.
Great work</p>

<p>Hey 9-11-2001</p>

<p>AE911Truth has become successful simply because we stick to the evidence. Judy Woods DEW (I like space beam though) is as laughable as NISTs &#39;office fires&#39;.</p>

<p>When evidence is independently verified, its very difficult to debunk, and that the kind of evidence we need to keep our focus on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Richard,</p>

<p>First off, I would like to thank you for your courage in speaking out about such an important issue and what many of us here establish as our ‘Kennedy Moment,’ who here remember that day extremely vividly. Most here from the US will agree that this event was both a crucial and pivotal moment for not only geopolitics as it was for us in our individual lives.</p>

<p>Again, most of us here have researched the event extensively and can all agree that at the very least, the facts of that day are not supported by our government’s Official Version.™ While not getting into the specifics of the events, we all agree that our government used the events as an excuse to pass legislation that has greatly limited our civil liberties, and have set of a chain of events that has forever expanded our police state in both the militarization of local police forces and the establishment of an entirely new governmental department dedicated to ‘keeping us safe.’ This has also expanded the surveillance state that has expanded exponentially in the past 13 years with the global applications of the internet.</p>

<p>I for one am no longer satisfied with being just knowledgeable and content with ‘knowing’ what really happened (as well as being disgusted by what it has done to this country and planet with the cascade of events that have taken place), I am eager for change in our current system, but know full well that the pervasive effects of unlimited campaign financing effectively make those who are not career politicians with access to these types of monies, silenced.</p>

<p>By your estimation, what percentage of the American public who were affected by that day agree with the above statements? I imagine we both agree that our current representatives will not open a new, independent, criminal investigation for the events on 9/11 due to the taboo nature of the subject in American culture and dialogue.</p>

<p>A representative democracy or republic was meant initially as a system of government for regular people to serve their people, and it was regarded as a privilege. Career politicians are diametrically opposed to how this system is supposed to work, as they are dependent on their campaign financiers to fund the PR machine required to keep them in power. With the advent of services such as kickstarter and indigogo, could your foresee a system where candidates are crowdfunded (and possibly unified by certain key issues), and legislation can be organized in an open-source manner? I believe if this is feasible, the time is NOW.</p>

<p>With that being said (and I apologize for the lengthiness of the comment already), do you agree that at this point, the only real way for a new investigation to occur is for our governmental system to be repaired? For this, the only remedy I can imagine is a complete reboot, with career politicians being voted out and individuals free of the shackles of corporate money replacing them, who will finally be able to represent their constituents properly, and who can open a new criminal investigation, and slowly roll back the legislative behemoth implemented in the 13 years since 9/11. In my view, this can only be established by motivated citizens who are unhappy with the status quo, and are willing to unite with others who may not agree politically or ideologically on what the mainstream media state as ‘major issues,’ for the greater good.</p>

<p>Could you see this happening? Again, thank you for all that you do for those that are unable to speak out for fear of being socially ostracized and difficult to employ in certain fields (I am in academia myself).</p>

<p>All the best,</p>

<p>Jim</p>

<p>(Edit: don&#39;t allow the downvoting to dissuade you from considering the information presented herein - when over the target we always take some flak!)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Hi Richard, </p>

<p>I have one more question and one that I feel is very important to answer, in light of all the evidence for CD of the twin towers.</p>

<p>What do you think of the evidence provided by Pilots for 9/11 Truth, via the NTSB Radar Data, that the south tower impact plane could not possibly have been a hijacked UA Flight 175 piloted by Marwan al-Shehhi, and must therefore have been a highly modified 767-type aircraft, remotely piloted to the target?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2jjt0z/re_911_south_tower_plane_a_question_for_pilots/">Evidence that the plane that hit the south tower was a highly modified, remotely piloted, military-grade 767-type Aircraft - A Question for Pilots.</a></p>

<p>Is that evidence not <em>complimentary</em> to the evidence that the twin towers were brought down by explosives initiated from around the impact areas?</p>

<p>After all, if the buildings were prepped in advanced to be destroyed with explosives, then it hardly makes any sense whatsoever to suggest that all they required, to be destroyed as they were and to complete the murderous hoax, was a successful hijacking with boxcutters, and successful navigation and piloting to the target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He MUST think that the plane was taken over from on-board control (hijacker locked out of flight control) and flown by wire ie: remotely. </p>

<p>If so, very VERY risky indeed (with the pre-wired building waiting for impact) to fly such an aircraft (unmodified commercial airliner) through that dive and final approach to target - at Vmo + 148kts, and Vd + 88kts. </p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd. </p>

<p>No rational, thinking person, with access to the data, could go along with that contention.</p>

<p>With evidence of CD of the twin towers in hand, there is just NO WAY that he could possibly think that the plane was a hijacked aircraft flown to the target by a piss-poor novice &quot;pilot&quot;, not a chance. He&#39;s not a dummy. </p>

<p>For the operation, the way it played out, there could be no room for such an unknown, indeterminate outcome.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really at a loss here... (shakes head in wonder).</p>

<p>Some people, like those at 911Blogger, think, wrongly, that positing remotely piloted drone aircraft is somehow discrediting to the movement, when the truth of the matter, based on an objective analysis of all available info and data, including evidence for CD of the twin towers, is just the opposite, since the implication is that the 9/11 truth movement is saying on the on hand, that the buildings were destroyed with explosives initiated from around the impact areas, and on the other, that the operation relied upon successful hijackings and piloting to the targets by complete novices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautifully said, however.... hypothetically, if you knew a terrorist cell were going to impact a tower, and cause a construction nightmare (&#39;cause you know those suckers would just keep standing), then pre rigging them in anticipation wouldn&#39;t be that much of a stretch. Melt the cores with thermite and let gravity and a few charges do the rest... I think we can have it both ways. Rigged for explosion, and anticipating collision, from first a nut job hijacker, followed by an exquisitely delivered drone.</p>

<p>FWIW- I remember sitting in my Dads office at the DOJ in 1994. I was 17 and ironically enough... &#39;conscripted in my local counterculture&#39;.  </p>

<p>A significant concern at the time, and a likely motivation for all of this <sup><sup><sup><sup>,</sup></sup></sup></sup> was the need for better wire tapping and data analytics. Encryption was a problem. The scale of digital growth was a problem. CALEA wasn&#39;t cutting it. All of these people cared about &quot;us&quot;.</p>

<p>Russia warned us of the Atta attack. DIA and CIA knew of it. FBI had a glimpse... 911 was sudo judo. We pulled those planes in, pulled the towers down, and pulled the wool over everyone&#39;s eyes... Or tried to anyway. A/e911 needs to accept drone aircraft, and truthers at large might benefit from accepting that we did have a foreign enemy that day. I don&#39;t know what happened fully, but I&#39;m happy to help obliterate the obfuscation.</p>

<p>Also, with a degree in radiological sciences, I can assure you that any discussion of mini nukes is a red herring. The isotopes presented are not even close to the quantities, or integral decay chain products with associated half lives of true &#39;fallout&#39;.</p>

<p>No planes, no terrorists, directed energy, and mini nukes are complete distractions.</p>

<p>I find that absolutely incredible that you may believe that the plane that hit the south tower was a hijacked UA Flight 175, piloted (@ Vmo + 148kts) by someone the 9/11 Commission considered to be no more skilled or trained than Hani Hanjour, especially in light of all the evidence for the CD of the twin towers.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll note that I said nothing about &quot;no planes&quot; or any such nonsense/disinfo. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with Rob Balsamo&#39;s data and evidence, as you might see from the link I offered. There may be things wrong with his personality and interpersonal approach and style, mind you, but the info and science is totally 100% valid. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2jjt0z/re_911_south_tower_plane_a_question_for_pilots/">check it out</a></p>

<p>P.S. Are you really Richard Gage? There wasn&#39;t the usual twitter photo given for other reddit AmA&#39;s. I simply cannot fathom how you&#39;d be unable to think this all the way through, causally - moviong backward from the evidence and proof of CD of the twin towers, to the plane impacts and their approach.</p>

<p>So in other words, you think that the buildings were prepped and ready for explosive demolition, whereby all that was required was a successful hijacking (with boxcutters) and piloting to the target (at Vmo + 148 kts).. to set the stage for the official story as to the <em>apparant</em> causal mechanism of the twin towers&#39; destruction? Huh?! </p>

<p>Question: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2jjt0z/re_911_south_tower_plane_a_question_for_pilots/">Why so fast</a>?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a final piece of this puzzle in terms of the nature and levels of the impacts as well as timing in regards to the subsequent destruction of the buildings about an hour and an hour and a half later that really needs to be addressed here to complete this heinous puzzle and &quot;mystery&quot; (to the degree that you can&#39;t quite see it yet).</p>

<p>A NATION CHALLENGED: THE TRADE CENTER CRASHES; First Tower to Fall Was Hit At Higher Speed, Study Finds.</p>

<p>By ERIC LIPTON and JAMES GLANZ</p>

<p>Published: February 23, 2002</p>

<hr/>

<p>Researchers trying to explain why the World Trade Center&#39;s south tower fell first, though struck second, are focusing on new calculations showing that the passenger jet that hit the south tower had been flying as fast as 586 miles an hour, about 100 miles an hour faster than the other hijacked plane.</p>

<p>The speed of the two planes at impact has been painstakingly estimated using a mix of video, radar and even the recorded sounds of the planes passing overhead.</p>

<p>Two sets of estimates, by government and private scientists, have surfaced, but both show that the plane that hit the south tower at 9:02 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175, approached the trade center at extremely high speed, much faster than American Airlines Flight 11, which hit the north tower at 8:46 a.m.</p>

<p>In fact, the United plane was moving so fast that it was at risk of breaking up in midair as it made a final turn toward the south tower, traveling at a speed far exceeding the 767-200 design limit for that altitude, a Boeing official said.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;These guys exceeded even the emergency dive speed,&#39;&#39; said Liz Verdier, a Boeing spokeswoman. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s off the chart.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>The speed of the planes is far from the only factor that will be important in explaining why the south tower, which was struck between the 78th and 84th floors, fell within 56 minutes and the north tower, which was hit between the 94th and 99th floors, stood for 102 minutes.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it was the combination of structural damage and the fires, fueled by thousands of gallons of jet fuel, that brought the buildings down. </p>

<h2>The south tower was also hit at a lower point, meaning there was more weight bearing down on the damaged floors.</h2>

<p>But the difference in the towers&#39; survival times, which translated into a difference in the amount of time tenants and rescue personnel had to get out, could be related in part to the planes&#39; speeds, researchers said.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;Clearly one plane came in faster and had more energy,&#39;&#39; Dr. Jerome Connor, a professor of civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is studying the collapses, said of the new calculations, in which he was not directly involved.</p>

<h2>&#39;&#39;If one building had more damage, it would take less for the heat to build up enough for it to come down,&#39;&#39; Dr. Connor said. &#39;&#39;That would help explain why the building that was hit second, fell first.&#39;&#39;</h2>

<p>The high speed of United Flight 175 may also have complicated the hijackers&#39; mission, because it would have been more difficult to make accurate adjustments in the plane&#39;s direction, several pilots said. Loud and repeated alarms would also have been sounding in the cockpit.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;The faster you go, the less time and room you have for error,&#39;&#39; said Tim O&#39;Toole, a former 767 pilot and staff engineer in safety department of the Air Line Pilots Association.</p>

<p>The flight data recorders from the two planes have not been found; Boeing officials said these so-called black boxes are not designed to survive the forces they encountered in the collapse. </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/bj52c38839.jpg">&quot;off the chart&quot;.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0Q5eZhCPuc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=50m16s">&quot;collapse&quot;..</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p>The South Tower was hit much lower, across multiple floors (78-82), and at a much higher rate of speed (by 85 knots or 100mph) than that at which the North Tower was hit - that <em>must</em> explain it - how the towers fell and why the 2nd one hit, fell first.. followed by the North Tower in the exact same manner about a half hour later (burned longer). Of course! After all, it could only be as a direct and sole result of the plane impacts (the attack) that the twin towers were completely destroyed. To say otherwise would be crazy and makes no sense..</p>

<hr/>

<p>Returning to look at the design parameters of exterior perimeter steel columned framework of the twin towers.</p>

<ul>
<li>were they &quot;tapered&quot; thinner towards the uppermost stories where the North Tower plane impacted around the center of the 95th-96th floor (of a 110 story building) at 425 knots or 5 knots over the Vd design dive limit and 65 knots over Vmo?</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;..oh, now I get it.&quot; &quot;Why so fast?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main idea here is that the south tower plane had to attain a certain critical speed to successfully break thorugh the perimeter steel columns at the lower level (around the 79th floor) ie: thicker, whereas the north tower plane, which impacted around the 95th floor level, although still very fast at 425 knots or just over the Vd limit of 420 knots, did not require as much speed to break through at the higher level where the exterior columns are not as thick (tapered thinner towards the uppermost stories for weight loading purposes). </p>

<p>This was done to help create the narrative as to the causal mechanism of destruction for both towers, as per the article cited ie: building hit lower, although hit second, fell first.</p>

<p>Thanks for answering or attempting a brief reply to my question.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with an individual by the name of Dwain Deets, because he&#39;s very familiar with your work and that of your group. Might he even be a member of A&amp;E49/11Truth? </p>

<p>More info here: (in case you&#39;re still checking your mailbox from the recent AMA).</p>

<p>What are your thoughts upon review of this information, and have you ever watched any of the videos from pilots for 9/11 truth or checked out the listing of <a href="http://www.patriotsquestion911.com/pilots.html">pilots who question 9/11</a>? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to presume that you&#39;re sincere in this notion that there&#39;s &quot;no evidence for that&quot; (modified Boeing 767-type aircraft, remotely piloted) but to be perfectly honest, I can&#39;t understand why you would think that way. It just doesn&#39;t make any sense to me, at all.</p>

<p>And isn&#39;t CD (controlled demo) itself tangential evidence suggesting nothing less within the context of &quot;operational success&quot;..?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Richard,</p>

<p>In case you were unwilling or didn&#39;t have the time to read my longgg post, below this one, here you go! re: your request. [everything you need is contained in this post]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>.. if 510 knot groundspeed = 515 TAS which equates to a CAS of 508 (at 1000 ft. alt.), working backwards, we could just as easily say that 360 CAS (Vmo Limit) = approx 358 kts GS (groundspeed) and 420 kts CAS (Vd Limit) = approx 418 kts GS (at 1000 ft alt that is), with a margin of error of +/- 1 knot. The outer OUTERmost flight envelop limit adds 15-20% (FAA FAR), so 1.2(418) = 501.6 kts GS or 8.4 kts / 9.6 mph LESS than the S Tower Plane&#39;s speed on final approach to impact (510 knots, margin of error +/- a knot ie: calc used multiple radar returns and other methods). </p>

<p>This is (501.6 kts GS at 1000 ft. alt.) however, the point AT which breakup and disintegration occurs, guaranteed, within a few seconds or something like that or somewhere between 1-10 seconds (read that somewhere for the &quot;absolute load limit&quot; - need to locate that to clarify with absolute precision - now included, below the line).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please note that the groundspeed (although relative airspeed and pressure increases as the plane descends into the ever thicker air density near sea level) was maintained between 510-520 knots for just over one minute, and not for just a few seconds at the last moment.</p>

<p>Probability this was UA Flight 175 Reg N612UA piloted by Marwan al-Shehhi from the United Arab Emirates? Zero, or so close to zero, that it might as well be zero. </p>

<p>Now consider the South Tower awaiting a high precision impact at the lower level..</p>

<p>I rest my case.</p>

<p>Re: Ultimate Load Limits</p>

<p>Since the aircraft was not flying in level flight and was coming out of a fairly steep dive to level off and then pull a final 1.5 (+/- 2) g-force turn to impact, we must use as an ultimate load limit, the ultimate aeroelastic limit, which I&#39;ve added to Vd/Md although the margin may in fact be referring to 20% of the ultimate operational limit or the Vmo, in which case we&#39;d be looking at a CAS of.. 432 or a GS of 430 kts (at 1000 ft. alt.). </p>

<p>The structure must be able to withstand the ultimate load for at least 3 seconds without failure.</p>

<p>FAR Structural Design Criteria</p>

<p><a href="http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/structures/FAR301.html">http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/structures/FAR301.html</a></p>

<p>STRUCTURAL LIMITS</p>

<p>These are the allowed positive and negative g limits of the aircraft. Structural limits are based on the
strength of the aircraft structure. Under any loading, even 1 g, the aircraft structure will flex. A large
amount of airframe flexure will lead to permanent deformation (a bent airframe) or component failure. A
lesser amount of flexure affects the lifetime of the airframe due to metal fatigue, etc. The aircraft structural
limits are selected to ensure that g-loading induced flexure will not damage the airframe or shorten its
design life. Structural limits are also referred to as acceleration limits or limit load factors. Exceeding the
structural limits (overstress of aircraft) may or may not damage the aircraft. Numerous overstresses will
shorten the service life of the aircraft.</p>

<p>AEROELASTIC LIMITS</p>

<p>These define the maximum operating speeds in both KIAS and IMN of the aircraft. Above the aeroelastic
limits, structural damage or failure may occur as well as a loss of stability and/or control authority. The
aeroelastic limit is frequently referred to as the “Redline Airspeed.”</p>

<p>ULTIMATE STRUCTURAL LIMITS</p>

<p>These define the ultimate operating strength limits of the aircraft. Flight operations beyond the ultimate
structural limits will result in structural failure of some component of the aircraft. It should be noted that
the ultimate structural limits are outside the normal <em>operating</em> envelope (Vmo - 360KCAS) of the aircraft. The usual aircraft design rule is for the ultimate structural limit to be 150% of the structural limit. However, this may not be strictly true since the structural limits may reflect aircraft lifetime concerns (UA 175 Reg N612UA, built and delivered in 1983) while the ultimate structural limits do not.</p>

<p>CORNERING SPEED</p>

<p>This point is located at the intersection of the structural limit and the aerodynamic limit. Cornering speed
is the minimum speed where the limit load factor can be achieved. Cornering speed defines turning
performance of the aircraft at which the aircraft can achieve maximum turn rate and minimum turn radius.
At or below cornering speed, the aircraft cannot be overstressed; stall will occur first. Cornering speed
may also be referred to as maneuvering speed.</p>

<p>ENVELOPE</p>

<p>The envelope is constructed based on the variables of weight, altitude, configuration, and loading
(symmetrical or unsymmetrical).</p>

<p>WEIGHT</p>

<p>Weight will generally affect the structural limits and the aerodynamic limits. The aerodynamic limits are
based on stall speed of the aircraft. Changing weight changes stall speed and the aerodynamic limits.
Likewise, as weight change affects the allowable g’s, the structural limits will also be affected. When the
structural limits are affected, the ultimate structural limits are also affected. An aircraft is usually
structurally limited at low altitudes.</p>

<p>ALTITUDE</p>

<p>Changes in altitude will affect the aerodynamic limits and aeroelastic limits. As altitude changes, the
maximum Mach number and maximum IAS change. The ability to generate the necessary speed to
achieve maximum g is also affected as density decreases and thrust available is reduced. At higher
altitudes, an aircraft is usually aerodynamically limited due to lack of thrust and decreased density</p>

<hr/>

<p>1.5 Ultimate Load Limit. The Vmo/Mmo operating limit of a 767-222 is 360 KCAS/.86M. According to the above, theoretically, an aircraft (brand new) should be able to withstand an ULTIMATE LIMIT of 540 KCAS/1.29M for at least 3 seconds before the aircraft disintegrates. </p>

<p><a href="http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/structures/loads.html">http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/structures/loads.html</a></p>

<p>This does not however account for issues involving aircraft lifetime (wear and tear) and doesn&#39;t factor g-loading or cornering. Therefore, we must revert back to the aeroelastic ultimate load limit of 1.2 max when considering <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tywMLqVcBO4">the real world event itself</a>.</p>

<p>Update: The 1.5 limit is a purely structural load limit (not aeroelastic) and therefore applies to g-force limits only, not airspeed limits. </p>

<p>Therefore we MUST revert to the aeroelastic ultimate load limit of 1.2 as per the following FAA FAR. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Richard, </p>

<p>Thanks for your consideration, and for your time and willingness and openmindedness.</p>

<p>The best and easiest way to understand it (that the plane was not UA 175 and couldn&#39;t have been) is reached, first and foremost, by the simple, logical process of inductive and deductive reasoning, working backwards from the proof of CD in terms of the <em>apparent</em> causes and effects. </p>

<p>Strangely, just last night someone wanted to argue 9/11 with me, unprovoked (although they know I&#39;m a &quot;truther&quot;) and for them, CD was discounted as an option because Occam&#39;s razor suggests, in no uncertain terms, that the cause of the destruction (&quot;collapse&quot;) of the buildings was the plane impacts. He was further convinced, having been so duped (and this is a scientifically minded person) that the &quot;collapse&quot; was and appeared to be &quot;what you would expect&quot;. I did not have the time or the wherewithal to explain the data to him, because he was being obstinate and was not really curious or open minded, just wanted to prove me wrong, or worse, crazy (some people..).</p>

<p>This very same person was well aware that Building 7 was a case of controlled demolition, there was no problem there, but when it came to the twin towers, the apparent cause of the plane impacts was something that he could not shake in order to examine evidence that the twin towers also, were brought down with explosive CD, and did not in fact collapse as a direct and sole result of the plane impacts. </p>

<p>Therefore, the campaign has been a success, up to a point, to the point that the CD of the twin towers has been ignored if only because in those two cases, planes hit, then, the buildings &quot;collapsed&quot;. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t &quot;decouple&quot; Building 7 from the twin towers, as you know. But in the same way, once you decouple the proof of CD and the plane impacts - setting them aside as if it&#39;s <em>assumed</em> that they were the hijacked airliners pilots by islamist extremist fundamentalist novice pilots (at Vmo + 148 kts) - then there&#39;s a big time problem with your fundamental hypothesis, which MUST include BOTH &quot;data sets&quot; to function as a viable alternative hypothesis and narrative to the official story capable of factoring all the data and information according to the proper use of Occam&#39;s Razor, right up to the meta events themselves (plane hit, buildings destroyed). I&#39;m sure you can see that clearly.</p>

<p>CD from an <em>apparent</em> causal perspective, is strangely dependent therefore in terms of causation, or the lack thereof, upon the south tower plane speed data and analysis. </p>

<p>Your initial reaction might be to dismiss this idea but I invite you to look at the two events as they are apparently linked, and, as they are not, from the perspective of a detective, like Sherlock Holmes. </p>

<p>So pick up your pipe and smoke it, while I try to walk you through the evidence step by step and distilled down into the simplest of terms..</p>

<p>editing and adding - stay tuned.</p>

<p>..over the coming two weeks, I will return to make posts, with each containing one fundamental idea which will be explained properly and thoroughly. You can of course pose any questions you like as we go along. Bear in mind that the key to my own understanding and comprehension is that I was nothing but a curious layman seeking to understand the data and evidence. Therefore, if I can understand it as a layman, so can you and so can anyone you would seek to share it with. That&#39;s the reason to stick with this inquiry and follow it through to where it logically leads, running the tape back and forth both ways - before and after impact and destruction, as well as before and after the proof that the CD of the twin towers has become entirely SELF EVIDENT, resolving the question - &quot;but what about the planes? Planes did hit the buildings! What are you saying that the planes were not the cause, you must be nuts!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you see and have encountered this dilemma more times than you can count. Thanks for coming back to this and for sticking around to grok it most fully.,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I suppose the estimated speed of UA175 would be a good starting point.</p>

<p>How is this gained? and more importantly ...how accurate is the 510knots (is radar estimate very accurate in these things)?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>--UA175_AA11 NTSB NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_Study <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/p4t/Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_Study--AA11,_UA175.pdf">http://pilotsfor911truth.org/p4t/Radar_Data_Impact_Speed_Study--AA11,_UA175.pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;For much of it&#39;s final descent, UAL175 maintained a descent rate between 4000 feet per minute and 8000 feet per minute. During the descent from 12,000 feet to 6000 feet, the aircraft groundspeed remained between 500 - 520 knots. As the aircraft made it&#39;s final descent to 1000 feet, it ACCELERATED and impacted Word Trade Center tower #2 at approximately 510 knots groundspeed.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Now, for those of you who, in examining this data, might simply conclude that the NTBS Radar Data MUST be wrong and in error, please keep in mind that the NTSB used ASR radar from EWR, JFK, LGA, HPN as well as RADES for their analysis. The NTSB also did a video speed analysis which corresponds to their radar data study. </p>

<p>Those who feel the radar may be wrong therefore should not fly in or out of the NYTC terminal area as the same radar is used daily to assign speeds and vector aircraft for approaches to EWR, JFK, LGA and HPN. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I will check re: how accurate the radar returns are, but I think they&#39;re pretty accurate. There were also a couple of other analyses using plane motion studies, relative to the surrounding buildings, as well as based on frame rates, both of which pegged the speed at 586 mph (to within maybe 1 mph), which equals 509.2 knots. Therefore I think it&#39;s safe and fair to say that it&#39;s accurate to about +/- 1 knot. If you wish, I think I could find links to the supplementary speed studies.</p>

<p>stay tuned for more and for the beginning of the step by step explanation. </p>

<p>When we&#39;re done you&#39;ll have mastered this data and analysis and WILL be in a position to present it to a challenging audience, no problem. I will even be teaching you in the most simple terms how to use the aeronautical calculator, taking screen shots from it (which you can also do) to make it absolutely self evident in the most simplistic, and undebunkable, self evident terms.</p>

<p>Hang in there with me, thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Important Note: The plane&#39;s speed and targeting on the south tower is at the very CRUX of the official story itself as to the &quot;cause&quot; of the destruction of the buildings an hour and an hour and a half later.</p>

<p>Let me show you what I mean by the following statement, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best and easiest way to understand it (that the plane was not UA 175 and couldn&#39;t have been) is reached, first and foremost, by the simple, logical process of inductive and deductive reasoning, working backwards from the proof of CD in terms of the apparent causes and effects. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>using the official story itself to demonstrate the point.</p>

<p>The following News Archive item from the New York Times (which you can find and capture searching it with Google) illustrates the point.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kn63y/nasa_dryden_aerospace_projects_director_declares/clmx8m2">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kn63y/nasa_dryden_aerospace_projects_director_declares/clmx8m2</a></p>

<p>While I have not proven the actual speed threshold at the lower impact level (to successfully break through the thicker perimeter exterior steel columns, at that level - 79th floor) exceeding such and such a speed (say 500+ knots), I do think it&#39;s fair to say that speed and inertia played a role in getting the plane through the outer wall to impact the core, while igniting that absolutely gargantuan fireball (which helps to create a suspension of disbelief as to the cause of the buidlings&#39; destruction). </p>

<p>At the very least, from a logical, deductive POV, there is really no other explanation capable of answering the question - why so fast?</p>

<p>Please acknowledge receipt of these replies, and I&#39;ll proceed with the step by step explanation, while showing how you can, whenever needed, explain it in turn to other laymen (non pilots, non aeronautical engineers). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Richard, </p>

<p>I think it would be easiest and most condusive to your inquiry, if you were to log in at the Pilots for 9/11 Truth forum and pose this question there, among others, in their Research Forum. And if Balsamo&#39;s a little gruff, don&#39;t let that phase you. He&#39;s been through so much to bring forward this data and evidence so it&#39;s understandable. To the contrary, I think if you were to make the inquiry there he would be most accomodating, and would be more than happy to provide you with all the fine detail you may need.</p>

<p><a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/">http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/</a></p>

<p>There were two other analysis which pegged it at precisely 586 mph. I don&#39;t think the one you referenced is reliable. </p>

<p>This one references one of those studies, although it would require further research to pin down the research paper itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kn63y/nasa_dryden_aerospace_projects_director_declares/clmx8m2">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kn63y/nasa_dryden_aerospace_projects_director_declares/clmx8m2</a></p>

<p>I will return with the step by step approach you asked for, which will involve the use of the aeronautical calculator to show how the flight envelope works through varying altitudes. Once you get that down pat, then you can create screenshots to clarify with precision for any audiance no matter how &quot;challenging&quot;. </p>

<p>As far as I know, +/- a knot (or two maybe) is right. </p>

<p>It&#39;s 510 knots, with a range during it&#39;s descent, between 510 and 520 knots groundspeed, after which it actually <em>accelerated</em> (impossible without more powerful engines by orders of magnitude greater than standard) to retain a groundspeed, at the lower altitude (in near sea level air density) of approx 510 knots. </p>

<p>510 knots, at 1000 feet alt. = 508 KCAS (knots calibrated airspeed), which is a full 148 knots past Vmo (360KCAS) and 88 knots past the Vd design dive limit (420KCAS). </p>

<p>Re: built in margin. From what I&#39;ve been able to gather, for a used aircraft, while maneuvering in flight, the safety range/margin is between Vmo/Mmo and Vd/Md, beyond which loss of flight control amid structural failure is imminent (unless the plane was seriously modified in a number of ways). </p>

<p>There are also numerous precedents for loss of flight control, structural failure and breakup, for which P4T have a very straightforward V-G diagram that you can also use during your presentations. </p>

<p>Please take the time to review the various videos and presentations by Pilots for Truth. Please join their forum, and ask some questions. As a layman I&#39;m not fully qualified to answer all your questions. </p>

<p>What I can do, however, is explain the data in layman&#39;s terms and show you how to use the aeronautical calculator to make screenshots which will demonstrate the data and principals involved re: groundspeed to TAS, EAS, CAS and corresonding Mach # at higher altitude (for the same aerodynamic pressure on the airframe) to even further illustrate the point. </p>

<p>This absolutely proves, in no uncertain terms or well beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aircraft was not and could not have been UA175 piloted by Hani Hanjour&#39;s ex-room mate Marwan al-Shehhi. Especially in light of the self evident proof of CD of the twin towers.</p>

<p>Edit to add: Btw, evidence that the plane wasn&#39;t UA175 is not based on any eyewitness accounts, since the photographic record reveals that it was even painted up in the United Airlines livery. (pic to follow). </p>

<p><a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/File:Flight_175_Traub1.jpg">http://www.911myths.com/index.php/File:Flight_175_Traub1.jpg</a> (paste the url into your browser to view).</p>

<p>Analysis of the plane&#39;s length and proportion, although not entirely conclusive based on angles etc. suggest very strongly that the aircraft was not the 767-200 (222) version, but instead the 767-300 which is a little longer for and after of the wing. Can&#39;t really use that effectively as evidence howevever, even though it&#39;s true that the plane doesn&#39;t fit the profile for a 200 series 767.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Richard,</p>

<p>So you&#39;re not just trying to be difficult or contrarion then I&#39;ll have to assume. : )</p>

<p>You&#39;ll note that according to the NTSB Radar Data Speed Impact Study, that during the plane&#39;s harrowing dive (under any circumstances), it was clocked by multiple radar returns, which as far as I know are pretty accurate, travelling in a range BETWEEN 510 and 520 knots..., where, at the end of it&#39;s dive, during the leveling out on final approach and target aquisitioning, it actually accelerated, to maintain the 510 knots groundspeed (515 TAS, 508 CAS) at the lower altitude, which it would have to do to retain that speed in the thicker, denser air nearer to sea level. So either way we&#39;re looking at a range of between 500 and 510 knots. Surely that&#39;s evident.</p>

<p>However, this would require, by necessity, some serious modifications, including engine power at least 3X greater than standard, because to accelerate well past the point where parasitic drag has overcome thrust (typically, even the Vd design dive limit of 420 KCAS can only be reached at altitude from a fairly steep dive) would not allow for an acceleration as the plane enters the thicker air in the lowest strata of the atmosphere nearer to sea level ie: the engines become &quot;cups&quot; or miniature metal parachutes where parasitic drag has already long overcome thrust capacity - call or reach out to Dwain Deets, ex NASA Dryden Flight Research Director, for additional info and clarification on this and other matters involving the physics and aerodynamics and jet propulsion involved. This is the main reason that John Lear is a &quot;no planer&quot; (if he really believes that nonsense). However, when you look into the science of jet propulsion, say through conversation with Deets, you&#39;ll come to realize that such a thing isn&#39;t impossible with sufficiently powerful engines, but again, by orders of magnitude greater than standard. </p>

<p>There&#39;s your smoking gun right there - the acceleration at the end of the dive while leveling out on final approach. Verify that, and you&#39;ve got yourself a military grade 767-type remotely piloted drone aircraft painted up in the United Airllines livery (as they call the painjob), beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly in light of the self evident proof of CD, working backwards in regards to apparent causes and the lack thereof if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Ref: </p>

<p>&quot;The dive speed is the absolute maximum speed above which the aircraft must not fly. Typically, <em>to achieve this speed, the aircraft must enter a dive (steep descent), as the engines cannot produce sufficient thrust to overcome aerodynamic drag in level flight</em>. At the dive speed, excessive aircraft vibrations develop which put the aircraft structural integrity at stake.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://theflyingengineer.com/tag/airbus-a380/">http://theflyingengineer.com/tag/airbus-a380/</a></p>

<p>The NTSB, instead of fudging the data, handed it over, as it was, almost with a wink and a nod with the reference to that final acceleration phase, which they should not have referenced and released to the public if they wanted to protect and guard the big lie. It&#39;s plain as day. In plane sight, so to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Richard, </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a pilot or an aeronautical engineer. The point was that they used multiple radar returns, and recorded the speed during the descent to be 510-520 knots, where, after the dive the plane ACCELERATED to retain a groundspeed of 510 knots to the point of impact, which it would have to do (increase airspeed) at the lower altitude near sea level to remain at the same groundspeed. This would be impossible, however, without much MUCH more powerful engines. </p>

<p>Richard, if you find this line of inquiry to be of interest, I encourage you to reach out to Dwain Deets and other pilots, including Rob Balsamo of P4T to pin everything down with the utmost precision. </p>

<p>You could start by reviewing some of the videos and info presented including &quot;World Trade Center Attack&quot;. </p>

<p>You have the time and the wherewithal to do all the necessary research in this regard. </p>

<p>As to the aircraft&#39;s airspeed limitations and the boundaries of it&#39;s flight envelope, that I can explain in layman&#39;s terms, and I&#39;d be happy to try to help out in that area. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s go with the 510 knot ground speed or to be conservative, between 500 and 510 knots, and closer to 510. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a good idea though I must say to get right into the radar recording technology, and how that number was arrived at, along with the two or more other studies which corroborates the radar speed, to within 3 mph, or 2.6 knots, where as far as I understand, the radar is the more accurate, pegging the speed at 510-520 knots throughout the dive, then, at 510 knots for the final approach as a result of a final acceleration at the lower altitude - an EXTRAORDINARY finding, and one that I created a new thread for in r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just doing my best to try to be most helpful, that&#39;s all, Richard (you&#39;re so much nicer &#39;in person&#39;). </p>

<p>The research itself is of course something that anyone can engage in and pursue. </p>

<p>Forgive me if I&#39;m not a radar technician. </p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s the medium. Lack of social cues and all that. </p>

<p>I will come back to you with my step by step demonstration for a challenging audience, using 510 knots groundspeed, just to be as helpful as possible. </p>

<p>As to the radar, I don&#39;t know, but they tracked it at a speed of 510-520 knots for quite a while. It&#39;s not like they were out by any wide margin.. in truth I don&#39;t know the answer, nor do I see it as my responsibility to provide it as we&#39;re in this research all of us together, learning things from one another. </p>

<p>I suggest getting in touch with Dwain Deets and/or Rob Balsamo, among others, and pin it all right down. You&#39;re going to need it and soon, because we&#39;re reaching that stage now in the inquiry, once CD has become self evident, which it has or is fast becoming - that &quot;the plane question&quot; is going to come up more and more I would predict because it goes to the very hijacking of the principal of Occam&#39;s Razor embedded right into the design of the op itself where it is not sufficient to say simply that the CD has nothing to do with the plane impacts and fires. We can&#39;t sever that causal linkage without taking a look at one very suspicious flying plane that was really there and really did what it did, including <strong><em>accelerate</em></strong> in near level flight and near sea level air density while flying at Vmo + 148 knots, CAS and Vd + 88 knots CAS (the limits are measured in CAS so I converted it - will show you how if you check back in and stick around)</p>

<p>Talk to you soon.</p>

<p>Best regards, and thank you. Your organization is one I once prayed for, once we had the group Scholars for 9/11 Truth, which went haywire when Fetzer co-opted it and Stephen Jones had to leave, but that was the seed, which DRG planted in you. </p>

<p>And now here we all still are 13 years after the event. </p>

<p>I was part of a small team who worked up the research for Loose Change btw, not that I need any special praise. </p>

<p>I am very happy though that the 9/11 Truth Movement is turning into the little red engine that could, so to speak. </p>

<p>Our voice is being heard at long last, and we sure were a voice crying out in a wilderness back in early 2002. </p>

<p>It&#39;s working. The truth outs. </p>

<p>So thanks again for all you&#39;ve done and continue to do with unrelenting persistence and perseverance. </p>

<p>The building 7 campaign can now be considered a great success. Let&#39;s not leave the twin towers out of the true story though just because they happened to have been successfully hit by aircraft. </p>

<p>It&#39;s in plain sight, plain as day. The NSTB handed over the truth, and just left it there awaiting discovery. </p>

<p>Please continue this line of inquiry.. for the sake of the truth about what really happened there on that beautiful fall day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Richard, presuming you ARE Richard Gage.. (please read this?)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. Much appreciated!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve painstakingly covered those things and more in this OP and thread (it shouldn&#39;t take you long to go through and undestand the principals and data). </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kn63y/nasa_dryden_aerospace_projects_director_declares/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kn63y/nasa_dryden_aerospace_projects_director_declares/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m a layman and I got it ok, although it took some refinement in presenting it carefully and thoroughly so that it can be clearly understood by other layman (non pilots, non aeronautical engineers). Part of the problem involves the relationship between TAS (true airspeed), CAS (calibrated airspeed), EAS (equivalent airspeed), and Mach # at the varying altitudes, where the flight envelope, measured in KCAS (knots calibrated airspeed) remains the same at all altitudes and throughout all flight regimes because it&#39;s a calc correlated to both TAS and EAS (TAS adjusted for both pressure and temp). I&#39;ve tried my very best to take the confusion out of it and to present a clear case in that OP and thread&#39;s comments. I&#39;ve even gone so far as to argue the other side who say that it&#39;s possible (however improbable).</p>

<p>The conversion you&#39;ve asked for involves first groundspeed to TAS (true airspeed), where groundspeed + windspeed vector = TAS, adding approx 5 knots to the 510 groundspeed (very light headwind that day to the N/W) giving us a TAS of 515 knots at approx 1000 ft. alt. (and a corresponding CAS of 508 kts) bearing in mind that Vmo/Mmo is 360 kts (CAS)/.86M (above 23,000 ft alt) and Vd/Md is 420 KCAS/.91M. </p>

<p>Airspeed, not groundspeed, is the key to understanding the aerodynamics, and once we have that TAS, we&#39;ve got what we need including the ability to caculate the CAS, which is what the limits are measure in.</p>

<p>GROUNDSPEED CALC (it was measured in knots, at 510 knots by the NTSB Radar Data Impact Speed Study).</p>

<p>I may have to get back to you on what VMO of 360KCAS and VD of 420 KCAS precisely works out to in groundspeed at 1000 ft alt, but near sea level it&#39;s almost the same where TAS, CAS and EAS are equal at sea level, so... let&#39;s see....</p>

<p>.. if 510 knot groundspeed = 515 TAS which equates to a CAS of 508, working backwards, we could just as easily say that 360 CAS = approx 358 kts GS (groundspeed) and 420 kts CAS = approx 418 kts GS (at 1000 ft alt that is). The outer OUTERmost flight envelop limit adds 15-20%, so 1.2(418) = 501.6 kts GS or 8.4 kts / 9.6 mph LESS than the S Tower Plane&#39;s speed on final approach to impact (510 knots). This is however the point beyond which breakup and disintegration occurs, within a few seconds or something like that or somewhere between 1-10 seconds (read that somewhere for the &quot;absolute load limit).</p>

<p>The ultimate margin of engineered safety beyond which a phenomenon called flutter (and breakup) is inevitable, is 15-20% MAX past Vd/Md with a Mach 1.0 absoute limit at all altitudes respecting the lowest EAS (equivalent airspeed) or CAS through descent from 17,854 ft. Flutter onset can begin at Vmo + 40 knots (it&#39;s 31 for the Airbus a380 and I&#39;ve extrapolated a bit to round up to 40 based on other comparisons with the Boeing, a slightly faster and more maneuverable aircraft) or 360 + 40 (400 kts) where beyond that, flutter and disintegration can begin at any time, and it absolutely assured 100% including disintegration, at no more than 504 knots KCAS Max MAX (20% over Vd). </p>

<p>Again THE plane, at a TAS of 515 kts was flying at a CAS of 508 kts so in theory however totally improbable (to the nth degree) it&#39;s perhaps not ENTIRELY absolutely &quot;impossible&quot;, athough I&#39;m not an aeronautical engineer like Dwain Deets or even a pilot, but from what I&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s way WAYYYY out there in terms of a probability. So there&#39;s a problem and the government has some &#39;splaining to do..</p>

<p>This says nothing about stable flight control, or piloting, once Vmo/Mmo (360 KCAS) is exceeded by any appreciable degree/margin.</p>

<p>If you take the time to go through what&#39;s been presented there, you&#39;ll be fully up to speed (so to speak). </p>

<hr/>

<p>Have you noticed that oftentimes when the evidence for CD is presented that people exclaim - &quot;But what about the planes?! we all SAW the plane hit the building, what do you mean that the plane impacts weren&#39;t at cause?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a big time problem with the CD hypothesis, this notion that it relied upon successful hijackings and piloting to target(s), especially when the limitations involved (in the case of the south tower plane) would make that a one in a million (+++) event. </p>

<p>Proof of CD of the buildings is therefore complimentary to the evidence regarding the excessive speed of the south tower plane, not only in terms of the flight envelope limit being exceeded to the point of inevitable disintegration, but also in terms of stable flight control at such a speed, and piloting by a complete novice at such a speed including the successful navigation to target and final target aquisitioning. It&#39;s not believable, particularly in light of the evidence for CD of the twin towers moving backwards through the apparent cause and effect ie: there could be no room for an unknown, indeterminate outcome regarding hijackings when the south tower is awaiting a hit, lower down, to make the official story seem plausible/credible. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no escaping or evading this self evident truth.</p>

<p>This is very important, so I do hope you&#39;ll take the time to review what I&#39;ve presented. </p>

<p>Otherwise, there&#39;s a big time incongruity at the heart of your (our) &quot;theory&quot; that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and you of all people serving as some sort of gatekeeper around the evidence regarding the south tower plane (that it was UA flight 175 succesfully piloted by a novice at such a speed) just isn&#39;t helpful to our cause, and would be absurd, imho. Don&#39;t be swayed by people like John Bursill or Jon Gold or the 911blogger people in spite of how supportive they&#39;ve been in other areas. The rage and &quot;debate&quot; was all about the use of this data by the &quot;no planer&quot; people, to suggest, absurdly, that if it wasn&#39;t possible for a commercial airliner to perform in such a way, or be successfully piloted at such speed, that there was ah, ah hem, cough, no plane there at all to begin with! (ABSURD!)</p>

<p>As to John Lear - there&#39;s no way he&#39;s REALLY a no planer. He saw the <a href="http://arabesque911.blogspot.ca/2007/07/pentagon-honey-pot.html">&quot;honey pot&quot;</a> and jumped right in to feed it as best he could (while trying to &quot;hide&quot; this data and evidence or render it as incredible and subject it to ridicule with the no planer bullshit by trying to make the plane &quot;disappear&quot;!) presumably to win brownie points with the deep state bastards.. No other conclusion can be drawn, same with that Brit ex MI5 guy, same with Morgan Reynolds, Judy Wood and Jim Fetzer although the honey pot has a certain pull on certain personality types who are unwittingly pulled into serving the wrong side by producing bad hypothesis capable of discrediting valid scientific data and observations. Fetzer did the same thing with the Zapruder film (which basically proved that Kennedy got his head blown off by a shot from the front ie: back, and to the left) during the JFK days, to raise reasonable doubt and to bring it into disrepute while gaining notoriety and attention for himself.</p>

<p>This data doesn&#39;t validate those folks however because there really was a real plane that hit the building, and, that penetrated the exterior steel columned framework, decellerated in a fraction of a second (hit the core structure) and detonated for that mega pyrotechnic shock-and-awe display - to lend a &quot;credible&quot; &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; as to the cause of the destruction of the towers, in the case of the south tower, with a complimentary TIP/tilt over the impact area before recovering it&#39;s momentum in the implosion (you know the drill). </p>

<h2>According to Lizeau of Controlled Demolition, such a feat is totally within the realm of CD.</h2>

<p>Mark Loizeaux, the head of Controlled Demolition, Inc., has said:</p>

<p>&quot;By differentially controlling the velocity of failure in different parts of the structure, you can make it walk, you can make it spin, you can make it dance . . . . We&#39;ll have structures start facing north and end up going to the north-west.&quot; (Else, 2004)</p>

<hr/>

<p>We are now at the point where this question (what about the planes?!) is being raised time and again to make us all appear crazy. </p>

<p>&quot;What about the planes - uh.. maybe they were at cause?!&quot; I hear it all the time, it&#39;s Bill Meher&#39;s favorite joke re: &quot;9/11 truthers&quot;. James Randi of JREF says the same thing. We need to throw it back in their faces.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you see the dilemma, and hopefully, it&#39;s resolution, based in nothing but physics and science along with a healthy dose of common sense with the self evident proof of CD in hand. What it does not do, in the least, is discredit the evidence of CD, but only supports it and validates it as essential to the murderous hoax of 9/11. Except to the degree that the hypothesis leaves part of the narrative unresolved (what happened to the original planes and passengers?) which is where I suppose that the cell phone record comes into play, to show that at least some of the passengers were not in the sky at all at the time they placed those calls. I presume you&#39;ve seen &quot;September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor&quot;..?</p>

<p>That said, I can understand your reluctance because of the nature of the honeypots embedded into the operation itself, like a mind trap leading either one way, to the official story narrative, or the other, into the domain of the dreaded and discredited &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; (a term much maligned during the JFK days, and apparently made use of, even relied heavily on for the 9/11 operation), but this evidence, including CD isn&#39;t ultimately going anywhere unless and until the linkage to the plane impacts is made, and you&#39;re right that it needs to get simplified as much as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>P.S. I&#39;ve used the 20% margin beyond Vd as the outer OUTERmost flight envelop limit instead of 15% as per the FAA FAR ref&#39;d in the OP of that thread because the older FAR (Federal Aviation Regulation), from when the plane was engineered and certified listed it as being 20%</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c380651443808e32aa15c684c954c990&amp;amp;node=se14.1.25_1303&amp;amp;rgn=div8">http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c380651443808e32aa15c684c954c990&amp;amp;node=se14.1.25_1303&amp;amp;rgn=div8</a></p>

<p>Although the plane circa 1983 had surely taken a beating over the years. </p>

<p>Bear in mind however, that the onset of flutter, and structural damage leading to eventual disintegration can begin at somewhere around 35 knots over the Vmo limit of 360 knots (KCAS) or 395 kts (lets round it up to 400 to be conservative), whereby this aircraft was travelling at 508 kts CAS or 148 kts past Vmo and 88 kts past the Vd design dive limit of 420 KCAS.</p>

<p>Hopefully, all that was helpful, and can provide some clarity regarding what we&#39;re really looking at here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah, yes technically the granite is no longer molten and has solidified and cooled to such a degree that workers can work, setting up ladders, running fire hoses around, hosing down hot spots, pumping out water, etc which makes you wonder why that work is even necessary in the first place.</p>

<p><a href="http://oi55.tinypic.com/2j1k8wi.jpg">http://oi55.tinypic.com/2j1k8wi.jpg</a></p>

<p>my next questions, </p>

<p>1) was this previously molten granite supposed to be the bedrock onto which the WTC buildings footings were put? 
that looks like a very irregular surface from which to begin construction, especially on such a massive structure as the WTC! where is all the earth and/or building materials that once covered this previously molten granite? </p>

<p>2) given that you are an architect/engineer, how would you begin construction preparation given such an irregular surface as a your base? </p>

<p>3) why can&#39;t we see any evidence of whatever original WTC construction preparation work was done, either evidence of the removal of some of the previously molten granite or the filling-in with aggregate materials? the surface of the previously molten granite in the foreground of the picture doesn&#39;t look like it has ever been worked by human hands. </p>

<p>4) where would the building pilings/columns/footings be placed? </p>

<p>5) what is left of the original pilings/columns/footings?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>fake <a href="/u/Richard_Gage">/u/Richard_Gage</a> replied with this </p>

<p>(These are interesting questions; Please excuse my brief responses but the following are necessary for you to understand before we can get to more complex subjects such as tall building foundations)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>technically the granite</p>
</blockquote>

<p>not &#39;technically&#39; ..actually.
not &#39;granite&#39;...Mica</p>

<blockquote>
<p>running fire hoses around, hosing down hot spots,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe I can see worker using one hose. I could not determine if it was actually a fire hose.
Nothing in this photograph would cause me to think anything shown is a &#39;hot spot&#39; (whatever it is you mean by that).</p>

<p>if you happen to be in Manhattan any time go to Central park and enjoy the same Mica bedrock that actually breaks the surface over large areas. It looks exactly the type you have in your picture. There are such protrusions all over Manhattan island.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>solidified and cooled to such a degree that workers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its metamorphic rock. It solidified and cooled 100million years ago. I think you may be unique, globally, in concluding that those workers are 100million years old.</p>

<p>1) if by &#39;previously&#39; you mean 100million years ago, then yes. In fact...almost the whole of Manhattan is built on it. Much of central Manhattan is located where it is in order to take advantage of the near-surface Mica bedrock that is necessary part of a stable foundation.</p>

<p>2) By preparing a foundation. Part of doing so requires digging down to and exposing the Mica bedrock, preparing it for the concrete. Then possibly using caissons to pour the foundation and steel rods to anchor it. (Knowing about foundation building will not inform your argument for the use of nuclear weapons on 9/11. For that you should get some evidence).</p>

<p>3) You would have to ask the photographer. (you could also ask them exactly what the workers were doing at the same time</p>

<p>4) &amp; 5) could not be adequately answered without knowing exactly what location and when the photo was taken, and which building was there before and what is next planned to be built there.
However: I see no value in explaining the finer points/considerations of tall building foundation design, even if those points were given.
It has no bearing on whether/not a nuclear weapon was used on 9/11.</p>

<p>AE911Truth is working hard to obtain present and inform about the strongest, irrefutable evidence about what really happened to 3 steel framed buildings on 9/11.</p>

<p>So far nuclear weapons has no evidence.</p>

<p>and again...Its 100million year old Mica. Not granite.</p>

<p>9/11: NIST engineer John Gross denies WTC molten steel </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SLIzSCt_cg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SLIzSCt_cg</a> </p>

<p><strong>so on the one hand</strong>, there is no debate between us on the fact that there was <em>molten metal</em> at WTC &quot;ground zero&quot;, (and given the evidence, fwiw)</p>

<p><a href="http://s662.photobucket.com/user/911conspiracytv/media/meteorites_side-by-side.jpg.html">http://s662.photobucket.com/user/911conspiracytv/media/meteorites_side-by-side.jpg.html</a> </p>

<p>the debate is about whether the metal was iron or aluminum, and the alternative methods for making the metal molten. the debate is <em>not</em> about the question of whether the metal was recently molten or not.</p>

<p><strong>but on the other hand</strong> you insist that there was no recently molten mica at the WTC site, in spite of the evidence? </p>

<p>i question your claim that the mica was molten 100 million years ago, as opposed to being molten on 9/11/2001, because </p>

<p>6) why would it be any more or less plausible that there was molten mica in the exact time and place where we know there was molten metal?</p>

<p>7) the <em>surface</em> of the once-molten mica in the foreground doesn&#39;t look like it has <em>ever</em> been worked by man or machine. how would that be possible if the mica was molten 100 million years ago, yet defaced by construction of the WTC complex?</p>

<p>8) can thermate / thermite / nanothermite etc alone explain making molten metal, molten mica, and turning concrete to dust? or explain high temperatures and heat for many weeks after 9/11/2001?</p>

<p>9) why would thermate, etc be necessary at all, other than to initiate the collapse, given that we know top-down progressive collapse is a tried and true method of controlled demolition, and likely would be the method of choice if the WTC complex had been brought down in an <em>overt</em> controlled demolition?  </p>

<p>10) theoretically, could an underground nuclear explosion make mica molten?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>fake <a href="/u/Richard_Gage">/u/Richard_Gage</a> replied with this</p>

<p>you seem to be of the impression that your picture shows exactly where the foundation of a building once stood.
I do not think that can be the case.</p>

<p>As I stated in a previous comment...the world trade center is built upon exactly the kind of mica bedrock visible in your picture.
Indeed: every tall building in Manhattan is founded on the same bedrock. This is why tall buildings in central Manhattan tend to be clustered together: they are all taking advantage of the &#39;patch/region&#39; of mica bedrock which is relatively near the surface there.</p>

<p>I expect your particular picture is not showing an area of ground occupied/previously occupied by any of the 3 world trade center towers.
In fact..i expect no tall building has ever been located in that spot.
(i am actually inclined to suggest that your picture really looks like preparatory work for a new foundation to be built).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the surface of the once molten mica looks as un-touched the day it was formed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>well yes, absolutely correct..it would do, since (most likely) nothing has been built on that particular section before.
The protrusions in Central park also look that way.</p>

<p>Your position is interesting, but as your position is so heavily dependent on that picture being:
-the site of the world trade center, probably one of the towers or other wtc vicinity buildings</p>

<p>-and taken on or after 9/11</p>

<p>...I expect you should be able to clearly easily demonstrate those to be true.
If you cannot...your position is without foundation (no pun intended).</p>

<p>I look forward to your proofs for both, then we can take discussion further.</p>

<p>Note: I am sure you will understand that I am trying to respond to many people and therefore won&#39;t be able to engage unless you can provide the necessary proofs.</p>

<p>(I am sure it will be easy for you to get them though, and then i hope we can continue).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  I&#39;m not implying the roof of the building is made entirely of tar paper or that tar paper would resist tons of falling debris.  Just that if falling debris causes the collapse of the interior of the building without causing the walls to fall...like what happened to building 6... portions of the waterproofing (tar paper) probably won&#39;t fall in due to it&#39;s light weight.  It will be unsupported from below however, thus causing the curved appearance of the hole.  I&#39;m not looking at a pic of building 6...  I&#39;ve just done roofing in the past lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume the general shape of the hole is a result of the shape of the thing that fell on it.  However, if you look closely at the edges of the hole (on the roof level) the reason why it appears curved (rounded) and not jagged is probably hanging roof insulation.  The inside looks plenty jagged.  I think we&#39;re getting hung up on what &quot;curved&quot; means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Richard. I would like to hear your response to this question posed by  <a href="/u/sacchetta">/u/sacchetta</a>:</p>

<p>5.) <strong>Thermite. Thermite, thermate, nano thermite, super-thermite and thermitic material</strong>; why does it keep changing? As I understand it is essentially iron oxide and aluminum, if the towers were turned to dust as we see in the videos and pictures, should we not expect there to be iron and aluminum dust in the debris since the towers were made out of iron and had aluminum cladding? It is claimed that there were non-ignited thermite chips found in the dust. If the heat was so intense then how didn’t it set off the thermite chips? Also shouldn’t there have been lots of bright flashes everywhere? Not just a glowing red substance pouring out of places, but a blinding light as seen in YouTube videos about thermite? How was it that the thermite was able to act so quickly, accurately and on time? From all the videos I’ve seen it appears to be rather slow and nowhere near the speed needed to bring anything down in sequence. Why was thermite not mentioned in Stephen E. Jones &amp; Bob McIlvaine’s <a href="http://www.ocio.os.doc.gov/s/groups/public/@doc/@os/@ocio/@oitpp/documents/content/prod01_003034.pdf">RFC</a>? The word thermite is in a link within the document but that was added later, why would Jones not mention or discuss thermite within his RFC?</p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>No laser light spot / laser targeting, not visible anyway, so it&#39;s a non issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Find the video, and then keep looking for other version of the same one to find the longer version. Not targeting laser - floating paper. Trust me on this, but verify it if you must.</p>

<p>The real elephant in the room, aside from the self evident proof of the CD of the twin towers, is the excessive SPEED of the south tower plane. </p>

<p>No need to focus on the &quot;pod&quot; or the laser light spot, there is proof it wasn&#39;t UA 175.</p>

<p>Yet, it IS an explosive demolition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said it wasn&#39;t. My &#39;error&#39; was that you CHOSE to misunderstand me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you will assert that this misunderstanding was my fault as a bad author (or woman, or Mexican) and not your fault as a person jumping to conclusions.</p>

<p>Nukes in the BASEMENTS is what I was talking about. I&#39;m sure the overall demolitions were achieved with several, or many, different kinds of explosives. There are pictures of diagonal cut offs that show that cutter charges were used which is exactly what we would expect to see in a professionally demolished building. Plus the thermite in the dust and the sounds of the explosions. I have been saying this for years. You misrepresented what I was asserting. </p>

<p>Did you see the video of the core column &quot;dustifying&quot; after most of the rest of that building came down? I believe THAT was the effect of a nuke. I was not talking about the explosions in your video; and I never said it was. </p>

<p>I really resent you for asserting that I hold a position that I do not hold and then publicly attacking me for it in a little &#39;group action&#39; with your man buddies. As a woman I really resent that sort of behavior, it is dangerous and even life threatening. In my own case it triggers my PTSD, so it is not a bit funny. It is harassment. </p>

<p>You could have at any time asked me to clarify what I was saying, but instead you chose to misunderstand me and then viciously and repeatedly attack me personally.</p>

<p>I really resent being treated like that and I think you owe me a personal and PUBLIC apology. In fact, I think you should have me put back on the 911truth reddit - since you got me banned off of it with your little repeated attacks.</p>

<p>Are you a person who takes responsibility for what you do, or are you a person who mistreats strangers for no good reason and then moves on? </p>

<p>I&#39;m a Girl Scout leader, how do you want to treat me? Because I WILL tell everybody about it, and we WILL have a permanent record of it. </p>

<p>BTW, the whole world is watching. I said eleven years ago that I had a plan to END WAR GLOBALLY based on the first amendment freedom of religion and the rule of law. It is a political action project that I call the walk of Jesus. You have heard of things I have been doing. Believe me, I know how to get attention. I also know how to lead big groups, one of the many skills I learned and put to use in Girl Scouts.</p>

<p>You owe me an apology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve given this a LOT of thought over the years, and I&#39;m just not at all satisfied with Richard&#39;s response, to be perfectly honest.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make any sense not to be making a push in this direction. </p>

<p>It could BEGIN with the papers published over at the Journal of 9/11 Studies. </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking something that would look like a report by a reputable, multidisciplined, architectual and engineering consulting company with expertise in building forensics and of course, structual engineering. </p>

<p>Then, out of the single, larger report, spin off some papers for review and publication.. </p>

<p>Man would that ever get the ball rolling far and wide in a hurry - plus, it would invite replies in the form of attempted debunks of the singular, authoritative NIST debunk by A&amp;E49/11T, which, from what I&#39;ve come to understand, would simply not be possible or hold up under scientific scrutiny and analysis because they would have to violate the laws of physics to do so. </p>

<p>Everyone would be all over it.</p>

<p>It would bring the debate to a whole new level, while lending credibility to our movement and the work of A&amp;E49/11T.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody said the report went through the peer review process; it was never intended to do so. However the scientific community have independently replicated NISTs results. You don&#39;t need the exact input data to check if its results are accurate, and most if not all papers pass peer review without the reviewers explicitly running through every calculation made in the experiment. Thats actual science, not the high school ideal that you&#39;ve been taught. Do you expect the people who peer reviewed CERN&#39;s higgs experiment to pour over trillions of bits of data they accumulated? or recheck any experiment performed on the new 20 Petaflop supercomputer built at ORNL? no, they focus on replicable results, which means they generally make sure the experiment followed a clear and accurate methodology.</p>
