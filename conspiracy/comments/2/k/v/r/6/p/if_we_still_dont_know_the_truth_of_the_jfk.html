<p>When Kennedy was killed, we has radio, TV, and news papers. There&#39;s 1 grainy video in existence.</p>

<p>For 911, there are videos from multiple angles (some decent quality), pictures, and interviews from the event itself and just moments after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like I&#39;m spamming reposts, but I addressed this issue yesterday about how we will never really know the truth about these things here:  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kso5h/never_forget_after_a_packedfull_chinook_with_no/closi48?context=3">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kso5h/never_forget_after_a_packedfull_chinook_with_no/closi48?context=3</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The truth is that you don&#39;t know and you will never know. The problem is that because of the way the CIA operates, they confuse every issue with lies. They justify this under the name of &quot;national security&quot;, but the effect is that we are now a nation full of people that are being lied and propagandized to constantly.</p>

<p>So when we have an &quot;election&quot;, how valid are the results? We don&#39;t ever hear any discussion about foreign policy. We don&#39;t get to vote on whether or not the CIA overthrows governments for their friends in the oil industry. We are not informed about any of this. If we try to base our &quot;vote&quot; on what we are told by our government, then we are operating from a completely faulty set of facts.</p>

<p>I think there is a reason why I think of this quote:</p>

<p>&quot;We’ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.&quot; – William Casey, CIA Director 1981</p>

<p>We are not in control. If our own government is working against the citizens to intentionally keep them misinformed about world events, then can we really say that we have a democracy when the voters are creating opinions based on complete lies?</p>

<p>Make no mistake about it... all of the major networks are here to confuse and divide the public and propagandize in order to drive public opinion. So when you hear the name &quot;national security&quot; come up, remember that excuse was created in order to &quot;legally&quot; justify every single immoral and evil act that those individuals who hide behind government do.</p>

<p>The useful information to us is what the <em>tiny</em> details reveal about the world we live in:  What didn&#39;t happen on those days, but what we can see was prepared to happen:  the Pentagon was prepared for WW3 on those days in case things didn&#39;t go as planned.  Certain people were safekept, others were not.  Certain information made it into the press, then was quickly forgotten.  Certain patterns can be discerned.  Certain parameters can be discerned.</p>

<p>Imagine we&#39;re all blind, living in a silent world in the dark.  Suddenly there&#39;s an audible event.

    <div class="md"><p>911 will be exactly the same as the JFK assassination. A lot of people still believe that a single bullet hit JFK in the back, bounced around, and then hit him in the head. It&#39;s ridiculous but imagine how many conspiracy theories existed back before electronics when someone would die or get murdered and you&#39;d just have to take someone&#39;s word for it without <em>any</em> evidence whatsoever, it&#39;s the way things have always been.</p>

<p>So instead of trying to convince old people to change what they think, make sure the young generation coming up is exposed to these ideas as early as possible, before indoctrination has ossified the mind. It&#39;s possible that in 100 years, people look back and say, &quot;Can you believe people thought that 19 poor muslims were able to pull off 911? They were so brainwashed.&quot; </p>

<p>As Socrates said, &quot;The key to change is not to tear down the old, it&#39;s to focus completely on building the new&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, with all the new technology we have had at our disposal when 9/11 happened why has 9/11 truth not managed to get to the next level of investigation? Why is 9/11 still relegated to the fringe as JFK Assassination truth still is? </p>

<p>If the truth is not acknowledged as the truth, and if people who want to tell the truth are referred to in the most Orwellian terms (such as being  &quot;A Truther&quot;) then, even after 13 years, 9/11 still has not managed to become nothing more than a different aspect of the same Conspiracy industry, what hope is there? </p>

<p>Will the next 13 years of 9/11 truth change anything?</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s easily argued things have become much worse since the PATRIOT Act. (The real &quot;Act&quot; of terrorism and the real endgame)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im new to this subreddit but strongly believe that most of the &quot;Attacks&quot; and &quot;Terror attacks&quot; against the US is self inflicted and a ploy for something.</p>

<p>With that being said, if we find out the truth about the JFK assassination will that change anything?</p>

<p>Same question for 9/11. Even if the truth is released don&#39;t you think there is a plan to keep americans locked up so they are unable to do anything against the state?(Like deploy military/secret service so that the people cannot get an upper hand on the gov&#39;t)</p>

<p>Do you think that other countries or groups like the UN will go against USA?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simple answer is that every conspiracy has different perpetrators, and a different achilles heel. It&#39;s up to people like us to keep chipping away at the facade until a breakthrough is made.</p>

<p>Let me tell you a stark truth. What actually went down on 9/11 will probably never be known (in its entirety). This doesn&#39;t actually matter - what matters is that a tipping-point majority understands that the government has been peddling a pack of lies. At that point, we have a chance of building a better future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only will you not know the truth, but the people that you consider to be responsible will never be brought to any kind of justice. Even if the majority of the American people come to believe that 9/11 was an inside job, there will never be sufficient evidence to convict anyone of anything in a court of law. Assuming that someone other than muslim extremists were behind the crime, those responsible have had ample time to destroy evidence and silence witnesses. No amount of &quot;truth&quot; will change that.</p>

<p>It must be difficult to be a conspiracy theorist. You&#39;ll probably never know the truth about so many things, and by the time you do it&#39;ll be too late to get any justice. </p>
