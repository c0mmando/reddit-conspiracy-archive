        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0-B2J7tp8eg">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0-B2J7tp8eg</a></p>

<p>There is a lot of hay being made about 28 pages in the 9/11 Commission report being declassified. This is a known red herring. The 28 pages refer to the connection between the Saudi Arabian government and the supposed hijackers. This has been known forever, unofficially, and now rogue former CIA agent Michael Scheuer (I think it’s him) has already said that this is “insurance” in case they need to put pressure on the Saudis.</p>

<p>But consider this: Saudi Arabia is America’s number one ally in the Middle East. The Bush family was unusually close to Saudi Arabia, and one of the Saudi Royal is nicknamed “Bandar Bush” because of his close ties to the Bushes.</p>

<p>Why would Saudi Arabia want to hurt their relationship with the World’s Only Superpower? Why would the Saudi ruling class want to hurt their number one American partners, the Bush family?</p>

<p>Now, who <em>would</em> want to harm the relationship between America and Saudi Arabia? Let’s see, which former President was considered an “Arabist” and hostile to Israel? That’s right, George H. W. Bush. Look at how he lost his re-election – a three way race and for the first time a third party candidate given massive media coverage and even included in the debates.</p>

<p>So when Bush Jr. gets into office, Dick Cheney is put in charge of picking VP. He picks himself, then picks a bunch of neo-cons dual citizen Israeli Jews.</p>

<p>Now, look at who was in charge in NYC on 9/11. Who was Giuliani’s right hand man, in fact, whispering in his ear the whole time? Police Chief Bernard Kerik.</p>

<p>Who was entertaining the 19 hijackers on his casino boats in Florida? Jack Abramoff.</p>

<p>Notice that both of these men wound up doing time in prison on various corruption charges.</p>

<p>Now, remember the “Office of Special Plans?” It was a special group set up in the CIA that faked intelligence about Iraqi WMDs. The CIA at the time was leaking heavily that there were no actual WMDs. Remember Valerie Plame, the CIA agent that had her identity outed by the neo-cons? The neo-cons had a war against the CIA, and the neo-cons had the media on their side.</p>

<p>In many ways, it appears the Bush family and a faction of the Republican party fought a hard internal battle against the neo-cons, but lost.</p>

<p>Now, all this fuss is being made about the 28 pages – but it’s just a big fat red herring, yet another way to drive a wedge between the US and Saudi Arabia. Who benefits from dividing the US from its number one ally in the Middle East?</p>

<p>Why, the other number one ally in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is the capital of Islam, while Israel is the capital of Judaism. Two perfectly opposed nations.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>In many ways, the cover up is more interesting than the crime. About 2004, rumors of Israel’s involvement and foreknowledge had gotten so widespread that a Jew had to make an anti-9/11 Truth movie, “Elders of Zion” which is where we get a number of clips – the Mossad agents interviewed on Israeli TV for one.</p>

<p>It’s a complicated story, but it is not that complicated. 13 years later, the 9/11 myth is one of Israel’s strongest pieces of propaganda to keep America on its side. People look the other way at AIPAC openly bribing the entire Congress and the media totally owned by Israel sympathizers because so many American still believe the myth of “radical Islamic terror.”</p>

<p>But since the 1980s, when the US armed and funded the Mujahadeen, the radical Islamic terrorists have always been on our side. Hell, in 2001, right after 9/11, at Tora Bora, the Bush administration told the military to stand down and allow an airlift out of Afghanistan, into Pakistan, of supposedly Osama Bin Laden himself and his major Al Qaeda fighters. They actually showed clips of the airlift on American TV and openly speculated some sort of deal had been made. John Kerry actually brought up Tora Bora in the 2004 Presidential debates.</p>

<p>No one remembers anything.</p>

<p>Now, if you watch this damage control video, you will see they interview black and brown street people who repeat exaggerated rumors. This was meant, of course, to associate fringe characters with the 9/11 truth movement and preemptively make anyone talking about Israeli involvement look like a kook. It also associated 9/11 Truth with various things like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, neo-Nazis, and Holocaust revisionism.</p>

<p>I remember at the time thinking – why is it that Jews were the most anti-9/11 truth? I didn’t think there was any particular role that Israel had in the 9/11 plot. At first, I assumed it was Bush and the CIA, something similar to the JFK assassination, something to do with Iran-Contra. I figured it was just Israel taking advantage of 9/11. But the more I looked, at the more time went on, the more obvious it was that Israel – and their Jewish Zionist assets in America – were the prime culprits.</p>

<p>Of course, lots of Jewish people died in 9/11, and not all Jews were warned. I know of a half dozen Jews that I worked with that ran out of the building with their hair on fire (figuratively.)</p>

<p>But an astonishing number of people – Jews and non-Jews – were in fact warned. The Odigo scandal is one that was openly discussed in the media at the time. The “Dancing Israelis” were another.</p>

<p>Now, just watch the two films. One, a piece of damage control that throws in all sorts of irrelevant and nonsensical bits of information. It was lavishly praised in the mainstream media. The other, a relatively well done film including all sorts of facts downplayed or ignored by the media. If it wasn’t for the internet, you would have almost certainly never even heard of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eev1uIiI9pI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eev1uIiI9pI</a></p>

<p>“There are certainly real questions that remain, but there are also real dangers into jumping to conclusions.”</p>

<p>And with that little piece of rhetoric, the makers of the film dismiss the fact that Israeli citizens were filming the destruction of the towers and seemingly had prior knowledge. Don’t jump to conclusions – about Jews that is. Now, jumping to conclusions about Muslim Arabs – hey, that’s exactly what the Jewish media did after 9/11.</p>

<p>Then there were the Naudet Brothers, that just happened to be filming a documentary about FDNY and just got lucky – they were set up in the ONE place in Manhattan that had the perfect view of the first plane hitting. The Naudet Brothers show up just in time to make this film – perhaps the greatest 9/11 Propaganda film ever – then just disappeared.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GD_vwzjdTi4">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GD_vwzjdTi4</a></p>

<p>Israel did 9/11. Not Saudi Arabia, and certainly whoever the supposed 19 hijackers were – some of them still alive after 9/11 remember – another forgotten piece of information heavily covered in the press at the time – they certainly had no part in rigging the towers and building 7 for demolition.</p>

<p>Who owned the buildings? Who had access to the buildings? A bunch of dual citizen Israeli Zionists.</p>

<p>It’s ain’t rocket science folks. It just takes a little bit of courage to see things for how they are, now how you might wish they were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One other thing that ties into what you are saying are the images they put on TV, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, of  &quot;<em>The Dancing Palestinians</em>&quot;, purportedly these clips of Palestinians dancing in the streets and in the shops because the 9/11 attacks were successful.</p>

<p>Only Israeli Zionists benefit from that kind of mind-shaping propaganda. Even now, 13 years later it is one of the things I remember the MSM broadcasting on EVERY news channel, writing about in every paper, and putting up on every MSM website immediately after the attacks.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post! Let me reply on a point by point basis.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>28 pages business as red herring, I totally agree.</p></li>
<li><p>Saudia Arabia as US #1 Middle East ally. Disagree. I&#39;d have to say Israel as number 1.... but just barely.</p></li>
<li><p>The CIA at the time was leaking heavily that there were no actual WMDs....</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is really interesting because it fits in with a theory that I&#39;ve been forming for a while now. Basically I&#39;ve been wondering if there isn&#39;t some kind of deep (and very secret) split within the US government itself. This looks like the neo-cons, certain major defense contractors and maybe the NSA on one side, with the CIA and maybe elements of the military(and whoever else) forming another faction.</p>

<p>As for who is responsible for 9/11? I say, first things first. Let&#39;s firmly establish that the towers didn&#39;t come down the way the official story says they did. If, as we&#39;ve heard, there are traces of nano-thermite in the debris. Traces that can easily be detected and positively identified as being an explosive.... that would prove the official narrative as being a lie. </p>

<p>There&#39;s absolutely no plausible explanation for the presence of nano-thermite in any significant amount in the debris. The perfect, free-fall controlled demolition-style collapse of Tower 7 into it&#39;s own footprint should serve as additional evidence for anyone not convinced by the thermite.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t first prove that the Towers were taken down by other means (esp. Tower 7) there&#39;s little point in making accusations against whoever else.</p>

<p>In plain English, you blame &quot;A bunch of dual citizen Israeli Zionists&quot;  and all they have to do is laugh and call you crazy. If you have first proven the presence of explosives in the Towers, they&#39;ll have to take any accusation much more seriously.</p>

<p>Sure yeah we went over there and threw our weight around. They probably felt very safe. But all we did was foment another generation of terrorists, destabilize a country that was relatively calm, and leave the place much more dangerous. </p>

<p>Anyone who studied history would have realized that chaos and danger in the region would only be exacerbated by our meddling.</p>
