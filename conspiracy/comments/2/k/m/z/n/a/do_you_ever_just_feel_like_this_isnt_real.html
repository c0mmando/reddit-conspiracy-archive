        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like the more I research, the deeper I go, that something has happened or change in the realms of reality. I see it from what I&#39;ve known, to what some people are saying to a total flip of reality. Shit that would be laughed at about years ago, is now coming to fruition and I shamefully  saying it, main stream. It&#39;s like something happen within the last, idk, year that totally flipped people&#39;s shit and/or reality. It doesn&#39;t make sense, I&#39;m scratching my head.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say some, because a lot of people are still oblivious. But, from people I know, who would never think about certain things, are actually thinking about them. I try to educate, never push, always do you&#39;re own research. But man, these people are coming out of the wood work, slow, but surely. </p>

<p>We aren&#39;t talking about fringe people, we are talking about average Joe&#39;s/ Jane&#39;s saying wtf. Has the veil been lifted? Is this do or die for the elite? I&#39;m peaceful and loving, just want to live my life, alone with my dog. I&#39;m sick of people, I love my family, try to help those in need. But, helping everyone else is exhausting. I just cant figure this shit out.</p>

<p>Everything in the MSM is so clearly bullshit, some are seeing it, others are yelling at the TV. I&#39;ve tuned out from that shit long ago, but it wasn&#39;t too long ago. I don&#39;t know what my real question is here, but there is a popular belief of a shift in reality. Is it possible? Could there have been a shift? I&#39;m on mobile, working my dead end job, I&#39;ll try to find the theory. But I&#39;d love to hear some thoughts. I know it may be loaded, or unorganized, but shit... This whole thing we call reality seems to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there is a shift going on. IMHO based on what I read. We are entering into an a golden age. History is circular and we are reaching and end of an age. I think this time we are being woken up by information that is being transferred to all humans from the past though our pineal gland. I watched a video on someone from the 80&#39;is who found out this was happening from information he discovered archaeological studies but I cant find it now.</p>

<p>The funny thing is 5 years ago I knew none of this and was not even interested in it. No all of a sudden im seriously interested in mysticism, metaphysics and Gnosticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My brain hurts these days from information/disinformation overload. This evening (USA) I realized I was watching a fake documentary on Animal planet while CNN is temporarily missing from my satellite service (dishnetwork), so I come to reddit and within a few minutes hear about another school shooting that didn&#39;t make the news where I live, a NASA missile launch exploding and a strange convoy of trucks and a closed down highway (trucks were leaving the same state the missile blew up in btw) and the official explanation of the truck convoy was that it was a fund raiser for the Special Olympics. Oh, and Neo from the Matrix&#39; passport expired on 9/11/2001. WTF indeed. Times like this I just want to hug my Mom, pet my dog and do something outdoors.</p>

<p>These are good things. Do them. Do them often and do them more than you used to. It&#39;s important to unplug and opt out as much as you see fit, while still keeping a pulse on local/national/global events to stay aware of the bullshit the rest of the people in this country are consuming (food, media, whatever).</p>

<p>I&#39;m slightly different than OP - where the deeper I go the more empowered I feel and the less I feel I need acceptance from my so-called friends and coworkers. It&#39;s just their feelings, man, and I don&#39;t really care.  I see this world going to shit and I&#39;m at least going to enjoy the time I have and try and leave it in a better place than I left it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read Bashar Blueprint for change which was written back in 1990. All you need to do is be the change you wish to see in this world. Don&#39;t try to wake people up,  let them gravitate towards you while only giving them breadcrumbs. You can&#39;t evangelize awakening, a lot of people even claim they are awake and then ask me who I would vote for, ZZZZzzzz still asleep. </p>

<p>Go inwards,  stay always in the present, be aware fully all the time and understand that you are eternal so you shouldn&#39;t have any real worries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve asked a few people who I know to be honest and trustworthy, with out bias to quickly tell me what they think about the &quot;berenstein&quot; bears. They spell it exactly as I have and pronounce it the same. They remember reading (some read it &quot;to&quot; me) as that. Hell, they even remember going to cedar point where they had their own exhibit, the Berenstein bear&#39;s tree house. Shit is freaky.</p>
