And most of all, which may be very advanced (research it last) research FREE WILL. Ask yourself why the people on TV aren&#39;t wearing hazmat suits when they &quot;visit&quot; ebola infected areas, ask yourself what the government has done in the past... If you take the vaccine, it&#39;s you ACCEPTING the vaccine under your OWN FREE WILL - this is CRUCIAL.</p>

<p>Spend an amount of time reasonable to the point where you feel you have the ability to make a free will decision. Don&#39;t spend <em>all</em> your time doing it or you&#39;ll start bugging out. (Protip: If you&#39;re posting pics of your hazmat suit to GLP, you&#39;re bugging out.) I have some colloidal silver and a cabin in the woods as my worst case scenario plan, I hear ZMAPP is the most reliable <em>treatment</em>.</p>

<p>Do all that you reasonably can but at the end of the day, don&#39;t sweat it, because it&#39;s god&#39;s will. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbWMEWubrk0">Reincarnation is real</a> and you will be getting back everything you gave out the next time around. If it ever does come down to it, be the guy who helps people around him not the one who cuts people&#39;s throats. Because it really does it matter and you really will be judged.</p>

Don&#39;t confuse God with being some white man with a beard - or <em>anything</em> exclusively human for that matter.</p>

<p>God is the word that humans (whether they know it or not) have for &quot;everything that is&quot;.  As such, God is both good <em>and</em> bad...and yet more (much more) still.</p>

<p>If you think &quot;God&quot; is what the Christian - or <em>any</em> - bible says, then you are correct in having trouble with the concept.  That version of God is but the tiniest fraction of what ultimately is, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So is God a masochist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course.  As I said, God is everything.  God is much (again, <em>much</em>) more than just &quot;a masochist&quot;, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it causing all this pain, and has caused unbelievable pain for hundreds maybe even thousands of years by having a system of control in place like the one on this planet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a great, great, very important question - the true and ultimate answer to which we tiny, impotent humans should not realistically hope to be able to even <em>begin</em> to answer.  All that being said, I posed a response <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7idtl6"><strong>here</strong></a> to this vert type of query when someone else asked the very thing.  In short, it can be said that we humans, with our infinitesimally limited perspective, can scarcely grasp the true and real reason for many of the things that happen.  We are similar to my four year old niece who I absolutely <em>loooove</em> to pieces, but who I (and her parents) often have to wage total war with - through fits and tears and tantrums and fighting - in order to just get her to eat her afternoon lunch.  More than once has it been that she literally pouts or screams out to either me or her mother or father &quot;I don&#39;t <em>like</em> you!!!&quot;</p>

<p>And all we&#39;re trying to do is make sure she gets something to eat and stays healthy because we love her so much.</p>

<p>Oftentime, it is WE adult, grown humans who are the spoiled, petulant four year old in comparison to that Energy that works toward helping us become more aware and understanding of our true Cosmic Identity.  Oftentime....the lessons are very, <em>very</em> difficult, and can be very painful.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like school.  Sometimes (not all the time, but sometimes) those individuals in your life that helped you grow and develop the most are those teachers (in school or otherwise) that <em>didn&#39;t</em> take it easy on you - that <em>gave</em> you the &quot;tough love&quot; and refused to allow you to have everything go &quot;your way&quot;.</p>

<p>Sometimes our greatest teachers are our fiercest enemies.</p>

<p>Shit is complicated, man - especially when you belong to a species as tiny, nascent, and ignorant as the Earth human species.  We have a <em>lot</em> to learn on our way toward true wisdom - and sometimes that learning is not very easy or very fun.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If god is everything that is, then it is destroying itself in an extremely painful way</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No It isn&#39;t.  Think you that God is limited to what is occurring on this tiny little microscopic planet we live on?  The whole of humanity on this planet is barely even more than a virus-sized spec in the body of God, and you&#39;re wondering whether That Great Being is itself &quot;evil&quot; or not because the tiny <del>human</del> virus living on the <del>planet</del> cell that&#39;s in God&#39;s body is experiencing some occasional difficulties?</p>

<p>Seriously?</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say God is &quot;destroying Itself&quot; - especially when God is beyond even the very concept of &quot;destruction&quot; in the first place.  How can something destroy itself - much less &quot;in an extremely painful way&quot; - when It exists beyond the concept of the words being used to convey the very idea?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>instead of just destroying itself it tortures itself with fear and deception before it eventually kills itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m reading and responding to your statement on a part by part basis.  As far as the response I have to <em>this</em> particular statement goes, I&#39;m hoping you can understand how limited the point of view you illustrate here is already.</p>

<p>You are anthropomorphizing - attributing human qualities to something that is indeed human, but that is also much, much more than merely human still.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless God (assuming your theory) has a plan to somehow overthrow the powers that be on this planet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God&#39;s &quot;plan&quot; already <em>is</em>.  In other words, there <em>is</em> no &quot;plan&quot; - not as far as humans understand the word or concept anyway.  There is no &quot;overthrowing&quot; to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I&#39;ve pretty much given up that hope after finding out who &quot;they&quot; are and how deep their control grid goes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good.  Then give up hope.  It&#39;s alright.  It doesn&#39;t really matter one way or the other.  Your job isn&#39;t to &quot;overthrow TPTB on this planet&quot; anyway.  Your job is to improve and get to know YOURSELF better/as best as possible.</p>

<p>It is understood and acknowledged that TPTB on this planet DO indeed make the task of getting to know oneself better quite a bit more difficult.  However, it is your task to do it and work on improving yourself <em>anyway</em>; to get to know yourself better <em>anyway</em>.  It is your task to work and focus and improve yourself...and in that way, you will develop and become a better, more powerful, wiser being than you were before/are presently.</p>

<p>And, for that matter, I&#39;m not sure this entire dynamic of causing you and all of us to improve through the constant struggle of having to live on this planet is not a purposeful act instigated by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">a greater power than us</a> that may very well actually be interested in <em>helping</em> us more than naught, believe it or not.</p>

<p>The first link is a comment that came from the second link.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I can certainly understand that.  There&#39;s certainly a lot of horrible shit going on in this world.  Definitely.</p>

<p>Gotta rise above it though.  MUUUUUCH easier said than done, of course, but still.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>also it doesn&#39;t explain how people sell their souls for fame and fortune</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t &quot;sell your soul&quot;.  That&#39;s a metaphorical statement.  It&#39;s not literal.  You don&#39;t &quot;sell your soul&quot;.  You only, at most, compromise your future development - and only temporarily, at that.  You&#39;re not &quot;damned forever&quot; for something (<em>anything</em> really) that you do in a mere 50-100 years of existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>obviously a good meaning entity would not buy someone&#39;s soul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And even if a bad-meaning entity <em>wanted</em> to &quot;buy someone&#39;s soul&quot;, they couldn&#39;t.  That&#39;s not how things work.  They don&#39;t have the power or ability to do that - at least not permanently.  They could temporarily enslave someone - yes - but one can free themselves from pretty much any chain upon arriving at a developed enough level of Self-realization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand, I&#39;m saying if we agree to take the vaccine we are accepting the virus with our free will. </p>

<p>Ebola was created by humans in a lab, obviously, or else it wouldn&#39;t be causing such a mass hysteria in media right now.</p>

<p>By getting the vaccine, which is a live virus being injected into your bloodstream, (which again is the ONLY way you can get it - Ebola is NOT airborne) you ACCEPT their method of exterminating you or controlling you.</p>

<p>Let me explain how free will works and why some people think free will is non existent to help you understand. People think free will does not exist because of torture, however, let me give you a scenario. A man steals something valuable from a king, he will be tortured and sent to death by that king. So is this torture against the man&#39;s free will? Not at all, in his mind he was thinking &quot;If I get caught, I&#39;m done for&quot;, so he accepts it will happen, allowing it to happen. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a really hard concept to fully explain because there are so many layers of deception in this world.</p>

<p>My theory with Ebola is an engineered pandemic sometime in 2015. Roughly 50% of the population will have access to the vaccine. It will be priced at the medium savings of a family eliminating those savings and those holding debt. This will be used as an excuse to reboot the economy. The new economy will be all digital and some say it will remove the &quot;central bankers&quot; from power freeing society. </p>

They could do it with flu shots right now if they wanted to - there are plenty of people who willingly take those every year. The Ebola vaccine, if it ever does become available on the open market, will unlikely be something middle-class Americans can afford. It won&#39;t be covered by insurance, and there will <em>coincidentally</em> be a &quot;shortage&quot; of doses available to drive that price even higher. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve researched this stuff since I turned 16 (24 now) most days 4-12 hours a day, especially when I was on breakthroughs like finding out something new about religions/cults/banksters/false flags/wars/etc. It&#39;s like I was destined to live in this time for a very specific reason because looking back I researched in a very specific order (not consciously, in other words seemingly random to me at the time) so that everything is as clear as possible through all the layers of deception in this world. If there is a theory on how the world works or who controls it, I&#39;ve likely researched it.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s absolutely better to refuse something like this out of your own free will and deal with any consequence that they threaten you with.  Ultimately free will is the law of the universe, if you accept the vaccine you accept the consequences that come along with it, if you refuse it you do not accept it.</p>

<p>Basically if you accept the vaccine you&#39;ll be accepting that they rule over you and you&#39;re allowing them to kill you with a virus that you fully know will kill you if injected into your blood stream.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s a hard concept to understand... but I hope you realize what I&#39;m trying to say here. </p>

<p>Basically - Do not give in to them, exercise your free will and don&#39;t &quot;allow&quot; them to do whatever they want to you, in this case, they will want to inject you with a live virus that is only transferable via blood, so they have to get you to ACCEPT the vaccine. </p>

<p>If they FORCE it on you, they are violating universal law and they&#39;ll have to deal with the consequences of that, which are much worse than any consequence here, after they are done here. If they throw you in a FEMA camp they will be violating your free will as well. </p>

<p>Now you&#39;ll say &quot;a lot of things happen to people against their will&quot; - this isn&#39;t necessarily true. I&#39;ve done a LOT of research into this topic because it is extremely complex, and the short answer to this is that it is VERY VERY easy to manipulate humans into accepting something, even torture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it&#39;s likely you&#39;ve accomplished nothing but adding to your paranoia and confirmation bias. Dwelling on these conspiracies will do nothing good for you, except probably allowing you to rationalize being a failure by blaming it on the government. </p>

<p>I do not live in paranoia, or anything close to it. I research in order to overcome any fear that this world throws at me, and it works.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response and I wish you good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can refuse to pay income tax, the problem is getting people to do it on a mass scale so that the entire monetary system is shut down. Of course that will never happen, people that live in these times cannot envision life without money, even though money is pretty much the main catalyst for all of human suffering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That second link is very interesting. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a little hard to believe knowing the amount of evil that is being done though, also it doesn&#39;t explain how people sell their souls for fame and fortune, obviously a good meaning entity would not buy someone&#39;s soul.</p>

<p>But still interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS. The government didn&#39;t need to invent Ebola if they wanted to kill people with vaccines. They could do it with flu shots right now if they wanted to - there are plenty of people who willingly take those every year. The Ebola vaccine, if it ever does become available on the open market, will unlikely be something middle-class Americans can afford. It won&#39;t be covered by insurance, and there will <em>coincidentally</em> be a &quot;shortage&quot; of doses available to drive that price even higher. </p>
