    <div class="md"><p>You can tell Washington is a fake news story because they broke into the Rush Limbaugh show today to bring a press conference where absolutely nothing interesting was said. You can always tell a news story is fake by how ridiculous the coverage is. Conversely, you can tell that the MSM is absolutely worthless for bringing you any real news and info, because they have yet to cover real stories like the LIBOR scandal and the CDCwhistleblower / CDCfraud. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that is splitting hairs a bit don&#39;t you think. When it comes down to it on cnn.com (a MSM website) you can watch a report about the CDC Whistleblower. No matter who did the reporting it is a report on the story available from a mainstream media website.</p>

<p>As for the snopes link, its actually a good read, but if you are trying to invalidate them by saying they are a husband and wife pair of amateurs, well then most conspiracy or alternate news sites also are run by &quot;regular&quot; people, so what are you saying about your sources of news and information?</p>

<p>But I digress, instead of throwing links at each other why don&#39;t I just show you what the actual &quot;whistleblower&quot; said? His name is Dr. Will Thompson and this is his statement concerning the issue:
&quot;I have had many discussions with Dr. Brian Hooker (this is the dude who recorded Dr. Thompson and released the video) over the last 10 months regarding studies the CDC has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes including autism spectrum disorders. I share his belief that CDC decision-making and analyses should be transparent. I was not, however, aware that he was recording any of our conversations, nor was I given any choice regarding whether my name would be made public or my voice would be put on the Internet.
Reasonable scientists can and do differ in their interpretation of information. I will do everything I can to assist any unbiased and objective scientists inside or outside the CDC to analyze data collected by the CDC or other public organizations for the purpose of understanding whether vaccines are associated with an increased risk of autism. There are still more questions than answers, and I appreciate that so many families are looking for answers from the scientific community ... My colleagues and supervisors at the CDC have been entirely professional since this matter became public. In fact, I received a performance-based award after this story came out. I have experienced no pressure or retaliation and certainly was not escorted from the building, as some have stated.&quot;</p>

<p>Cool, spoken like a true scientist. He is not claiming any correlation but he is saying the question remains and he intends to keep studying. Why? because the paper he published had one giant overlook that skewed the entire data set:
&quot;The study looked at different age groups: children vaccinated by 18 months, 24 months, and 36 months. The findings revealed that vaccination between 24 and 36 months was slightly more common among children with autism, and that association was strongest among children 3-5 years of age. The authors reported this finding was most likely a result of immunization requirements for preschool special education program attendance in children with autism.&quot;</p>

<p>Correlation does not equal causation.</p>

<p>Instead of wasting time and energy chasing these unicorns, why not spend that time and energy enriching your local community? Get into local politics, volunteer, steer the local in a more progressive direction from the ground up?</p>

<p>as for snopes, i used to be an evangelist and use them as a source frequently to debunk things, until they got caught being shills one too many times. nobody can be right 100% of the time, and snopes made some mistakes. now i don&#39;t trust them anymore, just like i don&#39;t trust CNN or FoxNews. </p>

<p>as for alternative sources, this is the product of the mainstream media tarnishing their own reputation to such a degree that nobody believes anything they say, merged with the the blogger community gaining credibility as a source, (which is why you are on this board instead of CNN board) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I feel you, you and I are a case of different strokes for different folks. I also hate the phrase correlation doesn&#39;t not equal Causation but in the case I used it actually was a case of correlation being interpreted as causation in a scientific paper haha. So give me a pass on that one. </p>

<p>CNN took the story down because it was bad reporting about a &quot;whistleblower&quot; who was really a doctor who didn&#39;t know the we&#39;re being recorded and a video that edited those recordings to seem like he was dropping a bombshell. It&#39;s sewer trash. The public outrage was the right kind of outrage, white suburban moms from the upper middle class. That&#39;s why it got out back up, not because they were trying to surpress information and got called out on it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you are stupid or an idiot or anything for believing what you believe I just think from our couple of brief debates on here that our fundamental difference is I see the world as a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off running around attempting to stroke their egos before they die and you see it as a more ordered structured plan with maybe some nefarious intent? To do what idk? Have money and power, sure I guess. But I mean play along with me for one second, what is the end game of suppressing a link of vaccines to autism? Who wins, what do they win and how are vaccines causing autism the means to that end for the person or persons who are behind it?</p>

<p>from what i can tell, most of the Autism community was not activist until their child got vaccine-damaged. if you listen to their stories on twitter, you get the sense that these are just ordinary parents with f*ed up kids who are angry, heartbroken, and want answers and reforms to prevent the same fate for another family. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>i think the reason for suppressing the links between vaccines and autism is to continue their vaccination programs as if nothing ever happened, and to side-step any responsibility for autism side-effect / damage. supposedly 1 in 68 kids is now on the autism spectrum, which is astronomical, and a huge liability. </p>

<p>if you observe the actions of the pro-vaccine crowd, you&#39;ll notice that they are very aggressive in pushing their own POV, while also very aggressive in shutting down any skeptics or critics. they are so aggressive (hard sell) that they bring attention upon themselves, like the creepy used car salesman is with a single lady</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think you are stupid or an idiot or anything for believing what you believe. </p>

<p>likewise. i think most people agree about most things, and it is only the things we disagree about are worth discussing. nobody ever had a heated debate over whether or not its a good idea to stop at a red light. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>nefarious intent? To do what idk? Have money and power, sure I guess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>how did africans wind up in north america? </p>

<p>the industrial scale of many conspiracies is so mind boggling that most people either can&#39;t or won&#39;t even contemplate it. the US money supply is a conspiracy to make us debt slaves through usury, so therefore the money in your pocket is part of that conspiracy. </p>

<p>since OP was about a school shooting, ill give a little background of how i got to where i am today...</p>

<p>on 9/11/2001, i was like a lot of people. minding my own business, keeping to myself, questioning various things like religion or history, but never questioned the news media (other than obvious tabloids like National Enquirer) </p>

<p>years later, i was introduced to the <em>Loose Change</em> 9/11 conspiracy documentary video. i spent the next several years researching and debating some of the claims made, and learning about many more questions and facts about 9/11.</p>

<p><a href="http://reddit.com/r/911truth/">http://reddit.com/r/911truth/</a></p>

<p>for whatever reasons, even though i was pretty well convinced that the 9/11 official story was a big lie, and that the rationale for war in Iraq was a big lie, i still trusted the government and media on current events (battered wife syndrome?)</p>

<p>so when Trayvon Martin got shot, i didn&#39;t question it</p>

<p>and when Gabby Giffords got shot, i didn&#39;t question it</p>

<p>and when the Aurora Theater batman shooting happened, i didn&#39;t question it</p>

<p>and when Christopher Dorner waged war on the LAPD, i didn&#39;t question it</p>

<p>and when Sandy Hook school shooting happened, i didn&#39;t question it.</p>

<p>but when it came to Boston, the local FBI boss Richard Deslauriers asked the public for help, so i helped...</p>

<p>and eventually helped his traitorous ass to the curb for his role in the hoax... </p>

<p>and along the way, there were many alternative narratives being put out by various &quot;news&quot; or government agencies, many of which were conflicting (MIT cop Sean Collier got shot with his own gun / MIT cop Sean Collier&#39;s 3 point locking holster prevented his gun from being removed)</p>

<p>one of the big conflicts in the official narrative in Boston is the identity of &quot;Boston Naked Man&quot;</p>

<p>1) if Boston Naked Man is Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Suspect1), then we know the Boston Police killed him after he was handcuffed and put in the car. </p>

<p>2) the Boston Naked Man isn&#39;t Tamerlan Tsarnaev. (then <em>who is he</em>? a very controversial question) </p>

<p>needless to say, &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; believe 1), while the official story is 2) </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1726&amp;amp;bih=986&amp;amp;q=BostonNakedMan&amp;amp;oq=BostonNakedMan&amp;amp;gs_l=img">https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1726&amp;amp;bih=986&amp;amp;q=BostonNakedMan&amp;amp;oq=BostonNakedMan&amp;amp;gs_l=img</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;amp;q=BostonNakedMan&amp;amp;src=typd">https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;amp;q=BostonNakedMan&amp;amp;src=typd</a></p>

<p>so, after having studied Boston Naked Man extensively, i come to the conclusion that he is indeed the actor who played the part of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. </p>

<p>however, there is ONE piece of evidence that didn&#39;t fit with all of the rest, and that is the fact that someone tweeted about this Boston Naked Man and made mention of the fact that the pic was taken well after the (fake) gunfight had ended and Tamerlan Tsarnaev was already dead, (supposedly run over by his brother Dzhokhar &quot;Jahar&quot; Suspect2) </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sethmnookin/status/325853110759219200">https://twitter.com/sethmnookin/status/325853110759219200</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clearly not either brother</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in my mind, clearly Seth Mnookin is lying, so therefore who is Seth Mnookin and why is he lying about Boston Naked Man?</p>

<p>turns out this guy has his own wikipedia page! </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Mnookin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Mnookin</a></p>

<p>turns out Seth Mnookin wrote a book called <em>Panic Virus</em> which is a book that &quot;debunks&quot; vaccines and autism links, and mocks anyone who says otherwise. </p>

<p>turns out Seth Mnookin is a bit of a celebrity in the vaccine industry/ community, and his book is praised and cited all over. </p>

<p>turns out Seth Mnookin is the co-director of MIT&#39;s Graduate Program in Science Writing, in spite of not having any readily obvious credentials for such a job, other than family connections and being willing to write vaccine propaganda.</p>

<p>not long after i discover Seth Mnookin is basically a propagandist for hire, i learn about the #CDCwhistleblower and #CDCfraud, which just reinforces my assessment of Mnookin, and turned me from someone who was previously un-interested in the vaccine-autism debate into a bit of an activist on behalf of the parents who have vaccine-damaged children.</p>

<p>after the CDCwhistleblower CDCfraud story got legs, the MSM ignored it, while snopes &quot;debunked&quot; it (bad move for snopes, they lost lots of credibility points among those who were following the story long before snopes weighed in) </p>

<p>and then we started getting a flood of news about #Ebola and the #CDC, conveniently doing an internet-wide forum slide. </p>

<p>so in the course of helping with the Boston Marathon Bombing, as per #FBIBoston SAC #RichardDeslauries&#39; request, i discover that the news media is &quot;recycling&quot; witnesses </p>

<p>which then brings into question Sandy Hook school shooting, where even more discrepancies are found </p>

<p>Oh, it turns out she&#39;s got her own Wikipedia page too!  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_McCarren">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_McCarren</a></p>

<p>and once the facade starts to fall off, the rest quickly comes crashing down too, to the point where these false flag fake news stories are so predictable they can be put on a calendar, and have been here</p>

<p><a href="http://6weekcycle.com">http://6weekcycle.com</a> #6WeekCycle </p>

<p>so you ask yourself, what do all these fake news stories have in common? what is the motivation to fabricate news?</p>

<p>and the answers i came up with are</p>

<p>1) to divide the people. get them arguing about Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman. now everyone has an opinion.</p>

<p>2) gun control. this is the exact same M.O. that was used in Australia to get gun control passed there. a string of high profile shootings, accompanied with media hype, and soon politicians passed gun control. problem. reaction. solution.</p>

<p>oddly enough, the mass shootings in Australia stopped right after gun control was passed, presumably because mass murderers obey new laws.  the name of the last town in Australia that had a mass shooting? Newtown! can&#39;t make this stuff up! </p>

<p>so, after knowing that there is a distinct pattern of fake, high profile shootings in the news about every 6 weeks, we have a high profile shooting, people just start calling it fake before the story even begins. we have come to expect these stories like clock-work. nearby &quot;drills&quot; are usually a big red flag, and one of the first things we look for.</p>

<p>1) the national media never actually tells you what is going on, they only tell you what they want you to think</p>

<p>2) every single &quot;news&quot; story is &quot;agenda driven&quot;, meaning they tell certain stories to drive certain agendas, and ignore stories (CDCfraud, autism) that don&#39;t fit their agenda (vaccinations)</p>

<p>therefore, if the &quot;news&quot; is covering something, like the story in OP, it should <em>always</em> be considered propaganda. there is an agenda for telling you any story. </p>

<p>therefore, if you want the state of the art propaganda, just tune in Sean Hannity on the radio and take notes. every word the man says is a lie. well, almost every word. enough to make him MMFA misinformer of the year 2008 </p>

<p><a href="http://newscorpwatch.org/research/200812170007">http://newscorpwatch.org/research/200812170007</a></p>

<p>if Hannity mentions ISIS / ISIL, he is lying.</p>

<p>if Hannity mentions Israel, he is lying. </p>

<p>if Hannity mentions Ebola, he is lying. </p>

<p>and when i say &quot;lying&quot; i don&#39;t mean we have a difference of opinion. i mean the BIG LIE. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve worked in video and photo for years and as insane as it sounds this was standard practice for literally decades. Yeah it is stupid, yeah when it comes down to it it is an incredible loss but guess what reusing those tapes was a decision by a tight ass pencil pusher and to him it was nothing but a line item on a sheet and a way to save money. This is my entire problem with people who believe conspiracy theories. I&#39;ve worked with some of the largest companies in the world I have clients who are some if the richest most elite people on the planet and you guys are right about one thing, they are not good people. But and this is a huge but so pay attention, the factor that connects them all is a bureaucracy of total ineptness. All the things you think are master plans are just fuck ups by people who are in a bureaucratic system and are terrified of losing their jobs or disrupting the status quo. The new world order that your so scared about is actually a bunch of coked out type A personalities stroking their massive egos. So find a new religion please. </p>
