       Why did the school remove the SWAT exercise notice, given that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The state demands pride in the militarized police.
       </li>
       <li>
        Increased perception of police availability would (if this wasn't faked) be
        <em>
         exactly
        </em>
        what a victim school would (have otherwise) want(ed) to show
       </li>
       <li>
        Such a removal would, by raising suspicions and foisting doubt, slightly reduce the 'reality' (probably a better word somewhere) of the event: the opposite of the desired outcome for a non-staged event

       If you check the website and see two posts, one about training and one about an incident, can't you see how people might get confused and think the real one is just part of the training? Or more realistically, how someone at the school could think that could happen and take down the first one?

       yeah as soon as i heard the news (i heard it very early on, before there were any articles on it) i went to the marysville school district site where i saw the swat message, before they had even mentioned the school shooting. Now, they took the post down. Not really sure why they would do that, seems it would only promote thoughts of a conspiracy. They must know that many people saw the same post - removing it makes little sense.

Earlier today, Marysville Pilchuck High School was placed in lock down following an emergency situation. Police and emergency services responded and are now directing from their command center along with assistance from Marysville School District staff.  We are actively working with law enforcement in identifying students and getting them home safely. 
A student reunification center is located at the corner of 116th and 51st Street at the Shoultes Community Church. Support services for students and families are also available at this location.
All after school events have been cancelled district-wide. 
This is an active police investigation. All media calls are being directed to local law enforcement. Additional information will be released as it becomes available. 
We want to extend our thoughts and prayers to the families involved in this tragedy.  When something happens to one of our children, it happens to all of us.  We are working closely with law enforcement.  Our thoughts are with all students, families, staff, and our communities during this time.

       This was grabbed as soon as I heard about the shooting. I was looking to see if the district had made a statement yet. Sorry to ruin your theory, but it's talking about the training happening by the district office / bus barn on 80th st.

       Thanks for the info. It is a helluva coincidence. In the realm of politics, power and police, I don't believe in coincidence theory.

       There have been far too many coincidences of this nature in the past years. It strains credibility to lay it all on coincidence.

       No, you arent. Most of the world is pretty simple, and has been for thousands of years.  At times it's more complicated, but for the most part it's not. Take you for example... you're not some genius sunflower who just hasn't found their calling. You are simply someone who doesn't have anything better to do. Maybe you are socially awkward and something keeps you inside the home, but there is no conspiracy regarding your personality. You simply are who you are and you choose to be that way. 99% of this country and this world is run in the same fashion, and the few connected conspiracies are overlooked because you are too busy focusing on situations that can play out like a 90 minute action movie. It's the reason half of your responses don't directly relate to the comment at hand, the reason you talk and think in circles. You are looking for bad information and you are finding it, it's a self fulfilling prophecy, but it doesn't make the information accurate.

       It's a proven fact that there is a small percentage of the population, 3-5%, that lack emotional activity and have a desire for power and control over others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst of sociopaths will do anything to get and keep power/control over others. They're at the top of the pyramid in politics, the banking/corporate combines, the military-police complex and any other hierarchy. They wish only power, status and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about me, btw, but I do hope you feel a little in your personal delusions in having been able to vent.

       This is absolutely about you. You have proven that over and over, and you just did it again. The fact that there are sociopaths in our society does not mean that they are all at the top and that they hold government positions while actively conspiring against you. The fact that you connect the 2 without any kind of doubt says more about you than it does society.

       I'm not sure what you're trying to show me. That you can find bad information by looking for bad information? I think we've already established that. We know there are sociopaths and psychopaths, and yes maybe some of them hold high positions or have in the past. I'm more scared of you than I am then. You have more power to affect my daily life with; rallies, terrorism, and militia like stances than they do with bills to ban guns, upping taxes, and whether or not they can check to see whether I'm a terrorist or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the impression that most of you think you are some kind of shepherd to the people, that you're here for some kind of higher purpose. I hate to break it to you, but you're not, and 99% of the people in this world have better things to do then take a stormy day as a sign of the apocalypse.

       Well yeah, the amount of bad info that you regurgitate as fact is scary. The fact that you have people that think like you is frightening. The rebels without a cause can follow your cause, no matter how far out there it is. Whatever makes you think the way you think is also a concern, but a separate one.

       Conspiracy theorists have a bad habit of using convenient information to support their version of the truth, and exiting the discussion when their information is no longer convenient. I have nothing against you personally, if you see anything I said as an attack maybe that has to do more with how you think than what i'm saying. I'm trying to convey the fact that people like you scare me as part of our society.

      <p>
       It's not your ideas that scare me, it's how you go about getting them. You go from theories to truth in a flash, leaving out volumes in the middle. When confronted with evidence that contradict the convenience of your theories, you stop the discussion and either stop responding or focus on complaining about some personal attack against you. You basically use the same tricks that politicians and self proclaimed prophets use.

       You're talking in circles again, it's quite insulting for you to think people won't pick up on this little trick. You rarely respond to the actual comment, instead you ask yet another theoretical and quite rhetorical question that you simply may find profound. If we are going to have an actual discussion, its to get back to where we left of at the evidence these drills are common enough that its quite plausible for the 2 things to happen on the same day.

       There you go again, talking in circles. It's insulting that you think I'm immature enough to fall for such tactics. You stated something as fact, and I asked you for more information on said fact. Instead of answering the question you yet again ask another hypothetical and rhetorical question, regarding what I believe in the situation.

      <p>
       But to answer your question... no they do not hold equal weight. Witnessing a crime holds a lot of weight. For you to state that you witnessed such events is a bold statement, so i asked you for clarification. Its nothing short of appalling for you to backtrack and claim your opinion is just as factual as the overwhelming evidence that this was another tragedy perpetrated by a mentally ill person. This kind of logic scares me, and that's what you might have taken as a personal attack previously. I was making a statement about the mindset, not about your character. There is plenty of common sense for being scared of someone who uses this logic. There are plenty of studies and discussions regarding this fictitious logic, it's called the argument for ignorance.

       This is one of many reasons most of us don't take people like you seriously. I tried many times to get you back on track to the actual discussion, and you were obviously unwilling to do so, i'm assuming because it wasn't convenient for your version of the truth.

       Any sane person with the reading comprehension of a  5th grader would realize that if anything, you were the one not answering questions during this exchange, and only asking new ones to derail the fact that you weren't answering questions to stay on topic. If you would like to go back and completely answer all of my questions that you didn't answer, then I'd be happy to answer your silly little one here. Keep asking, free asker.

       I see it as win-win: if he's for real, then I can engage him and maybe edge him out of his comfort zone enough so that his opinion might change down the road.

      <p>
       If he's a shill engaging in personal attacks for no other reason but to derail, then I can engage him reasonably and the fence-sitters that might run across the thread can see who the reasonable mind is: the one not engaging in personal attacks.

       Not knowing the full content of the post, it's just grasping for straws in my opinion. Doesn't mention when the SWAT training would be taking place, so we must assume it's the next day? I wish it wasn't removed, so it could provide more answers than questions.

       maybe they removed the announcement because it was yesterday and no longer applies.

       Or maybe they think that by removing it from the website, no one would know that this "shooting" is fake.

       Say people take umbrellas to work on random days of the week. Now it turns out that 100 people took umbrellas to work on one day, and it actually started raining. Conspiracy? No. You're not taking into consideration the 900 people who did not take umbrellas to work, or the other times when these 100 people took umbrellas to work and it didn't rain.

       So is there a single screenshot or cache of this notice anywhere that goes beyond "in the large fenced parking..." -- It could be saying any number of things after that... "in the large fenced parking lot this coming weekend" for example... Is there any evidence or suggestion that there was any police or SWAT presence at the school when the shooting occurred?

       If this is the only one in 2 years, Ok, maybe it's an interesting bit of evidence.  If they've done it 50 times, well then, coincidences do actually happen.

       OP is the one making the case that this is an unusual event, so much so that coincidence is ruled out. If he's going to put the theory forth and expect people to consider it, it's his responsibility to present the facts. All of them, not just those that support his idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have an opinion as if yet either way. But I'd like to see those numbers. If OP or anyone supporting his theory refuse to post them for everyone to easily see I can then assume two things; 1) OP doesn't care enough to find evidence supporting him and therefore probably doesn't much believe his own theory, or 2) the numbers contradict the theory and it's likely wrong.

      <p>
       When I know I'm right and want people to realize something I care about is truth, I don't find it an inconvenience to add facts and numbers to clearly support my argument.

       Rather than make this about me, kindly address the obvious: an announced SWAT drill that appears to have gone live.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SWAT training was even announced on CNN:

       An unannounced drill that was announced on CNN? And the school website?

      <p>
       Whatever. I'm not really caring about this, it's just another shooting. But I think it's ridiculous that you put forth this theory, smugly insult anyone who questions it, and refuse to barely even address the posts your replying to.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think you've found something worthwhile try taking the time to vet it before posting. If it's true, that time will pay off. If it's not, you saved yourself from becoming just another loon making this sub look like it's full of crazy people rather than concerned people thinking clearly and reading between the lines.

       why are you confident in that fact?

      <p>
       I can say that I'm confident you are an overweight virgin with bad facial hair, but I really have no actual evidence to support that claim.  So it would be idiotic and baseless of me to make such a hypothesis.

       You should know that I cannot prove a negative.  I cannot prove some connection doesn't exist.  You have made a hypothesis.  At least do the fucking minimum amount of research to see if your WAC has some amount of merit greater than zero.

       Haha, its common practice here to do your own homework. You came with the possibility they do it often so fucking prove it or go bother someone else. This is how we tell a difference in a real user of r/con or someone that is here to be a distraction. What is a bigger coincidence,  is your familiar tactics.  You are not very good at this.

       With only 40-50 counties in the state and only 365 days a year... no it doesn't. With a dozen or so school shootings in the past 10-20 years in that state alone... and you're acting like its 1 in a million chance? You said it would be interesting to see how common these drills are. I showed you how common they are, yet you're still stuck on the conspiracy?

       I found those with ease. I'm not about to waste anymore time on searching for subject matter regarding your conspiracy theory. Even with just a couple of instances over the span of 2 years, it's common enough that it's entirely plausible, and it's nowhere near uncommon enough to be any kind of evidence for a conspiracy. If you need something to be a  50% chance to even be considered plausible then I don't know what to tell you. Keep on thinking free, free thinker.

       As much as I loathe government and totally think that most people in government power are either bad people which is why they want the power or become bad people once they have the power...I do tend to laugh at the "conspiracy" folks for a couple reasons.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         government is incompetent in everything, except when pulling off grand scale conspiracies involving thousands of people and costing billions of dollars all in front of the watching eye of the public.  Then everything is flawless.

         What isn't a conspiracy?  When was the last "big thing" that wasn't a conspiracy?  When was the last bombing or mass shooting or terrorist attack or major outbreak of disease that wasn't a conspiracy?    It seems like nothing bad ever happens without the US government making it happen, and no on ever goes on mass killing sprees without someone making them do it.

       A typically retarded coincidence theorist response. Yet another "drill" coincides with a terrorist(TM) event, and, oh, it's just a coincidence.

       The government and the bureaucracy are two different things... when an individual needs something done, a permit, or whatever, and face incompetent workers and get the runaround, that is the bureaucracy, the part we have to deal with. There the is the government we don't see, organized, powerful. But no one deals with that part on a daily basis... well, none of the regular citizenry. That part of the government is a well oiled machine. That part is quasi military, uniform, rigid, it has goals. That part could get it's ass in gear and make some shady shit happen right quick. The DMV cannot.

       He said the people who make up the government are evil, but that the government sucks at doing everything. So even though they are evil, they are incompetent to the point of making conspiracies almost impossible to pull off. Sure the CIA is great at criminal conspiracies, but even they get found out eventually. I doubt a Seattle police department has the ability to kill a couple kids and have literally no one find out about it.

       Government is very good at one thing: keeping their jobs no matter how much they fuck up. It's also very good at something else: lying to us, day in, day out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a good thing for government that most people suspend critical thinking.

       I find it sad because you lack display a gross lack of any critical thinking skills in all of your posts.  A kid shot some other kids at his school.  This is an easy thing to happen.  You don't have an open mind, you have an empty one...allowing anything in instead of having a filter for reality.

       Would just like to say how disrespectful posts like these are. Contrary to what you may think, not everything bad that happens in the world is a conspiracy. There are well over 10 first-hand accounts of what went on in that school &amp; inside that cafeteria, all having the same general story of what happened. Hell, I've followed one of the kids who witnessed it on Twitter for years, you're going to tell me that he's a damn liar? Social media has definitely not helped your guys' cause, when there's multiple people at an event &amp; all see the same thing. But hell, sure, gotta be the damn government pushing their agenda, right? Get real. Life happens sometimes. People do unthinkable things, &amp; have done it since the beginning of mankind.

        Earlier today, Marysville Pilchuck High School was placed in lock down following an emergency situation. Police and emergency services responded and are now directing from their command center along with assistance from Marysville School District staff.  We are actively working with law enforcement in identifying students and getting them home safely. 
A student reunification center is located at the corner of 116th and 51st Street at the Shoultes Community Church. Support services for students and families are also available at this location.
All after school events have been cancelled district-wide. 
This is an active police investigation. All media calls are being directed to local law enforcement. Additional information will be released as it becomes available. 
We want to extend our thoughts and prayers to the families involved in this tragedy.  When something happens to one of our children, it happens to all of us.  We are working closely with law enforcement.  Our thoughts are with all students, families, staff, and our communities during this time.

       Also schools are closed when they do SWAT training, like on weekends or during the summer. So are you now implying that the police had someone shoot up a school with real ammo(as opposed to the paintball-esq training ammo they use) just so they could practice on someone other than themselves? Around children? Or they are willing to kill eachother and themselves for a training(real ammo)? I mean the police have confirmed that students are on their way to the hospital so....

       That's crazy man. I don't necessarily take it as a false flag but it would be great if the media actually followed up on it and you know, did some real journalism. It'd be cool to know what the rest of the notice said.

       It actually does look like a legit notice, unless someone was able to modify google results (unlikely). But it's not even close to a conspiracy. It's common for swat teams to run drills.

       If you enter that search string, it will bring up the school districts website because you're entering enough keywords for a hit.  The full is October 23... shows up under that link because of the 7 other "similar" pages that are exact hits, from forums reposting the picture.  Takes a little bit of knowledge about constructing the search string but, yeah, it's fake.

       I'm not sure what you mean, but that's a legit search showing legit hits from the
       <a href="http://www.msvl.k12.wa.us">
        www.msvl.k12.wa.us
       </a>
       website. Google doesn't show you cached hits from a website where the hits never existed on that website, it doesn't work that way. It's not a conspiracy, but its a legit notice. There was also someone on the news who had started to read the notice and then figured out it was from yesterday, so its not just some photoshop job.

       I don't think this is part of any conspiracy. Only 2 kids were killed - one was the gunman. There are, according to CNN's sources, 2,500 kids who attend that school - meaning there are probably many accounts of what happened. There have already been witnesses saying they knew it was the suspect Jaylen when they saw him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everything like this is a conspiracy. Things happen. Columbine was definitely real because we have video evidence of it - and that is one of the biggest cases of mass shootings in U.S. history; a case that everyone focuses on.

       Why would they schedule an event before a false flag? I don't understand the advantage besides maybe giving a cover for why there are so many operatives in the area. Besides that it is a bad practice because it builds a trend that people can figure out.

       I wonder if this shooter was on antidepressants too? If he was, then he was  no different than all the other school shooters. If there is any conspiracy about these shootings it's the fact all the school shooters were taking those drugs but it's the one aspect and commonality the MSM never explores.

       Is it disrespectful to question why these events of the past week have all happened a week before elections. The news has been talking about an "October surprise" which will hurt incumbents.  The validity of a news story isn't what I question, but more so the spin that is used to turn a crazed lone gunmen into even more privacy invasion for the standard citizen.  Mental health is the theme of the week, but its going to turn into terrorism/gun safety/jihadist/Isis and Ebola.  At the end of the day though, mental health is still the nucleus of most of the news we hear.

       So it looks like "Web Admin" changed the page. I wonder who Web Admin is? Surely they are a suspect or at least a lead. Maybe somebody in the Technology department would know...

       I am from around these parts...  watching the news on CNN during lunch break I immediately  thought something was up with the conversation on CNN's Terror Watch USA (what I call it).  News person asks how the "kid" on the phone giving his first person account of the incident sounds so calm and acts like nothing happened.  Kid responds with that is just how I am and have always been.  .....  sure buddy.

       This has NOTHING to do with the government. There is no conspiracy. Shove that false flag up your ass and be respectful to the victims. Judging by the Twitter posts of the students who attend that school, the gunman was a kid going through personal problems and simply snapped. Think about the friends and families impacted by today's events. Not everything is a false flag.

       Sometimes you have to be brave because the majority can be wrong.  Sometimes you should realize you are wrong because everyone disagrees with you.  In this case, you aren't being brave, you are being foolish.  Take a look at the downvotes in this case and reflect on how you are paranoid.

       It makes no difference. The announcement of a drill was removed and now the announcement of an emergency is on the school's site.

       He said the people who make up the government are evil, but that the government sucks at doing everything. So even though they are evil, they are incompetent to the point of making conspiracies almost impossible to pull off. Sure the CIA is great at criminal conspiracies, but even they get found out eventually. I doubt a Seattle police department has the ability to kill a couple kids and have literally no one find out about it.

       Yeah, and what about when 9 out of 10 people would rather keep their head in the sand and just pretend the world is perfect and that the government is honest and takes care of them (even though an overwhelming amount of hard evidence indicates otherwise)

       I see it as win-win: if he's for real, then I can engage him and maybe edge him out of his comfort zone enough so that his opinion might change down the road.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he's a shill engaging in personal attacks for no other reason but to derail, then I can engage him reasonably and the fence-sitters that might run across the thread can see who the reasonable mind is: the one not engaging in personal attacks.
