        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For me, it all started about a year and a half ago, when my brother asked me to watch &quot;a few fascinating documentaries&quot; on the events of 911 - something most of you would know as Loose Change and Zeitgeist. I can still remember that first night falling asleep and feeling like my whole world had been turned upside down. I had fallen down the rabbit hole. Like many of you, I immediately began reading up on anything I could regarding any and all popular conspiracies, realizing that if 911 was a lie, anything else could be possible.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a wild ride, and education, and certainly very eye opening. But sometimes I feel like it&#39;s just overwhelming, and not a little bit hopeless. Several times I have cut off all access to sites like this and others, in the hopes that I can just go back to living a normal life in happy ignorance, back to before I learned the truth about our world. I&#39;ve tried several times, but something always draws me back, eventually. As soon as something new strikes the news, and I want to know the truth, I find myself right back in the mix of things. Yet still, the terrible weight and responsibility that comes with what we know - it makes me wonder if plugging back into the Matrix wouldn&#39;t be better after all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We can step outside the matrix, you know. Many men have done so, by disengaging emotionally from the illusions of politics and world affairs. We are only in the matrix if the matrix touches us.</p>

<p>It may be argued that the matrix can torture us, inprison us, end our lives. But the counter-argument to that is that we are not our bodies. We can transcend our flesh. People do this all the time, by defying pain, by sacrificing themselves for others, by committing suicide. The matrix can control the body, but it cannot control the soul ... which is the ultimate message of the movie, <em>The Matrix</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Nolibs is trying to say you need to not view everything as so cut and dry. Not <em>everything</em> is a conspiracy, and not every popular theory is correct, so it&#39;s not necessarily &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot;.</p>

<p>What OP is talking about is a shift in perception of our world. Once you understand that you&#39;re not always fed the truth about past and current events, that our government may be out of our control and doing the will of a small and powerful group, or that 3 skyscrapers in NYC could be destroyed and the entire world lied to about who the culprit is, you gain a new perspective on how the world really works.</p>

<p>At the same time I understand that the matrix metaphor is a good way to describe this change in perception. I suppose if you theoretically wanted you could choose to decide to write off all conspiracy theories as misguided misunderstandings and in effect &quot;plug back in&quot; to your old world view.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to recognize that many of the popular conspiracy theories of the past have been PROVEN true. There&#39;s really no such reality in which all human events are non-conspiratorial. There&#39;s also no such possible reality where <em>everything</em> is the result of a conspiracy. It can be hard to distinguish the truth from the bullshit, especially these days with the internet, there are more ideas floating out there to consider than ever before. Infowars is not a good source of information at all, unfortunately there&#39;s no one source that can give you all the answers so good judgement is necessary to differentiate between truth and bs.</p>

<p>Another good question to ask is what do you plan to do about your world view? Is it going to make any difference at all if you believe certain things to be true, or will you just feel a bit more safe and comfortable while you sleep at night? My father-in-law is an interesting case, he knows most of the &quot;conventional&quot; conspiratorial wisdom is true, how war is a racket, there were some funny things about 9/11, etc, but at the end of the day he doesn&#39;t really give a shit. His attitude is &quot;there&#39;s nothing we can do about any of this&quot; he knows what&#39;s going on, but has basically surrendered. </p>

<p>The bottom line is, if you aren&#39;t going to let the knowledge you have impact the way that you interact with the world and the people around you, It doesn&#39;t matter what you believe so believe whatever you want. If you feel disgusted by the current state of human affairs like I do, let&#39;s keep fighting the intellectual battle to win over others to our view. We can help shape reality and not just be passive observers.</p>

<p>Just wanted to say that just because not everything is a conspiracy and not every popular theory is correct doesn&#39;t imply that everything can&#39;t be either a conspiracy or a correct popular theory.</p>

<p>What you might want is that some phenomena that are incorrectly reported and misunderstood are not conspiracies, but just human mistakes.</p>

<p>Besides that I like the last point you made about if this knowledge doesn&#39;t affect your actions it doesn&#39;t mean anything. </p>

<p>I would however say that it doesn&#39;t take much to constitute <em>a</em> change in the way people interact with the world. Being critical of, or ignoring, MSM, for one, is certainly something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to Love my daily life.  Working, playing video games with friends, spending money on frivolous hobbies.  I am so much different now.  I pretty much despise my day to day routine.  I have no free time and for my 60 hours a week at the grinding wheel I have something to show for it only because I am so frugal.  I squeak when I walk and debate for days or weeks before I spend money.  I often feel anxious for something to change and sometimes would even welcome disaster over this slow, painful decline.  </p>

<p>I hate when people say &quot;go back to school and do better for yourself&quot; because they obviously don&#39;t understand that education is absurdly expensive now and jobs are hard to get even with a degree.  I am disgusted with corporate retail, the most plentiful and arguably stressful jobs...also the worst paying.  I don&#39;t even like to work on my house, which is supposed to be this great investment, because I couldn&#39;t sell it at a loss the markets are so bad.  Forget investing in markets, they are doomed.</p>

<p>My only hope is to tread water long enough for our civilization to overcome these problems.  Overthrow tyrannical government.  Take the profit out of war.  Take the profit out of owning a home, receiving an education, medical care, free energy.  It&#39;s either that or collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people who don&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories as a rule they live by usually are that way because they do not want to live in a reality where they have to cope with things they have known to be true turning out to be false.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard that when people get divorced, their brain patterns are similar to people who have had a stroke. The stress and behavioral changes forced on a newly separated or divorced person are that powerful. I imagine that for some, the type of perspective switch after realizing these conspiracy theories actually have a strong possibility of being true is a similar situation. People generally do not want to have a stroke, or even get a divorce. People tend to know that this &quot;rabbit hole&quot; of truth is dangerous to their mood and sanity. Not believing is a sort of survival mechanism.</p>

<p>Those of us here generally do not have that mechanism, apparently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been said that &quot;always and never are two words you should always remember never to use&quot;, but still: No, never. Adherence to truth comes with its own comforts far superior to the dull tranquility of conformity. Only after fully committing to what I know to be true have I found genuine happiness. As in all things in this bipolar universe, genuine sadness is its eternal companion, but the mere depth of experience alone has made it all worthwhile. And above the emotional carousel, one fact towers unyieldingly: The lie might win the sprint, but the truth wins the marathon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The agenda is educating the public as to why we have wars.</p>

<p>tl;dw: Private central bankers finance both sides. The public is fed whatever story is needed to win their acceptance.</p>

<p>To change the subject a bit... What do you think will happen to Internet shills once this is all over? Depending on their cause (or, rather, assignment) many are aiding and abetting mass murder -- for example, the ones covering for the coup in Kiev or promoting discord in Syria. There are going to be so many angry people whose friends and families have been destroyed due, in part, to these shills who help drive the public narrative. They deserve justice. And history has shown that &quot;I was just doing my job&quot; is not an adequate defense.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t think all the wars in &quot;recent&quot; history were the cause of the bankers. If they supposedly have the power that you think they do, I wonder if they can be taken down. </p>

<p>Also, I doubt big central banks have people on payroll that troll around on reddit, but lets say they do. They wouldn&#39;t share the responsibilty of the gunmen in Kiev or Syria.  Like from most cupable to least: bank leaders&gt;bank henchmen&gt; bank soldiers and shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had that feeling the first week I learned about 9/11, back in 2005.  Not many people knew then, and I soon learned that not a single other person in my life was aware of the truth.</p>

<p>It did turn my life upside down, and I recall thinking &quot;I wish I didn&#39;t know this.&quot;  </p>

<p>But now, I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.  I realize that mainstream advice I read, about health, or finances, or even relationships, is most likely not based in reality.  We are being attacked on every level and the mainstream outlets are the primary vehicle for that attack.  9/11 was just the tip of the iceberg that got me to look deeper, and I&#39;ve learned some amazing things.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m also much healthier.  Waking up to the medical-industrial complex means I ignore most of what my doctors advise and do my own research instead.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this because I feel the same and it&#39;s nice to know I&#39;m not alone.</p>

<p>I used to spend a lot of time on Twitter and I was always talking about various conspiracy theories or trying to explain to people the real reason why certain world events were taking place (or in some cases telling them certain events <em>didn&#39;t</em> actually take place). </p>

<p>Anyway, I realised that I was just ranting and no one was listening and it was exhausting. Then the CIA opened a Twitter account with their first tweet being a joke tweet and everyone was retweeting it saying they were hilarious. People were saying things like, I guess the CIA has a sense of humour after all and those guys aren&#39;t so bad etc. I think that was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back because now I don&#39;t talk to other people about conspiracy theories or what really happened because I&#39;m sick of them taking no notice. It&#39;s really tiring being constantly disappointed in the people you care about so I just don&#39;t bother any more.</p>

<p>Except here. I keep closing my accounts in frustration and then coming back because I&#39;ve got no where else to talk about this stuff and I just can&#39;t help it.</p>

<p>But I think it would be nice if I was ignorant and didn&#39;t have to get so worked up all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a female in my mid-forties who was slammed into a new reality by experiencing 911 in real time and with a suspicious seed which was planted the year before. That seed made me question the whole of what i was seeing and made a siring slice dividing me from everything I&#39;ve ever know to be real and true. It takes awhile to get your footing. Relax and enjoy the process of the tension and illusions being replaced and replaced again as you learn. The more you become comfortable and okay with the tension- the more fortitude you&#39;re building in yourself. </p>

<p>I wanted to comment from a maternal perspective and no condescension in any way. If I could have the power to just have a quick talk with myself back when I was lost in the hardest and most jolting of the process...if only. So I will say this to you. Every time you stop and delay doing anything that will be good for you, make you healthier, happier, have more fun, more laughs, adventures, feel and be stronger, feel deeper, love and live bigger....don&#39;t delay and ponder....keep creating the forward momentum.  Plus,be a good friend to yourself and others. So just take a breath and fucking own this moment in your life. Don&#39;t use your new knowledge as an excuse to say fuck it.....own you.....own your adventure.  There is too much fun and excitement to be had...don&#39;t use this darker version to talk yourself out of taking advantage of the lighter more healthy version/path. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for these.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of them but it looks as though you&#39;re going down the same route as me with regards to dealing with the red pill. I&#39;ve pretty much buried myself in books and documentaries about philosophy/metaphysics/extra terrestrials in the hope of finding that there is some kind of plan for us (and maybe some kind of higher power supervising it), and that all of the shit going on at the moment is part of that plan. </p>

<p>I downloaded the entire works of Plato for about 47p on Amazon the other day as the Allegory of the Cave fascinated me (I think Socrates actually came up with it and Plato narrated it). Unfortunately, I can&#39;t really discuss this kind of shit with my friends and family as they would think I&#39;ve gone completely sideways (they barely tolerate me telling them how the government is fucking us). I&#39;ll definitely be checking out that Law of One thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly what you mean. All conspiracy roads lead to spirituality. And you will find all earthly secret societies involve things like child pornography, human sacrifice and &quot;satan worship&quot; at the top levels. The hidden hand interview is the only thing that makes sense. And the law of one corroberates these theories fully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like anything, the first step is to realize that you are an addict.  Quitting smoking was nothing to quitting borrowing.  </p>

<p>I lost my 6 figure job in one of the worst economies of our lifetime.  Couldn&#39;t get another job. I wouldn&#39;t recommend going that route.  </p>

<p>I started my own business instead.  Will never work for someone else again.</p>

<p>You have to create the principle that you will not borrow any more money, ever.  Really set it in stone.  Then prepare for a shitty ride, because things will suck for as long as it takes you to strip away your belief that you need 90% of the shit that you have in your life now.  </p>

<p>That is pretty much it.  Just stop playing.  Cut up the cards.  Pay off your car and keep it, squirrel back money every chance you get.  Treat yourself when things go right.   It took us a couple of years to adjust, to pay off everything, just to get our net worth to a balance of &quot;not negative&quot;.  But funny thing, when you don&#39;t have credit cards and car payments, and cable bills, etc... You can do things like pay your car insurance 6 months at a time, which saves you money.  Or pay cash for your cell phone instead of signing up for a 2 year plan, which saves you money.  </p>

<p>The whole system is designed to nickle and dime poor people.  If you pay cash up front, things don&#39;t cost nearly as much.  It is totally counter intuitive of course.  Why would I pay $500 for a phone that I can get for $9 with a 2 year plan?  </p>

<p>We all know the reason, but most people will still think that they are getting to keep $491, when in reality they are paying $700 - $800 for that phone over 2 years.  If someone offers you a phone for $500, why would you say &quot;fuck that! I&#39;m paying you $700 for it&quot;.  </p>

<p>People do it every day.</p>

<p>Same with a car.  If I say that I will sell a  $24,000 car for only $34,000, most people will jump all over it, because I am spreading it out over 5 years.  People are willingly giving up $10,000 of their hard earned money, for the sake of convenience.  </p>

<p>However, when you don&#39;t have credit cards and car payments, and a million other bullshit expenses that you think you need, saving up $24K ain&#39;t shit. I have enough now to pay off my house in case something happens to me.  I don&#39;t touch that money.  It&#39;s for my family.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get the idea that I am some tightwad though.  I still eat out a lot, and occasionally buy shit that I don&#39;t need.  It&#39;s only the first couple of years that suck.  After that, you emerge as some kind of battle hardened warrior poet.  I don&#39;t have to exercise my will not to buy things.  There is simply nothing in Walmart that I want more than my money.  I look at the Joneses next door, like they are the biggest rubes in existence.  </p>

<p>In short, there is no such thing as instant gratification.  Don&#39;t fall for it.  Play the long game.  It&#39;s easier than you think.</p>

<p>There is no way back into the Matrix though, the only way Cypher knew he could do it was only if he wouldn&#39;t remember any of it. Ignorance may be bliss, but you can&#39;t will yourself back into ignorance once it&#39;s taken away from you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks all, for your thoughts, opinions, and advice. I guess the general consensus that there is no &quot;going back&quot; or putting the genie back in the bottle may be right. I think the trick is to keep a steady eye on the news and world events but not become too obsessed. Not spend all my time and energy researching this stuff, worrying about it, and letting it control my life. I do appreciate what I&#39;ve learned, to question media and news, to think for myself a little more and not believe everything I&#39;m told, to have a new appreciation for truth. Knowledge is a value and a currency all its own, regardless of whether we can change things or not (here&#39;s hoping there&#39;s a way) knowledge itself makes us stronger.</p>

That things like MK Ultra, Operation North Woods, PRISM, 911, the Kennedy Assassination, and many other things, have existed and will continue to occur. The question then is whether we have any inherent duty to do something to change things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no God. There is no pretty picture of the future. It&#39;s only here and now and that&#39;s all you got. Learn how to manipulate people and use them to your advantage (while trying to minimize repercussions) to try to make the best of the life you have now. There&#39;s no stopping their endgame, so the best you can do is live for maximum happiness, be it from accomplishments or frequent pleasure or just doing hard drugs till your dopamine runs out. Or also smoke a ton of weed; that&#39;ll take the edge off all the negative conspiracies thinking. There is no escaping the system unless you want to live in the wilderness somewhere far away which is okay, but shit it&#39;s hard to live sustainably and it only gets harder with the eventual, total destruction of the environment that will eventually wipe out the lives of anyone/thing outside the matrix. Only good news is that dying is like falling asleep except you don&#39;t wake up, so that might help some fears. What do you think?</p>

<p>EDIT: Falling in love is also a good idea, but you gotta be willing to work for it and it&#39;s going to be hard to find someone attractive who thinks like you as well. So you could try to convince them yet, but that might destroy their blissful ignorance too so you&#39;d have to be careful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I&#39;ve actually chased a lot of leads regarding Egypt and a lot of it is disinformation or too general or leads me to nowhere. Perhaps the Egyptians did have knowledge of electric power... From aliens? Absolutely not... but if there&#39;s something more to the Egyptians—and there certainly seems like there might be—I haven&#39;t found any arguments I can get behind.</p>

<p>The spirituality thing is the only truth that will set you free. It will make every conspiracy, every evil, everything you&#39;ve ever thought was ever a problem, not a problem at all. It will give you a new focus in life that will literally make life soooo much better. But you have really want to know, and its really important. Basically I&#39;m telling you there&#39;s a hidden treasure on the internet that will reap literally infinite rewards and yet somehow nothing at all :) and that&#39;s not a riddle hehe</p>

<p>This is what those who would like to deprive you of the strength of your religion would like you to believe. They&#39;ve spent your entire life telling you this, every day of your life, over and over, until you believed it without question. But it isn&#39;t true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The agenda is educating the public as to why we have wars.</p>

<p>tl;dw: Private central bankers finance both sides. The public is fed whatever story is needed to win their acceptance.</p>

<p>To change the subject a bit... What do you think will happen to Internet shills once this is all over? Depending on their cause (or, rather, assignment) many are aiding and abetting mass murder -- for example, the ones covering for the coup in Kiev or promoting discord in Syria. There are going to be so many angry people whose friends and families have been destroyed due, in part, to these shills who help drive the public narrative. They deserve justice. And history has shown that &quot;I was just doing my job&quot; is not an adequate defense.</p>
