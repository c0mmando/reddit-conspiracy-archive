        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, take a look at this little gem from the Terms of Service:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you give us the right to use your content</p>

<p>You retain the exclusive rights in your content that you submit to redditmade and redditgifts, except that...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>you grant redditmade a royalty-free perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You agree that we can use your content even if your campaign is not funded. You also agree that any content you submit is not infringing any third partyâ€™s rights under intellectual property law, privacy rights, publicity rights, contract rights, or any other proprietary right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondly, I signed up and here is the breakdown:</p>

<p>You make the design and have complete creative control on the content of the shirt. You set the campaign and price. Here is the important part:</p>

<p><strong>If you end up selling 2500 shirts at $20, you make $5000 and reddit makes $45,000.</strong></p>

<p>You make a measly 10% and as someone who has had t-shirts produced to sell at festivals, this is a fucking joke. Even the fact that reddit is producing the shirts and giving you an advertising platform, 10% is an insult. This is the move of a greedy corporation, not a &quot;quirky website of nerds&quot; like they portray themselves.</p>

<p>This is a targeted campaign to tap all creativity from this site by treating the creators like suckers, while getting filthy rich in the process.</p>

<p>Lastly, when you look at the site, they have &quot;featured&quot; content and after going through the process and uploading my idea, I am given zero information on how to become &quot;featured&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>The &quot;special&quot; users get to upload professional mock-ups of their products that get displayed at the top while the rest of us get put onto a shitty, boring template, and thrown into the mix with the other thousands.</strong></p>

<p>My guess is that certain people who are in reddit&#39;s favor are given these special privs that almost guarantee that their campaigns will go viral. While the reddit staff get to go through all of the other submissions and look for creative work so that they can steal the uploaded art and sell it to the market for reproduction.</p>

<p>I made a post a few months back about what reddit was turning into. Most won&#39;t take this seriously but watch as this site gets squeezed for every drop of profit that can possibly be wrung out of it. </p>

<p>By giving reddit page hits and advertising money, they&#39;ve decided to change formats and have suckers buy into their ponzi scheme of money making. Business makes sense, but then its no longer an &#39;organic&#39; front page, its another forum of adverts and owned by big media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking over redditmade and thought it was a neat idea and I was considering using it instead of Kickstarter when I relaunch me campaign though I agree with you that they take to much away from the original creator. </p>

<p>What I think we do need to strongly considered though is that Redditmade is also offering to produce, warehouse, and fulfill orders for you at no cost to you, in other words they are acting more like a publisher and when you think of it that way, their cut (while still very high) makes some sense.</p>

<p>What I wonder is, does the creator of these products get a cut of profit if reddit was to sell additional copies on their own? For example: if I was to put my game Henchmen on redditmade and we sold 600 copies at $30 a game making a gross of $18000 and let&#39;s say that was enough to fund the minimum 1,000 copy order, leaving us with 400 copies to sell. Would I get a cut from the sale of those 400 or would I be left in the dirt? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I already addressed this. Their 90% cut does not make sense unless you think of them as a greedy corporation that only cares about the bottom line and cares nothing for the actual artists producing the content.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, you do not get a cut. If you got any cut then it would have been in the legal language. The writing is very clear, they OWN your work and can do whatever they want with it, <em>for commercial purposes</em>, and this includes SELLING your work to anyone they want. </p>

<p>And they can do this whether or not your campaign is successful. So if you sell the maximum # of units, then they can take your idea and literally sell it to a manufacturer or retail giant and you get NOTHING.</p>

<p>And I hope you know, by your own example, you would get $1800, and reddit would get $16,200. And if your idea was good enough, then they would get everything afterwards for FOREVER and you would get nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No shock.</p>

<p>The &quot;German named people&quot; who run Conde Nast have been searching for a way to monetize Reddit since the beginning.</p>

<p>Considering that this is the one and the same cabal that blew up three WTC buildings and controls the US money supply I am not surprised in the slightest. OF COURSE they&#39;re going to screw customers.</p>

<p>BTW, Reddit NEVER gave ME any news about this. Its obviously for people that Reddit feels has content that is easy to monetize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sell 2500 shirts at 20 dollars some of that money has to go to procurement and labor. I would say 10% off the top is really not too bad considering that you don&#39;t have to source your shirts, contract the printer or deal with distribution.  Especially considering it&#39;s like 95% of the work. After all is said and done I would be surprised if reddits cut were more than half.</p>

<p>All in all, maybe it&#39;s not as bad as it seems. I&#39;m a pretty skeptical person but I think redditmade is pretty groovy. The whole hyper &quot;local&quot; movement is one of the few encouraging aspects of the world today.</p>

<p>I would be really surprised if reddit&#39;s staff were to steal content given that it&#39;s stipulated in the TOS that you retain rights to the content. </p>

<p>Not 90%.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are wrong. It is extremely bad. I guess being an artist and working your entire life to nurture your creativity is worthless and just a &quot;small&quot; part of a process that is completely based on the CONCEPT of your item.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole hyper &quot;local&quot; movement is one of the few encouraging aspects of the world today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This model has been done to death and anyways, many outlets actually treat the creator as something special to the process and give them the respect the deserve monetarily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would be really surprised if reddit&#39;s staff were to steal content given that it&#39;s stipulated in the TOS that you retain rights to the content. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you have no understanding of marketing or how legal terms are written.</p>

<p>If reddit was going to cut you in on sales after they own your work and begin to reproduce it, then it would be a MAJOR marketing point that would be stressed to the public and we wouldn&#39;t even be having this conversation.</p>

<p>And why would you assume that redditmade has no intention of capitalizing on something that they clearly wrote in the TOS:</p>

<p><em>you grant redditmade a royalty-free perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium *</em>and for any purpose, including commercial purposes*<em>, and to authorize others to do so.</em></p>
