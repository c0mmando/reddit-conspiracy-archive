       suppose ppl made a request or
       <em>
        demanded
       </em>
       that the pyramid with the 'all seeing eye' be removed from the dollar bill,
      </p>
      <p>
       if it was removed, would that make any difference?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: sp
      </p>
      <p>
       "  One side of the Great Seal shows an ancient Egyptian pyramid, beneath a triangle containing a glowing eye. The shining eye in the triangle is a certainly a famous and common Masonic symbol, although some Masonic sources prefer to deny this. The All Seeing Eye (e.g. 1, e.g. 2, e.g. 3, e.g. 4, e.g. 5, e.g. 6, e.g. 7, e.g. 8, e.g. 9, e.g. 10) is one of the most important and spiritual Masonic symbols, and the distinguished Freemason George Washington, first President of the United States of America, wore it emblazoned boldly on his Masonic apron. The front of the Great Seal displays an Eagle, which is also an important symbol in Masonic traditions. The use of the blazing eye in the triangle motif, surrounded by rays of light, in the official seal of the Ordo Templi Orientis, confirms the occult significance of this symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
       . . . It is difficult to elucidate the full meaning of the symbols in the official Great Seal of the United States, because they are occult symbols which carry profound esoteric meaning from a truly ancient secret society which may be older and more far-reaching than the Masonic order.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are various interpretations in the public domain, but the truth is known only to initiated insiders. What is most important in the context of this article is that these are ancient religious symbols which hold special hidden significance, and their use by the American government reveals something about the secret beliefs of those in power."

       There isn't enough gold and silver to support the amount of money, sadly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, gold and silver fluctuate way too much. Good back to that standard would only give TPTB more power.

       What are you talking about? When you stop inflating the currency you then tie the dollar to however much gold and silver a dollar buys at the time and fix it. Doesn't actually matter how much gold or silver there is. Right now an ounce of silver is $17. So $1 officially becomes 0.05 ounces of silver. So easy, they killed kennedy for it.

       Back in the day 1oz of gold was tied to $22 USD. If we were to tie gold to the dollar now, 1oz of gold would be $1200 USD. If there's not enough gold in reserve to do that, then we can tie 1oz of gold to $10,000USD. It doesn't matter, the scale is infinite. Doesn't matter how much gold there is.

       So the sun god of pagan worship, Satan, favors our endeavor of a new order of the ages.

       Far from it. The Egyptian trinity is alive and well in many other religious systems today. Father, mother, and son. It's the same system Catholicism uses, and the Bible identifies this as the seat of Satan himself. It is the antichrist system, for antichrist means in place of Christ. They took the trinity and put someone else in Christ's place.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had the same old tricks back then that they do now. It's the same story. Forgetting where we came from has people blind.

       The lessons of history aren't superstitious non-sense. Unfortunately for everyone here, you haven't offered up a lesson of history to judge just yet. That a foolish Christian would label anything he doesn't understand as satanic or occult is evidence of nothing more than a primitive fascist cult-like and superstitious mind.

       You're missing it. These symbols and these gods have always accompanied systems of bondage. They are passed down through the ages by the elites and used to mark their territory and speak with one another. It's not a coincidence they use the same symbols today they used back then, and symbols are only one way of tracing history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occult and satanic are two terms that are misused and misunderstood the most. Occult is secret knowledge... it's a broad term. Satanic is also very broad, as anything that exalts man is satanic by nature. Just because you don't understand the terminology doesn't make it primitive or cult-like... Moreover, refusing to learn what those words actually mean makes your rationale more primitive by accepting popular opinion over documented intentions.

       it is believed to be an occult symbol, not on the seal but is on money
      </p>

       "Today, the Eye of Providence is usually associated with Freemasonry. The Eye first appeared as part of the standard iconography of the Freemasons in 1797, with the publication of Thomas Smith Webb's Freemasons Monitor.[6] Here, it represents the all-seeing eye of God and is a reminder that a Mason's thoughts and deeds are always observed by God (who is referred to in Masonry as the Great Architect of the Universe). Typically, the Masonic Eye of Providence has a semi-circular glory below the eye. Sometimes the Eye is enclosed by a triangle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Popular among conspiracy theorists is the claim that the Eye of Providence shown atop an unfinished pyramid on the Great Seal of the United States indicates the influence of Freemasonry in the founding of the United States. This was dramatized in the 2004 Disney film National Treasure. However, common Masonic use of the Eye dates to 14 years after the creation of the Great Seal. Furthermore, among the members of the various design committees for the Great Seal, only Benjamin Franklin was a Mason (and his ideas for the seal were not adopted). Indeed, many Masonic organizations have explicitly denied any connection to the creation of the Seal.[7][8]"

       It s a seal that symbolizes the progress of Civilization founded on the principles of the Declaration of Independence with no capstone meaning that the project of civilization is forever incomplete. It is a human symbol. Regardless, even if it were an occult symbol, it would be a good one that I would have no problem with. People who are anti-occult symbology are fucking stupid anyways.

       We already know what the origin is, to harp on it for the purpose of fear mongering is moronic and self-defeating. As far as masonry goes, like everything else it is part of our rich heritage as humans and should be celebrated. It's practice has led to many of today's great advances. If you want to demonize something you should demonize the Catholic Church or Israel or Islam.

      <p>
       A picture is worth a 1000 words, a symbol conveys meaning without the need for reading an essay. The Reverse Seal conveys a meaning of a prosperous civilization founded on the principles of the DoI. It portrays that meaning in easy to understand symbology that has been integrated into human academia for thousands of years. The fact that people today are paranoid or fearful of that symbolize nothing more than the deterioration of human culture.

        "  One side of the Great Seal shows an ancient Egyptian pyramid, beneath a triangle containing a glowing eye.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can use its name: the Eye of Providence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The shining eye in the triangle is a certainly a famous and common Masonic symbol, although some Masonic sources prefer to deny this.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No one denies that the symbol of the EoP is used by Freemasonry. What masonic and non-Masonic academic authors all agree on, however, is that the symbol isn't Masonic in origin as it was widely used by Christian groups for centuries before the Fraternity was founded, and that its use in the 18th century by the Fraternity was paralleled by dozens of other groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that the EoP is a Masonic symbol is akin to saying that the peace symbol is a hippy symbol. The latter's use of the symbol is certainly very widely known, but there are dozens of other places that the symbol is used that have nothing to do with hippies.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The use of the blazing eye in the triangle motif, surrounded by rays of light, in the official seal of the Ordo Templi Orientis, confirms the occult significance of this symbol.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, it confirms that the OTO latched onto the most prominent symbols of the day in order to lend a universal feel to their ideas.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        . . . It is difficult to elucidate the full meaning of the symbols in the official Great Seal of the United States

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are various interpretations in the public domain, but the truth is known only to initiated insiders. What is most important in the context of this article is that these are ancient religious symbols which hold special hidden significance

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is nothing hidden about the meaning of the EoP.

       First, the canned answer:

       <a href="http://tetrahedralmason.blogspot.com/2014/07/everything-wrong-with-freemasonry.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically the section, "Claim: Masons don't learn the real secrets until the "upper levels"/33rd degree/etc."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to answer more personally: I'm a Master Mason within the Grand jurisdiction of Massachusetts. There is no "level" beyond that. I have great respect for those who have been elected to some office within Freemasonry, but that's an office, not a rank. If I met the Grand Master of Masons in Massachusetts on the street, an appropriate greeting would be, "hello, Brother."
      </p>
      <p>
       We have many appendant organizations. Hundreds of them communicate degrees. But it would be a mistake to assume that any one of them is a "higher" degree than Master Mason.

       The Illuminati were dead and gone over 200 years ago. They continued on into the 19th century only as a set of notions about the role of Fraternal organizations in general, and the only place that that idea really took root was in France (where Fraternal organizations are deeply and publically involved in politics... which is one of the reasons that the Fraternal organizations such as Freemasonry, in the rest of the world are none to friendly with those in France.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Whenever a non-Mason says something like "the higher degrees," Freemasons generally just roll their eyes. It's more or less a meaningless phrase, as everyone learns when they join.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three degrees in Freemasonry and one rank: Master Mason. We cherish the notion of equality among our members.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...are aware of it
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, obviously they aren't the only ones. It's a super-secret kept only by the most influential and well-hidden members of our Fraternity and never glimpsed by the rank and file. No on knows... except for every blogger on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope. It's just an echo chamber of conspiracy theories that people like to whisper in each other's ears. The old, "I hear from a guy..."

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       I'm sure there's plenty that's hidden in every group of 3 or more people in the world. Freemasons are people and people have things they don't share with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the notion that there's one big Secret out there that is a) a dark and sinister (e.g. non-Masonic) plot b) known only to some mysterious "senior group" of Freemasons and c) never discovered by the rank and file Mason but d) known by every

       i appreciate your response, but i believe "the Illuminati" or whatever it's called (or maybe they no longer call themselves anything) does still exist,  but that's just what i think is true, from what i've read &amp; interviews; which of course doesn't
