    <div class="md"><p>Which vaccines are legally mandated in the USA today?</p>

<p>There are certainly some that you must have if you want to take advantage of publicly funded things, like public school. But that&#39;s different from legally mandated. You can forego the vaccines if you are also willing to forego public schooling.</p>

<p>But can anyone name one that they either hold you down and force into you or fine or imprison you if you don&#39;t take?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, this is exactly what he was referring to. it is mandated for parents to vaccinate their children before they attend public school. and to that end, they often give children vaccines on the day they are born, and several times throughout childhood.</p>

<p>this is a legal trap in a sense, though... if you don&#39;t vaccinate your kid he can&#39;t go to public school. and if you don&#39;t homeschool him or find a school that accepts his lack of vaccines, and still refuse to vaccinate him, you will go to jail. but if you ignore this, there is no other legally enforced vaccine requireemnt.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No. I referenced this elsewhere. It&#39;s not mandatory. It&#39;s a requirement if the parent wants to send their snowflake to public schools. Public schools aren&#39;t a requirement though, so the vaccination isn&#39;t a requirement.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t vaccinate, home school, all set.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...eventually lost custody or faced charges of some kind...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have seen cases of lost custody and manslaughter/murder where parents refused medical treatment to their kids (for religious reasons) and the kid subsequently died of a curable illness. I have never seen one for a decision not to vaccinate. (In the USA.) Do you have any links to any news articles for such a case?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they&#39;re not exactly required past a certain age. i got the vaccines for elementary school and all that, before i was self-aware of course. but halfway through high school they demanded everybody get a whooping cough vaccine, and that was the one everybody was flipping out about causing paralysis and brain damage. i thought the studies were legit, at least more legit than the fucking autism claims, so i decided to not get the vaccine and just see what happened.</p>

<p>they really tried to hassle me into getting the vaccine, and it was pretty twisted. they kicked me out of school for a full week before notifying me that i had an option to not take the vaccine. they sent me a form, finally, after calling them several times over a week, which was like an &quot;appeal request.&quot; when i received it, i realized that it only gave two &quot;excuses&quot; for not taking the vaccine. i could either attach a doctor&#39;s note explaining why my &quot;medical condition&quot; made me unable to take the vaccine; or i could explain my &quot;religious convictions&quot; that make me unable to take the vaccine. in other words, you weren&#39;t allowed to have a valid scientific reason for not wanting to have a foreign substance injected into your arm. your only valid excuse could be a medical disorder or a religious delusion.</p>

<p>that really drove home the point, i think, they were trying to send. this idea that there is no scientific resistance to vaccination. that you&#39;re only allowed to resist it if you&#39;re a sheep, or if you medically have to. it blew my mind... i eventually just sacked up and wrote a bunch of religious bullshit.</p>

<p>so point is they don&#39;t mandate all of them, but they sure try to make you <em>think</em> that they&#39;re required. it took them a whole week to even tell me that i had an option... and that whole time i was &quot;unenrolled&quot; from public school. pretty bizarre stuff. i also didn&#39;t have to get any new vaccinations to go to college. they supposedly demand that you get booster shots every 5 years or something, but i haven&#39;t had a vaccine in over 10 years, and my college didn&#39;t require anything of me.</p>
