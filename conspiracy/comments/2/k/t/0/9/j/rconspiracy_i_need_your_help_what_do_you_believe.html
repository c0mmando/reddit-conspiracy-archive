       I am giving my final persuasive speech in a university speaking class on the topic of 9/11. I have gotten spent hours researching this topic further all in the name of school work which is nice but I just can't  decide the best angle of attack for this speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first my goal was to persuade the audience that the official story of 9/11 is false. Because of the sheer volume of convincing information on the topic I have switched to merely trying to persuade the audience to do their own research by watching one of the many great documentaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The speech can only be 10 minutes and I'm having trouble picking out the MOST damming evidence against the 9/11 commissions report. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

       I think the footage of the collapse of the towers themselves. This is especially true for tower number 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend that you find some footage of demolitions gone wrong. Even better if there's any demolitions experts talking about how easy it is for a building to go over on it's side if the explosives aren't set just right.... or if the timing is off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then show the footage of how
       <em>
        perfectly
       </em>
       Tower 7 collapses into it's own footprint. That would make one hell of a lead off, or ending.

       I find the numerous initial on-the-street, as-it-happened eyewitness reports from firefighters, police, news reporters  et al of "a second explosion" and "another explosion" the most compelling argument for a pre-wired controlled demolition.

      <p>
       Then there's building 7, (insured for 10X its value by the new owner, Larry Silverstein, who'd signed the lease only four months before,) which contained the SEC and IRS records that might have implicated those who made money shorting the involved airlines just before the attacks.

       Don't mention anything about science! It's a circle jerk starter. Make the speech about
       <strong>
        government transparency
       </strong>
       . The first 2 minutes should be about how it's important for a democracy to know the truth otherwise how can you vote correctly? Bring up Snowden. Get everyone to agree with you on one point before ever even mentioning 911. That way you already have them affirming other things you have said. And then if government transparency is impotant.... BAM:
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 28 pages of 911 evidence that prove Saudi Arabia was behind the whole operation. Not only was this information available at the time of the commission report but it was actively covered up and 2 congressman on the 911 Commission quit over it:
       <a href="http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/">
        http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a video of Senator Massie talking about what he read:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItE28oeMnas">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItE28oeMnas
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This way the presentation is about whether or not we should be able to see classified information that changes our view of history not about whether or not 911 is an inside job or not (indirectly make it about 911, not directly). It's about whether government transparency is vital to democracy. If it is, then Saudi Arabia did 911. If transparency isn't important, go on believing the
       <em>
        official
       </em>
       conspiracy theory.

       3 monstrous building fall straight down, 2 of them hit in the side by aircraft, 1 not. That means 1 plane took 2 buildings down into their own footprint.

       The physics do not work out debris large enough to structurally damage wtc7 to fly that far.  Jet fuel will cause a huge fireball, but can't explode huge chunks all the way from the towers to wtc7. The only way for that to happen is if you believe that explosive charges were in placed in the towers.

       Girders weighing several tons were launched as far as 300 yards. That's 3 football fields. I want you to go to the top of the tallest building you can find and drive a golf ball, I bet you can't drive it 300 yards. The amount of energy required to launch debris that far could only have come from explosives. The pancake theory is patently absurd.

       Because it didn't.  The central cores of both towers were engineered to hold up both towers.  These undamaged cores were magically dissolved to dust.  Concrete reinforced with steel.  Only high pressure explosives is capable of this.  Not a phony collapse or "raging" office fires.

       Definitely talk about the lack of overall evidence. The lack of plane parts at the Pentagon and the 2 mile spread of parts at Shanksville, the lack of SOS calls from the cockpits but recorded cell phone calls from passengers, and the lack of CCTV recordings of the hijackers at the largest US airports.
      </p>

       Most people only remember (or rather "never forget") the Twin Towers so focus on WTC7 for NY, especially the fact that it fell hours later. The footage is a must if it's a multimedia presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the main Towers, don't get caught up in the jet fuel argument, most people will lose interest and just assume cutting a hole in the building will knock it down into itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mention some statistics about the NIST investigation (lack of funding, delayed report, no steel recovered from WTC7).

       I would start by explaining the immense impact this event has had on the U.S. and the world (wars, policies, liberties, freedoms, etc). Explain what made you distrust the official story. Don't mention anything about what you really think happened, nobody knows this answer and it doesn't help your argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can explain the sensitivity of the subject and how even mentioning it sparks controversy and often censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you can reveal some of the interesting facts/anomolies of the event that are not widely known (WTC7, insider trading, larry silverstein, patriot act size and release date, 9/11 commission vs things like Clinton scandal investigation, bush/cheney not wanting to testify on the record, eye witnesses, testimonies, architects and engineers, stats about what the rest of the world thinks, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever you do, stay away from conjecture and stick to what you know to be true. Your goal should be to convince the audience that it is important to question the official version of history as it has been wrong many times in the past (you can give examples). Also don't point them towards videos on youtube. In fact, warn them of the many shitty videos/sites out there that only discredit questioning the official story.

       I'd mention the 5 "dancing Israelis" who had cameras up and ready to go over 30 minutes before the first plane hit. This is foreknowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same company (Urban Moving Systems--an Israeli intelligence front) owned a bunch of white vans. Later on the 11th, one of these vans was found parked underneath the GW Bridge with enough explosives inside to easily take out the bridge. The owner of UMS (Dominic Suter) fled to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the Gomel Chesed Cemetery incident--when a Jewish man collecting ivy saw limos coming, hid, and heard a conversation between two men in suits in plain Hebrew who said "The Americans will know what terror is when we hit the Twins in September." The man who heard this went to the FBI with descriptions, plates...basically brought them a case on a platter. The FBI would NOT talk to him. He attempted three or four times.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, know that it was an Israeli op, helped GREATLY by sayanim in our own government and a corrupt, incompetent executive branch.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my firm opinion, being in the building trades once, that WTC I and II were wired, literally, from day one. A gas-tube explosive initiator (gas-filled det cord and kind-of-like the fuses used by Wile E Coyote--called
       <em>
        fire fuses
       </em>
       ) would allow the explosives/det system to remain stable for a LONG time with no chance of radio signals or static to pre-initiate the detonation timing sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was on site when the second tower was built and things got STRANGE. First of all--I have never seen more ARMED guards around a construction project. It was weird. They STILL hung, say, the generators from cranes, took tools home, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the guards cared more about the construction
       <em>
        materials
       </em>
       ? I remember a BIG flap when they started rotating out old rebar for fresh. The old was coated, the new not--just rust-colored like all rebar. They used (and called it) "high perf" rebar--3" but coated with a sandy black material we were told was primer. On rebar??? You see this SAME rebar stand as the concrete around it crumbles 80 stories up in video of the second (first hit) tower going down. And there it stood--like a bad lie until another explosion a few seconds later finally took it down. Why didn't THAT rebar turn to dust? Notice how nearly ALL of the debris that was left were 40 foot (or under) sections? The perfect length to fit in a truck. Nice. Then the crime scene was destroyed, the steel sold at a loss to China, and that shit was GONE--poof, like that. Since WHEN does ANY law enforcement group advocate destroying a crime scene? May as well ask--since WHEN do steel-framed skyscrapers fall? The answer? Never--except on that day where rationality, truth, and physics were suspended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the power-down (unprecedented in the history of the WTC) a short time before the demolition day. This allowed all systems to be checked AGAIN, and the more sensitive explosives to be put in. It also disabled ALL security including locks, card readers, and cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've now been on 6 CD sites (physical sites) and have NEVER seen debris ejected laterally from a building by more than a foot or two unless the job was botched. The explosions on 9/11 ejected material over 400 feet laterally and turned high-performance concrete (both lightweight and aggregate), people, STEEL, office furniture, and computers into 100-micron DUST.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "pre-wired" thing is just a theory of mine...the rest is 100% true and footnoted all over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck. Go to bollyn.com and download "9/11--The Deception That Changed the World." Its free and HEAVILY footnoted with information that is NOT Kosher-approved but true nonetheless.

       Check out this quote from the statement of Robert Parrish Sr.--who worked in the onsite lab analyzing concrete pours:
      </p>
      <p>
       "One day, as the lead consultant engineer was in my lab talking just about "stuff", I asked him, "Sometime in future, in 50 years or so, how are these Twin Towers are going to be taken down as tall as they were going to be and as tight as land is in a crowded city, without causing fast destruction to other buildings?"

       He was standing upright. He outstretched his right arm with his palm down. And said, "Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam" as he lowered his hand down one imaginary floor at a time. All the way down to the floor. I knew that we had to certify these commutators to be able to operate continuously for 50 years without service or repair as our part of the contract. He explained that as the buildings are being built, explosive charges are being incorporated into the structures at key floor joint locations. So, that when the first charges are set-off at the top floors, they will take that floor down to the next. And the charges at that floor will take it down to the next floor. This will continue all the way down. The Twin Towers will come straight down like a stack of pancakes. When the buildings get old and no longer useful or profitable to have and maintain, all it will take is a phone call to take them down."

       About the only bit of solid evidence we have is the Dancing Israelis. They indicate Israeli involvement in the 9-11 terrorist attacks. Either the Israelis helped plan and fund the attacks, or at the very least they had solid intelligence that they were going to occur and did not give that information to American authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another highly suggestive fact is that most of the terrorists were Saudis. This suggests that the attacks were Saudi run and financed, at least in part. The way the high-level members of the Saudi royal family were spirited out of the US immediately following the attacks also suggests this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Israeli involvement for sure, and very possibly Saudi government or royal family involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything else -- the absurd theories about planted explosives, the idea that Bush or Cheney knew before hand -- all that is wild speculation and unsupported by facts or common sense.

       A lot of people
       <em>

       kept silent about it. There are numerous first-person accounts of shady goings on in the WTC complex in the weeks preceding the attacks.

       All you know is that he disagrees with the official story. YOu have no idea what 'his conspiracy theory' is or how many people would have to be kept silent. This is a strawman and I hate to see people always throwing it around. If you think this is true you need to give us some specifics because I can think of a lot of ways to execute it without having to keep very many people silent. It can mostly be done through division of labor, lying and the fact that the government works on a need to know basis.

       look up "SCI" compartmentalization of sensitive information. if you tell 10 people how something is going to go down, then 10 people know your plan. if you tell each of those 10 people ONLY a portion of your plan, but not ALL of it, you end up with 10 people who each know a little bit, and for whom there are most assuredly VERY compelling reasons to NOT dig for info / discuss the event with the others.
