       Does it not irritate you a little bit when someone is presenting an argument and they hold TPTB responsible? And then don't bother to explain exactly who is responsible?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean who specifically are you talking about? A certain government, a certain corporation, a certain individual, the Bilderberg  group, the
       <em>
        Illuminati
       </em>
       , the Freemasons, the
       <em>
        Reptilians
       </em>
       , the MSM etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       To simply say, "the TPTB are responsible", seems like an intellectual cop out, no?

       Yes, it is. Not much different than "they" or "them". I think the problem is that there is no solid proof of who is actually in control of what. For example, I am confident the Rothschild group is a major global puppeteer, but are they directly causing police corruption? Probably not.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is simply easier for someone to raise an allegation without getting tied up in the semantics of who precisely is behind it.

       Pretending like this sub doesn't continually call out specific crooks and villains.

       We say the TPTB as a broad sweeping generalization for those that would like to continue the status quo.

       I use it as a catchall for the forces acting against prudence and altruism in whatever given context. TPTB when discussing the middle east are the political zionists, TPTB when talking about fracking are the domestic energy companies and the us govt, TPTB re: QE are the SEC, morganchase and that whole order..

       It is sometimes a bit difficult to pin down who is responsible. I would say "follow the money" often leads one to the element of the 1% who would benefit from a specific event or issue. The reality is that much of the discussion on here is speculation and it is almost impossible to be specific because we are all making educated guesses.

       In light of this then, I feel it would be honest to explicitly state the lack of completion in ones own argument. Rather than to simply cite TPTB as if that is all one needs to say on the matter.

       Hydra has many heads and the further you dig the harder it is to see the whole beast. You may never find the leaders. Just more layers of underlings. Those out in front are uber rich families that are all related to each other. Likely for the western head are some Italian families with historical names. Their underlings are heads of banks (including Ashkenazi Jews), oil, industry and random billionaires. Most of the 300 richest families work for the same structure of control. Who their leaders, the real ones behind the curtain, are may never be publicly known. That being said is still only on our dimension of existence.

       I don't give a shit if you don't believe the Bible, "TPTB" believe and it's the enemy of God that they obey, not the enemy of Allah or Buddha or Krishna, but the enemy of the God of the Bible. Get on your knees and start praying, because no amount of action towards these men will change their plan, you have to reach the root of the problem and only God can intervene. So suck up your pride and plead God to stop the actions of evil.

       Agreed. TPTB are the forces of evil, period. It's no cop-out and there is no identifying a principle as a person. There are many involved and most evil people truly believe they are working for the greater good. They are deceived just as much as the sleeping masses.
      </p>

       The Bible knows what's up and God has protected it through the ages. There's no way such a 'blasphemous' text toward the Pope and all the other powers in the world would survive unless God had something to do with it.

       You either are granted eternal life or damnation. There is no eternal damnation, for this is eternal life and is paradoxical to the quandary. You live or you die, you don't live forever in two ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Bible, there are two definitions of hell. One is the grave - the state of sleep until judgment. The other is the eternal fire, burning until everything is consumed. Death results in the grave, and the judgment results in eternal life or destruction... that is, eternal destruction, the same as before you lived after death.

       One good resource on the Biblical doctrine of hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is wishful thinking to believe that no matter what you do, you get to live forever in either a good or bad state of being. This doesn't make sense at all with the nature of the Biblical God. You will not be tortured into eternity, you will be damned unto eternity... meaning you will not exist anymore forever. Hellfire will consume you as fuel and burn unto it's conclusion with only the righteous being safe from the flame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kid yourself all you want... But do you really think everyone lives forever? This is new age slander. If everyone lives forever no matter what then it makes no difference whether you sin or not.

       How is it not a paradox? If you are blessed with eternal life unto heaven or hell, you are blessed with eternal life period. This is not Biblical whatsoever. Only the righteous obtain eternal life.

       You are aware the Biblical  Christian God you speak of is purely another retelling of a pagan sungod story aren't you? It was quite clearly a fabricated religion created for control. How can you be in this sub, be so critical of every other lie we are told in life and yet blindly accept a magic story?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really believe the universe was created 6000 years ago my a magical mind reading energy being that lives in another dimension? And this same energy being created a human deity hybrid to save the universe by an evil magic called sin that this same trans dimensional energy being created? Do you know who would believe that story? Pagans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christian religion is a big business like any other, no different from big banks.

       "retelling of a pagan sun-god story"? Not really, junior. There is no account of Adam, Exodus and Moses, David &amp; Goliath and the other 99% of the Bible in those "texts". Just because there are similarities and blatant plagiarism as to the story of Christ and the virgin birth in pagan lore does not make them the same story.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes critical thinking to believe in a higher power. Flies don't believe in God, nor does any other animal in the animal kingdom. Do you know why? Because they don't have the mental capacity for such.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has never been a time where religion has not been present on Earth. Atheists are always the minority because people would rather follow those outside the insane asylum rather than those in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Denying God reduces your thought process to that of an insane primate. "Devolving" much are we? LOL

       I must admit I'm a little confused, you admit that Christianity is "blatant plagiarism," and yet you still have faith in the Christian God?

      <p>
       The fact that flies don't believe in God does not prove a deity created the universe. It's true that we are the only species on this planet able to contemplate the origin of our existence, but we are also the only species able to research that question and figure it out.

       I know you have a strong faith and don't want to admit the flaws in your beliefs, I was raised in a religious household as well. Sometimes real courage comes from admitting what you have always believed is wrong, and changing opinions based on facts and evidence.

       Garden of Eden:
In the Persian scriptures of the Zoroastrians, the Avesta tells the story of how Ormuzd created the world and the first two humans in six days and then rested on the seventh. The names of these two human beings were Adama and Evah. These texts date back as far as the 10th century B.C.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a lot of evidence that the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the oldest recorded texts in human history, had an influence on the biblical creation story. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells the story of a man, Enkidu, who was created from the earth by a god. He lives amongst the animals in a natural paradise until he is tempted by a woman, Shamhat. He accepts food from this woman and is forced to leave the place where he lives after becoming aware of his own nakedness. Later in the epic, he encounters a snake which steals a plant of immortality from him. Obviously, there are a lot of parallels between this story and the Graden of Eden from the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flood:
A man is warned of an imminent flood by a god and is instructed to build a large boat in order to survive. The dimensions of the boat are 120 cubits; the building materials are wood, pitch, and reeds; and there are six decks. After the flood, the boat lands on a mountaintop where the man sends out a series of birds to find dry land. He eventually lets all the people and animals free and sacrifices to the god that saved him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now although these details sound like they were taken directly from the book of Genesis, you’d find the same information in the story of Utnapishtim, found in the Epic of Gilgamesh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moses and Ten Commandments:
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Bible, the Ten Commandments were given to Moses on Mount Sinai, and were written on stone tablets, allegedly by the hand of God himself. This was thought to take place around 1490 B.C. However when one examines chapter 125 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead(around 2600 B.C.), it seems he may have had a little help. The Egyptian Book of the Dead reads like the Ten Commandments written in the Negative Confession. Some examples are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Book of the Dead: “I have not blasphemed.”
Exodus 20:7: “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Book of the Dead: “I have not committed adultery, I have not lain with men.”
Exodus 20:14: “Thou shalt not commit adultery.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Book of the Dead: “I have not stolen.”
Exodus 20:15: “Thou shalt not steal.”
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also some similarity between the story of the Ten Commandments and the Code of Hammurapi, dated around 1772 B.C.
      </p>

       I think you missed the part where the Bible was written long after the stories it rebooted. Those dates come from people far smarter than you or I.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you could give me a couple dates. You seem like a fundamentalist, I'm assuming you take the Bible literally and believe in a young Earth? Around 6000 years old?

       No "they" didn't, dude. The same way God used Mary to bring the Son of Man to Earth, God used his prophets to speak through them. Just because men wrote the Bible, it doesn't make them the authors.

       I don't believe in God because there is no measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning which suggest that such a deity exists.

       Your own personal denial of the supernatural does not make it false. It's your own opinion that denies the experience.

      <p>
       I've never been to England, but people who have been there tell me it exists. I have every right to deny it because I have no proof myself it exists.

      <p>
       See how that works? You can't deny it just because you haven't looked for proof, instead you expect others to provide it for you. Not even science works like that.

       Maybe someday science will catch up with God and prove his existence. A 2000 year old book is older than any scientific method, and science still hasn't been able to prove the divine, not because it doesn't exist, but because God operates outside the realm of what science considers possible.

       The history of the scientific method can be traced back to at least 1600 BC with the Egyptian medical textbook, the

       The Bible's first writing were 3500 years ago, Moses lived between 1500 and 1300 BC, though he recounts events in the first eleven chapters of the Bible that occurred long before his time.

       Perhaps not, but it may be able to, and is actively trying to, explain life, reality, the universe and how we came to be. If science can show how this all happened and why it happened, with verifiable evidence that doesn't need God, then that in itself will disprove the existence of God. Science does not need to set out to disprove God's existence, it will be incidental to scientific progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently science cannot answer the questions as to why life began on earth or where the first single cell came from, or what happened before the big bang. But, the scientific community has revealed so much about the nature of reality and the universe, so much more than religion and the divine has. And that community is not going to stop, it's on the verge.

       It's not blind faith. It's reasonable because of the demonstrable results and inventions science has provided for us. For example, the technology we are using to have this conversation, mobile phones, the microwave oven, GPS and other satellite technology, the car that I drive, the planes in which we fly, the medicine which has extended our life's and will continue to do so, the devastating diseases that have been cured, and all of the wonderful things made possible by science which has given us the world we see around us today.

        But where is the experimental evidence? None exists in the literature claiming that one species has been shown to evolve into another. Bacteria, the simplest form of independent life, are ideal for this kind of study, with generation times of 20 to 30 minutes, and populations achieved after 18 hours. But throughout 150 years of the science of bacteriology, there is no evidence that one species of bacteria has changed into another, in spite of the fact that populations have been exposed to potent chemical and physical mutagens and that, uniquely, bacteria possess extrachromosomal, transmissible plasmids. Since there is no evidence for species changes between the simplest forms of unicellular life, it is not surprising that there is no evidence for evolution from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells, let alone throughout the whole array of higher multicellular organisms.

       Ah, you have just shown the beauty of science with that quote, which was written by an evolutionary biologist BTW. The beauty that is to constantly question in order to strengthen the validity of scientific results.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man who wrote that quote, Niles Eldrege, does not disagree with evolution in theory, all he disagrees with is the  gene-centric view of evolution and how evolution actually played out. He still believes we evolved from a common ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
       That quote was taken out of a book. I suggest you read it to better understand where the author was coming from. He is an evolutionist

       Trust me, no evolutionary biologist out there is disputing when evolution began (over 3 billion years ago) and where (deep in the ocean), and who by (single cellular organism).

       Even the Pope agrees with the theory of evolution and the big bang. Granted, as to who created the big bang and started evolution, sure, he would say God. But only up until science can answer those questions.

       Look into synthetic biology, the human body is being looked at more like technology everyday. DNA is just code waiting to be hacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is currently a convergence between computer science and biology that you ought to look into, it's fascinating stuff. Humans are literally creating life and playing God as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend watching

        this
       </a>
       documentary for and introductory overview.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're right, science is not comparable to religion, but none the less it is a method of enquiry which can answer the questions that religion purports to have already answered. E.g. the nature of reality, where life came from and the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, science is not based on faith or belief. Due to its bold objectives in answering the aforementioned questions, It's my view, as well as most of the scientific community's, that assuming science continues in its current trajectory, that science will one day answer these questions with observable and verifiable evidence which is repeatable by any other researcher on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it continues to do this, religion will, as it has been far at least the last 500 years, recede from society as science will provide the information which humans desire most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the key point to note, it will be incidental to greater scientific progress. Because, as you have rightly pointed out, science stays as far away from faith and belief as possible.

       No, but it has answered this non-exhaustive list of questions below. And if science does continue to make more enquiries, one could only imagine that science is simply going to get better at unmasking the mysteries of life and the universe.
      </p>

        What is the universe made of? 2. What makes us human? 3. Why do we dream? 4. Why do we sleep? 5. What are humans made of? 6. How does gravity behave? 7. What makes the tides go in and out? 8. Why is the sky blue? 9. How old is Earth? 10. How do magnets work? 11. What causes a rainbow? 12. What are clouds made of? 13. Why does water evaporate at room temperature? The list is pretty much endless.

       Side note, imagine the possibility of discoveries scientists are going to make by conducting experiments in machines like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. We have already discovered the Higgs Boson, the once theorised and elusive particle that gives all other particles mass. And that machine has not even been used to its fullest potential yet. Fascinating stuff.

       "The number of intermediate varieties which have formerly existed on earth must be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links?
       <strong>
        Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain
       </strong>
       ; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory." -

       That quote was written some 150 years ago. We now have a lot more examples of these "intermediate links". Here's a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transitional_fossils">
        list
       </a>
       that is by no means complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also worth pointing out that, technically speaking, every fossil is a transitional form. But the list above shows the "interesting" ones, like the transition between dinosaurs and birds or the link between fish and amphibians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution doesn't depend on Darwin being right about everything. He was wrong about a lot of things; off the top of my head, he thought that domesticated dogs were descended from multiple wild species, when we know now that they are all descended from grey wolves.

       You should have kept reading with that Darwin quote.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory.
        <strong>
         The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Edit: In addition to that, answers concerning modern developments in evolutionary theory that help to resolve such problems, you should also know that Darwin himself offered explanations to subvert such objections. In the Origin of Species, he included an entire chapter on difficulties with the theory (chapter 6). In addition, he included another chapter on the subject of your quote: the imperfection of the fossil/geological record (chapter 9). Darwin did not shy from the difficulties, and explicitly acknowledged what he thought were the strongest arguments against his reasoning and theoretical foundation. Nevertheless, the conclusion he drew was roughly the same as the one accepted today (albeit without all of the advances in genetics, etc. that have come since): that adaptations and the origin of new species are largely the result of gradual, continuous change due to natural selection.

       , this is the most obvious evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me try and be a little more specific, remember I'm not an evolutionary biologist. My background is in the social sciences unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The fossil record is the most obvious evidence of the organic chain of evolution
       </strong>
       . In the last 30 or so years,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics">
        phylogenetics
       </a>
       has also become a powerful piece of evidence. The wiki article is pretty confusing. Phylogenetics establishes evolutionary links by looking at genetic similarities between different species. It's more quantitative than comparing morphologies of different fossils. Now, we can look at the DNA of reptiles compared to humans, and say "OK this genetic material clearly came from a common ancestor." It's allowed scientists to detangle strange family trees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the evolution from bacteria to man didn't happen over night. It took at least 3 billion years.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are getting caught up on Darwin though. Read this carefully,
       <strong>
        evolution does not depend on physical evidence of the organic chain of evolution, not with the mountain of fossil evidence.
       </strong>
       Refer to the link above.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also does not depend on Darwin being right about everything.
       <strong>
        Darwin's understanding of evolution knew nothing about genes or the complex mechanisms of genetic heredity. Mendel's pea hybrid experiments were effectively lost when Darwin was writing. The very fact that Mendel's independent experiments verified Darwin's overall concepts support evolution, in particular, the idea that descent with modification leads to variation and eventually new species.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is simply so much for you to debunk. By all means try though, it would be groundbreaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: You are free to refute all of these points. But if you don't want to because you believe they are nonsense, then do explain why they are nonsense. And the best way to do that, would be to refute them.

       Now let me ask you a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim that all the mysteries of life and the universe are answered in the bible, but that bible was written by man thousands of years ago. What are the sources for the bibles claims?

       You must not forget though that the discipline of evolutionary biology is not finished. Why would it be?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fossil record is not complete and there are still inconsistencies to resolve.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the mountain of evidence already obtained, which can be seen in books like the ones cited earlier, proves beyond a doubt the age of the earth and how life started deep in the oceans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that is being disputed is exactly how evolution played out.

       Remember to not have faith, and to turn to the rigorous experimentational methods of science is to also except that there is still much to discover and learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where as people of faith have already accepted scripture and have all the answers which satisfy them. Which I have no problem with by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just seem to be relying on the fact that science is yet to uncover all of the mysteries of life and the universe as if that means it must be wrong. How can anyone explain these mysteries over night?
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible claims to have the answers. But where is the proof that the bible is actually the word of God?

       After all he wants what's best for us, right? If he was I'm sure he'd sort out who's running his world into oblivion pretty damn quick.

       Have you ever read the whole thing to actually know what's in it, or do you always let people do the thinking for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Thou shalt not kill" is a Commandment. Remember that one? Of course not, the Internet told you otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sucks to have read 10 pages and already consider yourself an expert. Imagine if your school only taught you 10 pages of every book, or cherry picked pages it thinks are the most important to use as reference.

       I can't even stand to hold the damn book knowing what it's done to it's followers and society. No, I've never read the whole thing and never will. I've had society try to jam it damn my throat all my life however, so I've got the gist of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since I was a child I knew it was bullshit. When church shows came on after cartoons, my brother and I would pretend that actively listening would kill us and that the longer the show was on the more programmed and brainwashed we'd become. We'd slowly crawl up to the TV and change the channel while we "fought" against the power of the church that was trying to stop us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, like him realized that it was all garbage and was for people that needed to substitute artificial meaning into their lives. We had meaning, our parents loved us, we loved them and we had fun playing all day just being who we were, not who the church wanted us to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to believe in something, what's wrong with believing in yourself? You accuse me of letting others think for me, all the while you've done nothing but spout off fairy tales from the bible and encourage praying for salvation both of which are glowing examples of letting others think for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever happened to being good for goodness sake? I don't need a book to tell me not to kill or steal, it's common sense.

       Your whining because someone misused a text to fool you doesn't make the Bible wrong, it makes them wrong and makes you an idiot for believing them instead of educating yourself about what's really in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were too gullible to believe other people's interpretations, the Bible has no fault.
      </p>

       The Bible doesn't teach you not to kill, it teaches you how to be saved after you die, being good is a consequence.

       You're too far gone man. Nobody's fooled me, you're the one who's been had. You believe on faith alone what's been told to you by someone else. There isn't a shred of evidence that supports anything in the bible.

       This happens every single time I put one of you bible thumping idiots in their place. I challenge your faith and you resort to petty name calling because suddenly the wallpaper starts peeling off the jebus suite and you start to see the shit hole that it was covering up. It scares you, I understand. It's hard to go through life having to think for yourself and make your own decisions without your life manual telling you what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said in an earlier comment, they got you too young. Religion is now a core part of who you are and always will be, there's no changing it. 
It's a shame that the church preys upon the young in such a way but I guess it's just business, jebus needs money after all.

       Yeah, the pope's also an idolater and thinks Mary is a saint, none of which is sustained in the Bible. Argument from authority much? "The Pope said so". Fucking brilliant!

        No, that's not how it works. You can't ever prove something you think doesn't exist that it doesn't exist. Proving a negative is a fallacy.

       Are you an expert in evolutionary biology? Have you made it your life's work to understand such a discipline?

        "Big Bang" - created space dust, which clumped and "formed planets". So if we go back far enough, do you think we came from space dust? See that spec of dust on the ground? Humans came from that? Are you serious? Spare me the "makes more sense than sky god", because it doesn't and it's plain impossible in any realm of physics. Minerals do not become organic in any given space of time.

       Once again, technology is not regarded as faith so it bears no comparison with religion.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Humans are literally creating life and playing God as a result.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But who created humans? Science? Nope.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        but none the less it is a method of inquiry

       Which has not reached a conclusion, therefore has no credibility.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Again, science is not based on faith or belief.
       </p>
       <p>
        Due to its bold objectives in answering the aforementioned questions
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It has not answered the question of life, ever.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        that science will one day answer these questions

      <p>
       No, it won't.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If it continues to do this, religion will, as it has been far at least the last 500 years, recede from society as science will provide the information which humans desire most.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Assuming it will, but it wont.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        science stays as far away from faith and belief as possible.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So don't use it to base faith on it, and stick to facts: Science has no proof of the origin of life and Bible is older than science
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       it answers the question about the origin of life itself.
