       <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/27/what-would-the-cdc-whistleblower-say-under-oath/">
        Jon Rappoport
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On August 27, CDC researcher William Thompson admitted, through his lawyer, Rick Morgan, that he and his co-authors committed egregious research fraud in 2004.
       </p>
       <p>
        They exonerated the MMR vaccine, in a key published study, claiming it had no connection to autism—when it did.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thompson is listed as an author on many studies, and it’s time to find out whether he committed further fraud.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also participated in a September 26, 2007, CDC press teleconference, “Early Thimerosal [mercury] Exposure [via vaccines] and Neuropsychological Outcomes at 7 to 10 Years.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the teleconference was to assure one and all that mercury in vaccines plays no role in neurological damage to children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here was Thompson’s key comment:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “… regarding the IQ effect, it was difficult to interpret because we found that among girls increasing thimerosal exposure was associated with lower verbal performance. But with boys increasing thimerosal was associated with increased performance IQ. So again, reiterating what Dr. Schuchat said, we interpreted it as random associations that we found by chance…”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That comment is certainly suspect. Writing off, as random, lower verbal performance in girls who had increased exposure to vaccines containing mercury—Thompson should be put under oath to explain himself, in great detail.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it gets worse. Much worse. In a more recent recorded phone call with Brian Hooker, posted at the Autism Media Channel, Thompson reverses himself, and makes several emphatic and powerful points about mercury in vaccines:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “I don’t know why they still give it [a vaccine containing mercury] to pregnant women…that’s the last person I would give mercury to.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thompson’s meaning is clear: mercury in vaccines causes neurological damage to the unborn child. He goes even further:
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “There is biologic plausibility right now to say that thimerosal [mercury in vaccines] causes autism-like features.”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Coming from a CDC insider, these statements tell us a great deal about the huge number of government studies on the “non-connection” between mercury and autism.
       </p>
       <p>
        The need to have Thompson testify to everything he knows about vaccine research at the CDC is pressing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CDC is both a public-relations front for the vaccine industry and a research center. To say that the two roles don’t mesh is a vast understatement.
       </p>
       <p>
        How could the CDC avidly promote vaccines and, at the same time, admit that any of its studies on vaccines raise huge red flags about safety?
       </p>
       <p>
        Answer: it couldn’t.
       </p>
       <p>
        The conflict of interest is overwhelming. On that basis alone, every “scientific statement” the CDC makes about vaccines should be rejected.
       </p>
       <p>
        And on top of all of this, the CDC is in charge of setting the schedule for all childhood vaccines: which vaccines, how many, when they are injected, and with how many follow-up boosters.
       </p>
       <p>
        The very pattern of organization and function of the Agency is blatantly corrupt.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whistleblower Thompson is certainly not the only researcher at the CDC to have seen and participated in fraud. There are others. They are hiding what they know—while huge numbers of children are being damaged by vaccines.
       </p>

       Vaccine shedding is not a myth.  And I'm not an anti vaccine lobbyist (which might actually be a myth).  I'm a vaccine safety activist.  I'm up to date on all vaccinations that I need if I don't plan on traveling outside of the country any time soon.  The difference between me and the pseudointellectuals who claim you must never speak ill of vaccines or you're an antivaxxer, is that I understand that vaccines are not magic.  They are, in most cases, the best option that modern medicine has in preventing many really horrible diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that vaccines are without risk, especially the newest vaccines on the shelf.  All vaccines have a risk associated with them and there has yet to be a single vaccine in history that has been used without incident of serious side effects or even death.  Some have much lower risk than others and often times there are multiple vaccines available for the same virus which individually have different safety records.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the current lawsuit between Merrick and two of their previously employed virologists.  Yes faking data to create the illusion of effectiveness does in fact expose people to risk.  There is also the SV40 virus associated with old polio vaccines, we learned of the risk after many people were already exposed.  The way that we manufacture vaccines is constantly evolving, and with each innovation we have new unknowns.  New suppliers enter the market and have untested safety records, old suppliers have run down manufacturing facilities in third world countries which could provide unsafe product at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a multitude of risks before we ever acknowledge the preservatives used and their possible side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       But shedding is a real thing with many studies having already examined the phenomenon and many published papers that acknowledge it.  Its only a Google search away!
      </p>
      <p>
       So while there may be a debate about the real world risks of vaccine shedding and how serious those risks may or may not be, it is clearly and demonstrably not a myth.

       The immune system knows exactly what it's doing, stay well-nourished and you'll be fine.  The story we get fed is simply a sales-pitch from the pharmaceuticals, in fact it's closer to fear-mongering.  It's all a complete lie, the reality is they want to fiddle about with your immune system, they spin the reels like it's a one-armed-bandit and see if they can induce a highly profitable lifelong autoimmune disease which will leave you dependent on their drugs for life; that's what's really behind the push for vaccination.

        Health care practices vary considerably across Amish communities and from family to family. For a basic overview of this aspect of Amish life, please
        <a href="http://www2.etown.edu/amishstudies/Health.asp">
         see this information
        </a>
        compiled by the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pa.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding vaccinations, "The Amish do vaccinate their children," says Dr. Kevin Strauss, MD, of the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg, Pa., which specializes in addressing the health needs of the Plain population. "Their overall vaccination rate is lower in comparison to the general populace, but you'll find a higher rate of vaccination among younger Amish than in older generations. The bi-weekly vaccination clinic that we run is very busy."
       </p>
       <p>
        Strauss also sees autistic behaviors among the Amish children he treats, "sometimes as a stand-alone condition, but also when the symptoms are one component of a broader medical issue like mental retardation or seizure disorders."
