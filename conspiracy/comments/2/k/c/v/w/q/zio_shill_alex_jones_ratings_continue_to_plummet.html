       He got really lazy with taking days off and putting the b-team in for the weekly shows. He was at his peak around the Piers Morgan incident, then he lost his traction. Him basically worshipping Israel over the summer was the nail in the coffin, even Max Keiser embarrassed him on the issue.

       I agree with you. But as always, the collective effort and what they are investigating or reporting on is never a subject for admiration or respect with some people. The only thing they are interested in is ridiculing Alex as a distraction attack, look at Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, etc -- same thing going on there "Y'aaaarrr a traitor!!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Say something that might make a little sense, or make somebody think twice, and you're suddenly a lightning rod for verbal attacks to deflect attention from the actual story. Just as the media portrays Wikileaks as if the entire collective effort is nothing but Julian Assange. There's a crowd of people who are also unable to see past Alex Jones, and dismiss the contents Infowars reports on the basis that they don't like Alex Jones as a personality.

       Exactly. I know everything that comes out of Jones mouth isn't true. I know to look shit up myself. It's always ad hominem attacks. Never attacks on his arguments. He's a dis info agent? Where's your proof? I hate baseless claims as the burden of proof is on the one who makes the claim

       Could you be more naive? Would corporations voluntarily disband after the government was torn down? The destruction of the government would remove any checks of corporate power that haven't yet been removed. Say goodbye to the 60 hour work week, overtime, minimum wage, health and safety regulations, etc. We would truly be slaves if corporations had total power.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why it is so important that we take back OUR government.

       You know basic economics? Without godvernment there would be no corporations. They only exist because of godvernment regulations. If godvernment were to dissappear tomorrow, all of the corporate power would be lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how small a government starts, it will always turn into what we have today. How would we be slaves? We are slaves under godvernment control because they give so much power to corporations. They have monopolies on most things and fuck small businesses because they can't compete with corporations because of government power

       Back to my original question. Do you think corporations would voluntarily disband if the government were to cease to exist? I can guarantee you that they would not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under that scenario there would no longer be ANY check on corporate power. And yes, I realize that alot of these checks have been dismantled after the corporate coupe d'etat of the US government in the 1980s. But alot of the New Deal policies are still in place. Without these policies US workers would be reduced to working 12 hour shifts (if not more) seven days a week for a pittance (probably less than a dollar a day) in terrible conditions with no health and safety regulations whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dismantling of the government would not reduce corporate power, instead if would increase it 100 fold.

       So I think they would disband? No. But their power would be greatly diminished. The thing is without government like I said before, there would be more competition. More competition equals more jobs and the best products. With the monopoly power corporations have because of government, they are able to under cut the competition and along with Obama care they fuck small businesses. So without that, the small businesses would be able to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would it increase? Without government anyone would be free to start companies to compete with the former corporations. Leading to greater a greater economy for everyone. Have you ever read rothbard?

       Capitalism will lead to monopolization in every industry, as Marx said. It has nothing to do with government. In fact, government regulation is what is keeping capitalism alive as unfettered capitalism is a revolutionary force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Small businesses will not be able to compete with corporations without the government enforcing anti-trust laws. As I said there would no check on their power without government. Meaning corporations could send corporate thugs to kill any competition that could compete with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without government the race to the bottom would be in full swing. Small businesses would not be able to offer their employees a livable wage, decent hours or a safe workplace if it's in competition with amoral corporations who only care about profit.

       How? Capitalism allows free markets. Free markets mean competition. Competition means choice. Choice means competition. They will be competing with each other for the customers money. People will vote with their dollars. If they don't like it, they can go somewhere else and no company would be "to big to fail"

      <p>
       Yes they would. Yes free market capitalism is about profits, but they have to take care of their workers. If not they can go work somewhere else and or people will not go there if conditions are like that. Small businesses would be able to offer a great wage, more people would have  more money to spend. Competition is best for an economy ,not monopolization. That is why I believe free market capitalism is the best form of economy and why I am ancap.

       Capitalism leads to monopoly because the natural, unrestrained market forces will create monopolies from the most successful commercial entities. You can see it the telecom industry for example. There is a oligopoly where a few corporations own the entire infrastructure. Eventually, these corporations will merge until only one stands.

       Obamacare is a right wing healthcare plan that expanded the role of private insurance. I'm not sure what relevance it has to the discussion.  I suppose you are saying that small businesses can't afford the insurance required of them and therefore can't compete. If there was a single payer system like the left actually wanted this would not be a problem.

       These workers would have no choice if the government no longer existed. Look at third world countries as an example. They have no government regulations policing corporations and corporations are in complete control. These workers work in slave like conditions for less than a dollar a day and that is the best job they can get.

       Government = publicly facing arm of international corporations. Government creates and enforces the laws that give corporations power to own and domimate you. If you are in a battle do you ignore the soldiers directly shooting at you? Government is the face of the corporations you want to get at. What is targeting a ceo or executive going to do? They will use the laws the government enforces to shut you down. Change the laws.

       Focusing on changing the laws isn't going to work with the amount of money corporations can anonymously donate to campaigns. Not to mention there is no choice come election time as your only choice is between two right wing parties.

       Focusing on corporations brings attention to corporate malfeasance and puts pressure on them through public shaming.

       My point to begin with is that banks and corporations are the ones controlling government behind the scenes and I don't think I've ever heard Alex Jones mention this. It's always the vague "globalists".

       Then you aren't listening. How much clearer can he be? The guy has literally been laying out a plan of mass extermination for 20 years. The globalists use corporations as a logistical arm of coercion. Same with the government. Globalists is a label for those entities that are pushing the agenda. Corporations and government are their tools. Go after whatever you want. Love him or hate him aj hasn't failed to cover any of it.

       In the "conspiracy theory community" you're going to have a lot of people who are so dissilusioned that they believe everything is a black and white conspiracy.  Alex Jones is probably one of them, as are the people who think Alex Jones is a shill.
      </p>

       I think alex jones would probably be a confidential informant because he likely has some extremist fans . If I were him,  I'd want to turn over the real wackos to the fbi.

       Yes he does call out Israel. I'm not one of the guys who thinks everything is conspiracy but I have an open mind on everything. I don't think he's a shill, just someone who is passionate about what he does maybe a little crazy, but being passionate and being a little crazy go hand in hand in my opinion

       Yes. If you listen to Alex Jones for any length of time, you will see that he does not tolerate any dispute or contradiction or disagreement. It's his way or the highway.  If any of his crew ever tried to put out a story that he personally had issues with, they would be gone, and they know it. They are there to be his puppets, nothing more. They have less freedom of expression than the talking heads on CNN.

       I seldom listen to Alex Jones any more (I used to be a daily listener), but when the B-team comes on, I just turn off immediately. The people he employs are not allowed to have views of their own -- they parrot their boss or they get their walking papers. They are like puppets.

       Ok? What does that have to do with anything? Because they are there for alexs mission, means he tells them what to say? It's a platform to go off of, people hear what you say. Listen to the message, not the messenger. I think the show is great and he has great reporters who each bring something different to the table

       I've been listening for a year but I've heard alot of his stuff from a few years ago. I look at the message, I also like Alex Jones he has a good show with good information that I can look up myself. It's not like I waste anytime listening either as I listen while I'm at work so it works out for me. I'd rather hear news from him the Fox news or msnbc

       He literally said that most people Israel killed were Hamas and not children/civilians. He always calls it tribal warfare to prevent his listeners from caring or delving deeper. He cuts off any caller who speaks the truth about Palestine and even played out Max Keiser with music after he said Israeli genocide and Max turned to the camera with a knowing grin and said "there's the music." He is a disinfo agent at its best when it comes to his zionist masters.

       I used to go to his site to see what his main stories were. As they got dumber and dumber (often focusing on stupid/trivial things) I began to see that he himself was a propagandist. I also saw him pushing agendas and neglecting issues other conspiracy theorists would be interested in. I don't go to his site much at all anymore

       Oh yeah. Jones believes stuff he's afraid to tell his listeners. Every now and then he lets a little of it slip out. He really believes that the New World Order is being orchestrated by demons, to destroy humanity. He won't say it outright (not very often, at least) because he knows it sounds insane.

       He never held any appeal for me.  He seemed far to driven by sensationalism.  Maybe if he governed himself, argued his point of view with vast amounts of "poise and rationality", the public perception of his views would be more accepted, of at least debated amongst the commons, instead of neo-am-radio enthusiasts.  I began to dislike him after his agressive and vulgar exchanges with the families and friends of those who were killed by the teen shooter in Santa Barbara in California.  Alex Jones has become the Al Sharpton of the "liberal" causes.  If I ever found myself at the center of a civil liberties controversy, my first action would be to send an/a email/statement/raven to Alex Jones telling him that "his help in this matter is not required, and any help would actually be injurious to my cause."

       Let's assume Alex Jones is a shill, totally believable. So who is telling the truth? James Corbett, Vinnie Eastwood, Pete Santilli? Who is worthy of listening to? I've found I really like Jan Irvin and James Corbett, those guys seem legit.

He got pissed and started yelling at the guy saying he's not a shill that both sides are wrong. I hate how everyone calls him a shill he has a great show and reaches millions of people and opens their minds. some "shill"

       Glenn beck fits the disinformation description way better.  But Jones despite his hyperbole, and shameless plugs, actually brings a lot to the table journalisticly.  His coverage of Ukraine, Bundy, Scottish independence, &amp; the immigration influx this summer were killer.  He just came off his best 6 months ever.  The last month most talk radio junkies are tuning into more traditional election coverage you get from Hannity or guys like that.  Also he tends to get repetitive.   So with this Ebola deal every show has been feeling the same the last few weeks.

       People fight their entire lives searching for the truth. When someone comes along and attempts to try and help expose those truths, the very thing that person was searching has been found. From a psychological view, the reaction is a defence mechanism. The reason why any notable character throughout history that would have made game-changing claims or new insights into the world were dismissed as crazy people. Even if the very thing you are trying to expose is revealed, some will go into denial and invert their own theory whilst ultimately dismissing any logic or fact from the person who beat them to it.

       Alex certainly isn't the messiah, or the truth of truths. But he has alot more to offer than many vocal people like to think.

       He's certainly got people talking about Bilderberg for a start. Something that was previously deemed "whacky tinfoil cooky made up rubbish". Here we are, 2013/2014 and the even the likes of the BBC acknowledge it now exists.

       Patriot leader? Alex isn't a leader of anything. He's a voice. Can you not look past him as a person?

       Dude, Alex Jones is a radio talkshow host.  These, now daily, attacks on him by the same race-baiting, Jew haters speaks volumes.  I've listen to Alex, weekly, for about 7-8 years now and the only movement I've seen him lead is his own.  If you don't like him, turn off the radio.

       That said, Alexa is NOT even close to accurate and their traffic is setting new records, thanks to toeing the Drudge line.

       Isn't it ironic that Jones' diehard followers denounce the charge that Jones is a Zionist shill; meanwhile, the one single media personality that Jones consistently promotes is the Jewish Matt Drudge?

       The failure of Alex Jones to talk about the Jews, in their various forms (wealthy manipulators of congress, controllers of the media in the West, Zionists, Israelis) and their relationship to the New World Order makes him irrelevent, in my opinion. Jones is all about the New World Order and what he likes to call the "globalists" but he never talks about the role of the Jews in the New World Order. Never.

       He literally said that most people Israel killed were Hamas and not children/civilians. He always calls it tribal warfare to prevent his listeners from caring or delving deeper. He cuts off any caller who speaks the truth about Palestine and even played out Max Keiser with music after he said Israeli genocide and Max turned to the camera with a knowing grin and said "there's the music." He is a disinfo agent at its best when it comes to his zionist masters.

       Could you be more naive? Would corporations voluntarily disband after the government was torn down? The destruction of the government would remove any checks of corporate power that haven't yet been removed. Say goodbye to the 60 hour work week, overtime, minimum wage, health and safety regulations, etc. We would truly be slaves if corporations had total power.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why it is so important that we take back OUR government.
