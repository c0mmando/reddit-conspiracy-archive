    <div class="md"><p>If you can register your discontent in here, you can register your discontent at the ballot box. Think about the votes a third party could get if all the discontented &quot;not going to bothers&quot; went in and voted third party.</p>

<p>The Congressional elections matter very little to me - I&#39;d like to vote them all out, but the incumbents we have are actually alright and they&#39;re far better than their opponents. Locally, however, there are a lot of interesting issues at play this year...</p>

<p>Another thing - we should all read the local legislation/&quot;questions&quot; they&#39;re trying to pass--don&#39;t just wait and read the summary at the ballot - the summaries and recaps can be deceiving. A good example, from many years ago - a &quot;pro-choice&quot; bill about abortion consent. If you were pro-choice or female, you were told to vote for it. A bunch of cool concert fundraisers for awareness, massive campaigning, bumper stickers everywhere proudly smacked on smug people&#39;s cars. What kind of person wouldn&#39;t vote for it? Are you anti-woman? Well, I read the bill. Approved kickbacks for doctors who referred women to abortion clinics, removed doctors&#39; liability in the event they botched it. The &quot;pro-woman pro-choice&quot; &quot;question&quot; was anything but. No one I knew who supported it had even read the fucking thing, they were just parroting what they were told.</p>

<p>If we all just stopped and read these things ourselves, imagine the amount of bullshit that would be kept at bay! Alternately, if you&#39;re too lazy or busy to study up, do a Ron Paul and vote No on everything. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think smart voting is very difficult and time consuming. Even taking all the steps you listed, this is still a very pessimistic technique and leaves you vulnerable to missing ballot measures and candidates that really fight TPTB and need support of smart people they can&#39;t reach without expensive media manipulation. For example, your technique would not have voted for Ron Paul on the Republican ticket. Remember some people are smart enough to fight the gov&#39;t and understand they need a support of one of the major political parties to have a chance in a first past the post election.</p>

<p>All that being said I don&#39;t think smart voting is efficient when you know all your neighbors are dumb voting and will pass whatever and whoever&#39;s campaign cost more.</p>

<p>Because of this I think the way we vote will need to change. People need to take their right seriously, even if it means hiring someone to find the best votes to cast given the complex ballot measures, the difficulty of accessing candidates, and each person&#39;s opinions how and where they want to live. Would people be willing to spend this money? They spend it on accountants to help with their taxes, so if smart voting was just half as accepted as taxes, it might all work out. And we all know <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/end-income-tax/P0T29pXB">income taxes are illegal</a>.</p>

<p>You are an idiot. Your local elections include ballot measure which directly determine whether or not those measures happen, which may be tax increases they disguise as being for the interest of the citizens, like &quot;home rule&quot;.</p>

<p>Your local elections are extremely important and have a direct impact on your community and your wallet.</p>

<p>Can you offer advise as to how I could accomplish that in the state of Illinois?</p>

<p>get self sustainable.</p>

<p>Again, can you offer some solutions to help with that whilst living on a tenth of an acre?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or wait for a revolution either peaceful or with force</p>

<p>So your other &quot;solution&quot; is to just wait for other people to take action?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same government that is there to fuck you over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not there to fuck us over, but it has been usurped for that purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you really think your local politician gives a fuck about you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am very active in my local politics and actually yes, many of them honestly do really care about me and everybody else they are running to represent, and this information is confirmed when I repeatedly over the course of time have them state their position on essential issues and back their stance with informed knowledge which is impassioned and sincere.</p>

<p>Just because many are bad, does not mean all are, just like with the police. It is a problem of systematic corruption which has been established through the corruption of those in power, which is why it&#39;s so hard to reverse, because they codify that corruption into law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So please go ahead and vote away the corruption</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is one way of trying, because again, not all who run are bought out, and it&#39;s very easy to tell when they are not, like Gary Johnson.</p>

<p>And if said communal farm hasn&#39;t been made severely illegal through municipal codes which ban you from raising farm animals on residential land.</p>

<p>Have you ever looked up land plot maps available at your town hall? I have, there are less than 10 acres of zoned farm land in my municipality and all of those plots are already owned.</p>

<p>B. Your vote doesn&#39;t count for the same said reason as A. It doesn&#39;t matter what you say, it matters what the lobbyist, or big interest says.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. I&#39;ve already mailed in my ballot. The excuses for not voting are often immature and when you dig down can be summed up with &quot;I&#39;m not engaged in the real world and I can&#39;t be bothered to learn or think about the issues.&quot; In my state, we have several interesting initiatives and a race between a popular Governor in the midst of an unfolding scandal and a fairly conservative challenger.</p>

<p>There is a truism that the votes of millionaires count just as much as the votes of poor people. However, millionaires vote at a much higher rate than the poor. If you don&#39;t like that, vote!</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to decry the effects of money on campaigns. But candidates who are attractive to the voters tend to attract the most money. There are many examples of self-funded candidates with plenty of money who utterly fail at the ballot box. Vote for the best candidate, and you can prove this again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I register and read the ballot measures. I rarely vote yes because often time they approve government spending or I feel the existing laws already cover what they are trying to pass. For example, the measure to make drinking illegal on the beach in Calif. was unnecessary because minor drinking, being drunk in public, and disturbing the peace are already unlawful and these were the people the bill sought to punish. As for government spending, I am of the belief that people can do anything the government can do, only better, and any action the government takes to impede the market will create inefficiencies because of their monopolized use of force.</p>

<p>Then I look up the candidates that will be on the ballot and look at what they have been in the news for. Earning my vote is incredibly difficult and it is critical to me that I have met them personally.</p>

<p>Of course, often times this means submitting empty votes.</p>

<p>I believe these votes are counted in some way and I hope one day that over 30% of the voters are like me and refuse to vote for someone that does not represent them personally. This would make it clear that people are willing to vote if a candidate would actually represent their constituents properly. </p>

<p>Organizations would then step in to make sure their candidates are solid (think new political parties and candidates that work hard for votes with a hard earned track record and the willingness to fight TPTB) and we could get some real change.</p>

<p>For example this election I will be submitting an empty ballot for the governer&#39;s race because both candidates support natural gas companies who are serial offenders of property rights in the nation.</p>

<p>As far as local and state ballot measures go, there is only one appealing proposition which lowers the penalty of all personal drug possession crimes to misdemeanors. It took me a while to come around supporting this measure. I posted on <a href="/r/changemyview">/r/changemyview</a> to see if anyone could find a problem with the law and I brought my complaints to the organization that sponsored the bill. I also took their responses back online and I remain convinced this bill is a good idea. What is sad is that the bill will never pass and although my house has been bombarded by mail for each proposition I have failed to see any about my own favorite.</p>

<p>It feels like we are a long ways a way but I also think things are changing so fast that the fact elections are every other year will actually be enough to change the voting industry in our lifetimes. What&#39;s more, a change to the institution almost always means a change to policy, and change is something we can all agree on. </p>

<p>And if said communal farm hasn&#39;t been made severely illegal through municipal codes which ban you from raising farm animals on residential land.</p>

<p>Have you ever looked up land plot maps available at your town hall? I have, there are less than 10 acres of zoned farm land in my municipality and all of those plots are already owned.</p>

<p>So again, you sort of have a solution, but your solution can not currently be easily implemented, which is a problem that needs to change.</p>
