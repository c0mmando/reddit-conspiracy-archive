       Dwain Deets appointed as NASA Dryden Aerospace Projects Director (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Dwain A. Deets has been appointed Director, Aerospace Projects Office at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, CA, Center Director Kenneth J. Szalai announced recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before this appointment, Deets became Director, Research Engineering Division in March 1994 and served as acting division chief from 1990 to 1994. In that position, he directed the research and engineering aspects of the flight research programs at Dryden.

       The airplane was UA175, a Boeing 767-200, shortly before crashing into World Trade Center Tower 2. Based on analysis of radar data, the National Transportation and Safety Board reported the groundspeed just before impact as 510 knots. This is well beyond the maximum operating velocity of 360 knots, and maximum dive velocity of 420 knots. The possibilities as I see them are: (1) this wasn’t a standard 767-200; (2) the radar data was compromised in some manner; (3) the NTSB analysis was erroneous; or (4) the 767 flew well beyond its flight envelope, was controllable, and managed to hit a relatively small target.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which organization has the greater responsibility for acknowledging the elephant in the room? The NTSB, NASA, Boeing, or the AIAA? Have engineers authored papers, but the AIAA or NASA won’t publish them? Or, does the ethical responsibility lie not with organizations, but with individual aeronautical engineers? Have engineers just looked the other way?
      </p>

       The above entry remained at the moderated AIAA Aerospace America Forum for approximately two weeks before being removed without explanation.

       Further context and additional research (to understand it clearly for yourself):
      </p>
      <p>
       1) A serious question for Pilots:
      </p>
      <p>
       If an
       <em>
        unmodified
       </em>
       Boeing 767 can fly (in control) at a true airspeed (TAS) of 515 knots (groundspeed [510kts] + windspeed, headwind very light to the N/W) at approx 1000 feet altitude (in near sea level air density) - at what TAS and corresponding Mach number would that same plane be flying at 30,000 feet altitude where air density is 2/3rds less (thinner), such that, an equal number and % of air molecules (dynamic pressure) are impacting the airframe (aeroelasticity) at every instant?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, by what % would such a TAS, and corresponding Mach number, exceed Mach 1.0? and by that I'm not referring to the sound barrier or transonic effects, but simply to illustrate a fundamental point about the outer OUTERmost limits of the flight envelope of Vd + 20% bounded by Mach 1.0 (or its equivalent airspeed) at all altitudes and flight regimes.

       Aeroelastic stability requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) General. The aeroelastic stability evaluations required under this section include: flutter, divergence, control reversal and any undue loss of stability and control as a result of structural deformation. The aeroelastic evaluation must include whirl modes associated with any propeller or rotating device that contributes significant dynamic forces. Compliance with this section must be shown by analyses, wind tunnel tests, ground vibration tests, flight tests, or other means found necessary by the Administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Aeroelastic stability envelopes. The airplane must be designed to be free from aeroelastic instability for all configurations and design conditions within the aeroelastic stability envelopes as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) For normal conditions without failures, malfunctions, or adverse conditions, all combinations of altitudes and speeds encompassed by the VD/MD versus altitude envelope enlarged at all points by an increase of 15 percent in equivalent airspeed at both constant Mach number and constant altitude. In addition, a proper margin of stability must exist at all speeds up to VD/MD and, there must be no large and rapid reduction in stability as VD/MD is approached. The enlarged envelope may be limited to Mach 1.0 when MD is less than 1.0 at all design altitudes, and
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) For the conditions described in Sec. 25.629(d) below, for all approved altitudes, any airspeed up to the greater airspeed defined by:

      <p>
       On the Airbus fly by wire aircraft, it is not possible to reach the dive speed, due to the flight envelope protections available in normal law. If the sidestick is maintained full forward, and the airspeed crosses VMO/MMO, the pitch nose-down authority smoothly reduces to zero at approximately VMO +16 / MMO + 0.04. This however, does not guarantee the airspeed stabilizing at this speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If MMO + 0.04 / VMO + 20kts is reached or exceeded, then a structural inspection is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond MD (= MMO+0.07) / VD (= VMO + 31kts) (A320 family), structural disintegration can occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the speeds for the A320, in Mach number and Kts. The lesser value must always be respected, at all times:

       Dive Speeds:

       Question: Why so fast?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       There's a final piece of this puzzle in terms of the nature and levels of the impacts as well as timing in regards to the subsequent destruction of the buildings about an hour and an hour and a half later that really needs to be addressed here to complete this heinous puzzle and "mystery" (to the degree that you can't quite see it, yet).

       A NATION CHALLENGED: THE TRADE CENTER CRASHES; First Tower to Fall Was Hit At Higher Speed, Study Finds.
      </p>
      <p>
       By ERIC LIPTON and JAMES GLANZ
      </p>
      <p>
       Published: February 23, 2002
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Researchers trying to explain why the World Trade Center's south tower fell first, though struck second, are focusing on new calculations showing that the passenger jet that hit the south tower had been flying as fast as 586 miles an hour, about 100 miles an hour faster than the other hijacked plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The speed of the two planes at impact has been painstakingly estimated using a mix of video, radar and even the recorded sounds of the planes passing overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two sets of estimates, by government and private scientists, have surfaced, but both show that the plane that hit the south tower at 9:02 a.m., United Airlines Flight 175, approached the trade center at extremely high speed, much faster than American Airlines Flight 11, which hit the north tower at 8:46 a.m.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the United plane was moving so fast that it was at risk of breaking up in midair as it made a final turn toward the south tower, traveling at a speed far exceeding the 767-200 design limit for that altitude, a Boeing official said.
      </p>
      <p>
       ''These guys exceeded even the emergency dive speed,'' said Liz Verdier, a Boeing spokeswoman. ''It's off the chart.''
      </p>
      <p>
       The speed of the planes is far from the only factor that will be important in explaining why the south tower, which was struck between the 78th and 84th floors, fell within 56 minutes and the north tower, which was hit between the 94th and 99th floors, stood for 102 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, it was the combination of structural damage and the fires, fueled by thousands of gallons of jet fuel, that brought the buildings down.
      </p>
      <h2>
       The south tower was also hit at a lower point, meaning there was more weight bearing down on the damaged floors.
      </h2>
      <p>
       But the difference in the towers' survival times, which translated into a difference in the amount of time tenants and rescue personnel had to get out, could be related in part to the planes' speeds, researchers said.
      </p>
      <p>
       ''Clearly one plane came in faster and had more energy,'' Dr. Jerome Connor, a professor of civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is studying the collapses, said of the new calculations, in which he was not directly involved.

       The high speed of United Flight 175 may also have complicated the hijackers' mission, because it would have been more difficult to make accurate adjustments in the plane's direction, several pilots said. Loud and repeated alarms would also have been sounding in the cockpit.

       The flight data recorders from the two planes have not been found; Boeing officials said these so-called black boxes are not designed to survive the forces they encountered in the collapse.

       The South Tower was hit much lower, across multiple floors (78-82), and at a much higher rate of speed (by 85 knots or 100mph) than that at which the North Tower was hit - that
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       explain it - how the towers fell and why the 2nd one hit, fell first.. followed by the North Tower in the exact same manner about a half hour later (burned longer). Of course! After all, it could only be as a direct and sole result of the plane impacts (the attack) that the twin towers were completely destroyed. To say otherwise would be crazy and makes no sense..
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Returning to look at the design parameters of exterior perimeter steel columned framework of the twin towers.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        were they "tapered" thinner towards the uppermost stories where the North Tower plane impacted around the center of the 95th-96th floor (of a 110 story building) at 425 knots or 5 knots over the Vd design dive limit and 65 knots over Vmo?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "..oh, now I get it." "Why so fast?"
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone who might be a little ADD and who still doesn't get where this was going - the main idea is that the south tower plane had to attain a certain critical speed neccessary to successfully break through the perimeter steel columns at the lower level (around the 79th floor) ie: where they are thicker, whereas the north tower plane, which impacted around the 95th floor level, although still very fast at 425 knots (about 100 mph slower than the south tower plane) or just over the Vd limit of 420 knots, did not require as much speed to break through at the higher level where the exterior columns are not as thick (tapered thinner towards the uppermost stories for weight loading purposes).
      </p>
      <p>
       This was done to create the narrative as to the causal mechanism of destruction for both towers, as per the article cited, which were evidentally blown up with explosives from the top down, initiated from around the impact levels of the two buildings, the south tower even offering up a slight TIP/tilt at the onset of it's "collapse", which then helps to "sell" the subsequent destruction of the north tower about a half hour later..
      </p>
      <p>
       ie: building hit lower, although hit second, fell first.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's elementary my dear Watson (puffs pipe).
      </p>
      <p>
       You see Watson, the SPEED of the south tower plane forms the very CRUX of the official story itself, sadly for it.

       Let the truth and the facts in evidence be it's own undoing, now, and in perpetuity.

       I am a pilot. Dassault Falcon 10 these days but have flown everything from a tiny old Cessna 150 on up to a 737.

       This is the
       <em>
        biggest
       </em>
       smoking gun of 9/11 next to the "dancing Israelis."
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is this: what the hell does it
       <em>
        mean?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that it is
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       for a 767-200 to exceed VMo without extensive modification. IIRC, VMo for this aircraft at sea level is 360 knots (414mph). This is the maximum speed
       <em>
        which the aircraft shall never exceed.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as I said--if that was a "real" 767 it would have fluttered to pieces over 100 KIAS
       <em>
        under
       </em>
       the speed at which it hit the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad you brought this little "physics issue" to the forefront as it ALONE proves that 9/11 could NOT have happened the way the "official lie" indicates.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR--A 767-200 would have broken apart over 100mph SLOWER than it was flying indicating either a heavily-modded plane OR a military drone as were being worked on by several Israeli/US companies at the time.

       Thank you xanaxinator, for your comment and contribution. Very helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of fairness though, and to be absolutely precise, the speed of 515 kts TAS (510 kts groundspeed + windspeed vector, which on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, was a very light headwind to the N/W) comes out to a CAS (calibrated airspeed) of about 508 kts (the Vmo/Mmo and Vd/Md are measured as 360 KCAS, and 420 KCAS respectively), which, near sea level amounts to something like 148 knots over Vmo, and 88 knots over the Vd design dive limit, which, in jet aircraft, pilots are not given the reading for (Vd/Md), to keep them well away from it, but the hard hard, outer OUTERmost limit for the flight envelope beyond which flutter and structural failure becomes inevitable, is actually at 15-20% past the Vd limit (see FAA FAR engineered safety margin specs) or 504 kts CAS (at 20%), which is only 4 kts less than 508 kts CAS.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in theory, although highly improbable if not next to impossible, the plane
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have held together, maybe. It should be noted that THE plane was travelling at this speed or close to it for almost a minute and not merely for a moment or two at the last instant as some people like to contend. And btw, how on earth did it ACCELERATE at the end of it's dive to retain a 515 knot TAS at the lower altitude near sea level?! Unless the engine power was greater by something like 3X+, that would be utterly impossible since in level or relatively level flight, especially in near sea level air density, parasitic drag exceeds thrust, meaning that only during a steep dive at higher altitudes can such airspeeds be realized.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The dive speed is the absolute maximum speed above which the aircraft must not fly. Typically, to achieve this speed, the aircraft must enter a dive (steep descent), as the engines cannot produce sufficient thrust to overcome aerodynamic drag in level flight. At the dive speed, excessive aircraft vibrations develop which put the aircraft structural integrity at stake.

       Therefore, it's not as much an issue of disintegration, but one of stable flight control (by a novice pilot), since, at such a speed exceeding the Vmo or max operating limit by 148 kts, the control surfaces are subject to all kinds of phenomenon, including flutter, at anything exceeding the Vmo by a margin of 31kts or just slightly higher (see Airbus a380 info posted in the OP), in this case (Boeing 767) at something like anything beyond 395 KCAS or so (360 + 35), for the possibility of flutter onset. So you weren't that far off the mark really in terms of real world flight conditions ie: THE plane was going 113 knots (508 - 395) or 130 mph faster than that (395 kts), so technically, you really were correct, but I just wanted to clarify in terms of pushing the outer-OUTERmost flight envelope limitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a screenshot from the aeronautical calculator depicting the Boeing 767 Vmo/Mmo at 23,000 ft, noting the EAS (sea level airspeed) and CAS of 360 kts and 378 kts respectively (at 23,000 ft).

      <p>
       Therefore, with regards to the excessive speed, the "impossibility factor" involves piloting, and targeting, first and foremost, (along with engine power capability) with the flight physics re: the outermost flight envelope, amounting to what can only be thought of as a one-in-a-million (or greater) shot, at best - at which point I would like to refer people to the self-evident proof of controlled demolition regarding the destruction of the twin towers in relation to
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kn63y/nasa_dryden_aerospace_projects_director_declares/clmx8m2">
        the official story
       </a>
       ie: that the building hit much lower and at higher speed (approx 100 mph faster that the plane that hit the north tower) fell first although hit second, and suggest that they think it all the way through moving backwards, causally (or as a faked
       <em>
        apparent
       </em>
       cause) from that evidence for CD, which is conclusive given the way and the manner and the speed by which the towers were completely destroyed, both of them in the exact same manner, an hour and an hour and a half after the plane impacts whereby we were led and are supposed to believe, that the buildings "collapsed" as a direct and sole result of the impacts and fire at around the impact levels of both towers.

       They were trying to hit the WTC in the UA sim the very next day.. on Sept 12, 2001, so while they were aware the plane was travelling at high speed, obviously he would not know what the actual recorded speeds were yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were flying the simulator for a Boeing 737, a smaller and much more maneuverable aircraft, within the Vmo limit, or under 360 knots - he mentions the figure of 300 knots, which is considered at that altitude to be very fast, particularly as it relates to controlled flight and maneuvering/piloting in near sea level air density. As for the forces involved, which include both aerodynamic pressures due to airspeed and g-forces due to maneuvering, Dan mentions in the interview that they were "fighting the crash logic" when making the attempt at the "higher speeds" because it simulates the forces involved, and very accurately in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, he and his pilots were trying to hit the WTC South Tower at Vmo or perhaps a bit above.. or 300-400 knots, max, and from what he said, closer to 300 and well within with the Vmo limit (360 knots)
      </p>
      <p>
       They couldn't go faster than that, past Vd (420), because the sim will then freeze and the screen will turn red due to the crash logic, which would require re-setting the simulator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, as far as controlled flight and maneuvering, and piloting goes, they were flying a 737, a smaller and much more maneuverable aircraft, at around Vmo (and less) and were unable to hit the target (south tower) unless and until they reduced the airspeed to near approach level speeds, which for a Boeing 767-200ER is around 142 knots and for a Boeing 737, around 130 knots.
      </p>
      <p>
       These were very experienced pilots with 1000's of hours of flight time in other aircraft types.
      </p>
      <p>
       After they tried it about 10 times or more, Dan himself was finally able to do it (fly the dive and final approach at the high speed of approx 300 knots and hit the target WTC South Tower), although he didn't say how many times he tried it before finally getting it just right with wing tips within the building perimeter (think of it like parking in or going through a separate garage in your car at full speed out of a turn, but harder.

       Thank you Richard, for taking the time to review. I know you're very busy all the time, but this is really important I think so it's well worth taking the time to examine and scrutinize very carefully, and it's relevant. Very relevant.
