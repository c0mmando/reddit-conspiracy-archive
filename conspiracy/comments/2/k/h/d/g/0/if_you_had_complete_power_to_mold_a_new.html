<p>I don&#39;t think that it would be possible to NOT crack quite a few heads in the process of instilling a &quot;benevolent&quot; dictatorship.  I for one understand that sometimes heads need to get cracked in order to clean out the mess and muck of a society, but I guess perhaps deciding which heads exactly get cracked or ousted or whatever might not be the easiest debate to resolve.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that there would need to be a <em>lot</em> of factors put into that AI program...and what if that AI program&#39;s decision is one that the current ruling elite don&#39;t like and want to fight against?  What if it&#39;s a decision that a lot of the population itself don&#39;t like and want to fight against?  What if the AI program gives its decision, and then a shit ton of people stand up and say &quot;Aw helllll naw!!&quot;?</p>

<p>And, for that matter, if no one DOES do anything like that and everyone DOES listen to and abides by the decision of this AI...then...who in fact would really be in charge at that point? the benevolent dictator incumbent, or the AI that actually <em>decided</em> that that particular person would be the benevolent dictator?</p>

<p>Lots of tricky questions, it seems.</p>

<p>Now...as far as going with the consensus of the population, it would seem that that would not be a horrible idea.  I guess it would just be a question of making sure and instilling a proper vote-counting system - one that <em>couldn&#39;t</em> be as easily manipulated and rigged as is the case with the current systems.</p>

<p>Not only that, but there would need to be a LOT of rules in place in terms of the limits of a candidates persuasion attempts.  Money and financial contributions would have to likely get done away with right off the bat.  I wouldn&#39;t want the wise person with no money to lose out to the moronic psychopath with a billion dollars in the bank.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, first of all, there are a lot more types of criminals on this planet than just the international corporate types for sure.  The corporate banker types suck definitely, but they aren&#39;t the only people unfit for an ideal society.</p>

<p>Additionally, I wonder if the digital currency idea wouldn&#39;t be able to get manipulated easily by hackers and what not...</p>

<p>Again, things to consider...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>very good quetsions.   the AI program has many nightmare scenarios that I&#39;ve read about in many sci fi stories.   I think that it would need to be a consensus based self evolving mechanism that had strict oversight from a consensus of the population before it could implement any decisions.    as for ruling elite, I think they would become obsolete, hopefully riiculed and ostracized.   what did the french want?  equality fraternity and liberty?  </p>

<p>I basically said that first we as a people would need to develop ourselves enough to keep the ruling elite from continuing to manipulate us in the manner that they have.  A lot easier said than done, of course, but without first doing that, we wouldn&#39;t be able to accomplish any of the things we&#39;ve been talking about here much at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s certainly shown itself to be a bad thing when that centralized power is in the hands of a few nefarious individuals.  That&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>I guess what I mean isn&#39;t so much centralized power as much as a unifying of the people into <em>one</em> collective unit - a collective unit that can definitely be made up of many different, unique individuals, of course.  All I know is that - as I said above - if you divide a people, it simply makes it a LOT more easy to destroy them.  History has shown example after example of this unfortunate truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also have a big problem with the &quot;one blanket covers all&quot; type set up approaches especially when it comes to things like coercive institutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understood.  That&#39;s not what I&#39;m meaning or referring to, however.  I&#39;m not saying or advocating a &quot;one way for EVERYONE&quot; type of scenario.  Again, all I mean is that if you separate things out into the &quot;50 nations&quot; scenario that you mentioned above, it might be a lot easier to tarnish and undermine those 50 individual nations as opposed to <em>one</em> single unit comprised of all the 50.</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s all about the strength of the collective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Give me the crazy-quilt patterns of human expression and experiments in freedom, and let&#39;s put the sociopaths out of power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You and I are not disagreeing here.  It&#39;s just that, again, it&#39;s simply been shown that the bigger the group, the more powerful the members in that group.  Take a close look at the documentary in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2jo97s/it_is_in_separating_the_human_race_into_multiple/">this OP</a> and apply it to what we&#39;re talking about here.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more that I understand just how impotent the individual is on their own, and how powerful the collective is together.</p>

<p>If you have 50 individual nations, then - pessimistic or optimistic - those 50 <em>individual</em> nations, of, say one thousand people each, will simply be a lot more easy to take over and do away with than would be the case if those 50 nations got together and formed one collective nation of 50,000 people standing together.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple.  What&#39;s easier to take out?  1,000 people standing together or 50,000 people standing together?</p>

<p>And, for that matter, it&#39;s not like a group of 1,000 would necessarily be any more exempt from any of the problems that a group of 50,000 would have to deal with.  Just as you can corrupt 50,000 people, you could corrupt 1,000 people.  Matter of fact, it would actually be <em>far easier</em> to corrupt 1,000 people because the numbers are a lot smaller and the logistics involved would be a lot simpler.</p>

<p>I understand your point behind the problem with big government, but I don&#39;t think that a single unit of 50 nations <em>needs</em> to &quot;necessarily&quot; have any sort of corrupt government overseeing it.  That&#39;s certainly what has happened throughout history - yes - but I&#39;m not sure that breaking the collective up into individual units wouldn&#39;t make the people even MORE easy to corrupt and take advantage of.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that the same element will rise to the top in THOSE types of systems - but we shouldn&#39;t think that this is the only type of systems under which a larger collective can exist.</p>

<p>&quot;Collective&quot; never <em>ever</em> HAS to mean &quot;corrupt&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having said that, I do believe that &quot;Camelots&quot; and benevolent kingships are possible on smaller scales, but even they are prone to be destroyed or subverted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said above, the smaller they are, the easier they are <em>to</em> get destroyed and subverted.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying, conversely, is that the bigger they are, the easier they are to be corrupt.  This isn&#39;t a bad point, and history has definitely shown that ONE type of overarching power does indeed work in a not very benevolent way, but that same level of corruption can exist in the smaller units as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I imagine small &quot;enlightened&quot; kingdoms could be humanly possible, but ever susceptible to the vagaries of decadence, power and corruption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The small kingdoms are, as you said, &quot;ever susceptible to the vagaries of decadence, power and corruption&quot;, but the larger systems are also very susceptible as well.  Additionally, the smaller a unit, the easier it is to take over.</p>

<p>What is the solution, then?  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Bv2MKY7uI">Noam Chomsky&#39;s explanation of anarchism</a> is one that I think is ideal, personally, but it also takes a <em>much</em> greater level of personal and collective responsibility than the human race as a whole has demonstrated up to this point.  We would have to up our level of development quite a bit before we could worthily engage in a viable system of that elevated type of governance.</p>

<p>And that is precisely the danger, a small elite that is empowered by the &quot;people&quot; is dangerous. There&#39;s reason why the very intangible but roundly vaunted &quot;mandate&quot; is the prize to possess in modern democracies.</p>

<p>Even the ancient Chinese Emperors claimed to have a mandate, albeit from heaven. The public mandate of today is just a repackaging of the same concept.</p>

<p>People <em>cooperating</em> together is a truly powerful and wonderful thing, but <em>collectively</em> exercising political power? That&#39;s just more of the lynch mob, the riot or the inaugural celebration for yet another corrupt politician.</p>

<p>Mob rule ends badly, though it may start on a positive note.</p>

<p>Absolutely.  Agreed.  As such, the people <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> empower a small elite.</p>

<p>There should be a global &quot;mandate&quot; adopted by all the people of Earth that applies to everyone on the planet.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if there is that huge of a difference if at all between people cooperating together and the exercising of proper political power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s just more of the lynch mob, the riot or the inaugural celebration for yet another corrupt politician.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call that the exercising of proper political power, however.  I would call that simply the rule of a nefarious elite.  It would seem that, other things being equal, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbWnJGlyMU">a proper collective of citizens all working together <em>should</em> be able to handle and overcome such nefarious rule</a>.</p>

<p>I guess the problem might be that other things might not always be very equal.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We should work at not being mobs then.  Easier said then done, but still seems true to me.  Additionally, the alternative of small groups working individually would seem to not serve a people much better because that would leave them a bit too vulnerable to outside forces.</p>

<p>I understand.  It&#39;s about the <em>practical</em> application of theories - i.e. just <em>how</em> exactly things transpire when you apply them in the real world.  And you&#39;re right in saying that big government on this planet HAS indeed historically been very manipulative of the overall population.  Certainly.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think that breaking things up into small, separate units would solve more problems than it creates is all.</p>

<p>And I would agree with that argument.  I&#39;m just not sure that 50 smaller nation-states wouldn&#39;t get just as undermined, however.</p>

<p>Certainly seems to be the case - yes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Or stand up, pull our bootstraps up, and help each other <em>independent</em> of any ruling elite.  Problem is that we&#39;ve been generally eviscerated as a people, have collective stockholm syndrome, and almost don&#39;t know <em>how</em> to help ourselves and each other.</p>
