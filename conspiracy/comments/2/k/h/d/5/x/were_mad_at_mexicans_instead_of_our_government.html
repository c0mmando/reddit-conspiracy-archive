        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why are there so many upset with illegal immegration from mexico when this very this stems from US policy? The border between us and mexico has always had the abillity to be crossed and any increase in that security does nothing to nullify the root of the problem. the root of this problem is because of th enature of the us policy regarding the drug policy, and this is where many people reach in their thought, but they forget how uninformed as a citizenry we are so that we can be taken advantage of. the us has not only implemented a drug policy that encourages illegal immegration by making mexico into a organized crime controlled state but they have executed another policy as well: that of corn. Mexico used to make tons of money and based their livlihood off the corn crop but because of skewed us agricultural policy we overproduce in huge amounts and even now pay farmers to stop growing corn. what was a place to let off this offhand excess? the mexican market. once our corn market let out onto them they had access to corn cheaper than ever before. what do you think that did to their local economy? now do you get why we have any mexicans immigrating into our country? it has nothing to do with the level of security at the border. the whole idea that we should hate on immigrants as if it was their fault that they had the will to survive is excessively flawed. we&#39;re being played here into thinking we know the problem, while the real one continues to corrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s social engineering, and a lot of it seems to be directed at Mexico, Central America &amp; South America.  It&#39;s a sad aspect of our trade policies, especially how the US exploits Asia.  The WTO is horribl trade deal which has actual gotten to the point that we will raise chickens in the US, send them to be processed in China, then ship them back so they can be label as a product that originated in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, and talk of TPP and TTIP, arguably worse than NAFTA, have died down after a push earlier in the year which did seem to have some effect in congress fast tracking it.  I suspect they&#39;re only waiting for a more opportune time when everyone&#39;s looking the other way, maybe at the end of the lame duck.</p>

<p>Honestly illegal immigration is slavery 2.0, the regular US citizen and the illegal worker are both the losers in this, because with regulation they may not get a job in the US but they will eventually get a job since other people will have more money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>have you seen the numbers on how much voter fraud actually occurs? from what ive seen its practically 0, which is why these groups take issue against it. minorities tend to have a harder time in (excuse the pun) having the time to obtain photo ids through such processes and so it cuts them out of the equation</p>
