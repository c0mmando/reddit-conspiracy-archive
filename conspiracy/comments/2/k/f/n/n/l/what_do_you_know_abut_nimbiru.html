<p>is is possible that the planet could be in danger, and we&#39;re not being told, why bother to warn anyone, there&#39;s no room underground for the masses.</p>

<p>many believe that ebola is a hoax to bring in martial law; &quot;camps&quot; to keep the masses corralled <em>before</em> the big event happens; if the elite go underground they won&#39;t be bothered by peasants, (whomever doesn&#39;t go to colonies on the moon or mars, before you ask why i think this true, ask yourself why you believe Tesla),</p>

<p>it&#39;s not just the US that has been building underground havens,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would assume that by reading this sub, you don&#39;t trust the government. Fair enough. But why, with that reasoning, would you even begin to give legitimacy to a civilization that couldn&#39;t predict it&#39;s own extinction, or even more so, trust people that tell you there is a secret hidden planet that will somehow pop out of a shadow and fuck the whole world up? </p>

<p>This Nibiru shit is complete nonsense. There is no phantom planet in our solar system, and there are no lizard people. All there is, is a society bound by debt and the perpetuating of it, backed by an imaginary fiat currency that insures it&#39;s existence by becoming so commonplace that the only alternative is a very disruptive collapse, and it gains it&#39;s staying power by invading and bombing the everloving fuck out of any country (because it takes at least that much to oppose) that threatens it&#39;s sustainability. </p>

<p>I wish there was a rogue planet that was our biggest concern, but the much more boring but sad truth is, the US dollar and it&#39;s realistic uselessness is the most threatening thing in the world (or solar system) right now,  and worrying about a fake planet is a waste of your time if you&#39;re legitimately concerned about impending doom right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to what I&#39;ve heard, Nibiru comes around once every 3,600 years.</p>

<p>Nibiru is a planet, around 4x larger than Earth, and it&#39;s part of it&#39;s own solar system with other planets and a sun (a brown dwarf).  Nibiru has life and is the home of intelligent people that are much older than we.  A long time ago, when our systems first passed through each other, there was no Earth.  There was a much larger planet named Tiamat that had no life.  Tiamat and Nibiru collided, smashing off a large part of Tiamat.  This collision is where we got the asteroid belt, and what was left of Tiamat reformed and became Earth.  When the waters of Nibiru and Tiamat mixed, this is what brought life to Earth.</p>

<p>The collision also damaged the atmosphere of Nibiru, but the people of Nibiru understood they could fix their atmosphere by releasing gold into the air, just like we&#39;re currently doing with chemtrails when we release aluminum.  So, the people of Nibiru started mining the hell out of their planet.</p>

<p>3,600 years later, when our systems were passing again, the people of Nibiru were surprised to discover life on Earth.  They sent many of their own people to Earth to mine gold with the idea that they deliver the gold to the people of Nibiru the next passing.  Upon the next passing, the Nibiru miners insisted on being released from this duty, and offered a solution by manipulating the DNA of a species natural to the planet.  Being that we are related, it wasn&#39;t too difficult for them to splice some of their DNA in with ours to make us intelligent enough to use tools and follow orders, but too stupid to realize that we are slaves.</p>

<p>The Nibiru people left a very few of their own people to govern over us and keep us mining their precious gold.  The following passing, another 3,600 years, the people of Nibiru sent representatives to collect the gold, and discovered that Earthling women were beautiful.  They mated with the Earthling women, and these women gave birth to &quot;mighty men&quot; or &quot;men of renown&quot;; people that were not as smart as a pure blood from Nibiru, but much smarter and stronger than any Earthling.</p>

<p>And this is when the shit hit the fan.</p>

<p>They began to lose control of their flocks.  These &quot;men of renown&quot; began to rebel against our slave-masters, but most importantly, they kept mating with other Earthlings, spreading their &quot;tainted&quot; DNA, which caused even more rebellions.</p>

<p>A massive undertaking was done to wipe out all these ancestors, but it was ultimately decided the best course of action was to use the solar systems themselves to do the job.  Normally a slave-master, or a pharaoh, would hide away with a large number of his flock underground to survive the catastrophic effects of the solar systems passing through each other, but this time they decided to abandon their flocks, allow the catastrophe to kill us off, and then start over again.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t work.  When they came back, they discovered their cities, temples, and pyramids abandoned.  Their flocks had scattered all over the world, and their flocks had all decided on new leadership from their own (mostly people that held a larger part of their DNA).  When they tried to re-claim us, we fought back and killed them all.  We declared everything to do with them to be &quot;evil&quot;, and we destroyed all we could find that was linked to them.  Not understanding what was really happening, we hoped if we did this, they would simply stay away.  Since then, we&#39;ve simply been trying to take care of ourselves.</p>

<p>Now the time of passing is coming once again.  The people of Nibiru noticed our testing of nuclear weapons and sent several representatives to Earth to see just what the Hell we were up to.  They were shocked to discover that, not only did we overthrow the people they placed as our leaders, but how much we had grown.</p>

<p>They have many different thoughts about us.  Some like us, some think we&#39;re animals, but most couldn&#39;t care less.  The biggest thing, is they still want their gold.  So, they made a deal with our leaders.</p>

<p>This deal was; deliver the gold and we&#39;ll show you how to build underground bases for your people to survive the coming calamity, so that your people can rise and rule over the few survivors, and start the process all over again.  Oh, and they also want to kidnap some humans to check and see how much we&#39;ve evolved.</p>

<p>This is almost all a lie.  They did teach them how to build the bunkers, and they do abduct people, but what they are doing is trying to create a new hybrid, and it will be this hybrid race that will end up being our new leaders after the calamity.</p>

<p>What will happen is about 1/3 of us will die from the calamity itself.  Another 1/3 will die after from starvation, exposure, ect.  Those that are left will form into groups, and the new hybrid race will come to select groups that show promise, amaze them with their technology, and enslave them once again.  We&#39;ll be ordered to rebuild the pyramid cultures and start mining gold again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its something I&#39;ve been looking into for about a year now.  Almost all I know is from youtube videos, but I&#39;ve seen practically all of them.  Most are shit, or laced with shit, but there are some good ones out there.</p>

<p>Ive never read the Book of Enoch, but I have seen several videos about it.  As for Zecharia Sitchin, I only heard about him fairly recently.</p>

<p>What I put together is a quilt piece.  I watched a ton of lectures online, compared them, kept all the primary information, and picked what felt right to me (based upon my personal observations).</p>

<p>This is what I do know for fact;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The events that will occur will be so dramatic, that there is really no possible way for you to prepare for the initial calamities.  Even those in the underground bunkers will be screwed, possibly more so, as we&#39;re talking a reforming of the Earth.  On the surface, those that survive MUST join with others to work together for survival.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be two warnings.  The first is a blue dot in the sky, followed by a red dot.  When you see this, you&#39;ll have some time to prepare.  Eventually, we&#39;ll be able to see the second sun and even the planets, but then it will be too late.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I believe the Ten Plagues  of Ancient Egypt were a result of this passing.  Let&#39;s consider what happened to them to give us some foresight of what to expect.</p>

<p>Water into Blood.  This could be explained by an iron content being flung by this solar system.  The ancient Japanese speak of a &quot;Destroyer&quot; that came like a &quot;dragon&quot;.</p>

<p>Frogs.  Once the water was contaminated, all the frogs came looking for water.  Frogs weren&#39;t the only animals looking for water and food, and being frogs are easy prey out of water, the animals brought...</p>

<p>Lice.  Lice bring with them their own problems, but soon after people start scratching all the time they noticed...</p>

<p>All the animals and flies.  There&#39;s dead shit all over the place and wild animals eating it.  All this starts to cause...</p>

<p>Death of livestock.  Not only is the water fucked, but animals are getting killed all the time from other animals and disease.  Not to mention they all got lice now as well.</p>

<p>Boils.  Now this is where it gets interesting.  I believe this is a result from solar radiation.  The first thing that ill happen is we pass into an iron cloud, you hear about lots f animals entering communities, and then we&#39;re hit with a bit solar burst that will cook anyone outside at that time.</p>

<p>Storms of fire.  This is debris from the other system.  It&#39;s gonna suck.  Stay away from anything big.</p>

<p>Locusts.  While we&#39;re getting shotgunned by the other system, the only thing that can compete with this is the insect.  All the stuff that to us looks wiped out, a pack of bugs will move in and thrive.  Then, when out of food, they will swarm anything alive; like a community of people.  </p>

<p>Darkness.  I believe the &quot;3-days of darkness&quot; is an expression of how long to expect it to suck.</p>

<p>Death of Firstborn.  Everyone will lose someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>very scary, reminds me of the movie: &quot;Melancholia&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Lars von Trier, that great maestro of facetious event cinema, is back with another instrument of torture. It&#39;s a disaster movie about an enormous blue planet called Melancholia – 20 times the size of Earth, but only half as big as the grain of salt you&#39;re going to need – which crashes into planet Earth.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>is it possible that the Mayan calendar was off by several years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, especially considering the original theory was based on a terrible understanding of the Mayans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is is possible that the planet could be in danger, and we&#39;re not being told, why bother to warn anyone, there&#39;s no room underground for the masses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was in danger, it wouldn&#39;t be from Nibiru (which for the record does not exist). Frankly, if you&#39;re concerned about the end of the world, you should be far more worried about things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano">supervolcanoes</a>, climate change, or asteroid impacts than about the whole 2012 thing. Also, for the record, you shouldn&#39;t be worried about any of the things listed either (except climate change, that&#39;s actually a very real danger).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>many believe that ebola is a hoax to bring in martial law; &quot;camps&quot; to keep the masses corralled before the big event happens; if the elite go underground they won&#39;t be bothered by peasants,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that theory does not really hold any water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(whomever doesn&#39;t go to colonies on the moon or mars</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;d kinda know if either of these existed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>before you ask why i think this true, ask yourself why you believe Tesla),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding what? That their vehicles are fairly efficient and have the potential to shift the car market towards electric vehicles? That&#39;s not really hard to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The passing of the destroying planet has been mentioned in too many different mythologies separated by space and time to not be taken seriously. The 3600 year thing is entirely Sitchin&#39;s, and does not represent a consensus; other people are arguing that researchers of his day didn&#39;t fully grasp the way Sumerians reckoned time, and study since then suggests that Nibiru&#39;s period is really 2100 years; with its orbit varying, depending on the location of Jupiter; resulting in a <em>cataclysmic</em> passing every 4200 years. Some even reckon the star of Bethlehem was in-fact the Anunaki homeworld passing out beyond Jupiter; the miraculous arrival of Jesus, the God-man, on Earth at the same time being a very unlikely coincidence.</p>

<p>We might take some solace in that the Book Of Revelation states that while the rich and powerful will indeed hide themselves under the mountains, it won&#39;t do them any good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I know about Nibiru is that our concept of it is based entirely on the writings of Zechariah Sitchin. So before you go off reciting the common Nibiru mythology, it would make sense to have a look at the guy who started this whole story.</p>

<p>Sitchin makes some pretty incredible claims..... so he should provide some serious evidence to back them up. What he gives us is his interpretation of the original Sumerian stories. There&#39;s a couple of problems here. Because Sitchin has no academic credentials to prove he even knows how to interpret Sumerian. He&#39;s been challenged by acknowledged academics to do so. What&#39;s more, he often fails to make proper references to the actual writings for many of his statements.</p>

<p>So if you actually go and take a look at the source material to check out his claims, you find that A) there&#39;s no way to find the actual verses.... or B) Sitchin&#39;s interpretation is incorrect.</p>

<p>I really like the whole Nibiru story, but tend to think of it as a sort of Sci-fi story based on one pseudo-academic&#39;s interpretation of some actual ancient writings. Having said all that, I do think it&#39;s possible that the Sumerians were more advanced than mainstream academics give them credit for. It&#39;s also possible that they inherited knowledge from older, more advanced cultures. I&#39;m just not convinced about the Annunaki/Nibiru/Planet X interpretation by Sitchin.</p>

<p>edit: Do yourself a favor and take a look at the opposing point of view. Search &quot;Nibiru debunked&quot; on youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We actually now know of at least two cultures that predate Sumer (ca. 3500 BC) by <em>thousands</em> of years.</p>

<p>One is the culture that built Catal Huyuk in 7500 BC. They had built a large town of at least a few thousand people which would have been considered a city back then. This is 4000 years older than the Sumerians.</p>

<p>Also there is what is considered to be some kind of temple at a place called Gobekli Tepe. It dates back to at least 10,000 BC. When I think about cultures like these that predate the 3500 BC figure we always hear about for Sumer and Egypt, it makes me wonder. How much more could they have advanced in all that time before they disappeared?</p>

<p>We went from Iron Age farming to the space age in about 1,200 years. What could they have done in 4,000?</p>

<p>is it possible that the Mayan calendar was off by several years?</p>

<p>No. Not at all. If they can predict the end of the world, they can get the dates right. Otherwise every crack pot complaining about the &quot;end times&quot; is right, plus or minus a few years/decades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is is possible that the planet could be in danger, and we&#39;re not being told, why bother to warn anyone, there&#39;s no room underground for the masses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The planet is in danger constantly, one lone asteroid can wipe us out completely. Hidden or no, this is reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The end of the world has nothing to do with Nibiru or the false prophecies of wrong religions.</p>

<p>The end of the world is caused by <em>us</em>.  &quot;By the fruits of their labors, they will be undone.&quot;</p>

<p>For a long time, I wondered why it is that Yahweh God would destroy his creation.  Why, in the Bible, does it say that He destroys us?  The answer is, He doesn&#39;t.  He told us what we were going to do, which is destroy ourselves, and we have accomplished that.</p>

<p>What&#39;s coming is famine, war, disease, and mutation.  It&#39;s going to be our own doing.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with any other prophecy from any other religion, and there is no such thing as Nibiru.</p>
