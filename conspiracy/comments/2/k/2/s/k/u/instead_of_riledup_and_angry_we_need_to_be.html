       The Powers That Be are extremely well organized and they thrive on chaos of the masses.  The more angry and scared people are, the easier it it to funnel their energy into their agenda.  As truth comes to light, the initial reaction is denial, followed by shock, followed by anger.  We need to take the next step, and come to a place of calm understanding.  From there we can begin to get together to take coordinated action to subvert the agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       There need not be one single, agreed upon plan, this is the MO of the power hoarders.  Instead we operate as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_group">
        autonomous groups
       </a>
       that can network when appropriate.  We need to use every means available to us.  If we get active, WE DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN THE WORLD
       <em>
        THEY
       </em>
       WANT US TO.   Do not fall into the defeatist trap.  That is part of their plan.  This is our planet and it's time we take it back.

       Totally agree. One of the first line of attacks tptb use is to try to squash any optimism. They want us to be cynics. There is a big change coming, and it will be very bumpy. One of the peoples main strengths is cooperation and compassion. Tptb don't have any powers against compassion. We will change the world, and it will be done with love and compassion for everyone. Absolutely everyone, we have to keep the door open for everyone, even bush and Blair. 
we have to share our food and shelter, water and compassion. We will breeze through this, but it must be peaceful. Otherwise we're just continuing the problem.
this is the last revolution, the revolution all before have been heading toward, we can choose to live any way we want, anything you can dream can be realised. Come brothers and sisters, let us build paradise here and now.

       They want us to riot so they could easily snuff us out to "keep the Peace" Collective consciousness is our best bet. We HAVE to get more people aware of the MSM matrix we are in. Most people IMO watch and believe what they're told through publication just because it seems more official. and yet they're the ones with the power to use these outlets of tv, radio, newspaper, and internet articles with a "validated" name. most people will ask you for sources when you present them with our ideas and i don't see these articles online being scrutinized the same.

       I think the next step is to convince the public that corporate news is fake. You'll never get anywhere on the individual issues until they learn to mistrust the news. Once that domino falls, it should be easy -- push 9/11, Iraq war buildup, JFK, Sandy hook... Whatever's obvious.

       The first plan is TO plan.  Everyone is going to have different ideas on how we should tranform the world and I say we try all of them.  Get together on the regular with real people near where you live.  Come together with a shared intention to make a difference and to come away with an actual plan of action, no matter how small.  Then share your experience with others so we can learn from each other's experience.  Stay positive, revise often, and don't lose focus on the goal.
