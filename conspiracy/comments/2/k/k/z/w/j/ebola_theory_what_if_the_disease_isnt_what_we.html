       Ok think about it, the media pushes fear into people and they keep saying "go get your flu shot" but do you know what exactly is in those needles? Millions of Americans are going to get the flu shot due to the fear ebola is causing not knowing the danger they're in but you need to be aware. This is just my theory so take it weigh a grain of salt but also think about why the media has hyped this particular flu vaccine right after ebola is in America.

       Okay, it just confused me.  I haven't heard anything about that easier, nor would it make sense because its a completely different virus, needing a completely different vaccine, and would make no sense to promote one for the other.

       Like I said, take it with a grain of salt but also Africa doesn't have the technology and the medicine we have (whether we choose to administer it is up to the government) but I believe we have the cure to all major illnesses but the money is in the disease so well never get it until we figure out how to mass produce it but we HAVE figured out how to mass produce a flu shot that millions of people take every year blindly and without knowing what's in the needle.

       There are some major issues with this theory though. First of all, this assumes that all doctors, governments, independent research groups, and more all know about this and are in on it. Considering the size of this group, I highly doubt this would not have already been made public by numerous sources, complete with peer-reviewed studies that prove their cures work. Secondly, this assumes that there is no money in actually curing this, which makes no sense. Take cancer for example. If you were to invent a cure for it, not only would you gain an absolute monopoly on cancer treatments and cures, but you'd still have people getting cancer since it wouldn't just disappear. On top of this, going back to the first point, the number of research groups soley dedicated to curing this is astounding, not to mention they have come up with better and better cures for cancer (it's still far from perfect, but it's significantly better than it was 50 years ago).

       But it's not hard to find out what's in vaccines. In fact it's usually a rather simple list of things.

       You're close.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have been seeing is one of the most effective marketing campaigns for a product that is currently in the works but was not deemed to be a money maker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think advertising meets Problem, Reaction, Solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 1:
       <em>
        create
       </em>
       a problem [We have no Ebola vaccine and everyone is dying!]
      </p>
      <p>
       By
       <em>
        create
       </em>
       , I merely been to hype up a fear campaign of epic proportions in both West Africa (where a ridiculous amount of natural resources are available and the US has currently sent 4,000
       <em>
        troops
       </em>
       to the area - did you know that?) and the United States. I am not saying the current Ebola scare isn't
       <em>
        real,
       </em>
       but it is dramatically overhyped.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is accomplishable because the bankers and multinational corporations that own the US Government (through a combination of ridiculous campaign financing laws and the flaw of fractional reserve central banking) and News media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US News Media goes along with it because Ebola is testing off the fucking charts, and that ad money is
       <em>
        good, baby
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2: Predict the Reaction [We need the vaccine! We need to restrict travel! Forced quarantines are not only safe, but an acceptable solution we would have
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       agree to 12 months ago].
      </p>
      <p>
       The US Government goes along with it because this will be a bonanza of possible excuses to further clamp down on the population, through federally mandated quarantine procedures first for those "exposed," and then those who
       <em>
        refuse the vaccine
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3: Provide the Solution [Ebola vaccine, more civil liberties discarded]
      </p>
      <p>
       The Big Pharma companies are fine with it, because this media campaign of hyped-up fearporn will obviously pay off for sales and dividends.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the People will go for it because of the hyped-up fearporn on all media outlets because they've been conditioned since 9/11 (can't post anything lately without it coming back to that...) to be scared, fearful, and the only solution is the active mobilization of troops to fight external threats (that's right - mobilization. Remember the shitshow of a conversation about when Putin had considered mobilization due to the bullshit in Ukraine).
      </p>
      <p>
       Their other solution is to give up rights and continually trade security for liberty, to crack down on domestic dissidents and
       <em>
        prevent terrorism
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the most logical interpretation to me. No zombie virus. No farfetched sci-fi shit. Just follow the money - and ask yourself:  "who benefits?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then ask yourself what you're going to do about it.

       This is pretty common knowledge. Also, who we should be sending instead if not the solders? We already have doctors there, and it would be a waste to have them be doing what these soldiers are going to do (mostly building stuff). So who else would the government send?

       It's a legitimate question and I thank you for reading that far at the very least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my contention is that a military problem should merit a military solution, and a health problem should have a health solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's my ignorance of the situation. While I do admit that the logistics of coordinating care for a pandemic is logistically difficult, we have sent more military troops to these areas than to the Middle East to counter our second most popular thing-to-be-afraid-of: The Islamic State by a factor of 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just doesn't seem proportional to me.

        I guess my contention is that a military problem should merit a military solution, and a health problem should have a health solution.

       I agree, but the thing that the solders are fixing isn't a heath problem, it's an infrastructure problem. And when it comes to infrastructure problems, the military is great at that due to large amounts of available manpower.

       Then that's all fair and good. Troop mobilization isn't really my main contention here. I threw it in merely due to a specific discussion last night with a close friend who was unaware of it.

       It started in West Africa, mismanagement in Dallas allowed it to spread. In reference to New York are you speaking on the 5 year old who tested negative for Ebola or the doctor who was working in West Africa fighting the disease? Either way quit giving in to the fear perpetuated by the media and unintelligent nut jobs, Ebola is not going to spread around the United States, the current Ebola situation will be gone by Christmas.

       So instead of being non biased and having a conversation, youre telling people they are wrong and you are right, and that you know you are right. You seem pretty intelligible...Lmao, sarcasm if you didnt catch that smarty.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think the entire ebola situation will be gone by Xmas or just here in the US(maybe you should clarify what you mean next time)? Got any more smart info to back that claim up, or are you just spitting out anything that comes to mind?
      </p>

       The CDC wouldnt be readying 50k vaccines by January if they thought their efforts would eradicate the virus by December.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mismanagement is the downfall to this entire thing. Mismanaged event after mismanaged event until we have something real. Are you too blind to see everything theyre doing is on purpose? They arent really THAT stupid. But they can always blame the little guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cant wait to see what you have to say. It might actually be something smart next time!

       The CDC is readying 50k vaccines because its a money game, profit can be made off the hysteria the media has created. Two people have contracted the Ebola virus in the United States, two of Thomas Duncan's nurses, because of a poor response from a Hospital in Dallas. Thomas Duncan's family and friends didn't contract Ebola because they knew exactly what the were dealing with. The US healthcare system is a for profit industry, it was not profitable for hospitals in the US to take steps they were told to months ago when the CDC warned hospitals to prepare for Ebola. Ebola will not be eliminated, just like the plague still exists today, but by christmas this outbreak will be under control across the world because of the efforts of the international community. You want to have a non-biased conversation, bureaucratic failures are what America is all about, they do not mean that anything is being done on purpose. Ebola victims have a stronger chance of surviving in the United States and that has been proven by the doctors and nurses that have contracted it and now test negative for the virus. More ebola patients will make their way to the United States, this does not mean our government is trying to cull the herd. I love a good conspiracy as much as the next guy but Ebola spreading in West Africa was a failure of international outreach and it spreading in the US is a failure of profit hungry hospitals not preparing for it properly.

       Obama already said that this current outbreak is to prepare for the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       airborne outbreak that is to come later. The CDC recently (finally) admitted that the current version of Ebola is airborne up to three feet, which is getting closer to the truth at least, but keep in mind that nobody has faith in the CDC besides obama and friends, so take their admission with a grain of salt. Whether this airborne outbreak Obama spoke of is going to be facilitated by the flu shot or the Ebola shot being rushed into production I don't know, but I wouldn't break any doors down to get either one.
