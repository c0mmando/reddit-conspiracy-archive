    <div class="md"><p>The amount of time it took for them to investigate, lack of resources provided to the &quot;committee&quot; to investigate, and the quick mass clean up and shipment of evidence to China should have alerted some red flags to people back then. Btw the 9/11 Committee&#39;s head board members, including vice chairman are ALL lawyers except for four. The other four professions are an investment banker, historian, doctorate in philosophy and a pharmacist. NO engineers or scientists..... I understand that in the wake of such an attack people lose logical sense to inherent emotions (fear) but looking back on everything, it makes absolutely no sense as to why these such &quot;prideful&quot; leaders kicked around dirt and twiddled their thumbs for an extended period of time. When it came time for war though, let&#39;s go in guns blazing? It literally took no time at all to convince these people that violence was the answer. Why the fuck have we not learned from history yet? Wars only cause death and flow money through the pockets of certain interest groups. Enough is enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps true if you count ONLY the 9/11 commission itself as &quot;investigating 9/11&quot;.  If you count money spent investigating 9/11 by FBI, NTSB, NYPD, NYFD, various state police agencies, border control, NSA, CIA, Congress, etc, I&#39;m sure far more was spent investigating 9/11.

<p>Yes you have.  Don&#39;t lie to yourself.</p>

<p>You have by virtue of the fact that you continue to allow the same old shit to keep happening from this government, and you keep dutifully paying those good ol taxes that help keep that war machine rolling on.

<p>And the worst part of this statement is that it shows that we the people have become so eviscerated and brainwashed by TPTB that we have completely lost sight of the fact that <em>we</em> as a united citizenry are the biggest, most powerful army that has ever, ever existed on this planet. TPTB know it...and that&#39;s why they work so hard to keep us brainwashed.  Meanwhile, we&#39;ve all but entirely forgotten that fact and spend our time bickering with one another instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One person stops paying their &quot;tribute&quot; and that person just becomes another example &quot;FOR&quot; the war machine telling you don&#39;t fucking think about not making tribute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  I don&#39;t disagree with that.  However, this is what can be called a &quot;peer pressure&quot; or &quot;threat of harm&quot; coercion tactic used to make you do something.  If you were to use that logic in a court of law as the reason why you stole something or broke into a house (&quot;Your honor, I was scared they were going to harm me. THAT&#39;S why I did it!&quot;) you&#39;d likely get your ass thrown in jail.  In other words, this is ultimately not any reason to continue buying (through our tax dollars) the munitions we do to kill millions upon millions of people a year in these wars of aggression.</p>

<p>And yet...we <em>do</em> keep giving away millions, and billions to the bullies that commit these crimes IN OUR NAME.</p>

<p>Yes.  In <em>our</em> name.</p>

<p>So what was that about &quot;It&#39;s not me!  It&#39;s <em>them!</em>&quot;?</p>

<p>No, man.  It&#39;s you.  It&#39;s me.  It&#39;s all of us doing this shit.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t agree with what&#39;s happening?  Yeah.  Well I don&#39;t agree with it either.  Don&#39;t try to extricate yourself from it, however, because you&#39;re only doing yourself and everyone around you a great disservice that way.</p>

<p>WE are responsible not only for the wars, but for their continuance.</p>

<p>It sucks, but so long as we don&#39;t all come together and <em>stop</em> it from happening, we have all of ZERO to say in terms of pointing the finger or talking too much shit against what&#39;s happening or against the people we&#39;re paying to keep doing it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much pointing the finger as much as it&#39;s putting a mirror up in front of your face.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>once you make yourself the &quot;standout&quot; or &quot;leader&quot; you automatically put the bullseye on you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then don&#39;t make yourself the &quot;standout&quot; or the &quot;leader&quot;.  Matter of fact, things would be much better if they were actually leaderLESS. We should ALL be the leaders <em>ourselves</em> that we wish to follow.  No individual should be the leader anyway.  The <em>principle</em> of proper action and working effectively toward a better future individually and collectively should be what leads action - not any one person or supposed &quot;leader&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to create a rebellion big enough to topple tptb you need to organize in secret and that statement explains why the NSA is spying on everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One doesn&#39;t need to organize in secret if EVERYONE were to organize in unison.  Nothing would need to be in secret at that point, because TPTB wouldn&#39;t be able to stop everyone anyway.  Again, it&#39;s about everyone coming together.  I understand that this wouldn&#39;t be nigh impossible at this point since we as a people are so divided, but - although you do have a point that a <em>lot</em> of plans would be best come up with in secret at this point - not ALL scenarios would have to involve the people getting together &quot;in secret&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If someone steps up and not many follow, it&#39;s over for him/her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would seem correct, and that is, unfortunately, also the very reason why we all stay back in line and allow ourselves to keep taking our ass pumpings like good, docile sheep.  So long as we continue doing this, however, <em>none</em> of us have any room whatsoever to EVER talk shit about <em>any</em> harm or evil that is going on in this world.</p>

<p>Because it is we that ALLOW it to keep happening.</p>

<p>We need to not worry too much about what happens to this vehicle - this little temporary, bag of skin and bones.  It&#39;s definitely going to go out sooner or later <em>anyway</em>.  Better to meet the inevitable end doing something worthwhile rather than cowering under a rock somewhere.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no different than anyone else, of course - I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m &quot;The next Christopher Dorner!&quot; or anything - but perhaps it would <em>really</em> be a good thing if we all were to be more Christopher Dorner-like in our willingness to stand up against the horrible corruption that exists and that we allow to continue going on in this world.</p>

<p>The question isn&#39;t &quot;How do you stop paying taxes?&quot; because the answer is very, very simple:  Just <em>stop paying taxes</em>.</p>

<p>The question is &quot;How do you keep from getting locked up by the criminal&#39;s goons? by the cops that the Federal Reserve-owned government have protecting them?&quot;  THAT&#39;S the question.</p>

<p>To be sure, there are indeed people who have fought the illegality of paying taxes, have gone to court, and have <em>won</em>, but that all gets suppressed so that more people don&#39;t catch on and do it themselves as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every job I&#39;ve had didn&#39;t give me the option not to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Understood.  Very, very difficult to go against the manipulation when the criminality is sanctioned by a large percentage of the corporation&#39;s smaller tiered underlings.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem to be anything that can be done on an individual level.  It seems to be something that would need citizen action on a collective, national level.</p>

<p>Indeed that is another piece of the puzzle. The unfortunate part is that you&#39;re incapable of picturing what the puzzle pieces form to be.</p>

<p>Going off of your backwards detective work, I am going to assume that you probably assume: For some reason I am a &quot;sleeper agent&quot; who poses as a person who wants everybody to be united (<a href="/r/unitedwestand">/r/unitedwestand</a>). Ironic, by the way, since you seem incapable of unity with me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve infiltrated the subreddit and I&#39;m going to eventually subvert it, amirite? Man, 7 months of dedication into a subreddit that has a positive outlook.</p>

<p>The more that you try to pin me as something I am not the more you make yourself look like a complete fool.</p>

<p>Welcome back. I actually forgot about you even though you&#39;ve been the most harassing stalker I&#39;ve encountered.</p>

<p>Yet for a person who seems to show such an interest in me it boggles my mind just how wrong you still are about such easily understood situations.</p>

<p>Because I am generous I will explain myself to you yet again. :)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on reddit since January 2010 with my original account. This was my alternate account. Around the beginning of this year I &quot;woke up&quot;. It completely changed the way I see everything.</p>

<p>Realizing that what I post isn&#39;t exactly  mainstream and that my main had years of personal information, I deleted my main. My alt, which I had few posts on, I scrubbed clean.</p>

<p>Here I am with months of contribution to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I feel I must be striking a nerve somewhere if I receive people like you whose sole purpose seems to be to follow and discredit my character.</p>

<p>Not sure what &quot;hasbara lackey&quot; is but the fact that you&#39;ve been so wrong for so long is borderline <em>cringeworthy</em>.</p>

<p>Yes! I&#39;m still here commenting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> like I always have been! And here you are still thinking that you know my intentions better than I know my intentions. Laughable if, like I said, it wasn&#39;t so cringworthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So <em>that&#39;s why</em> the structural steel was removed immediately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/groundzero/cleanup.html#ref1">The pace of the steel&#39;s removal was very rapid, even in the first weeks after the attack. By September 29, 130,000 tons of debris -- most of it apparently steel -- had been removed.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>More damning evidence that shows it was orchestrated from within.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FEMA&#39;s BPAT, who wrote the WTC Building Performance Study, were not given access to Ground Zero. Apparently, they were not even allowed to collect steel samples from the salvage yards. According to Appendix D of the Study:</p>

<p>Collection and storage of steel members from the WTC site was not part of the BPS Team efforts sponsored by FEMA and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).</p>

<p>That report said that &quot;about 50 personnel&quot; were in Monterey. The FBI had 11,400 special agents in the year 2000. </p>

<p>Funny, neither have I (being a daily commenter here). Yet welcome back to your attempt at discrediting my character.</p>
