        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I got into conspiracies around 1 and a half year ago, when my sister started showing 9/11 truth videos, and it all started making sense to me.</p>

<p>Ever since I started looking in more into other things and it opened my eyes to how much the whole system is corrupt, and how much today&#39;s society suck with the financial elites pretty much ruling everything and all the mass spying that is happening.</p>

<p>That caused me to go threw a major depression and has brought me to be a lot more synical about our world and future.</p>

<p>Since I don&#39;t want to ramble on and on about this here is my question: If you had a chance would you do like Cypher in the Matrix first movie and forget about everything to go back and living a normal life?</p>

<p>Ever since I started looking into all of this every one thinks I&#39;m a crazy &#39;&#39;conspiracy tard&#39;&#39; and the fact that I already have a low self esteem hurts a lot. Plus all of my friends don&#39;t believe or didn&#39;t look into the whole corruption and spying are all happier and easy minded.</p>

<p>IDK it just feels like sometimes it would just be easier to be a &#39;&#39;sheep&#39;&#39; (I&#39;m sorry for using this word I really hate it but just felt like the best way to describe what I would like to be for all of this to be easier...)</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the replies guys it helps alot, but once again my question was IF there was such a pill or thing to make you forget it all would you take it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happiness is relative. Society at large has been sedated with a cheap knockoff of true happiness and finding real fulfillment first begins by having a peek behind the curtain. You have taken that first step and now you must seek genuine fulfillment in this new paradigm. No one can tell you what that specifically means for you but don&#39;t sell yourself short. The powers that be seek to keep the potential of humanity hidden but now you can truly start to contribute to change for something better. </p>

You need to not give up ever we need people like us take the negatives and transform them no matter what. This is a pivotal time and there are none as brave, scarred and downright tough as us. We are all in pain,  the slave shackles are tight but we will break free KNOW THIS. This is inevitable,  the more you live and stay in the truth the more the lies will automatically be given light.

    <div class="md"><p>Have some faith people can figure things out on there own as well. My sense of always being right has blinded me to the fact that people are pretty capable.</p>

<p><a href="http://tomkenyon.com/hathors-archives">Hators</a> gives me hope, but I like reading about other worlds and ways of looking at things.
They have some sound meditations that really helped me.
Also burning White Sage helps me clear out negativity and focus on what needs to happen to get situations handled.
I&#39;m a firm believer that plants help you heal.</p>

<p>Hope that helps, Your words made me sad because I went down a path that involved self medicating one time, but I went to jail and hurt my family in the process. After I got out I never went back. Well I still have anger issues sometimes, but Im working though that with therapy. Sometimes we just accumulate a lot of bad karma/energy that needs to be looked and cleared before we can move forward.</p>

<p>If everyone tried to be positive and make their personal world a happy place then this place would be a lot less shitty. You can do your part and I guarantee that if you keep trying you will make yourself happier. It just takes time.</p>

<p>I like to just pretend that I&#39;m here for the experience. IF something good is happening I enjoy it and if something bad is happening I just try to accept it for what it is and take it in as a new experience. There&#39;s really nothing more you can do. Whether you are happy or not is primarily in your head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s crazy how backwards your intuition works in these situations.</p>

<p>I noticed it so much with some of my friends who I avoid talking conspiracies with just because I&#39;d rather keep that out of certian aspects of my life.</p>

<p>I noticed that if something is brought up and I jump on it and start explaining this and that I&#39;m met with resistence. However, if I stay on the sidelines and just interject a fact or thought here and there, ther&#39;s a decent chance that one of those friends will come to me in the later days with the exact idea I would have been trying to push on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trecked, I look at this as you need a certain amount of spirtual energy to be able to handle and comprehend some of these things that you are trying to get people to understand. If you dont have the necessary energy to hold it its just not going to happen. So your friends (if they are really your friends) will come to their own conclusions about the truth. IMHO we are all put here to learn truths but not all of us are here to learn the same truths or come to the same realizations at the same time. or maybe we are and we just need to be pacient for everyone to come to the realization.</p>

Conditioning people with that reaction is simple and cheap. They merely plant the seed in your mind by spreading fake conspiracies and attempting to group all conspiracies together, focusing on a few negative crazies, trying to make them representative of a broad group of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of sheeple is that there is a tendency for there to be a mass culture,  and people tend to be part of it.</p>

<p>In other words,  society has conventions,  and it depends on conventions,  without which there could be no continuity,  and a lot of the things that civilization brings,  clean water,  cars,  electricity,  would not happen.</p>

<p>So,  we are a part of this society.   Problem is that it needs myths,  or it needs simplifications of &quot;truth&quot;.   We find out that these &quot;truths&quot; are massaged,  and often those at the top are helping that along,  not always with our best interests in mind,  or at least it looks like they benefit more than we do,  but its hard to know,  and there are not exactly alternatives that we can control to know that there were better ways things could have been done.</p>

<p>Anyway,  I wanted to say that when we give up believing the official story of xyz,  there are dozens of alternative groups that are also out there trying to get us to join in their version.   We often end up trading one kind of pablum for another.</p>

<p>Or,  and it can seem lonely,  or even impossible,  we don&#39;t fully quit the world we grew up with,  and we don&#39;t join a new reality that Alex Jones or some other savior is putting out there.</p>

<p>We realize the world we grew up in isn&#39;t exactly truthful,  but we also realize that there is no version that is,  not Alex or Marrs,  or any of them have the whole truth.    We become critical,  and we have the patience to survive in a place that is a lot more fluid than we had anticipated.    Its called growing up.    Not replacing one infantile tit for another one.</p>

<p>Whatever bridges you burned,  for the sake of social survival,  you might want to at least partially rebuild them.   You can respect someone for being a good mechanic,  a good farmer,  without looking down on them because they did not make it a priority to find out what was going on behind the facade of conventional truth.    We are not going to benefit ourselves or anyone else by pulling away from the ordinary world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of the conspiracies make us believe that we are overpowered by people that are working against democracy and life.<br/>
But such people have really no other power than making us believe that we are incapable of doing anything. The more people accept the reality and want this to change, the less power such people really have.  </p>

<p>Look at the racism that was still active not so many years ago. Now it is not generally accepted anymore. Before that, even slavery was very common.  </p>

<p>The good thing for the future is that we as people, will not accept this corruption of democracy and corruption of life anymore. It will take a bit of time, but it will happen. The more people know about this stuff, the more people will stand up against all secrecy and all the underlying corruption.  </p>

<p>It will take some time for humanity to grow up and leave this phase behind.</p>

The differences are, I&#39;m a man, I&#39;ve been involved in the conspiracy and government subterfuge stuff for 10 years.

But I have been teaching my grandsons to see the real world and now my son is also on board. That makes me feel like I have done at least a little good. </p>

<p>Like you I have been using oxys to make things easier. I started on them due to a shoulder injury a few years ago. That&#39;s when I realized they also helped my state of mind. They make me feel euphoric and make it easier to handle the things I see going on and the condition of our country. Oh what a mistake that was! I have an appointment at a rehab facility at 1PM tomorrow where I am checking myself in for at least 7 days. I have never been without oxys for even one day since I began them, so needless to say, I am scared shitless of what&#39;s in front of me. Take care and good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have gone though some major depression as well coming to all these realizations. But you know what? after awhile I stopping being depressed. I mean literally no depression about anything any more. I have some times where I dont know whats going to happen next, but I am relativity OK about it cause i know the answer will come to me.</p>

<p>This is mostly because I do regular mediation and spiritual work on myself. The thing that really helps me is working on my inner stuff, thats what makes us feel less than who we are. You should take a look at The <a href="http://tomkenyon.com/hathors-archives">Hathor Material</a> sometime. You might think its a load a crap and it might be, but it gives me peace to know that other races outside of our world think about how we as humans are doing right now. This is one of the hardest times to be alive the Hathors say because we are going though a major shift in consciousness, all of us. </p>

<p>And we actually might make it though whats coming this time as it is believed history is circular and we have destroyed ourselves several times before or something.</p>

<p>Carlos Castenada books have been a huge help for me on this path, some people have negative things to say about is work. But I feel like Don Juan is a real person and a bringer of truth. </p>

<p>Truth is the hardest thing to live with but also the most rewarding.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you mean. It&#39;s as if every quiet moment is spoiled by the seemingly insoluble question: how the fuck am I supposed to exist in this world? You can&#39;t unsee the corruption, the delusion and the deliberate impediments to humanity&#39;s improvement that we didn&#39;t cause, but were born into. Not only that, but to look into history all we see is more of the same as far back as it is possible to look.</p>

<p>But then, you realize that not only is it more of the same, but that in all likelihood all of history is misrepresented. The winning side sanitized and the losing side demonized. How many times must history have been reimagined and rewritten. This explains its storybook character. But who cares? Nobody really ever seems to learn from it apart from those whose intention it is to ensure the best bits get a rehashing in their lifetimes.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s no solace there. I like to think there was a good civilization once upon a time, maybe 13 thousand years ago like Graham Hancock et al. purport. To escape, I love reading or watching documentaries about these unsolved mysteries, try to solve them myself, but its really about spending time in a world that I&#39;m still truly ignorant about its good or evil. It seems enlightened so I idealize it if only to have at least one happy place to inhabit.</p>

<p>That kind of acts as a bridge for me, because there&#39;s some evidence that the meter, the unit of length, was known to the constructors of the pyramids as it is known today. Could that mean there has been a contiguous, unbroken tradition or lineage dating back to 11,000BC? It is my hope that whereas the tradition on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is to see all corruption emanating from a single, dominating, ideology, that at least the evil in the world is fractured, and that there are benevolent and powerful forces competing for the greatest good for humanity.</p>

<p>All one can do is watch the show. You&#39;re not obligated to teach anyone else the open secret of the world&#39;s corruption, these days just about anyone could unravel many of the delusions with one google search in one afternoon. If people can&#39;t manage that, who gives a shit? Most &#39;mainstream&#39; people&#39;s sanity seems to be so precarious you could puncture it with a wet finger. A single acid trip can completely disrupt an ordinary person&#39;s world view, which goes to show how much they&#39;ve attempted to think beyond whatever&#39;s on their plate at any given moment.</p>

<p>But, that&#39;s the way the world has always been. It&#39;s neither of our faults. If it wasn&#39;t the television doing the deluding it&#39;d be the pastor or whoever else in the village with the will to profit from the human yearning for a coherent world view, even an artificial one.
The problem is how to avoid the trap of greed? Would you kill one person to feed a billion? How could you say no? But somehow, feeding that billion doesn&#39;t seem so important when all of life&#39;s pleasures suddenly become available.</p>

<p>The problem is systemic and writhes silently under our collective veneer. Everyone&#39;s deluded to a point, or would at some point feel uncomfortable once enough layers are removed. Ego death is terrifying, at least initially.</p>

<p>So it seems the lot of the thinking man is to bear witness to the ludicrousness of mankind, so we may as well just go along with it. Deride it openly, mock it and speak the truth as it is apparent to you. Those who have it in them to hear will listen. There&#39;s no point worrying that you&#39;ll probably never strike a deadly blow against the forces of deception, I&#39;m not sure if anyone really does. I have a feeling that people enlighten themselves then attribute the phenomenon to a suitable leader figure retrospectively.</p>

<p>The scope of modern ICT makes us focus on the totality of The Problem, which is of course insoluble. We forget that as individuals, our best fought battles are local, within our families and social circles.
What&#39;s the worst that can happen, anyway. I guess reincarnation could be real and we&#39;ve got 10,000 years of desperation and misery ahead of us. Better keep working on The Project, which is somehow, one day, fixing all this shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing much to believe in with conspiracies, very few turn out to be factual. After watching conspiracies here long enough, they all start to look similar, and they largely all lose credibility. You can spot the same patterns over and over. You can see who is selling what idea for what purpose.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may be true but the 1% that turn out to be true have such massive implications  for society. I am hugely comforted by the people in this sub who are critical thinkers, rejecting the stories told by the powerful and asking questions. </p>

<p>Sure not everyone is good at critical thinking here and in every large group there&#39;s going to be a few loose nuts. But the positives outweigh the negatives.</p>

<p>because its the same shit organizations doing the same stupid shit over and over again.</p>

<p>for example, serious financial stupidity runs on a thirty year cycle, most of the old hands in walls street who could remember 1981 are either retired or dead, the few senior survivors are high enough and crooked enough to profit massively from 2009. the young ones are naive enough to believe miracles can happen.</p>

<p>politics runs on cycles, four or eight years for US elections obviously, but other longer cycles where mistakes become forgotten and are repeated.</p>

<p>knowledge and experience and learning, educate yourself to discern truth from fantasy, become an expert.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well when I talk about it it&#39;s not crazy conspiracys like the moon landing was fake or that the government agents are half reptile ( I simply don&#39;t believe in those type of conspiracies and find them to be totally absurd)
It is  more about the corruption, financial elite, mass spying, how media and certain information is controlled or manipulated to push a certain agenda, and so on if you catch my drift</p>
