       I don't think the moon landing was fake, most of the movie Zeitgeist was complete bullshit, Hitler very likely committed suicide (He had a lot of health problems that were gonna kill him soon anyway), the war in Iraq was not because of oil, the Illuminati only exists in Youtube comments, and while I do believe that there was likely evidence that Mossad knew 9/11 was going to happen, I doubt it was set up by a government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't believe that things like Sandy Hook or the Boston Bombings are fake.  We have millions of people here in America, and statistically speaking, a few guys are gonna go crazy and do some shit like that.  I do believe that the government tries to capitalize on these events in order to take away things such as our second amendment rights.

       Do you have an opinion on what it was for then?
      </p>
      <p>
       First off I think we can all agree that it's far more nuanced than a single reason. However, I think oil was part of it and I have found that when most people say it wasn't for oil they are talking about literally going over there and shipping the oil back to the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my eyes it was a way to secure control of the region with its oil fields and pipelines. It wasn't to get us oil and lower the price of gas, it was to secure a few more decades of American imperialism in the region.

       Mainly Israeli interests.  Israel hates the idea of unified Arab nations ruled by a stable and secular dictator, they much prefer it that Middle Eastern nations go into chaos, because it gives them an advantage.  This isn't the first time Israel has used divide and conquer tactics, either.  One of the former PMs of Israel even wrote in one of his books how Israel on purposely tried to instigate the Lebanese Syrian War between Christians and Muslims.

       Yes they do capitalize on tragedy to take our freedoms away. I forget who said it, it was a Democrat. He said never let a good tragedy go to waste. You can get stuff done that you might not have other wise been able to do before the strategy

       I also didn't believe the moon landing was fake until I looked into it. Have you read much about it? It's one of those things that if you believe people immediately start throwing around the tinfoil hat comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you actually look at all the evidence, I believe you'll be fully convinced that there is absolutely no possible way that we've been to the moon.

       The reason why the moon landing was probably not fake is because if it were fake, the Soviet Union would have pointed it out and talked about it. But the Soviet Union never did, they just accepted it. Also, you can actually see footprints on the moon if you use a telescope that is good enough.

       As nice as the thing about the footprints would be if it were true, it's actually physically impossible to resolve details that small on the moon from as far away as the earth. It's been 20 years since I did physics at university, but google telescope magnification resolution and you'll see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, there are many societies that hold, en masse, 'conspiracy theories'. For example, almost everybody in the middle east doesn't believe the holocaust really happened and that the Jews are just promoting the myth to garner undeserved sympathy. Most people in Germany think 911 was an inside job. In fact, at some points in time up to a third of Americans reportedly held significant doubt about the reality of the moon landing, in the years soon after the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean is that the MSM misinformation machine is so effective in suppressing alternative hypotheses, it wouldn't matter if everybody on earth outside the US knew that it was a freakshow of astronomical proportions, those inside would mostly remain none the wiser.

       Except that is what happened.  The was no order by Hitler to exterminate all the Jews.  I'm not denying that Jews were rounded up and sent to camps, and often lived under bad conditions and there were cases of mistreatment by officers, but there was no official document to kill all the Jews.  Also, many myths such as turning Jews into soap have been discredited even by Jewish historians.  As for the number of Jews who died, the numbers have been radically changing over the years.  I just saw the Holocaust propaganda film "Night and Fog" a few days ago, and the lying Jewish narrator claimed that 9 million Jews died in Auschwitz.

       Sure, I know all about that. I'm just pointing out that you can have 1 Billion muslims not believing in the holocaust yet never hear that that's the case. I can't remember the percentage of Russians that don't believe in the moon landing, but I recall it was pretty high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, please do look into the moon landing stuff. It's almost relieving to hear the story. Back then, they had far less practice in pulling off hoaxes, and everyone was a bit less knowledgable about things like the practicalities of space travel, so the stories they used to explain the discrepancies sound very fanciful by today's standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if they tried to explain the collapse of the twin towers as a case of spontaneous combustion, and pointed to supposed incidences in history of that having occurred. That's how silly we're talking.

       One interesting tidbit was Sept. 12, 2011. Libya was telling us Benghazi was a terrorist attack while Obama and his minions were trying to claim that pesky video was the cause. That was one wake-up call. US media lies nonstop. The only real stuff on MSM is when firemen rescue a cat from a tree. The rest is full-on propaganda.

       Bill, this is a very long answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say my awareness came to me gradually. An early epiphany also came by rising up above the left-right paradigm, because clearly the democrats and republicans are part of the same problem. This was a part of the realization because groupthink is never a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in terms of news sources, there are plenty of internet sources that provide truth and in comparing that to MSM, its easy to see which is propaganda.

       You know, while on this topic, I'll say that Professor James Tracy from Florida Atlantic University is one of my heroes. He is a professor of Communications and Media and I admire him very much for his bravery. He runs a really great blog titled the Memory Hole blog. I absolutely recommend it. Academic Freedom is a great thing. Students also have Academic Freedom.

       That the Boston bombings were fake. It makes no sense to me that anyone (government or other entity) would hire actors to fake the entire thing when it is far simpler and has a much lower likelihood of exposure to plant an actual bomb.

       I think it's way more likely that the Tsarnaev brothers were under the watch of the FBI and something went wrong of they decided to go on their own. The idea that it was staged or filmed beforehand is really hard to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that the FBI has a
       <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/22/fbis-phony-war-terror">

       Contrails, UFO conspiracies, bigfoot being alive and thriving, chtulu (?), illuminati and-slash-or freemasons running things, moon landings being a hoax, 9-11 being an internal job to bring us to the middle east, and sandy hook being a hoax. All them things I think are silly as shit.

       Edited to add the boston marathon being a hoax. Nuts to that one, too.

       Chemtrails. There is a simple scientific explanation for every claim the chemtrailers make such as "Contrails don't persist" (they do), and "There are patents which prove it's happening" (No they don't; they prove something entirely non-chemtrail-related is happening).

       I remember reading somewhere that Rahm Emanuel's father was very likely an actual Israeli terrorist, and that his father's Wikipedia page immediately got taken down right before he ran for Mayor of Chicago.

       Rahm Emmanuel's father was a Zionist extremist.  He was even a member of an Israeli paramilitary terrorist organization.
