<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong> - A mod just claimed to me in the ongoing modmail discussion I prompted that this number is exaggerated. Apparently the bans were for merely quoting a wide range of unspecified, unsatisfactory numbers relating to the subject matter.</p>

<p><strong>In this thread user pomohomomofo posted the following comment:</strong>
How do Holocaust deniers exist and what evidence could they possibly have? I&#39;ve never looked into it before because it&#39;s too upsetting to think about. I don&#39;t know if this is an appropriate place to talk about it, but I wish I could understand.</p>

<p><strong>My post, which was later upvoted by users, was the following:</strong></p>

<p>don&#39;t disregard claims because you find them upsetting, thats irational, just look at a few videos on youtube to find out, they dont deny the dead they deny there being actual gas chambers and that numbers were bloated after the war
you need to look at both sides of all issues, allies bombed supply lines and cities, you think prisoners had plenty of food in the final days of the war prior to being liberated? or that germans starved people that they had in those camps for around 5 years
don&#39;t jump on hate bandwagoning, that&#39;s how horrible stuff happens to people
there is dirt, torture and cruelty in every country&#39;s history, written or not, depending on the results of wars
110,000 japanese-americans were also kept in camps in the US, so don&#39;t think that country was somehow a savior, they&#39;d be walking skeletons too if germany or japan invaded mainland US and won the war and all supply lines were destroyed during the final stages of the war
The fact that there were mass killings of innocent citizens during the war is not being disputed, what are disputed are claims that those camps were death camps and the numbers being thrown around are questioned
don&#39;t embrace ignorance and hate speech labels like &quot;holocaust deniers&quot; when historians try to do their job that&#39;s how it&#39;s illegal in certain areas to even investigate or suggest anything but the accepted version, even if it&#39;s completely professional&quot;</p>

<p><strong>What followed was an immediate ban from a child in charge of moderation of the subreddit:</strong></p>

<p>you have been banned from posting to <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a>: History.
note from the moderators:
&quot;Not that is not disputed, any claims in that regard have been long debunked. bye. &quot;</p>

<p>When I protested this, I found out from &quot;moderator&quot; davidreiss666 that <strong>&quot;We banned a good number (maybe 100+) of actual deniers of the Holocaust today. Your moral relativism is not welcome here. Go sell crazy someplace else.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>How are the pieces of shit even in a moderator position if they can&#39;t separate an explanation from a promotion of a point of view. The only thing I was promoting was educating one&#39;s self and not succumbing to hate speech labels and censorship, ironically exactly what happened to me immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>They recognized this fact, that I wasn&#39;t spouting holocaust denial or profascist stuff or whatever, <strong>as my post was not deleted and was upvoted by users as part of the discussion</strong>. But the mods still banned me as a &quot;holocaust denier&quot;</p>

<p>two times I replied in protest, both times those idiots called me a holocaust denier</p>

<p><strong>I don&#39;t know in how many words I can make clear that my post was not promoting the denial of the holocaust</strong></p>

<p>I posted this here so others can read just how incompetent people who get to be moderators can be. I dont know if they are just hunting people they think they&#39;re in disgreement with, or they&#39;re power hungry kids, or they just lack reading comprehension. It reminds me of why I delete accounts to this site so often in disgust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here in Australia, just earlier this year when there was debate about whether to go back to Iraq to fight ISIS, I noticed that SBS, our public multicultural channel started a war film festival – things like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as well as documentaries and various other foreign films in the same genre.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t decide whether, if there was an agenda behind the timing of it, the intention was to either drum up support for war or dissuade against it. I figured it was the latter as the focus seemed to be on the horror of war, not the glory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, SBS has &quot;movie seasons&quot;, a few weeks of movies of a similar theme, style or origin, a few times every year. It&#39;s really nothing unusual for SBS. While it&#39;s tempting to do so, I wouldn&#39;t read too much into it... especially when you consider that most Aussies would rather be watching <em>MasterChef</em> than even looking at what&#39;s on SBS.</p>

<p>Nobody cares about facts anymore, the source is paramount on reddit.  If it&#39;s not from the big 5 it&#39;s blogspam and anti-semitism.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;We banned a good number (maybe 100+) of actual deniers of the Holocaust today.&quot;</p>

<p>The Holocaust Inquisition.</p>

<p><strong>BELIEVE OR DIE!!!</strong> </p>

<p>It&#39;s not history... it&#39;s RELIGION.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong>: The Holocaust was undoubtedly a unique event - not simply the in grisly details of what happened, where, when and how, but in the way it has come to be viewed and treated by historians, and by  Western society in general.</p>

<p>Unlike other well documented instances of genocide and crimes against humanity, the Holocaust has become venerated by <em>secular</em> society, held as sacrosanct... unquestionable, untouchable, and woe be unto those that would dare broach the topic without the attendant reverence!</p>

<p>The Holocaust is &quot;hallowed ground&quot;: One is expected to accept, in whole and without question, every detail that has been added to the Holocaust Canon by the Priest-Class (Holocaust Historians) that have been charged with guarding the &quot;memory&quot; of this sacred event for time and all eternity.</p>

<p>Make no mistake: When the subject of the Holocaust is raised, <em>your moral character will be judged</em> on whether or not you respond <em>properly</em>, and those that fail the test can expect to be ostracized, shunned and shamed. Indeed, in many countries, those that persist on certain lines of inquiry or who dare DENY the Dogma and Tenets may well find themselves subject to secular punishment in the form of fines, and/or imprisonment... and students or academics who dare fix their &#39;unclean gaze&#39; on the Holy of Holies risk losing their careers for the violation.</p>

<p>The Holocaust has taken on the aura of a secular pseudo-religion - replete with a &quot;devil&quot; figure (Hitler and his demons), martyrs (the victims - especially Jewish victims), Salvation (the blessed State of Israel), shrines scattered throughout the world (Holocaust museums and memorials), a &quot;priest-class&quot; (Holocaust &quot;Historians&quot; and the &quot;Survivors&quot;) and of course the HERETICS (anyone who &quot;denies&quot;, or fails to honor the event with proper reverence).</p>

<p>The political ramifications of the sanctification of the Holocaust are another matter - but should be obvious.</p>

<p>Is what I wrote above a &quot;species of Holocaust denial&quot;.</p>

<p>Why or why not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have seen, conservatives and especially libertarians are MUCH more open minded to controversial subjects such as the Holocaust or just taboo subjects in general such as race and society.  I know many people who fit that category who may not be white nationalists, but they are sympathetic towards the cause.  Liberals on the other hand, often just put their hands over their ears, and try not to listen or talk about anything that may offend their religious dogma of egalitarianism.  </p>

<p>First, thanks for admitting that you were lying when you said <em>&quot;All of whom are, according to you, filthy liars.&quot;</em> </p>

<p>That&#39;s refreshing.</p>

<p>Second, regarding the &quot;Sonderkommando survivors&quot;, your assertions are extremely vague - you seem to be implying that they are either all liars who are always lying, or that none of them ever lied. Would you care to be more specific?</p>

<p>THIRD, your accusations reek of Religious Inquiry, as you seem poised ready to judge my <em>moral character</em> based on whether or not I unquestioningly accept, <em>on faith</em>, every jot and tittle of the Holocaust lore - and that would tend to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2kq1sm/thought_police_gone_wild_100_posters_in_rhistory/clnw6sx">validate my initial post</a>, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

That&#39;s why Reddit made sure it&#39;s quite difficult to use things like TOR to anonymously post content - they want to make sure they can log your IP.</p>

<p>But ah well, being a force for good is worth the risk to me.</p>

<p>Really, though, Reddit is a cesspool overall. I&#39;ll just take the opportunity to spread the truth when it arises, even if I have to wallow in the filth, because it&#39;s so hard to find anyone who cares.</p>

Common Dreams<br/>
The Double Identity of an &quot;Anti-Semitic&quot; Commenter</p>

<p>Smearing a Progressive Website to Support Israel</p>

<p>Like many other news websites, Common Dreams has been plagued by inflammatory anti-Semitic comments following its stories. But on Common Dreams these posts have been so frequent and intense they have driven away donors from a nonprofit dependent on reader generosity.</p>

<p>A Common Dreams investigation has discovered that more than a thousand of these damaging comments over the past two years <strong>were written with a deceptive purpose by a Jewish Harvard graduate in his thirties who was irritated by the website&#39;s discussion of issues involving Israel.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? Reddit is indeed Jewish-owned, and if you don&#39;t think they made sure those who would push their propaganda were in control of what would obviously become the most popular sub-reddits, such as <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, you&#39;ve got some learning to do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that the so-called &quot;elite&quot; like to foster enmity between Jews and &quot;Gentiles&quot;. I&#39;m not trying to do that. Most Jews are just pawns for these people, and so-called &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; keeps Jews toeing the party line by making them feel like victims, just like the Holohoax does. But to deny that Jewish tribalism is a factor here is ignorant.</p>

<p>No one can help how they&#39;re born. Regardless of the realities of nepotism and &quot;tribalism&quot;, being Jewish or <em>any other label</em> that&#39;s out of one&#39;s control is an incredibly weak point to lean on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people care about truth, some would rather argue about political correctness. Anti-semitism is an ad hominem attack against those who protest Jewish lies and manipulation. Even some Jews are referred to as anti-semites for not toeing the party line.

<p>Okay, so getting banned for an on-topic opinion is pretty absurd. There&#39;s no question there. That the opinion happened to be reprehensible is not pertinent.</p>

<p>On the gripping hand, this idea that everywhere there&#39;s a desire to shut down holocaust deniers is some sort of Jewish conspiracy is absurd. Reddit isn&#39;t the enemy. It&#39;s embraced a wide variety of people who had no voice (brony conspiracy theorist conspiracy hype!) In most popular venues. There have been bad mods. There have been terrible mods.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you ran into problems because the post you wrote is exactly what a holocaust denier would write, right down to the poor syntax, irrelevant details, and logical fallacies. So even if your purpose was only to demonstrate the errors of a denier, the mods really can&#39;t be blamed for mistaking you for one of them.</p>

<p>Holocaust deniers really don&#39;t have a place in <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a>, since they are either tragically stupid or actively bigoted. The bigoted ones are the worst, of course, and there&#39;s really no reason to give them a platform. Since you are not a denier, I think you can agree that they are some of the most slimy, abhorrent liars on the planet. I don&#39;t think they need to be allowed in a sub that attempts to talk about the truth.</p>

<p>Then you clearly haven&#39;t actually tried looking for a 3rd party. There have been quite a few observatories that can and have done this. On top of this, this is a tiny piece of evidence, since there are many more pieces of evidence that give absolute proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtlPlZGvgY0">here&#39;s a documentary</a> of nothing but Holocaust survivors talking about the camps.  They&#39;re talking about the tea parties and bands and plays and movie theaters and soccer leagues and art classes and libraries and on and on it goes.  Appears some of the survivors had it better off in the camps than they did in the ghettos!  None of that stuff happened in the Soviet camps.  Which, by all accounts, were far far worse.  The only reason we give all this attention to Jews and the Nazis is because A) Jews rule the media so they get to talk about themselves all the time and B) without the Soviet allies, Europe would have fallen to the Germans.  So we overlook their psychopathic brutality and massive human rights violations and attribute it all to the Nazi losers instead.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seemed to be an implication that an established narrative is true until proven otherwise in virtue of its being established. I think the counter to that, which quite a few people are expressing in this thread, is we needn&#39;t have proof contradictory to the established narrative before we are allowed to seriously challenge it. For example, there are a couple of great posts in this thread where people respond to others&#39; questions about the validity of certain statements and statistics about Jewish internment/extermination, providing reference and argument. The point is simply that all questioning should be considered just as valid as the official narrative itself; official narratives ought to be established in virtue of their ability to consistently answer questions - so we should not place the burden of proof on the asker of the question to disprove the official narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stablished narrative is seen like this because it has been widely accepted by experts, and has enough evidence behind it to justify it over other theories. As for questioning being considered at the same level as the accepted model, that doesn&#39;t really make sense. Just because you can question something doesn&#39;t mean you have any idea at all how it works, and there is really no reason to take it at the same value. In the same way that the established narrative regarding the solar system is Heliocentrism. If someone then tries to claim it&#39;s actually geocentric, then of course it&#39;s not going to be given the same weight as the heliocentric model, because we have direct proof of the heliocentric model. Now if you can prove that the heliocentric model is wrong, and the geocentric model is right, then you&#39;d have a lot more weight behind your theory. This is how science works, and I honestly have no idea why Holocaust denial should not have to abide by these rules.</p>

<p>That&#39;s great and all, but it doesn&#39;t somehow excuse the genocide that took place after. It also was not just to get them out of Germany, but to make it easier to contain them, so their goals weren&#39;t exactly altruistic here.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a cop-out. If you make a claim, I kinda need actual proof, so I know you didn&#39;t just make it up. And if there is such evidence, it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to link it.</p>

<p>This is weird, since according to most deniers, there were gas chambers used for delousing and chambers for gassing, but although they were built identically, only the gassing chambers had these issues.</p>

<p>Oh, that&#39;s simple. I simply stopped reading or replying to your responses after you seemd to imply, without any sources, that it is literally impossible for any iron-cyanide compounds to form in the alleged homocidal &quot;gas chambers&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in other words, you stopped reading before I even began? Because I explained the issue in like, the first sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We were going around in circles, and this was but one anomaly - so why should I waste my time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you <em>posted a damn video regarding that explicit anomaly</em>. </p>

<p>Also, since you clearly didn&#39;t read my comment from before, I&#39;ll just go ahead and post it again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because of this, there was an increased probability of forming Prussian Blue, while in the gas chambers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No because I&#39;m referring to the delousing chambers in this sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you meant to type &quot;decreased probability&quot;. But this is not a matter of diminshed probability. The chemical reaction did not take place there at a rate higher than the control rooms - i.e. non-gassing rooms which were occasionally decontaminated with HCN!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, this is rather unsurprising. As with both areas, the time and concentration of gas was lower than the delousing chambers, which is why there would be little to no formation. First of all, any chem 101 course could tell you that reactions do not happen instantaneously, and in many cases is going to take a very long while to form unless you either add a catalyst, increase the temperature, or <em>increase the concentration/amount added</em>. In other words, because of the relatively small amount used and the shorter time, <strong>the reaction did not have time to finish all the steps</strong>. This is again unsurprising considering that after doing some research I found that there are around a dozen or so steps to form Prussian Blue from HCN, and some of those steps take quite a while to complete without doing any of the listed things from before. Secondly, you accidentally proved my point when you said</p>

<ul>
<li>i.e. non-gassing rooms which were occasionally decontaminated with HCN!</li>
</ul>

<p>If these rooms were in fact decontaminated with HCN (which you seem to agree with), then if we were to go by your logic we would have to see Prussian Blue residue, except we don&#39;t. This perfectly shows how Prussian Blue is not a reaction that is likely to form unless there is enough time/concentration to allow the reaction to complete. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, NO iron-cyanide compounds were detected above the control figure. Your explanation amounts to a &quot;well, there mustn&#39;t have been as much HCN, so that reduced the probability of Prussian Blue forming to 0%&quot;, in other words, according to you, it must have been impossible for Prussian Blue to form in the &quot;gas chambers&quot;, even on a sub-visible level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, that is kinda what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m saying that because the conditions did not favour the reactions (since it&#39;s a very unfavourable reaction overall), there would likely not have been any (or if there was, it would be extremely small), due to taking much less time and using much less in the gas chambers than in the delousing chambers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This absurd argument, again made without reference to any authority beyond your own ability to cut-n-paste the formula for Prussian Blue, effectively signals your capitulation. I thank you for your effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is chemistry of solutions 101 stuff. It&#39;s not particularly complicated at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not even going to start about the lack of ventilation, the non-airtight doors, the breakable windows,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of which could also be said about the delousing chamber. What&#39;s your point here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the claims that Sonderkommando ate and drank while clearing the rooms, immediately after the gassing. (No ventilation time, even if the buildings were designed to ventilate, and no gas masks!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Admittedly, the Sonderkommando were Jewish, so I&#39;m rather unsurprised that the Nazis cared so little about them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That goes for all locations, as there is no direct forensic or document evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve given you again, multiple different pieces of evidence that were <em>not</em> testimonies from after the end of the war, you&#39;ve just ignored them so far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You realize at Nuremberg they accused the Nazis of killing 20,000 people at Auschwitz with an atomic bomb?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it was incredibly stupid, and also only brought up once, since it was quickly explained to be an idiotic argument. On top of this, just like with the lampshades, this was only talked about for a short time, regarding only a single person. To say that this means that the entirety of the Nuremberg trials were wrong is jumping the gun a lot.</p>

<ul>
<li>MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Now, I have certain information, which was placed in my hands, of an experiment which was carried out near Auschwitz and I would like to ask you if you heard about it or knew about it. The purpose of the experiment was to find a quick and complete way of destroying people without the delay and trouble of shooting and gassing and burning, as it had been carried out, and this is the experiment, as I am advised. A village, a small village was provisionally erected, with temporary structures, and in it approximately 20,000 Jews were put. By means of this newly invented weapon of destruction, these 20,000 people were eradicated almost instantaneously, and in such a way that there was no trace left of them; that it developed, the explosive developed, temperatures of from 400š to 500š centigrade and destroyed them without leaving any trace at all. Do you know about that experiment? SPEER: No, and I consider it utterly improbable. If we had had such a weapon under preparation, I should have known about it. But we did not have such a weapon. It is clear that in chemical warfare attempts were made on both sides to carry out research on all the weapons one could think of, because one did not know which party would start chemical warfare first. </li>
</ul>

<p>So in other words, they heard this somewhere, and after asking whether or not it was true, were quickly told it was patently false, and that the Nazis were nowhere close to creating an Atomic Bomb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They brought in shrunken heads, lampshades supposedly made of human skin, soap they said was made of people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ve already been over these.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now we know all of that stuff about skin and soap and atomic bombs is nonsense - you claimed not to be familiar with this, so I&#39;d recomend you learn a little about the Nuremberg show trials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I&#39;m aware of the story, I&#39;ve just never heard anyone claim this ever. Much in the same way I&#39;ve heard of theories that the moon is a hologram, but have yet to encounter anyone who would make such a stupid claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You must be aware, at least, that they brought forward witnesses to say that thousands were gassed at camps in the western zone! Even mainstream &quot;historians&quot; (well, lawyers, like Hilberg) would now admit those witnesses must have been lying, if they were ever to actually talk about this stuff. Proven lying eyewitnesses. The &quot;historians&quot; pick and choose from amongst the testimonies to fabricate the illusion of a sensible and consistent witness narrative. Hilberg actually made up two Hitler orders, which he was forced to admit didn&#39;t exist, and then removed them from his text in the 1985 revised edition! Proven lying &quot;historians.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So again, why are you ignoring any of the evidence I bring up that specifically does not involve eyewitness testimony from after the war? Frankly that fact that you focus on this so much implies you don&#39;t really have any defence against the evidence that&#39;s not such testimonies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, good luck. I hope defending this bullshit brings you some pleasure in your life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the very least, I hope you at least thought about what I said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>especially while these lies are being used to excuse Israeli aggression, and their criminal ethnic-cleansing of Palestine. Shame on you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ironic, considering your lies are being used to further racism and far-right aggression. On top of this, how the hell does this have any effect on whether or not the Holocaust happened? </p>

<p>To start with, the delousing chambers did have airtight doors - asserting the opposite is one of your many errors.</p>

<p>I really would like some form of proof that the doors you posted are </p>

<p>actually from where you claim. Not to mention your proof that one was for delousing while the other was not.</p>

<p>That&#39;s weird, since according to most accounts, they did have gas masks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compare this to the ventilation timing of the delousing chambers. Compare also with the historical operation of actual homocidal cyanide gas chambers in the US.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly were they different? Don&#39;t forget that the Auschwitz gas chambers were partially destroyed, which presumably included the ventilation system.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/camps/auschwitz/crematoria/hoess-sonderbefehl.html">Here</a>. This is completely relevant, and especially so to your argument about how long it took to ventilate the chambers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No shit. But this is as far as you got in your argument. I went on to state the LD100 for humans, and referencing the release rate and &quot;witness&quot; testimony, estimated a total exposure (per alleged gassing) of at least 3000 ppm of HCN [i.e. total by the end of the release of the Zyklon-B.] What estimates did you ever give?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don&#39;t mind me asking, which testimonies did you use? Since as you&#39;ve repeatedly said, such testimonies are untrustworthy. As for my estimates, I found the steps in the reaction, and found about how long it would take to complete the reaction, and then used that to figure out why there would not have been formation. Also, have you ever taken chemistry? Since I&#39;m not sure you understand what my points are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, it&#39;s the release rate of the Zyklon-B which proves the chambers couldn&#39;t have been cleared by Sonderkommando as they claimed. A point you have conveniently decided to ignore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I&#39;m going to point out that gas masks <em>are</em> a thing, and they did exist at the time.</p>

<p>Give me a single good reason why I should respect someone for claiming 12 million people, whether Jewish, Roma, Jehovas witness, Soviet POW, Freemason, Homosexual, diabled, Polish, Spanish Republican, or other didn&#39;t die, and that millions more did not suffer immensely. To me, you&#39;re basically saying &quot;those survivors didn&#39;t go through anything! They just made it all up for attention&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I never expected it to magically solve everything, but that doesn&#39;t mean that Holocaust denial should just be accepted unconditionally, and not argued against.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There can be no denying the “Holocaust” of the mid-twentieth century:  it was called World War II.  Roughly 50 to 60 million people died worldwide - about 70 percent of whom were civilians.1  They died from a variety of causes including guns, bombs, fire, disease, exposure, starvation, and chemical toxins.  Within this greater Holocaust existed many lesser holocausts:  the Allied fire-bombings of Dresden, Hamburg, and Cologne; the killing of hundreds of thousands of German soldiers and civilians, by the victorious Allies, after the formal end of the war; the U.S. nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which incinerated 170,000 women, children, and elderly; and the Jewish Holocaust of Nazi Germany.  It is this last Holocaust which has been the topic of heated debate over the years, and it is this Holocaust which I address in this book.</p>

<p>Key witnesses to the Holocaust have either falsified or greatly exaggerated important aspects of their stories.</p>

<p>The figure of “six million” has little basis in fact.  This number, which theoretically could only have been known after the war, actually traces back decades before.</p>

<p>Major death camps, like Belzec, Sobibor, Chelmno, and Treblinka, have vanished “without a trace”—as have most of their alleged victims.  Such a thing is not possible.</p>

<p>Both of the alleged means of gassing victims—Zyklon-B (cyanide) and carbon monoxide from diesel exhaust—are impractical, unworkable, and simply ridiculous. </p>

<p>No “Holocaust order” from Hitler exists; nor was there any budget or any plan.  How, then, could the Nazis have pulled off their perfect crime?</p>

<p>Wartime air photos do not substantiate the traditional account of events.</p>

<p>Why are there, even today, so many “survivors”?</p>

<p>Myth #1:  Revisionists believe that the Holocaust “never happened.”</p>

<p>Myth #2:  Photographs of corpses prove the Holocaust happened.</p>

<p>Myth #3:  The Holocaust was a “hoax.”</p>

<p>This is constantly trotted out, and never actually accounts for context. For example, <a href="http://servv89pn0aj.sn.sourcedns.com/%7Egbpprorg/obama/nytimes_ww2/101771056.jpg">this article</a> is often used as proof, despite the fact that when you look at the Jewish population in the Russian empire at the time, it was around <a href="http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1906_1907_5_Statistics.pdf#page=3">5,215,805</a>, so not so far off that it wouldn&#39;t be understandable when you account for sensationalism/Jews in bordering countries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Major death camps, like Belzec, Sobibor, Chelmno, and Treblinka, have vanished “without a trace”—as have most of their alleged victims. Such a thing is not possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can thank <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderaktion_1005">Sonderaktion 1005</a> for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both of the alleged means of gassing victims—Zyklon-B (cyanide) and carbon monoxide from diesel exhaust—are impractical, unworkable, and simply ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the Carbon monoxide, that&#39;s why they switched to gas. Regarding the Zyklon-B, it was actually very efficient considering it could kill many at a time, and within a reasonable time period. It also had the added benefit of being impersonal, which was a major issue encountered by the Einsatzgruppen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No “Holocaust order” from Hitler exists; nor was there any budget or any plan. How, then, could the Nazis have pulled off their perfect crime?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Hitler did not have to sign such plans in order for them to be carried out (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannsee_Conference">Wansee Conference</a>). As for Hitler&#39;s motivation, we can clearly tell his goals even if he didn&#39;t sign an order. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In 1922 Hitler told Major Josef Hell (a journalist at the time): Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have gallows built in rows—at the Marienplatz in Munich, for example—as many as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews.</p></li>
<li><p>On 21 January 1939 Hitler spoke with František Chvalkovský and said: We are going to destroy the Jews. They are not going to get away with what they did on 9 November 1918. The day of reckoning has come.</p></li>
<li><p>On 30 January at the Sports Palace in Berlin, Hitler told the crowd: And we say that the war will not end as the Jews imagine it will, namely with the uprooting of the Aryans, but the result of this war will be the complete annihilation of the Jews.</p></li>
<li><p>In Mein Kampf, Hitler argued that a war against Jews would have saved Germany from losing World War I: If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas, as happened to hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers in the field, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.</p></li>
<li><p>In the following widely cited speech made on January 30, 1939, Hitler says to the Reichstag: Today I want to be a prophet once more: if international Jewish financiers inside and outside Europe again succeed in plunging the nations into a world war, the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and with it the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Hitler&#39;s choice of language in German in the final sentence of the above passage is &quot;die Vernichtung der jüdischen Rasse in Europa&quot; - unambiguously meaning &quot;the extermination [or annihilation] of the Jewish race in Europe.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In his personal diary, Joseph Goebbels writes: &quot;February 14, 1942: The Führer once again expressed his determination to clean up the Jews in Europe pitilessly. There must be no squeamish sentimentalism about it. The Jews have deserved the catastrophe that has now overtaken them. Their destruction will go hand in hand with the destruction of our enemies. We must hasten this process with cold ruthlessness.</p></li>
<li><p>When questioned by interrogators if orders for the extermination of Jews were delegated in writing by Himmler, Adolf Eichmann states: I never saw a written order, Herr Hauptmann. All I know is that Heydrich said to me: &quot;The Führer has ordered the physical extermination of the Jews.&quot; He said that as clearly and surely as I&#39;m repeating it now.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Wartime air photos do not substantiate the traditional account of events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are there, even today, so many “survivors”?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you joking? Because there were more than just 6 million Jews in Europe at the time, not to mention the same thing goes for the other groups involved (i.e. Soviet POW&#39;s, Gypsies, Jehovas witnesses, etc...)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Myth #1: Revisionists believe that the Holocaust “never happened.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve outright heard claims on this subreddit that there was no intention to kill anyone, and that is pretty much outright claiming it didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Myth #2: Photographs of corpses prove the Holocaust happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not just corpses. It&#39;s also the gas chambers, the camps, the graves, and more. In fact, the entire reason Eisenhower ordered those photos to be taken <em>was as a way to prove later on that the Holocaust happened</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Myth #3: The Holocaust was a “hoax.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve heard more than one person use the word &quot;Holohoax&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Myth #4: Revisionists are right-wing neo-Nazi anti-Semites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all, but certainly a large number of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now if we want to talk REAL holocausts, how about the Armenian genocide of millions by the Jewish &quot;Young Turks&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly were they Jewish? That being said, the Armenian Genocide did absolutely happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the tens of millions that died under the Jewish-Bolshevik Soviet Union. Google is your friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, just because some members were Jewish does not make the entire movement/group Jewish. Also, I&#39;m going to need some form of citation on that tens of millions number.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh I&#39;m not defending what happened. The Nazi regime was evil. But the idea that the Jews experienced some sort of holocaust is a bold-faced lie. And really, both sides of the war were controlled by the same forces. Hitler was financed by New York Jewish bankers. America was controlled by the Jewish media and Jewish bankers. The USSR was controlled by the Jewish Bolsheviks. It was all part of a plan, and what was the result? The United Nations. The formation of Israel. Destruction of European powers. Murder of vast numbers of Europeans, amongst others. Who benefited? The &quot;best of the Gentiles&quot; were targeted for slaughter, as the Jewish Talmud commands.</p>

<p>Were there Jewish casualties in WW2? Certainly. Jews who didn&#39;t follow the Zionist script - get your ass to Palestine - were indeed targeted. Henry Makow, a Jew, talks about this. Most Jews are as much pawns as most &quot;Gentiles&quot; are. The elite at the top find them equally disposable - sacrificial lambs. Jews died in 9/11 which was an Israeli Mossad/CIA operation. But the &quot;elite&quot; Jews did NOT - they were given warning which is why they and their children didn&#39;t show up to work that day. And who benefited from 9/11? Israel and those who are allied with them at the head of the NWO. <a href="http://archive.org/details/MastersOfDeception">http://archive.org/details/MastersOfDeception</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a daily browser of <a href="/r/Documentaries">/r/Documentaries</a>. I don&#39;t watch doco&#39;s every day, but I like to see if there&#39;s anything new and interesting on there. The other day a doco about German art in the 1930s and 40s came up and I thought I remembered seeing it on SBS a few years ago. I&#39;m pretty sure that I have seen it, but I got sidetracked by the comments and then moved on to a doco about ancient Britain.</p>

<p>The sheer ignorance of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/2i8bqv/degenerate_art_1993_the_nazis_vs_expressionism/ckzuqhp">one of the comments</a> prompted me to reply with what I thought was a pretty clear and to the point post. But this <em>is</em> reddit, and this post is not about <a href="/u/murderhuman">/u/murderhuman</a> being an idiot. This post is about the reply by <a href="/u/totes_meta_bot">/u/totes_meta_bot</a> saying that the previous post had been linked to elsewhere on reddit.</p>

<p>I was expecting <a href="/r/holocomment">/r/holocomment</a> to be something along the lines of <a href="/r/TheBluePill">/r/TheBluePill</a>, with people making fun of Deniers, but it isn&#39;t anything of the sort. All it is is a dumping ground for a bot which links comments related to a certain keyword which apparently starts with H. There is no discussion at all because it is against the rules to either comment or vote. I don&#39;t know what the sub is for. It could be there so that a pair of trolls can keep track of their targets, or maybe it&#39;s a couple of sociology students gathering data for a paper about people&#39;s online opinions on the subject. Given the subject, however, that sub could exist for a whole host of other purposes and the people who run it could be anything from Neo-Nazies to Mossad agents or the German government looking for Deniers to prosecute, and anything in between. </p>

<p>The who and why of that sub might be a little creepy, but they&#39;re not really relevant here. What matters is that <a href="/u/murderhuman">/u/murderhuman</a> used a keyword which triggered a bot to record his post for reasons unknown. In recording that post, the entire sub-thread was recorded and put into a subreddit which is essentially a database. Because I took part in that sub-thread, my comment is now also in that database, despite my not using the keyword.</p>

<p>The above paragraphs are from a post I copied to WordPad to &quot;finish later&quot; several weeks ago. It was originally in response to someone using the &quot;if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear&quot; line about Australia&#39;s fun new surveillance state. The main reason I never got around to finishing was procrastination, but later events put a new spin on things...  and now we have this. </p>

<p>I hasten to point out that this entire thread has already caught the attention of the bot I was talking about.</p>

<p>To put the following into context, there are two things, beyond that it happened at all, that I find deeply offensive about the Holocaust. The first is the repugnant practice of Zionists using what the Nazis did to the Jews as an excuse for what they do to the Palestinians. I don&#39;t know of a word to adequately convey just how hypocritically reprehensible this is. The second is the marginalisation of the other half of the Nazi&#39;s victims, something which sounds an awful lot like Denial to me. I am particularly offended by the difference between the Jewish and Gypsy post-Holocaust experience. We are reminded at every opportunity that the Nazis thought of Jews as vermin and that we must never forget how the Jews were almost exterminated. And yet Gypsies are still considered as vermin and rarely rate more than a mention in most discussions on the subject. Not only that, and unlike the Jews, the Gypsies were exterminated to the point that an entire dialect went extinct. Gypsies aren&#39;t the only victims that are largely ignored, but they are the only ones still in the same social position in 2014 as they were in in 1934. We shouldn&#39;t forget the Jews, but neither should we remember the Jews at the expense of all others. To do so is an intolerable injustice. </p>

<p>Unlike <a href="/r/Documentaries">/r/Documentaries</a>, I am not a daily browser of <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a> and only occasionally read a thread if something on my front page piques my interest. It&#39;s very rare that I post in there, mainly because the first two or three times I did my posts got deleted. One of the top posts the other day caught my attention and I ended up responding <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2j52la/is_it_true_as_this_article_states_that_patton/cl8vb1w">with this</a>. I should say at the outset that I wasn&#39;t entirely sober and that, in retrospect, that could have been worded differently. Be that as it may, I was right about the quote and was shocked to get a curt PM:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you have been banned from posting to <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a>: AskHistorians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was it. No warning, no prior notice, no nothing. My response was will be in another post because apparently this is too long.</p>

<p>One moderator responded with a snarky comment, and I echoed them back (&quot;If you had bothered to read... &quot;), before another moderator replied with this:</p>

<p>You were put on watch for a previous comment of yours, the content of which we found eyebrow-raising. This other comment has also triggered people&#39;s instincts over bigotry, which we have a zero tolerance policy against. Your ban will not be overturned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have rarely posted in <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a> precisely because the first first time I did so my post was deleted for being a parent comment against the rules when I didn&#39;t know them (my client doesn&#39;t show sidebars), and a couple of times later when I misclicked and made a parent instead of replying. I don&#39;t know what my last post in /AskHistorians was, but I <em>do</em> know that I had recently made a comment in <a href="/r/Documentaries">/r/Documentaries</a> that had been picked up by a bot and added to a database of holocaust comments a suspiciously short time before I was banned for making a holocaust comment. My response to them was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It isn&#39;t bigotry to remind people of the fact that the Nazis killed 11 million people and not 6 million Jews. Bigotry is saying &quot;we must never forget the Holocaust&quot; and then conveniently forgetting half the victims because you can&#39;t imagine anything more icky than Vlad the Fabulous Homosexual Communist Gypsy Showgirl being in the same gas chamber as a Jew. Bigotry is perpetuating the kind of Holocaust Denial which paints one group of people as special and deserving of sympathy, while maintaining the idea that all the other victims are vermin that probably deserved it. It is not bigotry to seek equal representation, it is bigotry to treat one group as special and all the others as unimportant or non-existant.</p>

<p>Homosexuals are only now, very slowly, getting basic human rights in some parts of the world but still being sentenced to death in others. Communists hardly got a mention for 50 years because we were at war with them (don&#39;t want to cast the enemy in a sympathetic light), but there&#39;s no excuse now. Gypsies are in the same place now that they were in before the war - the most maligned group in Europe, a former slave people seen as nothing more than a bunch of filthy, lazy, thieving, paedophiles and prostitutes that everyone knows steal babies to sell into sex slavery. The Jews got their own country and the collective guilt of the world in such abundance that Zionists can use the Holocaust to justify ethnic cleansing. Funny how they were all victims of the same ovens </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[that last sentence is unfinished and probably would have ended up something like &quot;and yet one group gets all the sympathy while the others are virtually ignored&quot; and yes, I probably should have said gas chambers instead of ovens]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many thousands of books have been written about what the Nazis did to the Jews? How many have been written about all the other victims combined? Concentrating on the Jewish experience is a criminal distortion of history. And yet you call me a bigot for daring to suggest that there&#39;s more to WWII and the Holocaust than the Jews. You&#39;re not even attacking my argument, you&#39;re just making an ad hominem by banning me because of &quot;the vibe of it&quot;. And without even a word, warning nor indication to boot. Classy. If insisting on the equality of all victims is bigotry, then I&#39;ll continue being a bigot, thank you very much. You just go on ahead and continue spreading the story about the Chosen People that deserve special treatment at the expense of everyone else. That&#39;s not bigotted at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got no response.</p>

<p>I have screenshots of all the relevant posts and PMs, but I&#39;m not sure about what the rules are on posting them. Not even sure I can name the moderators without getting shadowbanned or something.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that, as far as I can tell, my post in response to <a href="/u/notstephanie">/u/notstephanie</a> has not been deleted. Odd that in a sub known for threads that are wastelands of deleted comments, a supposedly bigotted comment gets to stay. To not-her&#39;s credit, she edited the post and admitted adding it herself (something that I didn&#39;t really consider as I thought it was probably copy/paste).</p>

<p>I have just gone through my comment history going back to June looking for posts I made in <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a>. I couldn&#39;t be bothered going further. The four posts I found, and I may have missed some, were:</p>

<p>23Sep14, a comment about the <em>Batavia</em> mutiny.</p>

<p>10Sep14, a comment about Caligula&#39;s nickname.</p>

<p>10Aug14, a comment asking for another source on something that reads like a stageplay (Note that this is about Nazis&#39; reactions to the end of the war)</p>

<p>7Aug14, a question about how Nimrod became synonymous with geek</p>

<p>Eiither asking for a source on <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a> is bigotry, or I got banned because of a comment I made in an entirely unrelated subreddit that got hoovered up, along with every other mention of the Holocaust on reddit, and dumped into a database.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is nothing new. I have dealt with moderators several times with different accounts, and there are several power-mad, biased moderators who clearly let their subjectivity influence their moderation. </p>

<p>Most death estimates from the Holocaust are nothing more than that, estimates. Records were supposedly destroyed, so there is nothing wrong with questioning why estimates became treated like facts. There is unquestionably a large apparatus that has been in place since the event (and maybe planned beforehand) that is designed to attack anyone who questions the event. And yet history alone should be enough evidence that countries who win wars often cover-up their own roles in events, demonize the &quot;enemy,&quot; etc. People often forget that questioning is very different from denying or being crazy. It is important to question everything. I have spent years researching the Holocaust and WWII, and there is not enough evidence to support neither the official account NOR the alternate theories. Unfortunately, any real investigation would likely have to have been done soon after the event. Just remember that history is written by the winners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Holocaust is an important lesson from history, so it is imperative that we get the story right. In fact, very soon after the discovery of the atrocity, steps were taken to ensure the basic outlines of what happened were not forgotten. Because many remembered that during WWI, reports of German atrocities, while very bad, were sometimes discounted because of suspicions of exaggeration, a dispassionate investigation was important. Thus, a basic outline that reasonable people can agree on has been created:</p>

<p>Certain groups, most especially people of Jewish ancestry, were severely persecuted from the beginning of the Nazi regime. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the persecution and violence was transformed into state-sponsored mass murder, culminating in industrial-scale genocide. And this was a bad thing. Four to six million Jews and a similar number of other people were killed in this process.</p>

<p>This truth is the starting place. No one is stopping anyone from research or asking questions as long as the basic framework is agreed to. Anyone who denies this is <em>rightly</em> suspected of ulterior motives, namely bigotry.</p>

<p>Trying to suppress truth and enlightenment on the internet is <strong>impossible</strong>, and I&#39;d wager it <strong>will always be impossible</strong>. In fact, the more &#39;they&#39; attempt to suppress information, the more relevant and widespread it becomes.</p>

The Double Identity of an &quot;Anti-Semitic&quot; Commenter</p>

<p>Smearing a Progressive Website to Support Israel</p>

<p>Like many other news websites, Common Dreams has been plagued by inflammatory anti-Semitic comments following its stories. But on Common Dreams these posts have been so frequent and intense they have driven away donors from a nonprofit dependent on reader generosity.</p>

<p>A Common Dreams investigation has discovered that more than a thousand of these damaging comments over the past two years <strong>were written with a deceptive purpose by a Jewish Harvard graduate in his thirties who was irritated by the website&#39;s discussion of issues involving Israel.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtlPlZGvgY0">here&#39;s a documentary</a> of nothing but Holocaust survivors talking about the camps.  They&#39;re talking about the tea parties and bands and plays and movie theaters and soccer leagues and art classes and libraries and on and on it goes.  Appears some of the survivors had it better off in the camps than they did in the ghettos!  None of that stuff happened in the Soviet camps.  Which, by all accounts, were far far worse.  The only reason we give all this attention to Jews and the Nazis is because A) Jews rule the media so they get to talk about themselves all the time and B) without the Soviet allies, Europe would have fallen to the Germans.  So we overlook their psychopathic brutality and massive human rights violations and attribute it all to the Nazi losers instead.       </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t get what your angle on this really is. It seems like you&#39;re trying to save us from ourselves, but you really shouldn&#39;t do that, because it&#39;s just irritating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not &quot;trying to save you&quot; from anything. I&#39;m just calling out peoples bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is our turf and you&#39;re actually making the claim that the holocaust happened, so the burden of proof is rightly on you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re admitting that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a Holocaust denial subreddit?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But instead these people are indulging your stupid questions, and this is a very contentious complicated issue that the average person simply doesn&#39;t have the time to properly address your issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering the number of people on this thread who have repeatedly posted Holocaust denial videos/articles, I don&#39;t see how they wouldn&#39;t have time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are actually historians who can make the case far more accurately and I suggest you ask for that information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such as? It&#39;s not particularly hard to link to a few of these supposedly massive numbers of sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People in here take a pretty fair personal risk in being holocaust deniers and I recommend you have a little more respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give me a single good reason why I should respect someone for claiming 12 million people, whether Jewish, Roma, Jehovas witness, Soviet POW, Freemason, Homosexual, diabled, Polish, Spanish Republican, or other didn&#39;t die, and that millions more did not suffer immensely. To me, you&#39;re basically saying &quot;those survivors didn&#39;t go through anything! They just made it all up for attention&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You really think a stupid debate is going to settle anything?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never expected it to magically solve everything, but that doesn&#39;t mean that Holocaust denial should just be accepted unconditionally, and not argued against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here in Australia, just earlier this year when there was debate about whether to go back to Iraq to fight ISIS, I noticed that SBS, our public multicultural channel started a war film festival – things like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as well as documentaries and various other foreign films in the same genre.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t decide whether, if there was an agenda behind the timing of it, the intention was to either drum up support for war or dissuade against it. I figured it was the latter as the focus seemed to be on the horror of war, not the glory.</p>
