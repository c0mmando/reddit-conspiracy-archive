        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Join us on November 3rd for an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> AMA with James Corbett of <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/">the Corbett Report</a> and the creator of the documentary, <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/federalreserve/">Century of Enslavement: The History of the Federal Reserve</a>.</p>

<p>I imagine most people on this sub are familiar with Mr. Corbett&#39;s work, in case you aren&#39;t aware of his work he&#39;s had several of his videos reach the front page here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Here are some of my personal favorites:</p>

<p>This one is pretty recent and is simply known as, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyY6rqP_3Q">Shut up Conspiracy Theorist</a>.</p>

<p>Then there is his very well known <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98">9/11: A Conspiracy Theory</a>.</p>

<p>We also have this edition of his podcast which came out last year around the 9/11 anniversary that I consider to be required viewing for anyone with any doubts about 9/11, its aptly titled, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWLis-TVB2w">Who Was Really Behind the 9/11 Attacks?</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Corbett is also the video production arm for the Center for Research on Globalization, a website that regularly sees its content posted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="/u/AssuredlyaThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyaThrowAway</a> for arranging this AMA.</p>

<p>See you on Monday !</p>

<p>EDIT: Here is verification from James Corbett that he will be doing an AMA on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, he announces it at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtNTiQlt4wM">4:30 mark of his most recent podcast.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, my favorite thing about listening to his podcast is his even keeled nature. Alex Jones, with his fear mongering and bombast does the entire &#39;conspiracy community&#39; a disservice by acting so crazy on national television. </p>

<p>Corbett on the other hand has a very professorial style of delivery, with his constant citations and level tone of voice. I&#39;ve referred to him a few times here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as the antidote to Alex Jones. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>No joke.  One thing I hated about listening to Jones is when I would check into the topics he would mention, it would always turn out to be a sensationalized truth.  I&#39;d think to myself &quot;Come on man.  There&#39;s plenty to get pissed off about already.  No need to stretch the truth on anything.&quot;</p>

<p>James doesn&#39;t do this.  One of my favorite episodes was <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-207-more-patriot-mythology/">&quot;More Patriot Mythology&quot;</a>.  In it, he debunks a lot of things that get circulated in the community that are not entirely true.</p>

<p>One I still bring up to this day is the Larry Silverstein &quot;pull it&quot; quote that we keep bringing up.  Yes, it&#39;s a demolition term, but as James points out in this episode, to &quot;pull it&quot; is to literally pull a building down with cables and heavy machinery.  This is a distinct process from using explosives which is what WTC7 appears to be.</p>

<p>That, and I hate the form of &quot;proof&quot; that relies on tongue slips.  For example, I do believe (believe being purposefully used since I don&#39;t have any hard evidence) crisis actors are used, it&#39;s ridiculous to point to a cop talking to reports using the term &quot;actors&quot; to literally mean a stage performer.  I mean, really man??  They clearly mean &quot;those who took action&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corbett is a gatekeeper who calls out other gatekeepers. He goes a little further than other alternative news personalities, but will only mislead you away from the truth. I prefer his more level-headed approach to somebody like Alex Jones, but he&#39;ll never state the obvious; just look at his Fed doc, he can&#39;t even tell you who these people are, and abstracts them into some neutral term like globalist elites, the Bilderbergers, etc. Why can&#39;t you state the obvious, James?</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>It appears that we may have been duped. We will make an announcement soon once we get all the information. I apologize if anyone was misled or let down by my following statements.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>but does anyone know if that last AMA was verified?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea for the AMA originated at <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>. <a href="/u/ae911truth">/u/ae911truth</a> stepped in and made the contacts and verified that the person in control of <a href="/u/richard_gage">/u/richard_gage</a> was indeed the man himself.</p>

<p>Dave Chandler was even on board in the beginning, but it ended up not working out.</p>

<p>Obviously things were shaky to start. We had a similar problem in the beginning of the last conspiracy AMA when the host couldn&#39;t figure out how to check for new messages.</p>

<p>Two pages of instructions were sent to both AMA hosts, but certain things about this process (and reddit in general) seem to be lost in translation, especially in the older generation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having seen Richard dominate the C-Span interview</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the same issue...you&#39;re comparing two mediums that are apples and oranges. Richard Gage grew up in the TV generation, that&#39;s something he can handle.</p>

<p>A reddit AMA, in a conspiracy forum of all places, is light years away from a cspan interview, and this is also why it took a half an hour or so for him to get it right.</p>

<p>Not only did he figure it out, but he went from not knowing how to start a thread on his computer, to continuing to participate and answer questions on his phone over the next several days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just couldn&#39;t believe he would make some of the claims he did. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What claims?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m reading in the comment you linked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NIST have said that they wont share their data for safety reasons. This is frustrating. However: what we at AE911truth can do is develop our own models. As we dont have the tools or resources that NIST do, it will take more time.</p>

<p>When we compare our more accurate model to their&#39;s we will force them to the table, so to speak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seem to me he&#39;s speaking hypothetically. &quot;When&quot; we compare, &quot;we will&quot; force them, etc. He&#39;s saying that once their model is released, they can compare the models.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at, but I see nothing wrong with his statement.</p>

<p>AMA&#39;s on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are a new thing, and we&#39;re working out the kinks. The last couple AMAs could&#39;ve gone more smoothly, but looking back at each thread, I feel they ultimately were very successful. </p>

<p>Each participant spent several days interacting and commenting in the thread, not just the scheduled couple of hours, something that I&#39;m sure is very rare for the regular AMA sub.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll do our best to prevent this in the future. Corbett has already announced his participation in one of his recent podcasts, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll give further confirmation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also confident that Corbett will navigate his way through reddit much more easily that Richard Gage (who ended up figuring it out just fine).</p>

<p>We have another exciting scheduled AMA soon with someone who might have similar problems as Richard, but we&#39;ll do our best to prevent any more issues.</p>

<p>This is an exciting time for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and indeed the alternative research community, so keep having an open mind and a healthy dose of skepticism and let&#39;s do this.</p>

<p>Need to carefully examine your entire posting history</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been around here for years, so good luck with that.</p>

<p>The last time I checked (about a year or so ago), I was the 2nd highest contributor to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of all time after that julianassange guy. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve slowed down since then, but I&#39;m probably still in the top three.</p>

<p>Needless to say, you&#39;re going to have a bit of material to sift through.</p>

<p><a href="/r/axolotl_peyotl">/r/axolotl_peyotl</a> may also give you some ideas of what I&#39;m interested in. It also has a small collection of some of the &quot;original&quot; research I&#39;ve done over the years for the benefit of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and reddit in general.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who precisely you backed and supported and 2nd&#39;ed during the recent new mod contest, etc. </p>

<p>I supported all the mods who were chosen, but I also would&#39;ve been happy with everyone that had above 6 or 7 total at the end of that voting thread (other than not_jtrig).</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know if those are the kind of &#39;gotcha&#39; questions truthers hit Gage with all the time, but I thought this was the kind of thing he&#39;d be addressing in the AMA. I guess I just expected a little more of the kind of debate we normally get into here, of the specifics of the theories and the issues witht he NIST report.
Of course that was just my perception based on nothing, he may have had a totally different purpose for doing it. </p>

<p>One thing I should appreciate is that Gage has answered these questions time and time again and at some point it just becomes easier to point to the last time you answered it.</p>

<p>Was this in the thread or via PM? What were you guys talking about? Is that part of the reason why you started getting more suspicious about their identity?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Answering a few more questions the following day doesn&#39;t exactly a champ make...</p>

<p>It was nothing compared to Linda Brown&#39;s AMA from earlier this year. SHE was the champ...she continued answering questions for almost a week, and it turned into one of the best threads in the history of this sub.</p>

<p>Again, I disagree with the <em>real</em> Richard Gage and his theories. I attributed my disappointment with the impostor&#39;s answers to my prejudice with respect to the real Gage. </p>
