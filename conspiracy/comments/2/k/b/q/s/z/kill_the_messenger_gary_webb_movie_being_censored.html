        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ive been waiting to see &quot;kill the messenger&quot; since i first saw the trailer. I live in one of the 5 boroughs in NYC. I have literally been trying to see it for two weeks now. One theater, the main one near my house, played it one time, on a monday, at 4 o&#39;clock. The next time was a Friday, but at one theater in Manhattan, far from my home, at a very early time. It wasnt in theaters over the weekend..  So, just now (5 minutes ago), i drove one hour to Williamsburg, brooklyn, to a dingy indepented film screening room, which is just tables in a rokm with a projector screen.. I showed up 20 minutes early, and it was sold out. I left and i am not able to see it. This is INSANE, and something is obviously wrong with this.. Its a major motion picture with millions of dollars invested, top tier actors, and amazing amounts of work put into this film. I read a comment on reddit that said &quot;if the cia can destroy gary webbs career, and leave him dead with 2 bullets in his head, declared a suicide, then why cant they censor the film, or obstruct its release&quot;. Well, that is what is happening.  the weird film times had me thinking, and not playing in any major theater, on weekends.. Was suspicious. But now that ive physically attempted going to the random, small, independent theaters that the film actually IS being screened in, i can see that this film is NOT meant to be watched. The filmmakers, actors, and investors, should make this public and demand answers to why their investment is not being given a fair chance at movie sales, and the public should demand answers on why they are making it so hard to go see the film. This film is very important, supposedly amazingly made, and probably one of the best films of the year. This NEEDS to be seen.  I tried to wait, i tried to write it off as just being a &quot;limited release&quot;, which made no sense anyway being the high paid actors and action.   It is a conspiracy my friends.. This movie is being stopped before it can even get off the ground. Im going to demand that this film be played in all theaters.. And you should too...  I couldn&#39;t wait any longer, and had to post this here... Someone is making sure it ks very very very difficult to see this film.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro you just described all of independant film. Just because there are big names doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a relatively small film, independent movies, especially ones that deal with controversial issues, have trouble getting a wide release. </p>

<p>There is a a CIA office of Hollywood affairs. It&#39;s more to plant positive propaganda and move some movies along (Argo, Zero Dark Thirty.)</p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested to hear what the film-makers have to say about attaining distribution, maybe it&#39;s been tough. I agree that it&#39;s deserving of a wider release, but if it met opposition along the way, that battle&#39;s been fought. </p>

<p>The notion that someone is out there trying to shut down screenings now at theaters across the country is preposterous. The movie&#39;s out there already. It&#39;s a known story, and just like when the story was published, all the CIA has to do or say to maintain control is <strong>nothing</strong>. </p>

<p>You&#39;re just noticing and creating a story because you had some trouble finding a screening. Do you often go out looking for a specific independent film?</p>

<p>That being said, &quot;We&#39;re not going to hurt your children, Mr Webb.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... They could just be character tropes, it is still a movie, from what I&#39;ve read though the movie is very faithful to the book, so you&#39;d have to see how Webb originally wrote those real life people. </p>

<p>I know what you&#39;re saying, but there are much more clear instances of the CIA actively script consulting on a movie. Also if a war movie wants to use US military equipment the Pentagon demands script <em>supervision</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think a movie that insinuates the hero was murdered by the CIA is capitulating to them as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The film had a $5 million budget and is distributed by Focus - an &#39;art house&#39; distribution company. It was never going to get a wide release.</p>

<p>Limited release means it opens with few screenings and it&#39;s release is adapted market-by-market... So places where the initial screenings go well will see more screenings, and those where it doesn&#39;t perform will fall off rapidly, or it will be consigned to low attendance session times so that it won&#39;t impact on films that see a higher return.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of amazed anywhere is still playing it anywhere two weeks after opening.</p>

<p>On the plus side, small budget films like that tend to get to VOD sooner and other in-home releases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really understand?</p>

<p>The point was that the, as far as I can see, has opened and screened pretty much exactly as would be expected for a film of that budget and nature.</p>

<p>It&#39;s at the higher end of low budget, but it&#39;s still a low budget art film.</p>

<p>Look at Kevin Smith&#39;s recent release Tusk, for example, it had a $3m budget and they inexplicably choose to go for a wide release and was subsequently declared a box office flop. That&#39;s why studios usually don&#39;t do that for small films.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not about not making enough money.  They screened it in TIMES SQUARE.  Noone is going to times square on opening day when the movie should be playing at all theaters. The trailer didn&#39;t come with a disclaimersaying it would only be in the single most expensive, annoying to drive to, ridiculous consumer area theater. It should have been in all theaters. At least for a few days. Def not about money, because if it was, they would have screened it in more practical places... They played Michael moore documentaries in every theatre.. But not a huge allstar movie like this? I call bullshit.  Blaming the obvious attempt at limiting,mathematically, the amount of average movie goers, along with people who have an interest, but are not going on OPENING NIGHT, on &quot;sheeple&quot; who dont care is bullshit. No offense, but people do care.. Thats why webbs career was destroyed, thats why he was killed, thats why millions were invested into this film in the first place. If noone cared, movie doesnt get made.  This needs to be, and should have been in all theaters... And if not, the people should have been told that this isnt a regular movie and it will only be shown at a few places, at a few random times... No.. Itwas made as a regular movie, trailered as a regular movie.. And shown in theaters like its going to incite rebellion if given a chance to sell tickets. Dont show the movie in weirdo theaters, and ONE major theater, and then say &quot;oh the movies not making enough money, lets show kt even less now!&quot;.. And then its the &quot;sheeples&quot; fault, na im not buying it</p>

<p>This movie was released in ~400 theaters and has grossed 2 million dollars ... in two weeks. This completely explains why you are having issues finding it now. It simply was not popular and therefore theaters have begun to drop it. 2 million in two weeks is a very poor showing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t know who &#39;They&#39; is..You might be referring to the CIA. But,as someone familiar with Manhattan movie theaters..If after 2 weeks, a film is not making money ,the owners of that Theater will Yank it...Too much overhead to support empty Theaters.</p>

<p>Complicated political films like this are never box office blockbusters...though I think they should be. Let&#39;s face it,the populace of this country are dumbed down...they don&#39;t want heavy,they want easy.
Maybe this will be released to a wider audience next month and if it wins awards will be re-released in theaters and make the money on DVD.But as far as the CIA telling Hollywood what to do,I think it&#39;s the other way around...CIA works for the Corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether it cost 5 million to make or not, or if mass distribution is not as viable with a budget of that size. It does still make a person wonder, if there is some kind of vested interest out there trying to stifle this from getting too much attention. At the end of the day Gary Webb was trying to expose the CIA, and all kinds of smear campaigns were thereafter created to try to discredit him as much as possible, and he just so coincidentally ended up with 2 bullets in his head after an apparent suicide. Now all that being said, don&#39;t you think that there could, budget/ distribution issues aside, be a chance that this movie is being robbed of the attention that it should be receiving because of its harshly negative depiction of what the US gov&#39;t and the CIA did back in the 80s?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its small film nothing strange about the limited distrubution but i DID find it odd that they all had &quot;earlyish&quot; playtimes. i went to see it last friday and out of the 7 or so theaters in my metro that had it only like two had showings past 9pm. and some did not have any evening showtimes.</p>

<p>So i wouldn&#39;t blow it out of proportion but maybe you are right. </p>

<p>As for how important the film is. Not Very. not that it was bad, but certainly did not go as far as i think it should have. the least it will do is introduce new skeptics to gary webb. I think if they didn&#39;t use the &quot;kill the messenger&quot; liscence and fictionalized the story to the end it would&#39;ve been more powerfull. Renner also made the mistake of not looking more like gary without the goatee and blond hair. (if you are going to use the likeness, use the likeness)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a small indie film.  It does not matter who stars in the film, what matters is the budget and the company that puts it out.  This film cost 5 mil to make and was released by a small time company.  That is way it has a very limited distribution, especially after being out for two weeks already and not making any money. </p>

<p>Movies at this level never do well in theaters. </p>

<p>Another Quixotic Film Crusade fer ya:</p>

<p>Made a lot of press over this, until someone pointed out that this would be a yearly death toll of 365 THOUSAND.</p>

<p>He ended up committing suicide, so this was obviously the result of an evil cabal of Republicans, Wall St Fat Cats, and Established Religious Leaders and their evil, secret machinations!</p>
