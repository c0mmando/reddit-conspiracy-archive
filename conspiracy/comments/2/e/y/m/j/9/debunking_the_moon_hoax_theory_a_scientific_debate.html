        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-08-29 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/SirStarBeast.html">SirStarBeast</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m here to set the record straight. Yes, we absolutely landed on the moon. This is fact. This theory, which attempts to denote one of humanity&#39;s greatest scientific achievements without a shred of evidence, is bogus. Let me tell you why, going through every piece of so called &quot;evidence&quot;:
1. &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle little star...how I wonder where you are!&quot;
Basic knowledge of photography quickly puts this in the bullshit pile. Very simply, the exposure was too short! The moon is a gigantic reflective surface that bounces light from the sun (hence why you can see it at night). If the exposure was long enough to see the faint stars in the background, you wouldn&#39;t be able to see the astronauts! The reflective light from the moon would drown out everything in the foreground. They were there to film themselves on the moon, not to film stars! So the cameras were designed to have a very short exposure. In fact, in the vacuum of space the exposure would&#39;ve had to be even shorter than that! Also, the stars wouldn&#39;t twinkle anyway. Twinkling is a byproduct of starlight filtering through our atmosphere. Since there&#39;s no atmosphere on the moon, they wouldn&#39;t twinkle! Thus, this &quot;evidence&quot; doesn&#39;t hold up at all.</p>

<ol>
<li>A Game of Shadows-many lunar hoax theorists believe that the strange positioning of the shadows indicates TV lighting. The shadows seem to go opposite directions, which theorists contend is evidence of the double tv lighting. This one also utterly fails, for largely the same reason as the &quot;star argument&quot;. Firstly, there ARE multiple light sources on the moon: The sun...and the MOON ITSELF! With all the reflected light and the light from the source (the sun), the shadows would have multiple light sources, thus explaining why their split in some pictures. Also, the moon is covered with weird surfaces. It&#39;s been bombarded with craters since it&#39;s birth. When the shadows form over these surfaces, they get weird and distorted. Having a shadow on a weird surface can change the way it looks. And having a shadow on a gigantic shining mirror to the sun can also change the way it looks! Thus, this argument is also complete nonsense.</li>
<li>Strange lights-Many hoax theorists have taken photos from Apollo and found strange lights in the background. They claim these lights are the TV lighting for the landing set. This ones also complete bullshit, once again for the same reason as one and two. Anyone familiar with the filmography of JJ Abrams should know about lense flares. Basically, when a reflection of light passes through the camera, it creates weird flares. And all of the lense flares in the moon hoax were caused by the same thing: Once again, the moon is made of reflective materials. And it reflects light back from the moon. This reflected light causes lense flares. This argument is also complete and utter crap.</li>
<li>The film would&#39;ve melted in the vacuum of space-Once again, bullshit. The film was in a specially designed case that easily handled the radiation and absolute zero tempuratures of space. It was a special type of film designed by Kodak, and if you want proof then go into the archives. It&#39;s development is very well documented. (along with the development of the ENTIRE  MOON LANDING, we&#39;ll get to that later). </li>
<li>The &quot;C&quot; Rock-In one photo, a rock can be seen which appears to have the letter C on it. This has lead to rampant speculation that the rock was a fake prop. Once again, nonsense. The photo was a loose piece of hair which landed on the film. Don&#39;t believe me? Zoomed in pictures of it clearly show a strand of hair. Go look it up.</li>
<li>&quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;-the classic flag waving argument. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all heard it somewhere. &quot;How would the flag wave in a vacuum?&quot; the hoaxers ask. Well, firstly the flag waves because the astronauts are placing it in the lunar dirt! As they do that, THEY are waving the flag by moving the pole to put it in. &quot;But then...it moves on it&#39;s own!&quot; the hoaxers will claim. But that&#39;s actually what would happen. You see, in the vacuum of space there&#39;s no air resistance. Meaning that the momentum of waving the flag would continue for a few seconds after you planted it. Don&#39;t believe me? Scientists have actually taken American flags and waved them around in vacuum chambers...and they got the same exact same results as in the original footage. </li>
<li>&quot;A conundrum of craters&quot;-The next argument is that there would&#39;ve been a blast crater from the lunar lander&#39;s boosters. So the lunar lander had 3000 pounds of thrust. Seems like a lot. However, it&#39;s actually almost nothing compared to the average fighter jet, which has about 22,000 pounds of thrust. Do you see jets making blast craters? No. Also, that 3000 pounds was being dispersed in the vacuum of space. This means there was even less! So there shouldn&#39;t be a blast crater at all. And there wasn&#39;t....so this argument is also a load of bullocks. How would a rocket be able to be powered by such little thrust? Well, the moon has only one sixth of earth&#39;s gravity, so they don&#39;t need nearly as powerful rockets as boosters for the decent. Pretty simple, eh? Moon hoaxers also say it didn&#39;t kick up any dust. This is also bull. Look at the actual footage! It does kick up dust! Seems the hoaxers pulled this right out of their ass. If you haven&#39;t watched the footage, don&#39;t declare it fake! </li>
<li>The footprint-this one is so stupid, it&#39;s actually hilarious. &quot;The moon is a dry ball of rock! There isn&#39;t enough moisture for a footprint&quot; How do you know the moon is so dry? BY LANDING ON IT, GENIUS! This one is so full of circular logic, it actually makes me bust a gut. If the moon landing was a hoax, why are you using knowledge that can only be proven by landing on the moon....to prove it&#39;s a hoax?! The logic here is so sloppy and bad, it probably takes the cake for stupid moon hoaxer arguments. Just think about it for more than 30 seconds. Also, the moon does have moisture. NASA found it when they bombarded it with a projectile and detected water ice in the shrapnel.
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/ice/ice_moon.html">http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/ice/ice_moon.html</a></li>
<li>&quot;Lost Technology&quot;-Why haven&#39;t we been back? It&#39;s not cause the moon landing was fake. It&#39;s simply due to one reason: Bureaucrats. The government just didn&#39;t want to spend the money. Nixon axed Nasa, took a huge dump all over our space program, and basically destroyed Nasa&#39;s budget with massive cuts. The sad truth is, NASA&#39;s budget is only 4 tenths a penny on the american tax dollar. If we just made it one penny, could you imagine what we could achieve? We&#39;d return to the moon in no time. Also, we did not loose the technology at all. Tech developed during Apollo is still being used in space exploration all the time. The tech that we use in everything from rovers to the ISS had it&#39;s start in Apollo. Which means one thing: in order to believe Apollo is a hoax, you have to believe pretty much everything else NASA did was also a hoax. If so, then where all the testimonies? Where are the whistle blowers? 10,000 people worked on Apollo. The only person who was even remotely connected to the lunar program who made a hoax claim was Bill Kaysing. Kaysing was a &quot;technical consultant&quot; who was basically only vaguely connected to rocketdyne. Really? That&#39;s who you believe? Not the 10,000 other scientists who worked on the program? Give me a break. Also, that 10,000 doesn&#39;t include the rest of NASA and basically all other subsequent projects, and as I previously explained they would also be in on the so called &quot;conspiracy&quot;. So the hoax theory becomes even more absurd.</li>
<li>&quot;The Rover couldn&#39;t fit&quot;-Many moon hoaxers claim that the rover wouldn&#39;t be able to fit in the Lunar module. Very strictly speaking, this is true. The dimensions of the rover are bigger than the hatch where it was placed. However, actual knowledge of the engineering reveals this is more garbage. The rover was designed with wheels that could be folded into the axel, then unfolded via nylon straps. These dimensions actually do fit in the module! Don&#39;t believe me? This deployment can easily be seen in the original footage...please watch that before declaring it fake...that goes for EVERYONE!</li>
<li>Van Allen radiation-Hoaxers also claim the astronauts wouldn&#39;t be able to survive the van Allen Radiation belt. (For those who don&#39;t know, the Van Allen is a collection of orbiting solar radiation captured by Earth&#39;s magnetic sphere). However, this one is also wrong. NASA actually set up the landing sequence to minimize exposure to the belt, in fact they passed through it very quickly. The astronauts were only exposed to 1 rad, which is well below the lethal dose of 10 rads. 1 rad is nothing! It&#39;s little more than the radiation you get by watching a burrito turn in a microwave! You think this burrito radiation would kill astronauts? Think again. Also, the LM was fully equipped with radiation shielding that further reduced this tiny amount of radiation exposure. So this one is also wrong. If the exposure was so small, why equip your LM with shielding? Solar flares, that&#39;s why. Van Allen wasn&#39;t really a concern anyway. They knew exposure would be minimal.</li>
<li>The Evidence-Now that I&#39;m done disproving all the evidence that we didn&#39;t go there, where&#39;s the evidence that we did? There&#39;s actually a lot. Firstly, the astronauts brought back rock samples which provide incontestable physical evidence that they were there. Also, radio enthusiasts all over the world were listening in. They were tracking it just as much as mission control, and every transmission throughout the mission could be heard by these millions of HAM radio operators. They weren&#39;t working for NASA. They were civilians. And they were listening the whole time. You can&#39;t fake radio telemetry. It&#39;s the one foolproof way of knowing distance. Radio signals easily show the distance they&#39;re going because of the doppler effect. Moon hoaxers know that a gigantic million dollar rocket was definitely real, and definitely launched into space. However, they say that it spent all it&#39;s time secretly in orbit of the earth instead of going to the moon. This is ridiculous because every HAM operater in the world would know about it. So if you can bring a rocket all the way to the moon, and land it and your goal is to land people, then what&#39;s the point of faking it? At that point, it&#39;s easier to just put people in the rocket and actually land on the moon!
So, hoaxers...any rebuttals?!</li>

Did you know NASA doesnt even have the blueprints to apollo or the lunar module, nothing... or any evidence at all of proof they went to the moon. It&#39;s all been &quot;lost&quot;. Shit they can&#39;t even get spaceX to fucntion correctly, do you know how much more advanced our electronics are now compared to the 60&#39;s and cheaper too... so... why can&#39;t we afford to go anymore? They are liars but you&#39;re welcome to your opinion of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Firstly, it seems clear by this comment that you didn&#39;t read my part about &quot;lost technology&quot;. The technology wasn&#39;t lost at all. We didn&#39;t forget how to land on the moon. No, we could today...if anyone actually had the will to do it! Nixon axed the Apollo program and wrecked NASA. Going to the moon ain&#39;t cheap, and we were able to do it back then because the will was there. But today, NASA&#39;s budget is only 4 tenths of a penny on each American&#39;s taxes. We didn&#39;t lose technology, we lost a dream. The space age dream lies asleep. I don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s dead, because such spirit for exploration is a fundamental part of the human mind. But right now, it&#39;s been eroded away by cynicism. The entire curiosity rover mission costed less then just 13 hours of military expenditure. That will tell you how little the industrial military complex cares about space exploration. Instead of wonder, technology, and inspiration, our government wants to wage war. If we didn&#39;t have such a bloated &quot;defense&quot; (I prefer to call it invasion) budget and instead put that money into the noble pursuit of space exploration, we would&#39;ve already colonized the entire lunar surface. Also, how do you think we got that  &quot;much more advanced electronics&quot;? Much of it was actually developed by either Roscosmos (the soviet space program) or NASA during their race to the moon. Everything from nylon to satellite GPS technology somehow arose from either American or Soviet space accomplishments. So this argument of yours kind of implodes on itself. The moon hoax theory also operates on a complete lack of knowledge about the soviet space program. Korolev, (One of the greatest rocketry visionaries of all time) headed the program. He was in charge of the N1 lunar capsule that would take his soviet comrades to the moon. It was on the fast track to success. The soviets were on a roll! however, unfortunately it had problems. For one, the N1 required many more engines than it&#39;s American rival. This created a host of engineering problems. However, in spite of this, the Soviets were still in the lead. Sadly, however, Korolev died. Their space program had lost it&#39;s greatest mind. And that set them backwards in a big way. Meanwhile, America was getting progressively better. America had also taken a few pages from the N1&#39;s book, due to a conveniant network of spies. So we were first. There was no hoax involved. The greatest accomplishment in human history happened. Accept it! That&#39;s not to denote the great accomplishments of the soviets. Both sides had brilliant minds designing the future not just of their countries, but of the world. But I digress. The fact of the matter is, we didn&#39;t lose the technology. Apollo era technology is still being used all the time. The Space shuttles are one example of many. So much had it&#39;s start in Apollo, that in order to declare it a hoax you must declare almost every other subsequent space related accomplishment of every other space agency, Russian, American, or the ESA. Once you make that huge leap in logic, the moon hoax theory loses whatever credibility it had left. Also, why hasn&#39;t SpaceX gone back? SpaceX is a corporation devoted to low earth orbit for profit tourism. The shareholders aren&#39;t gonna get any richer by returning to the moon. This argument really implodes on itself. Firstly, it fundamentally misunderstands the entire history of space travel, all of which is very well documented. Also, there is another reason we haven&#39;t gone back: the lunar hoax theory itself! It&#39;s cynical nature has steadily destroyed the will to continue space exploration beyond earth orbit. Also, my opinion on Mr. Bart Sibrel: what would you do in Neil or Buzz position? Some asshole is publicly harassing you and saying that you&#39;re greatest achievement never happened...that would piss me off too. If Sibrel didn&#39;t harass them, they would&#39;ve both done so with joy. But the fact of the matter is, Buzz and Neil both have the right to ignore Sibrel. Sibrel was being very rude. Furthermore, this isn&#39;t evidence that the moon landing was a hoax! In fact, what evidence have you provided? None. All of my evidence remains unrefuted. Please, try to find some hoaxer evidence that I haven&#39;t already debunked, or some reason why I was wrong about one of those pieces of evidence. So far, I haven&#39;t seen any imperical hoaxer evidence that holds up against common sense, basic knowledge of physics and space, and photography. Also, the moondoggy link contains more of this emotional rambling. Where&#39;s the evidence? Until you provide that, you have no reason to believe it was a hoax. I question everything I see. I don&#39;t blindly trust authority. I trust facts. And the facts show we&#39;ve been to the moon. There&#39;s just no way around it, I&#39;ve seen no facts that prove otherwise. Not only does it lack evidence, it&#39;s also incredibly immoral. How so, you might ask? It&#39;s so incredibly cynical, and it&#39;s a sickness that is slowly crushing our space exploration. We need space exploration. We need it for science. We need it for the future. Humanity needs to find a new home, and space exploration will pave the way. None of this would be relevant if the moon hoax theory had any EVIDENCE, but it doesn&#39;t so there&#39;s no reason to believe it. If you are interested in space conspiracy theories, that&#39;s great. I am too. But you happened to choose the single least credible, least believable and most cynical and ugly of them all. You want an interesting space mystery? Try Tunguska. Or the lost cosmonauts. Or Project Orion. Or UFOs. All of those are far more credible and far more interesting than the incredibly flawed moon hoax theory.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I am not arguing with you though it seems like it. And I have nothing against you or for having a serious debate and without bringing up god at all or the bible thing, but I&#39;m hoping you understand why I will never believe it. </p>

<p>-Lack of physical evidence
-Lack of ability to do it again
-Math that&#39;s not adding up (fuel consumption, etc.)
-Political/Societal landscape at time of alleged occurrence
-Won&#39;t swear on bible</p>

<p>I won&#39;t be convinced, nor am I trying to convince you, I was just sayin&#39; and I realize I may have come off brash on this thread but my anger and irritation is with the liars among us. That is all. I, probably like you, just want the truth. I believe they never went and until I am dead and standing before God with them and God affirms it to me, you will never convince me. You can understand why I am reluctant to get involved in any discourse beyond what I have because you are arguing technical details and building strawmen of a fictitious event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine. I just wanted a debate. So...can you tell me some of this &quot;lack of physical evidence?&quot; What Math doesn&#39;t add up? Even if you don&#39;t want to convince me, you should always be able to provide irrefutable evidence to back yourself up. If you can&#39;t do that, you should re-evaluate your view of the world. So, what is this lack of physical evidence? What Math doesn&#39;t hold up? If you can&#39;t provide specific examples, that doesn&#39;t count as evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just something about the &quot;lack of physical evidence&quot;. The moon rocks contain isotopes that can&#39;t be found on Earth like helium 3. How do you hoaxers answer to that? And I&#39;ve heard about the arctic meteors. But scientists know the difference between something that&#39;s burned up in the atmosphere and a fresh sample of rock that didn&#39;t. If they really got it from the arctic meteors, everyone would know that because the scientific analysis of the rocks would&#39;ve revealed they were meteors. Instead, they revealed the opposite. They posessed no characteristics of a meteor, and contained helium 3 that doesn&#39;t exist on Earth. That&#39;s basically the smoking gun right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, another point I forgot to mention in my other replies: if Apollo&#39;s fake, what was the point of Apollo 13? If they faked all the moon missions for national image, why would NASA fake a failure? That makes absolutely no sense. And if you say one apollo is fake, you&#39;re saying they all are. They had almost all the same people working on them, using a lot of the same hardware. By saying one is fake, you say their all fake. Apollo 13 being fake makes no sense. Why fake failure?

<p>There was only one &quot;manned orbiter&quot; that I&#39;m aware of - Saturn V. Since only NASA (claims to have) sent manned spacecraft through the Van Allen Belts, we are entirely reliant on what NASA tells us. Where&#39;s your independent corroboration?</p>

<p>Ask yourself why Russia, who were the first to land a craft on the moon (unmanned), and the first to orbit the moon (unmanned) never actually sent a human being to the moon? </p>

<p>In fact no Russian (or indeed any non-American) has ever travelled more than about 380km from the surface of the Earth. Meanwhile, you have no problem with the idea that the USA sent numerous manned missions 1000x further than the Russians (the moon being roughly 380,000kms from Earth). </p>

<p>And presumably it doesn&#39;t occur to you to question why no human has travelled further than Mir Space Station (380km) in the last 42 years, seeing as it is obviously so bloody easy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Apollo 11 was not the only, there were also all the other Apollos. The unmanned probes also count because they prove that going at the trajectory Apollo was cruising at, the time spent in the belt and the radiation exposure would&#39;ve been 1 rad. Which is well below the lethal dose. Other unmanned probes by not just NASA, but the ESA and Roscosmos confirm this. And there plenty of independent corroboration for the moon landing: every HAM radio operator in the world. They were all listening to every single transmission. Those couldn&#39;t have been faked, because distance by radio is impossible to disprove. You can&#39;t fake the doppler effect. It&#39;s actually impossible. All of those HAM operators represent a massive third party. This basically confirms that there was a space craft that actually traveled to the moon. This is irrefutable. They heard it all. As for the rest of your points, you continue to regurgitate the same tired &quot;lost technology&quot; argument that I have already addressed. The fact of the matter is, even with our more advanced technology (Ironically, much of which was developed in the race to the moon), it&#39;s still really expensive. And space exploration hasn&#39;t been the main focus of our government. NASA makes up only 4/10ths a penny on the American tax dollar. It has a comparatively tiny budget, and it has since Nixon terminated Apollo. As for Russia, please read up on the factual history of their manned lunar program (the soviet N1). The main reason is because halfway during the N1&#39;s development, Korolev died. With it&#39;s greatest mind gone, the soviet space program began to lose it&#39;s footing on the project. I recommend watching this documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZnYr94aa9E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZnYr94aa9E</a> about the development of the N1, and reading my previous comments and post about the &quot;lost technology&quot; argument. One more thing...so you say there&#39;s no corroboration for the lunar mission. Where&#39;s the corroboration for it being a hoax? Provide that. Provide evidence that it was fake, beyond the same old rambling lost technology argument. I want EVIDENCE, not proclamations. If you can&#39;t do that, you lose the debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>only 1 rad doesn&#39;t kill people, and the math checks out that&#39;s all they would&#39;ve been exposed to (not even including what would&#39;ve been absorbed by the shielding). 1 rad is only a tenth of the lethal dose. This isn&#39;t data from the actual flight itself, it&#39;s data from the trajectory and technical notes. The math checks out that they wouldn&#39;t be hit by the radiation in a lethal way. If they didn&#39;t go, why get those calculations right? The biggest problem with the hoax theory: In order to believe it, you have to make huge leaps of logic, so huge that it&#39;s easier to just land on the moon then fake it.</p>
