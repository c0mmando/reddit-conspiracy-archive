    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been convincing myself of this very same assertion based on the FOX report cited and the fact that they&#39;re quadrupling the cost of renouncing U.S. citizenship on sept 6th.  Rick Perry was talking about it too...It seems like all the politicians have already been briefed and are trying to condition the population for it so it seems more plausible.  It definitely feels like something big is about to happen.  Cheney is active on the news again, basically only to fear monger.  It feels like its about to happen and that its well-planned out.  Here&#39;s the other thing...could it be bait?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a shot in the dark, what if it was a certain secret base that all conspiracy theorists knows is practically unused anymore, but for some strange reason, a new hanger is being built there, yet all exclusive military and gov contractors have moved to a safer place in Utah. It would be a fantastic opportunity to get rid of any evidence, they were getting rid rid of radiated or deadly toxic chemicals with open burn pits that at the time of operation made everyone sick. They would claim it was were they kept the nations most secret weapons and the massive weapon that ISIS set off had set them back generations militarily. Getting their military budget doubled from already absurd levels of full retardation. Claiming lthe death toll was astounding and, of course records of such happenings at this installation would remain top secret. It would only take 5 ISIS proxy pukes with 1 bomb and the whole AREA would be destroyed. Lol</p>

<p>I&#39;ll bet you anything its the goddamn JP morgan chase building in houston.  I just typed JP morgan chase terror into google and got all sorts of sketchy returns.  I&#39;m also seeing these reports of stock market experts predicting a crash of up to 60%, and quotes like &quot;its hard to know what the catalyst will be&quot;.  I think shit might be hitting the fan in september, boys.  I guess I&#39;m one of those paranoid mother fuckers now.</p>

<p>Edit: Reasoning: tallest building in texas, company has sketchy connections, we&#39;re being warned of impending stock market crashes, lots of &quot;the southern border isn&#39;t secure&quot; and &quot;ISIS could come through the southern border&quot; in the news, lots of &quot;MH370 could resurface as terror&quot; in the news.  This shit is bull shit.  Headlines as sensational as these don&#39;t appear very often, I think there is a VERY good chance this could actually be about to happen.  What if we could prevent it from happening by being vocal now?  I don&#39;t know how many times that I imagined myself with the information that the 9/11 attacks were about to happen before they actually occurred and whether or not I, as an individual, could prevent them.  I was having these thoughts since before I even dreamt of those attacks being a false flag.  I&#39;m kind of freaking out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its texas.  Rick Perry has recently been on the news and its always texas they&#39;re talking about when they talk about the problem with border security.  I&#39;m looking at the biggest buildings in texas in the internet right now.  The top three are JPmorganchase in houston, wells fargo plaza in houston, and bank of america building in dallas.  The Tower of americas in san antonio i guess would be symbolic, but pretty impractical...I&#39;m sure if we think hard enough about what the perfect target in the United States is, one of us can guess...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that something will happen before the end of the year. My two picks are either somewhere in Texas or Chicago...or both. Don&#39;t forget that ISIS members claimed to be in the streets of Chicago. Having two simultaneous attacks go off at the same time or around the same time would be horrible for America. On the one hand with an attack in Texas, the boarders close and the stock market can crash. One in Chicago could also crash the stock market and it would cause chaos that would make Ferguson look like a daycare. Regardless of where or when, something big is coming soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nostradamus is that you? just kidding. I hope you are wrong bro, it seems to me any pretext would be used by the TPTB to manipulate/exploit events to support their narrative and further their gains. I hope reasonable people will keep their vigilance in these times as the world seems to be in a very tight/ volatile situation that any slight misstep could be a black swan that will lead to more lies, and suffering for most of us.</p>
