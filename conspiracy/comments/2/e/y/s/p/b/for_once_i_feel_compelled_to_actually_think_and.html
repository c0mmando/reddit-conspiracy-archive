    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s insane, isn&#39;t it?  Alcohol, when drank regularly, can be an additional high hundreds to THOUSANDS of empty calories.  I calculated some nights to be over 4,000 calories of alcohol alone.  Now if you&#39;re not eating...at all...you can get away with it.  If you are eating/exercising, the pounds just continue to pack on.  It was the single largest influence for me in my getting to a healthy weight/fat percentage.  </p>

<p>Having not drank anything in over six months, last night sure was fun.  Easily the drubkest ice been, and I can tell you, the ills of this fucked up world literally melted away for the seven hours I was heavily under its influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though faculties decrease, I&#39;ve always found alcohol breaks down psychological barriers of critical thought. To take <a href="/u/presidentr">/u/presidentr</a>&#39;s words about keeping you in-line in a different context, when alcohol is approached in a reflective manner, it lets you think in ways that depart from previous thought habits e.g. common assumptions, unaware perspectives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub may be against psychiatry, the DSM, and SSRI medication. However, modern psychiatry places a large amount of faith in cognitive behavioural therapy. Which are just fancy words for philosophy. Modern practice has it&#39;s roots extended back to stoicism philosophies, and it has been proven effective for treatment of a diverse set of issues, even schizophrenia. The fact remains that we can all benefit from the application of philosophy in our lives.</p>

<p>I highly recommend doing research into CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) and stoicism if you have trouble maintaining peace of mind. There is no shame in trying to be happy, or to avoid taking on the weight of things you can&#39;t change.</p>

<p>That said, if we go to war and I can&#39;t fathom agreeing with it, then it will finally be time for militant protests, objective capturing of facilities, and a grassroots campaign backed by militia to reform social ills. I don&#39;t want bloodshed, and I would rather prevent social degradation through a period of mass rioting or civil war. </p>

<p>You are not alone in thinking shit might hit the fan. Prepare speeches to quell the rage and direct it towards the truth. </p>

Yes, the U.S. Federal government is a band of psychopathic killers. So, just stop complying with their demands and stop paying them. Think of them like a coast-to-coast Jim Jones cult.

    <div class="md"><p>So, okay, middle ground time! See, if we want that unity, to band together and resolve long-standing problems, we need to stand together, right? Means not responding to people like that. Means dude you replied to is just as much at fault for division as you were for your reaction. But <em>you</em> control your reaction. </p>

<p>There&#39;s three groups i can think of off the top of my head: the folk that want violent revolution, the folk that want non-violent revolution, and the folk (a sad majority) that either don&#39;t care or don&#39;t think there&#39;s any problem at all. </p>

<p>Nevermind the third group, what <em>really</em> needs to happen is the first two putting away stupid squabbles and snark, and finding a common ground. Say, I think I can see a common thread right here, right now. The need, the want, the drive for change. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have all the answers, but I sure can point out a fundamental flaw that, so far and continuing into the future without problem, makes this not a possible outcome. </p>

<p>Until there&#39;s a solid movement that both type one and two people can band together with, to start chipping away at the third type, we ain&#39;t going nowhere an armed dude with a rifle and CS canisters isn&#39;t telling us to. Unbanded violence mixed with nonviolence will accomplish nothing. But a united movement may gain traction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the American Revolution. The people within group number 2 became violent when they were met with violence. The only way to cause a real movement (similar to the civil rights and currently the immigration movements) is to focus on non-violent protests with strict obedience towards either a religion or a community group. Once these groups meet together and find a common enemy (government, laws, policies, politicians, etc) that&#39;s when people become organized and ready for a revolution. </p>

<p>Like you said, it will be tough to organize group 1 and 2 together. Similar to any successful revolution, there needs to be a mixture of non-violent protests combined with defending these protests violently from the enemy. Political parties will try to divide all of us from uniting together under one protest (with conservatives and liberals). But knowing republicans very well, they&#39;d be the last people to join a protest for any reason. Because Communist.  </p>

<p>I agree with Archonemis, Revolution just breeds a <em>shift</em> of power, it doesn&#39;t actually change the dynamics of society. I guess it would depend on the kind of revolution we were talking about. I don&#39;t think violent revolutions bring real change, just a shift in power. Seen it time and time again in countries all over the world.</p>

<p>The only thing that brings real change, is awareness of oneself on a mass scale, and I think that is happening right now we are reaching some kind of golden age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what the term democracy means? It&#39;s not defined as a completely representative government. That is unique to European/American style of governments, which is really an oligarchy. When I said democracy, I&#39;m describing a government which has oversight from the voters themselves. Technically speaking, there was more wide spread democracy in 1917 Russia then in America at the same time (women, blacks, and open gays could vote/hold office). </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Look at the American Revolution, French Revolution, Chinese Revolution, Russian Revolution, hell even the German Revolution. Society in those areas became much different places, reminisce can still be found today. For better or for worse, revolution sparks political conversations that create the foundations of many nations and ideologies. From physical revolutions and conflicts, not from &quot;awareness of oneself on a massive scale&quot; through the internet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is true, tptb?
It would depend on the wishes, if it was something trivial, no harm in letting someone think they are in power when they are really not. If it was something life threatening I would refuse and then I think the best approach then would be to let the world know about what was going on. As Gandhi showed us, tyrants can commit acts of violence only so long as light isn&#39;t being shined upon them.</p>

<p>If you are trying to get me to say I would commit violence, I honestly dont know the right answer to that. I think that under the specific circumstances if people&#39;s lives we&#39;re being threatened I would find a way to stop them violent or otherwise, But I hope I would not be doing it from a place of fear and instead from a place of right action. I firmly believe that whats most important is knowing yourself and your intentions. If you don&#39;t have one or both of those in your grasp you can easily be taken over by your own emotions, thoughts and the manipulation tactics of others. You become the very thing you were fighting against. That&#39;s how people become corrupted. They don&#39;t really know themselves and haven&#39;t worked on their inner state becoming subjected to their own unconscious desires and fears. And there are powerful people who know how to psychologically take advantage of those people.</p>

<p>Non-compliance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you or anybody here on the internet then?  Have you ever tried to truly be non-compliant with the system? How many people do think have the knowledge and will to grow and slaughter their own food, build their own shelter, and be able to heal them selves without a doctor?  Are you willing to fight a fire without the benefit of a Fire Department?</p>

<p>Almost no one has the skills and ability to live in non-compliance with the current system.  To insist that non-compliance is the only answer would ensure the death of the majority of people who would try this.</p>

<p>If we want to make a difference then we need to start teaching the next generation to be self-sufficient and empowered while empowering those already here.  When people no longer feel/are powerless, then change will happen.</p>

<p>That is not my position.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in breaking from al of society. I&#39;m only interested in breaking free from psychopaths and systems designed by and in support of psychopaths. I like doctors and so I&#39;ll participate in the game of doctors. I like internet and so I&#39;ll participate in the game of internet. I like food and so I&#39;ll participate in the game of food.</p>

<p>I do not like killing. And so I will be paying the U.S. Federal government to kill people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying, but how can you opt out if you are still using money?  How can you say you are opting out and then still engage in commerce?</p>

<p>If you want to opt out of the food aspect, then grow, raise, and slaughter your own.  I hope you see what I&#39;m getting at.  You can&#39;t just say &quot;I don&#39;t pay taxes therefor I am not perpetuating the psychopaths!&quot;  </p>

<p>If you interact in any way with money, then you are feeding the system.  I thought very much the same thing you do and then I realized the only true way to &quot;opt out&quot; is to be <strong>completely</strong> self-sufficient.  I think the majority of people in the US don&#39;t have the skills, knowledge, or experience to do this successfully.  Nor would they because it takes a lot of hard work.</p>

<p>By the way, the internet (and I will probably get burned for saying this) is just the modern version of the Colosseum.  A distraction for the masses.  Sure it has the potential to be a powerful tool for social change.  But not the way it is currently used by the masses. ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awareness. It&#39;s as simple as that.. people asking questions, people seeking outside answers, people getting tired of the boy who cried wolf routine.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, things have always been as bad as they are currently, the only difference is there is now an awareness that is being brought to issues that were/would have been otherwise swept under the rug. We&#39;re refusing to continue to be distracted in larger and larger numbers, we&#39;re refusing to <em>accept</em>, we&#39;re refusing to naively just <em>believe</em>, we&#39;re tired and looking for better answers/resolutions to the issues at hand. They&#39;ve exhausted their left/right issue focused paradigm, nothing is changing and the masses aren&#39;t content just to continue carrying out the marching orders. Yes, there are still a lot of people asking, &quot;but what can <em>we</em> do?!&quot; because we&#39;ve spent a long time feeling powerless and trapped - but the fact that these individuals are questioning at all, gives me hope. It&#39;s all about realizing their power only lies within the reinforced perception of their power by the many. That&#39;s it. Their system serves money, an illusion and lesson in hierarchy reinforced by their system and benefitting only them. The rest of us get by on hope - it&#39;s all very Orwellian. The income/wealth gap has widened to such a degree that that the majority is no longer even minimally supported by this system they&#39;re supposed to uphold for the minority at the top of the pyramid. This is a lesson in economics that has repeated itself time and time again, and time and time again we&#39;ve overthrown the system and replaced those in charge... but the reality is, the corruption is inherent in the system itself, and people are truly beginning to see that. When things crumble this time, what will all of the amassed fortunes mean if people choose instead to replace the entirety of the system? </p>

<p>So yes, they are cornered. They see this blossoming awareness and will take any steps to enfocre/uphold the system that supports <em>them</em>. And I&#39;m not referring to some behind-closed-doors evil mastermind plot here, it is the same thing most individuals do in positions of power: attempt to maintain their power. The difference is, the power is now in the hands of small group of corporate big players, who have mutual vested interests and vast wealth/resources/media and political influence/buying power at their fingertips to maneuver themselves into a position of protection and/or create/inflict a fear propagating event in order to continue controlling the narrative. Fear is a powerful tool - most will sacrifice anything in order to protect themselves - even if that protection is as much of an illusion as the fear itself.</p>

<p>/rant       sorry for getting so worked up over this, I&#39;m very passionate about manifesting the change we wish to see. I hope I was clear in the presentation of my argument and didn&#39;t get too caught up in the emotional aspect. Cheers, friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/everything-you-need-to-know-about-facebooks-manipulative-experiment/">Facebook emotion manipulation experiment</a> was meant to alter users&#39; feed to predominantly show negative or positive submissions to effect the users&#39; emotional state. Anyone with enough sock puppet accounts can submit and vote up negative or positive Reddit posts. You can inadvertently preform this on your self by only subscribing to negative subreddits.</p>

<p>When you think about it, Reddit is an easily manipulated propaganda and manipulation tool. With one to a hand full of people and software to run a few hundred bots, one could skew the perception of the entire Reddit community on any topic, not to mention simply flooding them with gloom and doom.</p>

<p>Reddit has a few features that massively enable such mischief, most notably, its dictatorship subreddit admin policies. Once colluding admins take control of a subreddit, they can force out other admins, and permanently control the subreddit with no way to challenge them.</p>

<p>You have only to create your own test subreddit to know what colluding admins are capable of without notice. When colluding admins control multiple popular subreddits, they can spread out their mischief to avoid notice.</p>

<p>In the end, voting brigades are the most effective at skewing topics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Put down the news and disconnect yourself from the media and focus on your own life and the people and real things around you, because nothing else is real for you. Even if the worst things you can imagine happen, the same thing will be true; only you yourself and those around you in your own life matter and they are the only ones you will be interacting with. Worry about you, not political bullshit meant to distract you from your own real life.</p>

<p>Whatever happens, it&#39;s still just going to be you in your house/neighborhood/life, so go live it and find a way to be happy instead of giving a shit about propaganda. Teach your children how to think and live their own lives happily even given the [broadcasted] state of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It gets me down too. I definitely think it is created to weaken us. It is fear mongering at it&#39;s best in a psychological war we know hardly anything about. I only give myself a day or so to browse r/conspiracy. Then I only read MSM head lines to know &quot;What they are telling the sheep.&quot; I ask questions like why. Like why CNN spent a whole day talking about Robin Williams. Why is it they report the things they do? Is it white noise or is it steering us.
But I have plans. Dreams, short and long term. And unless I focus on what I need to do I&#39;ll never get anywhere. It sucks, but just living and having hobbies gets me through. And I have hobbies toward bettering life for me and everyone. That&#39;s all a person can do. The more people that do that the better we will be. News is rating driven so we have to stop watching it. It&#39;s literally that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The truth will make you mad&quot; -Aldous Huxley</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay, dude. There will always be monsters in life that we have to take care of. The important thing is that you know what&#39;s going on in the world, as dark as most of the news has been the past few months. Knowing the truth will fester within you and can cause panic, but you need to stay strong. I understand the feeling, I had somewhat of a mild panic attack the other day from reading too much news. You also have to remember that a good portion of the news thrives on scaring their viewers, as cruel as it is. People are the most important thing in the entire world and a lot of evil people don&#39;t understand that. Focus on your loved ones and breath. Don&#39;t live in fear because of the evil, but cherish the fact that you&#39;re still alive right now and the knowledge of the truth is intangible. </p>

<p>But consider that they don&#39;t just want to kill most of us -- they have to maintain control while doing it. That tells me they have to take out Russia, China, and India first. And that&#39;s not happening anytime soon. So they can&#39;t pop the cork just yet.</p>

<p>At the same time, more and more people are waking up. They&#39;re gonna have to make a move at some point, even if the timing is not ideal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One problem I find with continuously coming to this sub, is that it sometimes hijacks my life with endless thinking... Which really isn&#39;t that healthy because there is no guide to tell us how to respond to the obscene things we feel is true. I&#39;ve tried and will continue to share certain points to friends and family, and I&#39;m always impressed by how active this sub is, putting articles I would never find no matter how hard I research a subject on my own. My advice is not to dwell on the subject too strongly if you do not plan on taking some particular action with this information, otherwise being up to date on these details will just make you anxious for no good reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what the term democracy means? It&#39;s not defined as a completely representative government. That is unique to European/American style of governments, which is really an oligarchy. When I said democracy, I&#39;m describing a government which has oversight from the voters themselves. Technically speaking, there was more wide spread democracy in 1917 Russia then in America at the same time (women, blacks, and open gays could vote/hold office). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Revolution just breeds a shift of power, it doesn&#39;t actually change the dynamics of society. </p>

<p>Look at the American Revolution, French Revolution, Chinese Revolution, Russian Revolution, hell even the German Revolution. Society in those areas became much different places, reminisce can still be found today. For better or for worse, revolution sparks political conversations that create the foundations of many nations and ideologies. From physical revolutions and conflicts, not from &quot;awareness of oneself on a massive scale&quot; through the internet.  </p>
