     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       I frequent this subreddit a lot because to me, a lot of stuff going on in the world doesn't make sense to me so I try and find alternative answers to what the status quo is.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the Grand Scheme of things, I or anyone else who frequents r/conspiracy really don't know if the government was in on Sandy Hook or the Boston Bombings or any other conspiracies we talk about.  All we can do is investigate and come to our own conclusions and try and discuss them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had the displeasure of trying to introduce critical thinking on r/conspiritard about child vaccinations but I quickly realized it was a mistake due to the Lynch Mob mentality of those people who frequent r/conspiritard and the constant bashing on me by their users.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the problem is that a lot of r/conspiracy users, including myself are the same way.  Instead of introducing critical thinking into the matter, we all argue with each other and it turns into a pissing match.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't achieving anything from doing so and this isn't any different than the Democrats and Republicans always arguing and never achieving anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have two challenges for the people of r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       First challenge is to try and use more critical thinking on a "conspiracy" before making a final judgment.  Like I said earlier, I don't really know if some of these conspiracies involve the Government or not although a lot of evidence points to them being involved but the thing is, none of us know for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second challenge is when we realize that a user comes to the r/conspiracy subreddit to troll and we realize they're trolling, just ignore their ass.  It doesn't do any good to argue with them because they've already made up their minds that were a bunch of retards anyways.  The argument is going to fall on deaf ears and if we entertain the idea of arguing with them, then that's all we're doing, is entertaining them.  And if we start to use the same Lynch Mob mentality like they do, then we're no better than them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The frequent visitors to r/conspiracy, including myself visit this subreddit because we all feel that things aren't right.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious that there were Government conspiracies that were exposed like Operation Northwoods, The Tuskegee Experiments, The Gulf of Tonkin incident and many more that r/conspiracy users know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that people, especially the r/conspiritard users don't have a clue about the exposed conspiracies and sadly, they
       <strong>
        don't
       </strong>
       want to know about them which makes the current state of affairs quite sad.  The side effect of this is that if they don’t know or want to know about past government conspiracies, then they don’t want to find out about current conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's really not worth getting all riled up about these
       <strong>
        true
       </strong>
       retards that come and bash us.  They've already made up their minds and maybe if you ignore them, it’ll challenge them into looking deeper into things like we do.

       Basic good ideas that sadly are not followed here or in most subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parroting old soundbites and reposting questionable links do nothing but cement the conspiracy nut image the media and authorities work hard to portray.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please consider sources, examine possible agendas and biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specially with video links, consider technical details like quality, source and plausibility when presenting them as 'iron clad proof' of anything. CGI and fx are quite advanced, search for similar links.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pet pevee: language and spelling. Yeah, typos happen, but showing a basic grasp of written conventions and grammar rules helps A LOT with credibility. Nothing like some damning meme with stale imagery and metaphores and mistakes like 'Columbia' when you refer to the country not th state. Also, terms like sheeple and 'waking up' make statements sound douchy and distantiate them from the desired recipient.

       But a lot of the time it seems that people get called a troll or a shill if they have different thoughts on the matter or proof otherwise. People will spew shit out with no proof other than their own thought and expect everyone to take it as truth. It is just bad information being spread.

       Yeah, I hear you and that's a big frustration of mine too is that people tend to believe things without looking into it but what can you do when you've proven someone wrong and they still sing the same story.

       Ignoring them is the best way but I feel and people are entitled to their own opinion whether we feel it's right or wrong.

       I submitted my post because of this question and I was trying to introduce critical thinking into the subject and I wasn't trying to start shit or anything:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/2ewvsa/rconspiracy_and_their_antivaccine_stance_coarse/ck3u13q?context=3">
        http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/2ewvsa/rconspiracy_and_their_antivaccine_stance_coarse/ck3u13q?context=3
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But it quickly turned into a witch hunt by those assholes without any objectivity and most of those guys think the know the definitive answers on vaccines because they read up on vaccinations and they think they're fucking experts on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is that a lot of r/conspiracy users do the same thing but with the opposite outcome and that doesn't make us any better than them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel we should stop the rhetoric and keep an open mind about the conspiracies we're into because like I said before, it only makes us look worse when we argue with those cunts.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example of what I'm talking about are The Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth crowd.  These guys aren't claiming there's a conspiracy but there's something fishy about WTC7 and they'd like the Government to look into it more.  This adds legitimacy to their cause because they don't claim to know exactly what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second a conspiracy theorist claims to know the full on truth without actually knowing the full on truth, just suspicions with vague evidence to back it up, then things start to get messy because its basically a case of he said/she said.

      <p>
       I mean, look at what kind of shit these guys try and say over on r/conspiritard:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        *
        <em>
         I_Am_The_Spider *
        </em>
        Everyone here has already addressed your issue with number of vaccines older people used to receive and what younger people receive these days. We have more diseases that we can vaccinate against/more doses over longer periods of time to prevent diseases longer/etc. etc. etc. Why don't you take those explanations to heart? What makes you disbelieve them and keep asking this question? The issue with you siting the "Swine Flu" and "Bird Flu" pandemics is that diseases (at least those like the "swine flu" and "bird flu") don't kill 100% of the time. You will always have people who survive them. Also, if a Dr. tells you you have something, sometimes they are being facetious or just tell you you have what you come in thinking you have... There's ways to explain "a friend told me" away, like you made it up, your friend made it up, your friend is being misquoted (even if ever so slightly it can change the meaning of the whole conversation), etc. etc. etc. That's what the person below me means by "easily manipulated". Take the facts that are brought up using actual critical thinking and incorporate them into your thinking please. The way you are handling yourself here is making the case against you, not for you.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was in response to me claiming that a co-worker of mine got Swine Flu because that's what his Dr. diagnosed it as and this person from r/conspiritard is trying to say that the Dr. lied to my co-worker about having Swine Flu.
       <strong>
        Is this person for fucking reals?
       </strong>
       I didn't know it was a habit to joke around about a diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then later I mention
       <strong>
        Data=Information
       </strong>
       and this is the response I get:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         CarpeKitty
        </strong>
        Data isn't information. It must be interpreted, organised, and processed into information.
If I gave you a list of names, area codes, and something else (ethnicity, household income, etc) that'd be data.
If I gave you a list of sorted names broken up by area code and could work a pattern or something out of the rest of the data that would be the workings of information.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again,
       <strong>
        is this person for fucking reals?
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In what part of the world does Data not equal Information.  DATA IS INFORMATION.
      </p>
      <p>
       But whatever, I've seen this kind of illogical behavior on r/conspiracy and it just makes a person look douchey when making statements like that.

       Boston bombing you say, you're not sure you say,
      </p>
      <p>
       The Boston Marathon bombing was a government conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       See for yourself right here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a good closeup of the backpack that the FBI claims contained the bomb.

       Here are the two accused bombers with their backpacks at the marathon, along side of a third person, a government employee.

       The U.S. government is guilty of the Boston Bombing.

       Case closed.

       The tards say nothing when confronted with this.

       Just keep battering their clenched up eyes until they have to look at what's smacking them around so hard.

       I've seen those pics many times and even though something funny went on in Boston, the pics aren't 100% proof that it was a Government conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we'll know 40 years from now if the Government was involved or not, just like how we know now Operation Northwoods happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that it does no good to argue wuth the Conspiritard group since they think we're retards anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't even humor those assholes by arguing with them because basically, that's what they're goading you into doing and when that happens, they win.

       I can't make the conspiratards  admit it, but I can make them show their unwillingness and inability  to see the facts that are clear to see, the same way you have shown here.

       There is no way those pictures show anything but the US government committing a false flag attack on Americans. There is no logical rebuttal.

       If you defend yourself in court and the prosecution produces pictures of you carrying a  bomb container that was later seen blown up, to the place where it blew up, moments before it blew up, you would be convicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you suppose that the government employee took the bomb to the site of the bombing and one of those nasty Tsarnaev brothers ran up and exploded it when the government agent was just taking the bomb out for a walk?
At least one of the Tsarnaev brothers was innocent because of proof provided here.

       I wouldn't be so sure about that.  I don't know how old you are but I'm old enough to remember the OJ Simpson case and I believe that guy got away with murder even though the evidence against him seemed insurmountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I feel that yeah, something funny is going on with the Boston Bombings and the photo evidence seems convincing and the killing of the older Tsarnaev brother who in one set of pictures looks like he's surrendering and in the next set of pics shows him dead but most of us only get to see the pictures, that's all.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But
       </strong>
       we don't get to get down to the nitty gritty like visiting the crime scene and interviewing potential witnesses and gathering forensic evidence and all that shit that goes on in an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, we are outsiders looking in and to try to make an absolute determination by looking at just pictures is futile.

       I meant rockran, not you.... If I meant you I would have responded to you, not rockran.
Look how he just said 'k' in an attempt to marginalize what you said. I actually agree with your post.

       I can't make the conspiratards  admit it, but I can make them show their unwillingness and inability  to see the facts that are clear to see, the same way you have shown here.

       There is no way those pictures show anything but the US government committing a false flag attack on Americans. There is no logical rebuttal.
