    <div class="md"><p>Move out of the city. </p>

<p>I moved my family out of a major city to an old tobacco farm a year ago. It&#39;s not a working farm, the fields are grassy meadows I cut down a few times a year. The barns are set up for livestock. The fields could be plowed under and planted any time. The place came with a nice tractor and attachments. I bought a gun and a rifle. My wife is a better shot than me. I just need to install solar panels and perhaps a small windmill in the spring when I convert one of the buildings on the property to a guest house for the mother in law. Probably the year after I&#39;ll get chickens. Maybe a couple goats to graze once I fence it. We have two wells, one has a hand pump. </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking of stoking up on something that might be valuable. My first thought has been liquor. I have bottles of whiskey in the storm cellar. I keep adding wines once in awhile. Those can be valuable items for barter. Five bottles of whiskey for enough seed to plant. A dozen for a pair of hogs. It could help. I&#39;m certainly not wasting my time trying to hoard gold. My wife has enough jewelry! </p>

<p>Gardening in large scale has been really great, but it is a lot of work! I&#39;ve had some of the best melons I&#39;ve ever eaten in the last couple weeks. I&#39;ve met a neighbor who will take me hunting this fall. I eat meat--to not take part in the killing is somewhat disingenuous even though to see an animal suffer in any way is hard for me. It&#39;s a skill I feel I have to learn just in case. </p>

<p>I&#39;d rather live out here and maybe have to really fend for myself than be in a city taking handouts and orders if that&#39;s what it would come to. </p>

<p>I think my family is safer here and happier. The dogs are still going bananas over all the space. I have to commute for work now, but I&#39;ll take that. I don&#39;t even like being in the city I moved from to go to work anymore. It just feels so alien now and I lived their for the last 16 years. </p>

<p>So yeah, leave the city. It will be dangerous and oppressive. That&#39;s my advice. </p>

<p>Also, have everyone in your family get a passport. If things get really bad leave the county. Even when there are major upheavals, there are always safe places to go. Survivors move to safety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds amazing. 
My family is originally from Colombia so one option that i always considered was moving back there. Even though they have strong ties to the USA, therefore still connected to any form of elite power with a NWO agenda.</p>

<p>Living in South Florida really has me thinking. If anything was to happen i would literally be stuck in a geographic place shaped like a bottle neck. 
Moving to a farm sounds like a dream.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on having some gold put aside??</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh Florida. That sounds sketchy all around. Ha. I would just get inland if you can away from the big cities. </p>

<p>As for gold, it can&#39;t hurt, but I&#39;m just not sure I want to put money into that because of the high price and certain indications that the price is being manipulated like other commodities. There have been plenty of r/conspiracy posts about that over the last few years. That being said, it will always be valuable and I don&#39;t know if the conspiracy posts about price manipulation are right, or if the prices just reflect how much good is in demand because of the explosion of consumer electronics in the last 30 years. Either way, it&#39;s a good thing to have a little bit of for an emergency. </p>

<p>I would like to buy bitcoin. Just as an experiment. 30 years ago having a few shares of Apple would be nice right about now. I see bitcoin having the same potential, but I wouldn&#39;t want to put more than $1000 in it now. </p>

<p>And yes the farm I bought is amazing. But you have to understand I didn&#39;t go out and buy some southern plantation. I&#39;m not rich. In the city a decent townhouse would cost $600-$700k. I bought a beautiful farm house built in the 1890s for half that. My son can play outside, the dogs can run, my wife can garden, and all in a healthy environment. </p>

<p>Florida has environmental issues too. Sea levels will rise.  I wanted to buy a place that could be passed down through a couple generations and not be in a place that might suffer from global warming. </p>

<p>Brazil is awesome. If I had to flee the county I would seriously consider going there. My wife is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese. It has the strongest economy in the Western Hemisphere besides US and Canada and they don&#39;t rely on oil as much, but use Caine sugar to make ethanol for their cars. </p>

<p>Like I said before, people who survive major world upheavals are the ones that move to safety. My great grandparents did that when they fled Europe at the start of WWI. That lesson was not lost on me.</p>

<p>Edit: minor edit for words.</p>

<p>I admire that and thank you very much for the information. 
I definitely want to be informed and be prepared if anything was to happen. Not only for my safety, but for the safety of my family.</p>

<p>Preparation starts today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to just tell you leave the city without saying this: nothing bad may ever happen, not at least beyond the scale of Katrina or Occupy or Fertuson. I wanted out, in part, because I grew up in a rural area, so did my wife, we both wanted that childhood for our son. It&#39;s not for everyone. So don&#39;t make a plan to move to the country without it being something you would have wanted to do anyway. In essence, plan for nothing happening at all, but prepare for the worst if you can.</p>

<p>If you do think it&#39;s for you or if you like the idea and you can&#39;t get out of the city as soon as you would like to, accept that and start to think about if you felt you had to leave how would you do that and where would you go?</p>

<p>Things you can do right now: make a mental list of people you could stay with outside of the city. Old friends, extended family, a kind co-worker. Keep in touch with those people. Perhaps talk to them about your concerns, but don&#39;t get all crazy NWO about it. Couch it in terms of &quot;hey this Katrina thing, the Ferguson thing has me concerned about being in a city.&quot; Maybe one of them will throw you a life line and extend an invitation if things ever got bad.</p>

<p>You could buy camping equipment. Learn how to use it. If things got bad go to a state/national park, camp for two weeks. If things are really bad and you&#39;ve exhausted supplies, from there go to the nearest town. Find a church or community center, tell them you are afraid to go back. Hell, lie and tell them looters burned down your house, you have nothing to go back to, no family there or anywhere. Whatever it takes to find a lifeline. </p>

<p>If you look at what happened to people in Katrina, many of they waited too long to leave because they didn&#39;t think they&#39;d have to or had the means. Be prepared to make a hard choice and go when your instinct tells you to whether you are prepared for the apocalypse or not. </p>

<p>Notice how in Ferguson the govt was keeping outsiders out, but it didn&#39;t stop anyone from leaving. But think back to Katrina again, when people flooded out of NO after the storm, the police of small communities were threatening refugees with being shot if they didn&#39;t turn back. You want to have reached safety before those in safe places realize they are facing a problem. </p>

<p>Consider this all food for thought. It&#39;s the type of things I have and would think about. </p>

<p>Personally I live in quite an urban city. I have family that lives in a rural town but it&#39;s a 2 hour drive. I&#39;d need to get to them and it&#39;d require a decent amount of gas in the tank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much the &quot;axis of evil.&quot; But maybe one can find NWO controlled countries where the parasite has not penetrated as far, but also are not under economic assault. Some of the smaller Latin American countries that haven&#39;t completely sold out to the IMF for instance; possibly Costa Rica or Uruguay. And, as a member of the BRIC alliance, Brazil is quite likely to throw off the parasite, in the coming years, to become the Germany of South America; maybe you could get in on the ground floor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the advice.
I really want to start planing for whats to come.
I do not want to sound paranoid or anything like that but the way things are looking in the country it does not seem like its going in a good route.</p>

<p>I really think it might come down to martial law being implemented in certain parts of the country in the next year or so.</p>
