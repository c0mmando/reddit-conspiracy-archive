       Word on the street is that there's an attack coming Sept 11, 2014. AP released an article with a future date and later retracted it. And now here is General Mcinerney on Fox News corroborating it.

       Edit: When Sandy Hook occurred, and the original 9/11 years ago - It was noted that there were safety drills nearby to those two events and that those workers went to help(/stage?) the aftermath. Well - In Emmitsville, Maryland this year there is a training course that takes place from Sept 08 - Sept 12 2014. It's description is:
      </p>
      <p>
       "This course covers the content of FEMA 426, Reference Manual to Mitigate Potential Territorial Attacks Against Buildings, and FEMA 452, FEMA: A How-To Guide to Mitigate Potential Terrorist Attacks. This course is being offered to Federal Executive Branch officials and state officials with COOP responsibilities."

       "Maryland is also considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in America[9]" As per Wikipedia. It is also the home of The Washington National Records Center.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Washington National Records Center (WNRC) provides records management services to headquarters and field offices of Federal agencies located in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. It also serves Federal Courts located in the District of Columbia and Armed Forces worldwide." Link:

      <p>
       Also, it is 32 minutes away from Washington DC. Hm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be way off base.. What do you guys think?
      </p>
      <p>
       I did some alternative digging to see if there were any celestial events of astrological cosmic/religious significances and I found a few potentials.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, Sept 9th the moon will be in Perigee. Perigee is the point where the moon is at its closest eliptical point to the earth and in this stage, the moon appears larger. When the moon is at perigee, closer to the Earth, there is much more gravitational pull which contributes to higher tides or greater variation in the high and low tide.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the final Full “Super” Moon (3 of 3) for 2014 occurs at 1:39 UT, just 22 hours after perigee.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Mark Blitz, "Amazingly, according to the biblical calendar months these supermoons’ fall in the month of Tammuz when Israel worshiped the golden calf. The month of Av, when the 10 spies brought the evil report and when the Temple was destroyed twice on the same day. And the month of Elul, which is the month of repentance,” says Biltz, “There is also added significance as it precedes a Shemitah year, or the seventh year of the seven-year cycle beginning this Rosh Hashanah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if that has any significance but people say that the powers that be love that weird occultist sacred geometry/astrology stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, what's up with this "book release" on the 7th?

       I had many of the same thoughts as you.  You can maybe chalk
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of it all up to coincidence but anyone who's studied history and the conspiracies it's composed of knows that
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       coincidences are few and far between.  Many of these "events" are planned decades if not centuries in advance so I think this is something to keep an eye on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hard to make any declarations with a degree of certainty but I think even a "debunker" would have to admit that it's all very suspicious.

       In this thread is a linked video in which a retired general makes this comment regarding a book release. The user notes, "I just want to comment on what this general said about his book to be released. He said '...on the 7th of September a major news network and a major publishing network are gonna put out a book and its gonna be earth shattering of what's happening and what happened'."
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, as nothing is currently happening, or has happened, one must assume that there is some foreknowledge of something that IS to happen which would make this book and the information contained within it relevant....
      </p>
      <p>
       I commented on all of this stuff when the AP news article was captured and passed around - there's some huge stuff happening globally, alot of people talking about the supposed RV and GCR... If there is truth in this talk, I wonder if this will be a huge last ditch effort on the part of the cabal to create chaos/fear and retain some sort of grip on their currently tenuous power-hold...
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, Look at the reactionary state of citizens in the west, things are bubbling up to the surface and there is certainly a new awareness growing... A false flag would certainly be necessary from a power-over-others perspective if you want to detract from the horrible state of economic affairs and looming derivatives/student loan bubble bursts, the horrible failure of the cold war reboot, the militarization of the police force, ebola crisis, weird weather patterns, the gaza occupation, not to mention the growing controversies over big agribusiness/gmos/pesticides/colony collapse, the CDC fraudulent trial vaccine controversy, the cultural grassroots sustainability movement, second amendment violations/essentially the whole constitution thrown out the window... we're in a total big brother Orwellian state of control, we're a capitalistic corporatocracy playing at this idea of democracy, and war generates profit, fear sustains war....
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind, it's getting to be a bit like the boy that cried wolf though... I can't imagine that people at large aren't beginning to take note - there's certainly a new energy arising and a lot of what I've seen on r/conspiracy that was mocked over the years is now coming to light as truth - individuals like ourselves are gaining credibility... it's all very interesting to watch in the grander scheme.

       No Prob :) the whole thing is funky if you ask me. I've kept my mouth shut about a lot of the things on the rise in this sub - especially in regard to the false flag fanaticism, but when I saw that pre-written AP article, something hit very close to home....

       September (from Latin septem, "seven") was originally the seventh of ten months on the oldest known Roman calendar, with March (Latin Martius) the first month of the year until perhaps as late as 153 BC.

       Number 7 Numerology
The number 7 is the seeker, the thinker, the searcher of Truth (notice the capital "T"). The 7 doesn't take anything at face value -- it is always trying to understand the underlying, hidden truths. The 7 knows that nothing is exactly as it seems and that reality is often hidden behind illusions.

       777 by Aleister Crowley
777 is one of the most prominent books of the Qabalah in the western esoteric tradition.

       -Thus, where shall we put Isis, favouring nymph of corn as she was? As the type of motherhood? As the moon? As the great goddess Earth? As Nature? As the Cosmic Egg from which all Nature sprang? For as time and place have changed, so she is all of these!
-Satan, again, who in Job is merely Attorney-General and prosecutes for the Crown, acquires in time all the obloquy attaching to that functionary in the eyes of the criminal classes, and becomes a slanderer.
-Then, on the other hand, what of Moloch, that form of Jehovah denounced by those who did not draw huge profit from his rites?
-The Tree of Life is the skeleton on which this body of truth is built. The juxtaposition and proportion of its parts should be fully studied. Practice alone will enable the student to determine how far an analogy may be followed out.

       Top U.S. military brass warns ISIS has ‘apocalyptic, end-of-days’ plan that can’t be stopped without attacks in Syria
America’s top-ranked military officer says the surging Islamic State group has an “apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision” in the Middle East and cannot be defeated unless the United States and a coalition of partners confront it head-on in Syria.

       Douglas McAuthur McCain Wasn't Alone, More Americans Fighting With Extremists: Officials
He wasn't alone. The American extremist killed fighting with Islamic militants in Syria is one of dozens of U.S.-born jihadists who have taken up arms with terror groups in Syria — posing a significant threat to national security, senior Obama administration officials told NBC News.
In response to NBC News’ exclusive report about American Douglas McAuthur McCain's being killed in Syria fighting for the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), the officials said dozens of other Americans have traveled to Syria and Iraq to help extremist groups, including — but not limited to — ISIS.

       Sears Tower To Be Renamed, Become Willis Tower
For Chicagoans it may be the architectural equivalent of having to watch Michael Jordan finish his career in a Washington Wizards uniform: The Sears Tower is turning into something called the Willis Tower.
That's right, the tallest building in the United States is getting a new name later this year, building management said Thursday.

       The Willis Tower, Chicago, Illinois
233 S Wacker Dr, Chicago, IL 60606, United States
Willis Tower (formerly named and still commonly referred to as Sears Tower) is a 108-story, 1,451-foot (442 m) skyscraper in Chicago, Illinois, United States. At the time of its completion in 1973, it was the tallest building in the world, surpassing the World Trade Center towers in New York, and it held this rank for nearly 25 years. Willis Tower is the second-tallest building in the United States and the eighth-tallest freestanding structure in the world. The skyscraper is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Chicago, and over one million people visit its observation deck each year. Named the Sears Tower since its opening, the structure was renamed in 2009 by the Willis Group, as part of their lease on a portion of its space.
United Airlines moved its corporate headquarters to Willis Tower from the United Building at 77 West Wacker Drive in August 2012. As of December 2013, United is the Willis Tower's largest tenant, with its headquarters and operations center occupying around 20 floors of the tower.

Two investors who are part of Larry Silverstein's group that owns the World Trade Center lease are among the buyers of the Sears Tower, which MetLife Inc. agreed to sell Thursday for more than $800 million, according to people familiar with the situation.
Lloyd Goldman and Joseph Cayre, New York investors who are among Mr. Silverstein's backers in the Trade Center, are part of a group that agreed to buy the Chicago landmark, these people said. Another New York investor, Jeffrey Feil, was also a participant in the Sears Tower deal, the people said. Names of the other investors couldn't be learned.

       Ret USAF General Warns of Possible 9/11/14 Coming
Saturday on Fox News Channel's "America's News HQ," network military analyst Ret. Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney told host Uma Pemmaraju that in oder to address the current threat ISIS posses, the Untied States should "go to DEFCON 1, our highest state of readiness and be prepared as we lead up to 9/11," because he warned "we may even see a 9/11/14."
McInerney referenced the missing Malaysia Airlines jet MH370 from earlier this year and said, "On the seventh of September, a major news network and publishing network are going to put out a book. It is going to be earth shattering of what's happening and what happened. The fact is we may even see a 9/11/14 MH-370 surface again. We should go to DEFCON 1, our highest state of readiness and be prepared as we lead up to 9/11."

       Note: Notice how he mentions DEFOCN 1 but doesn't specifically say it should be implemented on the specific date of 9/11, and instead says it should be implimented "leading up to 9/11" (leading up to would include Sept 7).

       'We Should Be at DEFCON 1': McInerney Warns ISIS Already in U.S.
"I believe that we should go to DEFCON 1 and be prepared for another strike. ... I believe American cities will be attacked and we should be prepared for it," he said.
"The American people are in danger. We need a massive air campaign in Iraq and Syria," said McInerney, noting that he believes members of ISIS have already infiltrated across the southern border.

This coming Sept. 11 will mark the 13th anniversary of the unforgettable terrorist attacks on the U.S. that took place on Sept. 11, 2001. According to an expert, the U.S. may still not be safe and should be prepared to tackle another such attack on the same date this year.

       Dick Cheney predicts attack this decade ‘far deadlier’ than 9/11
Former vice president Dick Cheney predicted Tuesday that the U.S. will face a catastrophic attack before the end of the decade that will be worse than the Sept. 11, 2001 bombings.
"I think there will be another attack," Cheney said on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. "And next time, I think it’s likely to be far deadlier than the last one. You can just imagine what would happen if somebody could smuggle a nuclear device, put it in a shipping container, and drive it down the Beltway outside of Washington, D.C."

       BREAKING: Captain of Missing MH370 Flight Identified as Prime Suspect – Report
June 22, 2014: Maybe one day it will finally come out that the US itself likely diverted the aircraft the Diego Garcia, so months/years later it could magically end up in ISIS's hand and resurface, to be used as part of a LIHOP event said to be in retaliation to our coming drone strikes in Iraq, using an event that closely mimics 9/11, to be used to really hammer the war on terror conditioning into the publics brain through DIRECT repetition via yet another created puppet terrorist regime.

In the meantime Malaysia Airlines has retired the missing airliner’s flight number in respect for the missing 227 passengers and 12 crew members. As investigators continue to look into the disappearance of the missing Flight MH370, Malaysia Airlines has since replaced the flight number of the missing airliner with Flight MH318, which has taken over the flight route between Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Beijing, China.

       Missing Nukes in Texas? "Plans for Multiple FALSE FLAG Events Taking Shape" READ THIS!!
"It is being reported in multiple locations that a base in West Texas conducted an unauthorized Nuke transfer. There was no signature required for the transfer and it was totally off the books, thus, making this a black ops activity.
On the same day, Senator Lindsay Graham (SC) , stated that if we did not immediately go to war with with Syria, that Charleston Harbor would be nuked."

       Air Force general in charge of nuclear weapons removed for lack of trust: defense officials
A top general in charge of the U.S. Air Force's arsenal of nuclear ballistic missiles has been relieved of his command due to loss of trust, defense officials told NBC News.
Air Force officials said Maj. Gen. Michael Carey was fired for “personal misbehavior” while on temporary duty at an unspecified location outside his usual command. The officials would not describe the behavior, other than to say that it did not involve any sexual improprieties, drug use, gambling, or criminal conduct.
