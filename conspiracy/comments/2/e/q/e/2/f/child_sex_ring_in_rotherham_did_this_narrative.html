       So, there was some news bubbling up recently that seemed to implicate a child sex ring among the elite of England and it looked like finally, maybe, something was gonna be done about all the pedophiles up there in their ivory towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, we got this Rotherham thing that is being squarely placed on the pakistani population.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, am I missing something, are there 2 investigations, or did we just see some serious slight of hand over there?

       It'll be interesting to see whether Yewtree will still be mentioned going forward. But to be fair Sky news were slating the council in that area and asking whether there was some sort of cover up so it all ties in with the elites.

       Take my confusion for example. And I hang out in this sub all the time, I am always looking for shenanigans and this almost flew under my radar. Normal people that just saw "pedophile ring" a few weeks ago and "Pakistani pedophile ring exposed" now don't realize they are getting new information. They think they are getting more information about the article they only caught the headline of before. And now it has a racial element, so it is easy to roll their eyes and say "oh, that all makes sense now" because people are shitty. And the other story just kind of falls away.

       In the run up to Syria the British media has been demonizing and fear mongering Islamic infiltration of schools, Halal meat, domestic terrorists and now Muslim child molesters. So yes, OP's right, the focus has been deliberately shifted.

       People don't study the details.  This story makes it look like the UK authorities are cleaning up the historic pedo investigations.  They are going to use this to slow down/stop on the elite-pedo-ring investigation.  Watch.

       The Rotherham guys. I haven't been keeping 100% up to date but the criminals were convicted in 2010 and this is just an inquiry into the institutional failings that allowed them to get away with it. My point was that this hasn't just popped up out of nowhere.

       Here is a PDF on the demographics of Rotherham from 2001 to 2011
       <a href="http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/jsna/download/downloads/id/38/rotherham_demographic_profile_-_2013">
        http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/jsna/download/downloads/id/38/rotherham_demographic_profile_-_2013
       </a>
       In the age profile graph there are 20,000 people in the relevant age cohort divide by 2 to get the number of females, that mean a teenage girl there had a minimum 14% chance of being raped and abused and ignored by authorities. The scale of this is huge 1400 is only the minimum number of confirmed cases. Who knows how much similar goings on sweeped under the rug in the rest of the UK. There have already been several other towns where stories like this have leaked through the suppression such as Derby, Rochdale, Telford and Oxford. Can the entire "liberal" establishment now admit they are depraved, bigoted, hypocrites, craven cowards and traitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the PDF Pakistanis only made up 2 to 3% of Rotherham are Pakistani so this goes to show even a small amount of diversity can be very dangerous when cowards collaborate. For the fashionable mind no sacrifice is too great for the god of diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know what the coverage is like in Britain but where I currently am the media are still more concerned about a sole black thug being shot while charging a police officer after previously trying to wrestle his gun off him.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people are so so blinded by political ideology, propaganda, afraid of committing a thought crime or associating themselves with a low status red neck stereotype, they dont believe their own lying eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a lie is so big no one believe you when you tell them, surely this would of been a scandal in the supposedly free media. But anyone who tried to do anything to protect the innocent was arrested for hate crimes.

      <p>
       The Rotherham Pakistani child rape squad story is till unknown to most Americans.  When I tell them they are completely shocked and appalled byt eh depravity and shear scale of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which begs the question:  How is it that such a blockbuster story is failing to hit the news circuit?  Is there censorship at the editorial level?  Is their a concern by the elites to "protect the diversity project" as this story would be devastating if ever known?

       They definitely don't want the pitchforks coming out in america over high-profile pedophiles. As far as I am concerned there are only 2 qualifications to be in high level politics in america. You gotta be a thief, and you gotta love fucking kids.
