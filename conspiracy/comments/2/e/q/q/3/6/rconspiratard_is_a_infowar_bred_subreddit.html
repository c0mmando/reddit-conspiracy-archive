It&#39;s not hard to set up a subreddit made for the ridicule of conspiracy theorism. That&#39;s all <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is, to ridicule, they have a community based around hating us for no good reason other than they&#39;re conforming with the purpose of the subreddit. </p>

<p>It would be very simple for the government to do this, it makes their job easier because anyone who questions them can be ridiculed. Conspiracy theorists are turned into, &quot;Tin-foil hat wearing wacky men&quot; even though maybe if they listened they&#39;d realize it&#39;s deeper than <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> goes.</p>

<p>They have a community based around straw grabbing and getting karma for it. Someone posts something criticizing Israel? They&#39;ll probably call it &quot;anti Semitic&quot; even though they probably don&#39;t even know what that really means. </p>

<p>They&#39;re just circlejerking, while we&#39;re about facts and digging up the stories the mainstream is hesitant to touch. We&#39;re one of the best known news sources on Reddit and with a far bigger audience than <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> anyway. </p>

<p>Also, I really don&#39;t see this sub as &quot;one of the best known news sources on Reddit&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>As a sub, the broad scope of conspiracies which occur tends to get overlooked. The evidence isn&#39;t always vague, sometimes we have members who hit straight to home. Previous topics like the NSA, libor, elite pediphilia, Libya and Syria, CIA gun and drug smuggling, Covert training, have all been reported on and discussed heavily.</p>

<p>What is conspiratorial is the fact that many of these topics have been suppressed from places like news, technology, economics, politics, and have had sources banned from being posted. </p>

<p>Not everything is a gem around here. But when another sub cracks down on a relevant topic, we see an influx of subscribers who want to get to the bottom of it, but have a hard time discussing it elsewhere.</p>

<p>This place has it&#39;s faults, certainly. Wouldn&#39;t consider the scope to be limited though. I&#39;d say our main issue comes from too broad of a scope. Alas, it must be this way. Flawed, yet required.</p>

<p>As far as the user base goes, we have idiots, trolls, agenda&#39;s at play, but open discussion nonetheless. The topics on the recent pedophile scandal where top notch with it&#39;s sourced material.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been here every day for about four years now. It&#39;s been real interesting watching the earlier predictions unfold. This is the type of place to lurk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Info wars is black propaganda. its perfectly sane to theorize possibilities other than what corporate media creates as the status quo. Sometimes conspiracy theories are just entertaining. Sometimes they are dead ringers. I remember reading conspiracies about the NSA and economic collapse in 2007. Look where we are now. The narrative is about control, stories are powerful. I dont give a shit if someone calls me crazy for entertaining alternative reasons for the violent bull shit attrocities occuring daily.

    <div class="md"><p>Meh. People will always attack ideas that stray from mainstream ideology, and I think we should admit there are fringe ideas and theories that are both valid and non-valid.</p>

<p>From what I see from that sub, the most outlandish conspiracy theories rise to the top of their sub, while they completely ignore the majority of information we discuss here, i.e. the security state, militarized police, war &amp; fear mongering. There&#39;s a desire to discredit all of it, and paint us as uneducated, paranoid right-wingers - but I think an objective eye sees through that. They have less than 1/5 of the subscribers. Just ignore it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but to be fair the truly paranoid, believe whatever fits their worldview, the gov&#39;t is responsible for everything bad type of conspiracy theorists they focus on are also pretty pathetic. I get it.</p>

<p>What really pisses me off is the absolute dismissiveness when it comes to the JFK assassination and to an extent 9/11. Those are the two main points of contention, and the two world shaping conspiracies of the century, and to pretend like there&#39;s no good evidence against the official story and anyone who believes that is a dumb ideologue is willful ignorance. And they won&#39;t admit it but those are the two they&#39;re protecting themselves from, because if we&#39;re right that means there is something deeply wrong deep inside the depths of our State that has shaped history. </p>

He quickly found r/climateskeptics and soon went ballistic when no one would cave-in to his demands for all of us to change our positions in light of his &quot;irrefutable&quot; ranting.</p>

<p>N_I_G, in his delusional grandeur, adopted several other subs as his private little world. He, and he alone, had the right to slander, condemn and belittle anyone daring to take a position not his. One of his favourite terms was &quot;conspiratard&quot; which applied to everyone. He took to heart the Lewandowski paper and so felt justified to lump every person with a contrary attiude together. If AGW skeptics could be &quot;truthers&quot; then &quot;Truthers&quot; must be &quot;deniers&quot; etc. </p>

<p>Not too long ago it was revealed that our planet has not warmed for 15+ years. It was at that time that the head-mods on several subs decided to adopt language rules because the users had gone completely nuts in their dispair. N_I_G, thinking himself above such rules, just went on as normal with his slander, condemnations, and belittling. He managed to get himself banned from his percieved private clubs of r/environment and r/skeptic. </p>

<p>Within 20 inutes he was back as u/geneconspiratard on r/skeptic and r/climateskeptics. A quick note to the mods and that account was banned as well. 2 hours later u/otherconspiratard was born. make no mistake about it - that guy is dangerously crazy. If ever reddit is unavailabe I shudder to think what will happen to his neighbours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why should the government do all the work if useful idiots abound? Have one person post a bunch of stuff from a series of different accounts, and eventually the hive mind agrees and joins in the rabble-rabble. I&#39;ve long thought this is what happened to news article comment sections and how they descended into nothing but &quot;Bush vs. Obama&quot; and sickening and stupid racist and statist crap you see. Or seeing self-avowed &quot;Liberal hippies&quot; push for war, death and, of all things, pro-giant corporations and anti-organic farming. </p>

<p>Spend a little effort to build the snowball&#39;s core, then let the useful idiots push it big enough to build a snowman.</p>
