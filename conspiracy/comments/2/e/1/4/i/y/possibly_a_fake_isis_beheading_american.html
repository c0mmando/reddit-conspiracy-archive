       Does this come off as fake to anyone? It seemed weird that Foley wasn't the least bit worried about the fact that he was going to be brutally murdered after his statement. The beheading portion is weird as well- fades out as soon as he starts sawing away then cuts to a photo of Foley already beheaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Maybe I'm mistaken, but there didn't seem to be any blood following the cut to his neck.

       This man makes a point. Maybe he thought it wasn't real until the blade was to his throat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weird thing is it seems just overly produced.  Someone else mase a very good point that normally terrorists like to display their craft. The main focus was the beheading and they edited out like a PG-13 movie.
      </p>

       This is ISIS guys. The terrorist group publishing an annual report and demonstrating a perfect use of social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea here, with the self censorship is to make sure that one precise image would go viral in the mainstream media, in this case the last frame before the fade to black —the knife under the throat. This is a carefully and well executed propaganda strategy. Because they know that big tabloids will jump on this image/opportunity. They know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise beheading videos stay on Liveleaks or gore sites where most mainstream viewers never go. For a few precious hours the video was available, downloaded and of course viewed on Youtube. And because its content is totally acceptable in terms of blood and violence, it will be even more distributed. Any standard gore beheading could never reach this level of impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I clearly see a very professional understanding of social media or "how to spread a beheading video to a mainstream audience", not a niche of gore fans. This is all about reach. Even the small knife has a huge impact in psychologically inducing fear of a barbaric inefficient technique.

       If they are this sophisticated, why behead anyone at all? The journalist who plays the part of the victim is probably one of the film editors. No one needs to die. It's money making theatre.

       Great point there.  Of all the 'terrorist' products I've seen in 13 years and there are thousands, this James Foley video stands distinctly apart in it's post production.  If you've ever really watched any real beheadings you'll know right off something is rotten in Denmark.

       Another bullshit excuse to lend some suspension of disbelief to the back story of ISIS.  Make people think they would have the time or inclination to produce a 'made for television' beheading.  If you're going to make an example, the Islamic Fundamentalist way is full gore, full shock value.

       Here's a decent comparison.  Note that a one-man executioner will put the person on the ground because sawing off a head with them on their knees is counter productive.  Also they'll naturally kick and obstruct your actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blood let down is also immediate and after all that sawing there isn't a spot of blood.  That would be like a porn shoot without the money shot.  It's no wonder why the Brits are saying to examine the evidence is illegal.

       ISIS is a terrorist group which is actively trying to gain a reputation for merciless violence. Censoring themselves doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

       The point does not match the evidence.  Athens neck is th r most unprotected soft tissi is in the human body.  Full if massive amounts of veins and arteries.  Any knife, shirt of butter would have sunk in producing near instant blood.  The circle felt dubbed, and the fade to black, after effects image shake all appears staged.    This is Zionist propaganda.  the same group responsible for creating Isis.  Come on people.  Use that brain.  A terrorist org that hasn't done shit to Israel is either in the payroll, or part of them.  I trust nothing Isis.  A ythomn name that is sourced from their core mythology.  Zionist through and through.

       As much as I'd love to believe it's fake, I don't think that it is. The ISIS is ruthless and would much rather slaughter a man than take the time to stage the execution. My heart sank when I saw this today. Awful, just awful.

       All of the beheading videos I have seen the victims are pretty damn calm. From terrorists to Mexican drug gangs - all of them. I think it is more of knowing what is coming and putting your mind somewhere else or at least trying to and maybe even making your final peace internally. They never yell or fight before (or at least not much)
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing that was eerily missing was the blood. Within a couple of strokes the blade is in the carotid and blood should start pumping/pouring out. That is the only thing that makes me question the video - no freaking blood. The only way to maybe stop that would be a hot blade that would instantly cauterize the vein. I don't know if even that would work. Not that it matters as he talked for a while before cutting so the blade would have been significantly cooled by then.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just doesn't make physiological, anatomical or medical sense is all I'm saying.

       this one is real? except this is the only beheading I have ever seen that cuts to black at the important moment.. proof of a head getting cut off.. 
we see the fake terrorist start cutting.. but not a drop of blood.. that initial cut would have blood squirting out.. but no.. we cut to black.. then we come back and we have a perfect severed head which was cut off by a small knife.. and still.. no blood on his clothing... no blood near where he was sitting, just a small puddle where the neck is. Ive seen more blood from a stubbed toe..

       The knife slices back and forth 7 times before the fade out. No blood. No spraying. It's also extremely odd they fade to black. Why the hell would they do that? After hitting the carotid artery blood should have been spraying for a good couple of heart pumps.

       That was my first thought. He cut back and forth a good few times with no sight of any blood. Foley's heart would have been pounding like crazy with all the adrenaline which in turn would have made the blood pump out.

       Also, you have to remember that there aren't any Americans being killed in Iraq till this extremely fake looking beheading.  Maybe some here and there that have gone to Iraq to join the caliphate, but ISIS isn't really interested in killing those people.  With an American journalist being executed, it's supposed to rally that American spirit to get the bad guys, because now they've killed one of our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALthough, I think the country is so war weary, one dead American really doesn't mean a whole lot.  It's sad if this is real, but as many here have said, there's no blood.  That's impossible with the way he's cutting into this guy's neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's now being taken down because it's clearly fake.  Whoops!  It's the 21st century and Americans aren't dumb about media.  It's the one thing we do right.  We make movies that have more convincing beheadings than this.  Utter nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe ISIS is a bad group, but there has to come a time when the U.S. admits defeat and forfeits the land.  We can't militarily keep killing people like this, unless we have the intention of following a scorched earth policy and wiping Iraq and Syria clean of all potential terrorists.  This of course would be incredibly difficult logistically as well as ethically wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think we should let the country fall under ISIS rule and see what happens.  There's nothing we can do.  And i feel bad for the people that live there, but fuck, it's just too fucked of a situation to fix.

       The tactic IS the "don't watch it"
That way the news can cut and paste whatever snippets they like and tell us not to disrespect Foley or "give them the media reach".

       The trachea is the first anatomical spot that is being sliced, that is skin and cartilage. The main vessels are a little deeper and slightly to the side. You could hear him grunting which tells me that they were causing trauma to the trachea. The vessels, once hit, would bleed like crazy, but I saw no indication of a vessel being hit as most of the trauma was done superficially, and anterior. What I didn't see, however, was skin trauma bleeding which may or may not have been apparent. The knife may have been slightly dull which would explain the number of attempts to get through the anterior part of the throat. Either way, it is brutal.

       I haven't watched the video, really sick of my Twitter feed being nothing but graphic murder porn the past month every time I check to see what's up. It's all "Good morning! Here's a dead kid with pants around his ankles, bleeding all over the street!" "Ready for bed? Want to catch up on the news? Well, here's a dismembered baby in an ice cream freezer!"

       I agree.  Still photos are much easier to photoshop than video.  I were going to behead someone on camera, I'd make it all one solid take, from the first cut until the body is lifeless, so there could be no question that it really happened.

       in risk of sounding like a sick fuck I have to admit I searched for the "full" version only to find that it was nowhere to be found. But let me just get this story straight. the most terrifying and potentially biggest threat at the moment to the world's safety just executed a man and probably used final cut pro to edit out the bloodiest part in order to make it pg 13? sounds legit

       If he really thought out that speech for himself it might simply be because he's been captured for so long that he is starting to believe what his captors tell him.

       In reality he probably had to read the speech from a screen or sign, and did it out of fear of torture.

       Interesting that ISIS storms down from the north.  The Kurds and the US Allies were in the north, along with the British.  This has MI6 all over it, with the intent for us citizens to approve of a third decade of military action in Iraq.

       Prior to watching this I just assumed it was going to be a real execution but wow they managed to make it seem really fake and hokey. All the video cuts, using multiple cameras and of course omitting the actual beheading are making me question whether this was real at all. Why would they do that?

       Are you kidding? The look on his face was wretched before he was beheaded. People act very strange when they know they are about to be executed.

       I don't know why they faded to black when his head actually came off. Although I have seen them blur out gory parts of dead bodies in the propaganda videos they make. They probably want people to focus more on the speech than the gore. They are probably aware that a lot of people who hate what ISIS stands for only watch the videos because they like gore and death.
      </p>

       I think it is real. I don't think they could logically pull of a hoax of that magnitude.

       They faded to black long before any head "came off."  They faded to black before there was even a single drop of blood.

       This conspiracy is very flimsy to me. All of the "evidence" seems circumstantial. Like maybe he looks different because he was in an Iraqi(?) prison for 2 years.

       I'm an idiot and Google is broken right now for searches on "James Wright Foley".
       <strong>
        Can someone please post a link to an article or video that Foley did in his career from a site or page that existed before 8/19?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked on his Wikipedia page but that didn't exist prior to 8/19 and merely stated the headline that's been plastered all over the internet. It seems that he was rather high profile so why would his Wikipedia page be non-existent prior to the release of this video?
      </p>
      <p>
       More idiotic stupid questions from me:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         ISIS didn't exist 2 years ago so how could ISIS have Foley?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Foley was captured in Syria so why would ISIS care about Foley?

       I was reading up on the Nick Berg beheading that happened years prior, and apparently one forensic pathologist explained the lack of blood on that one due to an air embolism. "he could have had an air embolus—when the large veins of the neck are cut, air can be sucked into the heart, where it’s whipped into a froth, which forms a vapor lock, and stops the heart from pumping blood". It isn't talking about the James Foley execution, but it's a possible explanation. Here's the link if anyone cares to read up on it

       Also was on a thread and found two different veterans that say they helped train ISIL forces in Jordan in 2012, but weren't told who they were. Wake up dude.

       That doesn't support your reality at all. Did you actually read what you posted? ISIL was claiming that the FSA was selling weapons to al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda does not support ISIL last time I checked. In addition: in what way is this sufficient evidence to claim that ISIS was the FSA. Your original statment is blatantly wrong.

       All the other google links that you refuse to look at. Also this thread reveals many other secrets for you to catch up on. I like the veterans who are pissed because they believe they may have inadvertently trained these douche waffles.

       Alright lets just put the FSA in the where are they now file, and wait patiently until they show back up? I imagine they are serendipitously, mostly missing from Syria. They may have left a few to tease Assad, but my guess is we won't be hearing much of anything about them, until maybe ISIL gets its ass handed to it. Then they will just change their name again. Until we get evidence they aren't, I will just call them CIA, OK?

       You've shown me the error in my understanding. So two separate groups of CIA trained islamic extremists, that used to be besties, had a drunken fight one night. Being surrounded by mutual enemies has a way of healing misunderstandings between friends, though. I like the revelation of that video I linked better, @ 2:45. Its funny and extremely informative.

       Couldn't watch it yesterday and took another turn and finished it today.  The first thought I had was that's it.  Ive seen the brutal videos that come from Radical groups and they make it as nasty as they can. When he started sawing didn't see a drop of blood.

       I haven't watched any of the videos because I saw a beheading once and it fucked me up for a very long time. We don't need to see stuff like that. I hit hurts the soul. But on the news page talking about it they had a still of him before being killed and I did note he looked disinterested.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen that disinterested look on men about to be beheaded and I wondered if they drug them? I would be running and fighting for my life and force them to kill me before I let someone brutally saw my head off.

       Now Saudi Arabia. They got this shit down to a precision science, I think I'd take beheading by one of their guys if it was between that or lethal injection.

       Seems like CIA black flag operation.
Isis was conquering IRAQ for almost year - and yet almost zero negative news about them. THEN just after some major political shifting in IRAQ and re-deployment of US military "advisors" to iraq - BOOM mass-media were bombarded by anti-ISIS propaganda to gain support for new war. All in the matter of few days.

      <p>
       Dont be stupid - this is all politics. There are not good or bad guys. Just political forces with agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS 2 weeks ago: rebel forces in IRAQ ad Syria (btw they have beef with AL-qaida)
ISIS today: suddenly it becomes "worst terrorist group" - just like that... It seems that world needs new "goal" after WMD in Iraq, Al-qaida and Bin-laden...

       I suspect it was fake too because his upper body length is very tall vertically whem he was on his knees, yet when the severed head was on top of the body at the end,  I noticed the upper body length from the waist on upwards was shorter.
Also, the other American at end was hardly wotried.  He looked like someone who isn't even kidnapped at all.  The ISIS giy was Middle Eastern no doubt, because I have heard enough arabs say word Muslim to know how it comes out of their mouth compared to Americans or other caucasians.

       Finally, someone I can talk to. I've seen the video once(I then rewatched it several times obviously) and in the first 30 seconds I realised it was a fake. It really is but we can't prove it, maybe a photoshop master or someone that deals with these kind of propaganda bullshit.
This video is so smooth and clear, they're both wearing super clean clothes and the prisoner looks so healthy, his speach was flawless. There's editing involved with fade to black and everything. You're telling me that a sheep fucking terrorist has the gear, time and skill to make an edited video?
When he goes to cut his throat it fades to black, why? There's no reason to do so if you really want to scare America. Another strange thing is that there's a post on reddit telling people not to watch the video because it's too graphic and everybody agrees, also his mother says the same thing, not to watch it? What's there not to watch, There's nothing graphic about the video I've seen. Is there any full video where they actually show the crime? Total and utter bullshit, I do apologise if there's an actual video of the real beheading and if there is I take back what I said.

       Just because the original footage was shot somewhere near Syria, doesn't mean it was edited there.  Alas, there are plenty of desktop-jihadis in Western nations willing to edit and upload the footage for the Islamic State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, it could have been edited by them near where Foley was murdered.  All you need is a laptop, some software, and later on an internet connection.  Islamic State is not a ragtag terrorist group - they are a terrorist state (though mostly not formally recognised... yet).  They publish glossy full-colour magazines too, all quite professionally laid out:

       Let me boil it down for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       SHORT VERSION:
The increasing sophistication of terrorist/extremist videos (the use of lapel mics, multiple cameras, video editing, transitions, titles and effects) does not suggest or even imply that the videos are fake/false flag/CIA/Illuminati/whatever.  It is consistent with a wider trend.
      </p>
      <p>
       LONGER VERSION:
Some people (such as yourself L3zer) think that the high(er) quality of this video is somehow suspicious.  It isn't.  These extremists are getting steadily better at packaging their message, across all media not just video (see the link in my previous post)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's WORRYING and DEPRESSING that there are people out there shooting and editing beheading videos using the same hardware, software, plug-ins and processes I use to shoot and edit corporate videos and short films, but that's a rant for a different day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've taught at a film school, and from a strictly production/post-production standpoint the quality of this IS video is entirely unremarkable in itself; I'd rate the skills required at good high-school level or basic first-year diploma level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, the fact that the video is in focus, shot on tripods, correctly exposed, with the victim and extremist miced up with lapels, etc, is a depressing milestone in a way, but only one of several I have seen over the years.  It is only a few steps up in quality from the typical beheading video of a few years ago, but that's not hard as those videos were usually handheld, barely edited, and often, by the time we saw them, tenth-generation re-encodes at 320x240 resolution sitting on rotten.com.  In terms of production quality it's all an improvement from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still remember the first time I saw a beheading video that actually had titles and primitive overlays to block out the face of the beheader (over a decade ago I think).  At the time I was doubly disturbed by the video.  Obviously the brutal content of the footage was the cause of most of my horror.  But, as someone working in the video production arena,  it also greatly disturbed me that there were people out there smart enough and capable enough with technology and software to perform the tasks required to add titles, fades, overlays etc, and yet also be involved in the creation of such a repellent  video.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Foley video is just another step down that same bafflingly incongruous path -- a path that has given us technologically savvy anti-western extremists.

       That fade to black struck me as odd too.  Other extremist videos are not exactly squeamish when it comes to showing the nadir of their inhumanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can think of many "non-conspiratorial" explanations for that fade to black, but all my explanations suffer from the same core problem as the "conspiratorial" false-flag/CIA/etc explanations - they are speculations that are consistent with the evidence but untestable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, here are three possible non-conspiratorial explanations for the fade to black:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They edited out poor Foley's final moments out of a sense of decency and respect for the Foley family and/or for the sensibilities of the viewers.  Yeah, I know, given the final shot of the beheaded young man this explanation seems preposterously unlikely, but I include it for completeness -- and it's no less likely than some of the conspiracy-based explanations.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They wanted to ensure that the video was shown on western TV.  This also seems a little unlikely -- and it didn't work: I'm in Australia and the only thing mainstream TV show here is a single freeze-frame of Foley kneeling next to his soon-to-be murderer.  Nothing else, not even on subscription TV.  But it's possible they were misguided enough to think that editing out the actual killing would get them air time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They botched the job, either through incompetence and/or Foley struggling at the last moment -- perhaps his murder may have been drawn out and (even more) unnecessarily cruel.  Pride is a big deal to these guys apparently, so perhaps the editor faded to black because they thought it made the Islamist look less like a "scary murdering extremist" and more like a "bungling murdering butcher".
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Anyway, as I said, there's no way to test any of the above explanations without access to the raw footage and people involved, not that I'd particularly want to see it or meet them.  I for one actually hope the crazier conspiracies are true, and that no one was killed that day.  But I doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps one day a small special forces team will retrieve the footage for us and conduct interviews with the relevant persons, and the minor mystery of the jihadi-video-that-faded-to-black will be solved.

       Editing out the gruesomeness of the beheading defeats the purpose.  Propaganda like this is supposed to give the viewer a sense of dread.  Also, if it was botched, the effect iseven better.  The most horrific thing to me is seeing someone try to get away but ultimately their fight for life is futile.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as others have pointed out, the media would have simply chopped out the execution.  24 hour news networks have few scruples.  They won't show the execution but they sure as hell will show those beginning moments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if ISIS is as media savvy as they seem, they know there's other avenues in which explicit content can be viewed.  It's the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why to me this video seems fake.  I don't know who would be behind its faking but no blood is a big tell to me.

       There's no reasonable way for you to be able make such definite claims about the purpose of the beheading video, not with any real confidence, not unless you have a level of access to IS that you're not letting on to the rest of us. We're both just speculating on the motives of those that made the video. The difference is that I admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plausible non-conspiratorial explanations for why the actual killing was not shown in the video; explanations at least as plausible as those explanations revolving around the video being fake/false-flag/CIA/etc.

       Indeed you are allowed to do this. But you didn't.

       What you did was make evidence-free claims about the purpose of the video, then pointed out that my explanations are inconsistent with those claimed purposes.

       Logical, certainly. As I said several posts back: coming up with speculative explanations for the fade to black that are consistent with the evidence is easy (for example, maybe both their cameras failed just at the moment of the murder), but testing or falsifying such explanations is hard. Neither of us are able to do this.

       I know I know, saying "we don't know" is way less satisfying than inserting an explanation, but it's also more honest.

       Well then I think the U.S. should stop calling ISIS terrorists and start calling them, mildly scary-ists.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree, it's less satisfying to say I don't know.  I don't know, but given the history of beheading videos, this one stands out as the exception to the rule.  It also makes me question how vicious the group really is, which in the states, is being considered the dogs of hell.  And I'm sure they're bad.  I've seen some pretty horrific things from the group.  However this video flies in the face of that perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if ISIS is trying to come off as more family friendly or what, but if they are, beheading people in the streets and threatening to raise the ISIS flag in the U.S. doesn't exactly point to a kinder, gentler ISIS that is focused less on terrorizing people to make them conform to their religious rhetoric, but focused more on winning the hearts and minds of people everywhere.  In other words, I believe a video like this would be counter productive to their nationalistic goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why this video is confusing to me.

       The other captive steve said they frequently do mock executions so maybe foley thought it was just one of those, which is why he was so calm..almost smiling at one point. I don't know tho...it's pretty weird!

       Also, look at the knife, as the "killer" is talking, it appears to have a "lasso" or string attached to it.  When everything is "said and done", you see the knife on the left, no string.  too many small details say this is not real.
      </p>

       Perhaps I don't want to believe this is real because it makes no sense to me but I can't dismiss what my own eyes see

       Here's a funny thought.
Youtube is censoring all graphic videos of the Foley "execution" but this one is way more graphic and has been there a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       This video is linked in the
       <a href="/r/morbid">
        /r/morbid
       </a>
       reality sub, so be warned that it is extremely graphic.  Thing is, it's not being censored on Youtube and is very relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare this video to the Foley one and see what kind of mess this makes.

       Here is something else to consider: As a deterrent to bombing, does this video make any sense?  I believe it would increase american/british intervention, in other words the exact opposite of the message of the video.  Someone making such a slick production must know this.

       Research the green screen technique.  The blue is not natural to the executer's head.  I'm not even done with my undergrad in digital media, and I noticed it in seconds.  It was most definitely filmed in a studio.  You don't get that type of audio quality anywhere else but.  This is gonna make my editing evaluation look bias to some of you, but the people reporting on it:  CNN, FOX NEWS, and... NY TIMES??  and a bunch of other right wing outlets, but... NY TIMES?  The American people just got bitched, or punked, or whatever you internet kids call it these days.

       I don't know if its fake or not... Regardless it certainly is a tactic used by IS to convey a message of "Don't mess with us" to the world. It should be understood though that this isn't unusual... This is just the nature of statecraft, think about all the nuclear weapons nations such as the US, Britain, Russia and Israel have.
      </p>

       But back to the question, it seems strange that Folley would give a speech which sounded so... submissive before he died. He didn't even shed a tear when talking about his family before arguably the greatest moment of his life - death. Maybe he had to say all that stuff to buy his life...

       I was thinking maybe they put up some cue cards for him to read and held a gun to someone else's head off camera. To me, the speech gelt plausible and his expression before the beheading. The odd parts I immediately noticed were (1) The scraggly filter put on the Obama speech for no apparent reason, (2) The edit to not show the head being cut off, (3) No blood spewing, and (4) Foley's severed head looking kind of peaceful/alive.  Still looking for an analysis of how the severed head shot was faked.

       I hope it's a fake. But hopes apart, there are a few things we can't explain without an expert's opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be great to have a doctor and a professional video editor to corroborate these theories. I agree on a few of them. No blood apparently - and I don't know about you guys, but when I cut myself (cooking or trying to open a jar in the worst way possible) I bleed like a pig. I've seen shaving cuts bleeding more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The behading being edited... Makes no sense to me. It's like - sorry for the comparison but seemed quite graphic to me - doing porn and editing the sex scenes out. If it's porn, it's porn. If it's a beheading, it's a beheading. Why leave the door open for so many questions? Again, makes no sense to me.

       The only thing that makes me doubt is his face. The incredible amount of tension in his mouth and neck. Either he's a great actor or he thought it was for real.

       I think actors could do a better job then an actual victim of something tragic like this.  Imagine one of your loved ones who died in the most gruesome ways and now that video is viral around the world and now you are on the spotlight getting interviewed, wouldn't you just shut down emotionally just to get through the interview??

       Heres a few things I noticed, thats a bit different then previous beheadings. And I know its a different group then before so I have considered that.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        No Flag to show who they represent.
       </li>
       <li>
        The guy speaks English instead of the normal Arabic.
       </li>
       <li>
        No Music.
       </li>
       <li>
        No second set of hands to help, because that knife is too tough to cut a head off with, without extra hands to help you.
       </li>
       <li>
        NOT SHOWING THE BEHEADING, how can they show us how serious they are, by sending us a beheading video without a beheading in it. Its so easy to fake it if you do this way. All the clips at the start of the video show they already have a basic knowledge of editing, but why edit out the actual reason for the video.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This video just seems so off to me. I think its staged or hoaxed. And the next guy in line didnt seem worried or scared at all either.

       I had read somewhere that they would often stage "mock" beheadings for their captives, basically making it impossible for the hostage to ever know when exactly they would be killed. Foley had probably been through this many times before, and had become accustomed to leaving the ordeal alive every time...
      </p>
      <p>
       I do find this video odd however, because of the fade to black upon the actual beheading. Either it is a psychological tactic (the benefit of which I have no idea) or a staging/fake.

       I say this because the first beheading video I saw, pretty much scarred me for life. It was carried out by Al Qaeda. It showed every moment of the beheading... Apparently ISIS is suppose to be more hardcore then Al Qaeda, yet they edit the portion of the actual killing? How strange is that?

       I've just seen your post and had the same question. I've had previously made a

       WTF is going on, really, this is too Orwellian in my opinion. Now I can only imagine the tweetstorm talking about this without even asking themselves some basic questions. I've even seen the statement "you don't need to watch the video" but still keep the impression on your mind and assimilate the message that there are the 'bad' guys and the 'good' guys.

       No blood when they started cutting. The knife doesn't reflect in the sunlight. If ISIS had wanted to prove a point they would have made it as nasty as possible. Plus these guys dont want us raining hell from above down on them. They have stayed away from all the oil facilities and American " interests". This screams Dick Cheney and his boys trying to get us back to war.

       My thoughts as well. If you want to persuade America to stop attacking you, the first thing you don't do is brutally behead an American citizen, then say you're going to do it again.

       Yeah, that and not attacking the oil or American or allied infrastructure given they are "the most serious threat we've faced" smacks a little stupid to me.

       I have to agree. That there's no blood is not possible. Seriously. I've seen two other beheadings before and that first cut spews it out like a fountain. A veritable geyser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my theory behind it. It was a coordinated effort by the US to shock the public into practically begging the pres to attack, attack, attack. And it doesn't matter if the guy in the vid was a lookalike or the real Foley. His parents are obviously in on it, and if he isn't dead already then he will live out the rest of his life, confortably, in protective custody.

       i'm not going to say anything about foley being dead or alive, but the video to me seems staged because the lighting is so off. i can't confirm it's stage though because like others are saying it might be a completely high-tech setup with it's own lighting in the actual location. really difficult to know, but i always thought it was weird he was almost smiling at some points

       At first I believed all that I saw but then after analyzing a bit the video I realized some things that gave it away.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         This was supposed to be another beheading video, among all other beheadings, why did it get so much hype?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They're in the middle of a desert, and audio is crystal clear. He actually got a microphone.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Camera is stable, it is not held by someone...maybe a tripod? Hmm..not usual.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Terrorist starts with a knife (black handle, rather short blade), after there is a different knife on the ground at the end.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Victim is very composed and not much emotion is shown considering he knows his fate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Blood seems to take a long time to come out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A few cuts in the video, maybe he forgot his next line?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Terrorist not looking menacing at all, nearly always looking at the ground a blinking slowly, like he's tired of retaking the footage or something. Also he is looking below the camera angle while he speaks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Left the actual beheading part out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Still image...How did blood get on the victim's both legs on his pants at the same exact level. Also, blood on the leg away from the camera look like a two/three fingers swipe of blood?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No blood on terrorist's hands/clothes when 2nd victim is introduced. Victim does not seem that tense neither after what he had just seen.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Great effect at the ending of the video.

       I want to comment on point 11 in that I find it interesting as well that if the point is to show unfeeling brutality, why would you clean up before introducing the next victim?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen a beheading video like this one (and unfortunately I've seen a few)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also never seen one covered so heavily in the media (don't tell me it's simply because he's an American)
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, even if this video is a staged bit of fakery to provide pretext to do work in Syria, I'm alright with it because I really do believe Islam needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into the new millennium, but let's at least get Michael Bay on the job or something.
      </p>

       It's hard to take this video at face value, something is fishy here.

       It's obviously fake. It can't be real, you can't saw into someone's throat without blood spurting out. Everyone who looks closely says there was no blood. It doesn't make sense for Isil to censor something designed to shock and horrify.

       I watched this other one where this kid shoots two Russian spies in the head. It obviously is fake because there was no blood splattering after a headshot (no matter where the angle of the camera is, blood would still be visible). I dunno man, you can't trust anyone anymore.

       I really cannot believe this video...why the hell would they fade to black for the most important, gruesome part of the video? The part that would really get their message across? REALLY lmao I am laughing at this, it is not only clearly staged but done so in a cheesy fucking way...seems like 9th grade high school film class shitty video editor stuff...so ridiculous. I would like to listen to someone who genuinely believes it tell me why they think it's real.

       He cuts with the blunt part of the knife. The execution wouldn't have gone as clean as they wanted, so they cut the footage. He also looks noticilibly in some sort of distress as soon as the ISIS dude begins talking.

       I'm looking at this as a video editing point of view.
       <a href="http://truthuncensored.net/warning-graphic-breaking-american-journalist-james-wright-foley-beheaded-by-isis-in-chilling-video-to-obama/">
        Video I'm referencing
       </a>
       The beginning of the video has a filter on it to simulate a broadcast with fake "static" added here and there.  Subtitles added on top without these additional filters.  There is a fade out, and a fake "transmission interrupted" almost similar to a TV broadcast being turned off.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, why go to all this trouble with these un-needed effects go get across this particular message?  The no blood is weird and the fadeout is weird but I don't understand the effects unless these terrorists are editing their footage with Sony Vegas before releasing it to the public.

       I think it's fake, I'm not sure if any of you have been around to the gore sites like DocumentingReality or anything, but there are videos on there of the Al-Qaeda beheading some journalists. Those videos were beyond gruesome, I actually cringe whenever I think of them, but in the videos they show the full on beheading. Blood everywhere, wheezing from trying to breathe, the body jerking each time the knife smashes against the spinal cord, etc.  Now, if ISIS is supposed to be ten-times more frightening than Al-Qaeda, why do they block out the actual murder? They're trying to show that they shouldn't be messed with, but they hide the very thing they're trying to scare us with? If they're trying to send a message, it's not exactly a very scary one compared to the past sending-a-message videos from their predecessor

       Just doesnt make sense,the fbi would let these videos circle around the internet but a few naked pictures of women were immediately threatened to arrest people that reposted them. But its ok to spread propaganda and have a nation believe another lie. Just to continue another war with Iraq. Also why the hell were they so calm. James Foley looked like he was waiting in line at the dmv. No struggle, nothing.

       Something else i bet none of you noticed, The video was made in front of a green screen, just look at the edges/outline of their bodies - There's just NO WAY that the wind is blowing that hard in the desert yet theres no sand in the air; atleast not even a little tiny sprinkle of dust lol. The minute i seen this i thought it was hilarious acting smh with what purpose? i don't know but i know one thing, this is all an act.

       the video did not actually show the beheading, but faded to black at the appropriate moment. A subsequent frame purports to show Foley’s head propped up on his headless body. This video was staged, however, as proved by numerous researchers, and even admitted in the British press. According to a report in The Telegraph:…"a study of the four-minute 40-second clip, carried out by an international forensic science company which has worked for police forces across Britain, suggested camera trickery and slick post-production techniques appear to have been used…no blood can be seen, even though the knife is drawn across the neck area at least six times".......Don't you think it's better if they show us the beheading huh it's more convincing right! C'mon it's ISIS they made us think they're the Real Barbarian Beheading in front of the Camera will be easy as water for them.

       But what if they want the people who'll actually scrutinize the video to say "Hey, wait a minute, this looks staged"? That would be the ultimate way to manipulate both the 'masses' and those who think about it objectively. Shock the 'average Joe' with images which inevitably end up splashed all over the media and make the less easily manipulated question whether their own government is lying and setting up an excuse for war.

       Pure speculation, obviously. It's just something which crossed my mind a few times and I was wondering if anyone else had similar thoughts?

       This is the one thread where I realized there are way too many posters grasping at straws. They beheaded an American journalist and posted it to the internet. It was done by a UK recruit. This is now common knowledge. Have some fucking respect. And stop asking stupid tea party level iq questions like "why did it fade to black?". "The production values are too high". I'm seriously disappointed in the level of absurdity.

       I meant respect towards taking a beheading with zero media commentary, (as just the video itself), and then looking for any possible little thing, (like bad editing, or too good of a job at editing), to make this seem like a conspiracy. Like these animals care to play the conspiracy game right now. Do you need it explained in any other bite sized chunks?

       If it was just the fade to black it wouldn't bother me. ISIS are slick, and the bloody mess of a beheading in action does not fit with their style. Watch one - a real one to see the bloodbath. Like I said above, the first cut and it gushes all over like a geyser. In the vid there's 4 or 5 sawing motions and not a drop nor a gash in his skin. It is biologically impossible and laughable to believe.

       So you're just ignoring facts and pretending to be offended by the discussion of someone you don't know's potential death. No one is grasping at straws here, this is filmed like a badly scripted movie. Grow up.

       You all have ZERO facts to back up your assertion that this is a conspiracy. All any of you have is ridiculous "It faded to black i don't trust that". and "we're just questioning the media". What media? It was a video posted online. You don't need the media with this one. You guys are grasping at straws with editing quality. Then anyone who calls you out gets your nonsense projection of "grow up and stop grasping at straws". I'm not grasping at anything.

       I'm pretty sure YOU were the one telling people they were grasping at straws lol. There was no blood spray, you don't even see the beheading, there's no attempt to make this seem realistic and anyone falling for it is a moron.

       It happens like that around here from time to time.  Some theories are hit and miss. Our community needs to get real and focus on the plausible scenarios.  Everyone thinks the rabbit hole has to include everything.

       Totally staged.  At no point does an actual beheading occur. his willingness to exactly what they want him to prior to being allegedly beheaded is insanity.  At that point, what do they have over him.  Why would he participate so willingly. The camera vibration, perfectly timed cuts, "terrorist" actor speaking perfect English.  All adds up to fraud.

       they are likely to be inner city kids, with city accents, not RP accents from an English public school.

       anybody used to watching the high end BBC dramas is only going to know the posh RP English accent, most do not speak like that, they are eeh and aahh, ecky thump like.

       the Woolwich MI6 'killer' spoke like a public school educated Rupert, not a London oik, he had done his years at university then MI6 school.

       You left out one very obvious explanation that requires far less conspiracy. They  showed him the fake obviously blunt knife and told him that if he read the lines and played the part that they would let him live, so he did. When it was done, someone else killed him (as planned) and staged the body. This scenario makes far more sense.

       Obviously he is using a script! That's not even being debated. You really think Foley came up with that whole speech himself? The torture and the mock executions he probably went through were the only reason he spurted those words, they clearly do not represent his actual beliefs.

       I'm no butcher or chef, but have been a successful home cook for years and what the man in the mask is holding is barely 2" longer than my paring knife and does not appear to have any serrations on it. I couldn't bone a chicken with it let alone cut through a human spine.

       I have no choice but to agree with you. I found it strange how theatrical the whole thing was. They rarely have the captured speak or read, the filming looked professional (not some potato cell phone), and no one else present. They also cut the murder for no reason. They obviously do not care to spare his family from seeing this, they want the world to see it! But it's all seemingly staged. Rehearsed. Inconclusive. Even the head at the end looks like it's from an older gentleman.

       Alright lets just put the FSA in the where are they now file, and wait patiently until they show back up? I imagine they are serendipitously, mostly missing from Syria. They may have left a few to tease Assad, but my guess is we won't be hearing much of anything about them, until maybe ISIL gets its ass handed to it. Then they will just change their name again. Until we get evidence they aren't, I will just call them CIA, OK?

       I was thinking maybe they put up some cue cards for him to read and held a gun to someone else's head off camera. To me, the speech gelt plausible and his expression before the beheading. The odd parts I immediately noticed were (1) The scraggly filter put on the Obama speech for no apparent reason, (2) The edit to not show the head being cut off, (3) No blood spewing, and (4) Foley's severed head looking kind of peaceful/alive.  Still looking for an analysis of how the severed head shot was faked.

       I didn't fucking say the media released it, chief.

       I said it's pointless "having respect" when clips of the video have already been all over the media and they're offering commentary blah blah blah

       You've already edited your original comment, though, so responding to your obtuse follow-up is an obvious waste of time. I'm going to go ahead and end this exchange before you make it any stupider.

       I read that a user's friend in isreal said that there is an unedited video that's about 7 min long with no blackout during the beheading. Where could one ask around to Israeli redditors if any others in the area had seen that one as well?

       Your post history is strange. Redditor for 4 months, you posted a macro with the wrong font and then only commented on this story.

       No way.  My mate put on the Daniel Pearl one about 10 years ago and as soon as the knife touched his neck I knew  needed to get out of the room. It's not good for you man to watch these things. If it is real it'll decimate my soul to watch it.

       Another bullshit excuse to lend some suspension of disbelief to the back story of ISIS.  Make people think they would have the time or inclination to produce a 'made for television' beheading.  If you're going to make an example, the Islamic Fundamentalist way is full gore, full shock value.

       Pretty interesting given the publicity that surrounded his kidnapping in Libya.

       His Wiki really doesn't predate the execution video? That's wild.
