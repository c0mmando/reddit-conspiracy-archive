        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The scenario:</p>

<p>A leader of a country is killing civilians in his country. A bunch of the citizens don&#39;t like this and start rebelling. A foreign country sees this and starts supporting the rebels against an evil leader. </p>

<p>Sounds very familiar. Since this is exactly what happened in Syria. And Lybia... and Egypt... and Iran... and Iraq.... and Somalia.. etc..etc... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions</a></p>

<p>The US gave money, weapons and training to the people going against their government and was praised for it. The rebels were seen as freedom fighters and everyone was supporting them. The rebels weren&#39;t called &quot;US/Nato backed anti-government terrorists&quot; They were simply &quot;freedom fighters&quot;</p>

<p>Now take the exact same scenario:</p>

<p>A leader of a country is killing civilians in his country. A bunch of the citizens don&#39;t like this and start rebelling. A foreign country sees this and starts supporting the rebels against an evil leader. </p>

<p>But change around the foreign country supporting the rebels to Russia and it is &quot;fascist, invading, evil&quot;. People froth at the mouth at how much they hate Putin and want him killed and Russia wiped off the map. The rebels aren&#39;t freedom fighters, they are &quot;Pro-Russian anti-government terrorists&quot;... terrorists for defending their fucking homes. The regime doing the murdering is hailed, praised and supported by the world, while the people being murdered are called terrorists.</p>

<p>I am completely astonished and blown away by this utter insanity. A few months ago people were supporting the rebels in Syria and Lybia and hating on Gaddafi and Assad for killing civilians. But now they are supporting a president who is murdering civilians and hating on those rebels for defending themselves. The only difference being which side the US is on. Really tells you a lot about how the world works and how fucking stupid the general public is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s insane if you&#39;re looking at it from the wrong point of view.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve already achieved a perpetual state of war against an enemy that cannot be defined or defeated, if you don&#39;t think outside of the box you could consider the market saturated.</p>

<p>But if you&#39;re smart the next step is to start playing both sides, and then eventually to bring the war home and sell all of those defense products here and abroad.</p>

But if you step back, you will see that NWO is merely the normal world turned upside-down; under its sphere of influence, every institution is functioning opposite of how it is supposed to. Governments are oppressing their people, money is debt, bankers are robbing banks, people are losing their faith to religion, the police are criminals, etc.</p>
