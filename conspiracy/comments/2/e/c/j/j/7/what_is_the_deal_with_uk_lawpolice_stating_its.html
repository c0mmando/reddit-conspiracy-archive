       I went back to view it again, wanted to examine the background audio after seeing someone pointing out there is no wind.  Went to liveleak, found/searched for the video:
       <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=bc1_1408481278">
        http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=bc1_1408481278
       </a>
       and was about to extract/download it from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i am presented with
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yoNIgx2.png">
        THIS
       </a>
       <br/>
       I thought liveleak was the last of all places to promote censorship...
      </p>
      <p>
       Over at
       <a href="http://www.ukcolumn.org/">
        http://www.ukcolumn.org/
       </a>
       on the 21st august edition, they had a part detailing that they asked the police force under which law it is classed when it comes to "viewing video" breaking the law, and they refused to comment. Suggesting there is no law, but the police force and the BBC (surprise surprise) likes to think that it is against the terrorist act of 2008 and that anyone who simply views the (most likely faked) beheading video where there isn't even a beheading taking place, will be branded a potential terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is going on, is liveleak protecting/covering for users in the UK, or what? As far as i'm concerned there is no law stating that you cannot watch video, even having said that, it is nothing but a snuff video. The content of the video breaks no laws in terms of an observer watching it

       Either our Govt. are trying to combat possible race tensions that could arise of the viewing of the video (which i feel is unlikely, since just knowing about it via mainstream media lets you know a British Muslim 'beheaded' Foley).
      </p>

       Or, they know its fake, or not in keeping with ISIS's other videos and don't want people looking too much into it and asking questions.

       It's not fake. There is no evidence whatsoever that suggests the video was faked in anyway. What more proof do you need? Do you need ISIS to fly you out there to see the body yourself?

       Yeah, you've got this this arse-backwards. There's no evidence in the video that would lead an intelligent person person to conclude they had watched a beheading.

       There is a video of him being executed. I have seen it, I heard the sound of his throat being cut. Why would ISIS fake an execution? How would they benefit from keeping him alive and convincing the US he was killed when Foley was a powerful bargaining chip? Explain.

      <p>
       That is some bullshit logic. You can't ask me to prove something wasn't the case because you can't put forward any kind of evidence yourself. There is a video showing the beginning of the execution and an image of his severed head resting on his headless corpse. What else do you need? You're the one claiming this was fake, the burden of proof lies with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's incredibly disrespectful to attempt to turn this into a conspiracy theory, you have no evidence to back up your claim. Imagine if your son, brother or father was Foley, how would you feel if you read all these claims of conspiracy theories?

       Yes, I can. I could hear him struggling to breathe through his windpipe before the video cut. Are you actually suggesting that the picture showing his severed head lying on his corpse is fake?

       What am I making up? you can clearly hear a drowning sound coming from  Foley's throat. Since we are using conspiracy nut logic here, can you prove that he didn't have his head cut off? Your reply to that question is what a normal person would say in response to the claims you are making. You have too much time on your hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Address the question I asked you earlier. Like all conspiracy nuts you ignore the logic and only consider
       <strong>
        claims
       </strong>
       that coincide with your twisted, paranoid world view. Address the quote below.

       You're the one deflecting. I told you that I saw his throat being cut. I saw the picture of his severed head and his headless corpse. You just can't argue against my logic. You know I'm right. Your claims are irrational and stupid.

       I heard that many times in the past decade when i mentioned to people that government spy agencies are illegally monitoring everything you do online and offline. I recall there were leaks confirming their actions recently, but nobody batted an eye and when i mention that the government is spying on people today they tell me "you're a conspiracy nut".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easier to turn to insults than it is to actually do anything about the worlds problems. To think for one moment that your government (whichever nation) would lie to you is unbelievable for some. Western governments are the biggest liars on the planet. Whether it be spying programmes or staged events to make a pretext for invasion... why would anyone able to think for themselves believe
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       their government stands by?
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears to be more criminal to suggest the beheading video was probably faked, than it is to actually perform a beheading... that tells you something.

       Two relatively recent cases and relevant to the area;
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Nayirah al-Ṣabaḥ, 1990. Her testimony kickstarted a war, based on lies.
       </li>
       <li>
        "Weapons of Mass Destruction", 2003. Those claims kickstarted a war, based on lies.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Bear in mind, that is 2 times that the West has fabricated the reasons for war. Forgetting about the other numerous invasions and wars that have been started through lies... that is 2 times too many on it's own. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.

       There is no beheading. There is a man in a chokehold, fades to black, then there is a panned picture of the alleged aftermath. At no point in the video/footage does James Foley's head come off. Look around

       ISIS would have no reason to fake it, other parties would however. ISIS would have nothing to gain from killing a hostage. That's the point.

       All this does is gives the US/UK (West) an excuse to continue profits in the arms trade and continue to push fear as a means to control. Look at many peoples reactions, they are scared shitless and yet there is no beheading video of James Foley and neither have they seen a beheading video of James Foley, as neither have i.

      <p>
       I find it unbelievable that people blindly accept what is portrayed by mainstream media and government alike. If the news told you Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, would you accept that as immediate fact? Many people did just that...

       Because ISIS is made up and acting on behalf of the US Government. The US Government needs and wants a reason to get stuck back into the Middle East, but it's citizens are fed up with war.
