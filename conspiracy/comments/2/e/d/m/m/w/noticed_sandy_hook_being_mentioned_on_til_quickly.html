       Complete with an alleged psychologist commenting about how fascinated he is by this "phenomenon". Why are people who disagree (read: don't western grip handjob the MSM at 5:30 every day) with the official story automatically labeled insane? I totally support people disagreeing with me. Please, i insist. But this is just kind of... gross. I won't even link the thread.

       I dont understand why people care about this shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isnt part of being a conspiracy theotist being chastised? Its like you want your cake and eat it too. I mean, go for it. To each his own, i say. But its odd to me that folks get upset when treated as if they are not normal when they believe things or discuss things that are not normal. Isnt it natural human behavior to treat non-norms as such?
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the more fervently wr are treated as anathema, the more likely we said something (if not blatantly racist or otherwise discriminatory, or psychopathic---lacking empathy and compassion, or something outtight fucking stupid) that shook the foundations of those who hold their negative views towards us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people treat us like shit because we say something racist, discriminatory, or psychopathic in nature, we kind of deserve it. If people treat us like shit because we show them the evidence or a different view of the same picture to support an argument, or because we enjoy speculating alternstive narrstives due to our distrust of our government, then fuck them. Who gives a shit? They have their right to own theirbown opinions, and to even share their opinions with others, no matter how hurtful it is. I support their right to do so. I dont like it, nor do i support their opinions most of the time, but i support their right to have them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I align myself pretty closely to this quote from sam adams:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “If you love wealth more than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, depart from us in peace. We ask not your counsel nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you let this digest for a moment, and really analyze what he was trying to say, you will see how closely those folks who trash us align with those that posterity has forgotten since the revolution. Not much has changed in this respect. And, should the time come for anothet revolution, it will be the neo-tories that posterity will once again forget that they were our countrymen.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time, i feel compassionate enough to wish their chains to rest lightly upon them.

       My issue is that I have a problem with holding people to higher expectations than I should.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning, I would love it if people could entertain a thought without accepting it as truth. That really is the, for me, spirit of conspiracy theorizing. Taking things that may or may not be obviously related and figuring out who profits, why, how, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       It bothers me that people are so dismissive, but not in the "no thanks, not interested" type of dismiss, but the insultingly mean dismising.

       True. I agree. It would be one thing to just dismiss it and move on, but those who go out of their way for ad hominem are attempting to borderline infringe on our rights to have our own opinions and discussions. That is where i start to have issues and where it becomes harder for me to withhold my own emotions from oozing into the discussion with those folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this situation, i try to be as objective, reasonable, logical, and openminded as much as i can. If they keep upbwith the ad hominem or closeminded sttacks or rebuttals, i tend to yield and leave them be.

       I get mad because I think we could all agree that most people are like sheep.  The mainstream media controls the propaganda and since most people are too stupid to realize that they're being lied to, they believe what the mainstream media tells them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our voice "The Conspiracy Theorists", gets ridiculed and discredited by the mainstream media and then we get ridiculed further by the public even though they usually don't have anything to back themselves up with.

       Many people do tune into MSM stance and easily align with one of their offerings, but the amount of people who utilize 'people' generated media such as here (sans astroturfing) is increasing, effectively negating any weight the MSM holds.

       I am confident that my observational skills and rational logic lead me to the most reasonable conclusions, not to be confused with the "certainty" that your position and tone preclude.

       I'm not deluded by my attachment to an illusory worldview, my worldview is open ended and ever evolving.

       I believe you to be the type of person who cannot actually ask yourself difficult questions due to a subconscious awareness that your worldview would be in danger of changing.

       Please.  You have the word "shill" in your username, meaning you learned it recently and haven't yet realized it's a word used far too frequently by idiots to retain any utility.  You write a childishly wordy response that only demonstrates you're not comfortable using the vocabulary you had to look up.  And you genuinely seem to think I'm incapable of independent thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of this vitriol for what?  For my completely reasonable suggestion that you should at least consider the possibility that you're crazy.

       I would agrue against the notion that "they are too stupid."
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow me, for a moment. Is a child born in a third world country with little to no comparable education system stupid? I would say no, he isnt. But, unfortunately, he is doomed to follow what the universe offered him. Being uneducated is completely different than being stupid. (Though, i will admit there are some incredibly stupid people out there, but thats not the point...)
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that just because they are using what they have to the best of their ability (which is what we all, arguably, can only do --- make the best with what weve got) it doesnt automatically make them stupid. When you spend yourbentire life being indoctrinsted into a system thst disallows questioning of authority, is it your fault that you cannot break from that mold from which you were cast?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this is a two sided sword. When presented with facts that are npt congruent with what youve come to know and accept, we are naturally given a choice. We can either disregard it, then discredit it what false rationalization or faith. Or we can accept it unquestionably and disregard everything else that we knew that is no longer fact. Or, we can step back, when confronting such incongruencies, and take a hard look at everything we have come to accept, and the information presented, cross reference everything with our own observations, speculations, and intuition, and come to a more logical conclusion that makes the most sense of all things being considered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stupidity has no place in this paradigm of logic, imo. However, stupidity does play a role for some folks who were not indoctrinated, and who are actuslly stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, i tend to give the benefit of the doubt, and say that most people arent actuslly stupid. They only react to things in the only way they have ever known. This surely is similar to stupidity at face value, especially to those who have learned how to logically discern information and extract the true meanings and patterns thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that said, this is truely a witch hunt, and we certsinly are the witches. And those with the pitchforks are not the ones who are conducting the witch hunts. Those are the already indoctrinated ones, ignorant to their own actions and the ramifications thereof, and the agenda they are helping to facilitate into fruition therein.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how i view things on this subject, and it helps to remind myself to not get angry at such things. Though, i will admit, the temptstion to give in to anger is ever-present. But i attribute that emotion to the frustration that is inherent in our role in society.

       Well, i can agree thst thete are a lot of stupids out there. But just because they think we are crazy doesnt mean they are stupid, that was thebmain point i was trying to illustrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest issue is that people in general have grown to be so complacent thst they are afraid of accepting anything else other than the official narrative as possible, much less true. Those folks are everywhere, and they are thst way (i bekieve) because the thought of being helpless in all the bullshit is so overwhelming thst their natural course of action is one that takes up the defense mechanism of denial, even in the face of undeniable evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, these folks tend to have a zero tolerance policy for others to even entertainingly speculate on alternative versions.

       Well, we should care. I do. But i wont allow that to force my emotions towards a direction where it infringes on their right to say or bekieve what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the end, history will forget that these people were a part of us. History will never mention them more than a sleight statement saying that supporters of tyranny existed. We can look at our history books now that merely mention thst tories existed, and supported the british during the revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       When time comes for the next revolution, they will sit on the sidelines. And we will not forget their inaction. Thus, i dont really care whst they say or believe. But i will suppott their right to be like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when the government decides to start locking all of us up for owning dissenting opinions, all hell would break lose, amd i can foresee that some of those former government supporters will finslly see what weve been saying the entire time. At least, i hope so.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you still make a good point. It doesnt matter how wrong the government is. When they make the rukes, enforce the rules, and decide which rules apply to who and when, they can do as they please. And owning dissenting views in this scenario is actuslly dangerous.
      </p>

       A wise man once said something about the truth is dangerous to those who know it. (Eh, something like that...)

       I totally agree about that history part. The way I see the world, majority of people are nay-sayers. They have a very limited sense of the possible. Those few who do not are the ones who rise out of the crowds and are remembered. The more I look into it, the more I see that it is a stringent requirement to be successful to have access to deep knowledge of all this, and/or esoteric knowledge. Not just politicians but musicians, scientists, writers, etc.

       Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The allegation Sandy Hook "never happened" at all, as alleged by the TIL, is certainly extraordinary, even in comparison to other ideas - say, the idea Lanza was a mind-controlled patsy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone open to conspiratorial possibilities, I have to say, the evidence
       <strong>
        for
       </strong>
       the "never happened" theory [not to be confused with gaps in the official narrative, which I certainly admit exist] appears to consist of subjective interpretations of YouTube videos (Robbie Parker), data with other, credible explanations ($0 homes), and unsupported leaps in logic from these to "it didn't happen". It's certainly well short of extraordinary, and I don't find it very convincing.

       The numerous previous occasions, over decades, where similar things have happened, e.g. Dunblane, Port Arthur, Virginia Tech, etc. There's a LOT of precedent for bad things happening when mentally disturbed people get their hands on lethal weaponry.  There is no such precedent for the US government entirely faking an incident of this kind.

       Less facetiously, this is a perfect example of the "unsupported leaps in logic" by hoax proponents I mentioned earlier. Actually, there are two such jumps here.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There were no pictures shown in the media, therefore nobody saw the bodies being removed.

       The flaws in the above really don't need pointing out. But in case anyone is unclear, I'll just add that there are no pictures of my grandmother's corpse either, and I'm pretty sure she died.

       I've been responding to posts all morning, and it's a shill-storm.  My dissenting comments were instantly down voted into oblivion. I'm not doing it for karma, obviously, but I find the lame arguments and name-calling to be a sign that the truth is winning.  Also, kudos for not linking to the article.

       I responded to a few comments in the most open-minded way I could. I merely expressed interest in opposing theories because I enjoy reading different opinions and was treated much the same.

       Honestly it feels more manipulated than that.  The Anderson Cooper video was a year old, had no current relevance, and all the agreeing comments are upvoted and all the disagreeing comments are buried instantly.  Or maybe I've seen too much and now I'll never integrate into normal society again (whatever "normal" is these days).

       It becomes pretty obvious when you present them with a simple question.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 26 people were brutally gunned down, where did they go? Bodies were removed when precisely? Not a single photograph of a single body being removed from the scene of the crime exists. This fly's in the face of crime scene investigation and expected media coverage that has happened at every major shoot event in US history.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make the claim that things were done differently at Sandy Hook "just because" is absolutely fucking ludicrous.

       That is beyond idiotic and you make it pretty obvious that you are incapable of the slightest independent thought when you just recycle my comment.

      <p>
       I'll break the logic down for you in a simple way that your intellect can handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pictures you claim exist? May actually exist. I'm certainly not denying the possibility that they exist, just as flying pigs may exist. I've never seen either, so until either can be confirmed to "exist." They do not, in fact, exist in public consciousness.

       Why so touchy? I'm just asking questions, bro'. Just asking questions. Guess my skepticism is clearly hitting a nerve for some reason, which I find interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as noted elsewhere, it's a massive leap from "the media didn't show any pictures of dead bodies being removed" to "there were no bodies." In comparison, avian porcines seem a good deal more plausible.

       I came here to find this post after seeing the bash thread. I do have to say that there are quite a few videos that make me question the real story. The medical examiner video, The walking in circles video, The video of the father laughing then fake crying, The video of the 2nd, and 3rd shooters in the woods, The video of how the vehicles parked (much like a movie set. The list keeps going and the arguments are more valid than what we were forcefed on cnn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until i get some real proof, i will stand back and take the shill beating that i learned to shrug off very long ago. Like i really care what anyone else thinks :) Also-- 911 was an inside job.

       I think that the fact that the parents couldnt see their childrens dead bodies is one of the most suspicious things ever about sandy hook
 Plus, where wad the public outcry about this? I know thst if it were my child amd i wasnt allowed to see their dead body, id be flipping some heavy ass shit on some people. Hell, i would probably have to get arrested, but not without the entire world knowing thst i couldnt even be allowed the decency to identify my kids body...
      </p>
      <p>
       But, to be fair, thst doesnt inherently mean that no kids were shot. But it does raise my eyebrows...

       the green screen videos, actors standing infront of green screens with layered composite video.
      </p>
      <p>
       the planter at the firehouse as seen on the grieving parent videos (2pm) is fake, its made from regular planks of wood and has a 90' square corner. this was made and used in a studio, actors did their roles before a green screen and one 'police' car.

      <p>
       the real planter at the firehouse is made from square section railway timber/sleeper wood, it has a beveled corner.

      <p>
       you can see the original on google earth streetview, and also in some video from the 13th/14th.
      </p>
      <p>
       the green screen video behind the firehouse, where the shed/garage thing behind is way too close to the action, the real shed is 100 yards or more away. layered composite video.

        one video

      <p>
       only one planter there, on the building by the road.

       Why would tptb allow this to happen?  To mock this subreddit? There is no simpler conspiracy to perform than if they just would have hired a gunman to do the crime exactly as it happened.  Why risk all this "evidence" being discovered when you could simply pay a nutjob to do it?

       This is my favorite complicit response. Why wouldn't they just kill a bunch of people? Because they don't even have to anymore! The majority has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they don't even need evidence anymore. Just tell them what they believe.

       They aren't mocking my intelligence, they are mocking yours!

       They know for a fact that most people are to apathetic, well-conditioned and just plain stupid to question anything they say.

       Stop asking yourself "why" and just honestly look at the evidence. You might surprise yourself.

       So they go with the way more expensive, complicated and risky option just to mock the public so they can presumably troll us harder?  You do know part of crime solving is establishing a motive right?  Well this is what my why is in this case.  What could possibly be the motive for using tons of resources just to fake murder kids? Especially when it would have at least been easier to just murder the kids?

       Look at you. Rather than just...consider the possibility, you attempt to explain away the motivations, in the context of your own. Establishing the knowledge of conspirators is not dependent the least bit on their goals, which you couldn't possibly begin to understand unless you acknowledge their presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the problem here? You are viewing everything within the context of what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       know. Try to think in the abstract and you might actually get somewhere.

       That's not true at all. I'm viewing the known evidence in the context of logic and rationality. In fact many of the events of the day surrounding Sandy Hook do not fit the model of rationality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most notably, the complete disregard for
       <em>
        start triage system
       </em>
       which is the national standard for trauma control and treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is in fact your kind, who uses your own flawed brand of unconfirmed bias to disregard significant things as insignificant, that do not fit your proposed explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will not accept the notion that you have weighed the evidence against sound logic and reached a conclusion that does not point to serious conspiracy.

       It's not that I don't have respect for you. I don't have respect for your logic.

      <p>
       Your perceived disrespect comes from a notion I hold, that most people tend think their reasoning is infallible. I happen to know that my reason is not infallible which allows me to inch closer to the truth.

       Certainly.

       The preponderance of circumstantial evidence withstanding.

         The disregard of nationally accepted procedure with regard to mass trauma. Including: Lack of STS and Lifeflight
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The disregard of nationally accepted procedure with regard to declaration of death. Bodies declared dead on site and not removed until under the cover of darkness.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The non-existance of footage that depicts any type of realistic shooter scernario. Including: No footage of the shooter, Parents calmly walking in circles at the fire station. No footage of a full scale evacuation of a school where some 800 children were said to be attending. A palpable lack of intensity from all parties involved.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The fact that there are fewer than 10 photographs of Adam Lanza in existance and that no one, I repeat, no one in their neighborhood knew the Lanza's, despite them supposedly being residents of the community for some time.

       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       You want to know what would be somewhat convincing? Evidence of the shooter. No dead kids. Just show me that a human being named Adam Lanza existed and can be shown to have been responsible for the events of Sandy Hook. If the shooter exists, that photo or series of photos exists. That is an undeniable fact.

       While there "could be" there certainly hasn't been a reasonable explanation aside from the ludicrous notion that everyone was justifiably dead on arrival and that we need to respect the privacy of the families.

      <p>
       I'm interested to know what explanation you think there could be for not following highly standardized trauma treatment and legal medical declarations.

       It's not "possible." It's true. No footage has been released. The question is, if it actually exists, why hasn't it been released?

       All in all your response is indicative of the type of thinking that is wholly incapable of even considering the possibility of conspiracy. Which leads me to ask you...

       I live in ct and have friends and family in sandy hook. The murders happened. Do I think there is information being withheld, yes. Did the murders happen? Yes. Do I have friends and family who know the coroner and medical examiner? Yes. Do I think there was a second shooter? Yes. But the "this didn't really happen" has to stop. It did happen. I am one of you. Do I hate the Goverment? Yes. However, this did happen, and I think there is information being withheld.  However, those kids died. We need to focus on what facts are being withheld, not "did it happen at all"

       Why, why can you definitively say yes to all these questions? Besides the fact you have friends and family in Sandy Hook, what have they told you? The town is called Newtown by the way, Sandy Hook is the name of the school. As someone who claims to live in CT themselves, not knowing the difference makes question your character.

       Sandy hook is the best intelligence test besides 9-11... Which is fucking scary because even on r/conspiracy you idiots are failing it with your downvoting of dissenting opinions... We dont need to speculate on what happened, just to point out that 99% of americans, including those quackademics who think they are above faith, openly believe something without a shred of evidence. No, an agenda-controlled newspaper claiming something aint evidence you morons, thats a claim. Sandy hook is one giant psyop. Its more than just gun control. Its to make Americans become used to the new status quo. The choice between living a lie or going against everything you have been raised, taught, brainwashed, lied to, and fed. Not many people will choose the latter, no matter how blatant the lie is. The agenda has realized this, friends, we are at a turning point, the agenda is starting to get sloppy, ON PURPOSE. Sandy hook is such a bad false flag event it looks like a 13 year old kid planned it. With the technology and intelligence they have, one must assume this is intentional. Here is some real psychology. When the agenda makes itself more obvious, the result is more cognitive dissonance for those faithful, reality denying servants of the agenda. Which means more projected anger, more stigmatization of "conspiracy theorists". That is the point. To end the truth movement, or at least confine it to the 3-5% of the population who value truth over authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aldous Huxley wrote the blueprint for how the agenda can easily do this: 10-20% of the population are in a perpetual state of mental addiction and will believe anything. Another 30-40% are ignorant, focus on other things, and will go with the flow. Another 10-15% will go along because they think it is benefiting them or their political ideology, which it may, in the shirt term only.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you have 60% of the population believing the lie. At this point, there is 30% who, to varying degrees, care or pretend to care about the truth. However, they will not go against 60% and the media. Also, for a smaller event, they will not look at it as much. This is so you can see how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not apply as much to sandy hook as 9-11, because in the case of sandy hook it was probably more like 50-70% didn't really care about it.

      <p>
       they are liable to go to jail for their paid lying, or the parents of any real dead kids are going to go after them.
      </p>
      <p>
       remember we only ever see or hear from half the parents of Sandy Hoax, maybe there was 50% real dead kids, 50% faked ones, and this could only mean preplanned massacre, a hoax and murders by CT govt and MSM, that would open up a very angry hornets nest.

      <p>
       Because A) The "non-believer" group has a lot of nutjobs in it that have harassed families of the victims and other workers in Newtown, so "believers" associate "non-belief" with harassment; and B) A lot of arguments lead to things like "HAHA you believe the MSM IDIOTS!

       various non MSM professional journalists have interviewed people in Newtown, various hobby journalists have phoned up the coroner, the gofundme charity for 'Allison Wyatt' which was using the picture of Lily Gaubert for three weeks (how the parents who setup the charity for their alleged dead child used the wrong child picture is beyond belief)

       Sandy hook is one giant psyop. Its more than just gun control. Its to make Americans become used to the new status quo. The choice between living a lie or going against everything you have been raised, taught, brainwashed, lied to, and fed. Not many people will choose the latter, no matter how blatant the lie is. The agenda has realized this, friends, we are at a turning point, the agenda is starting to get sloppy, ON PURPOSE. Sandy hook is such a bad false flag event it looks like a 13 year old kid planned it. With the technology and intelligence they have, one must assume this is intentional. Here is some real psychology. When the agenda makes itself more obvious, the result is more cognitive dissonance for those faithful, reality denying servants of the agenda. Which means more anger, more stigmatization of "conspiracy theorists". That is the point. To end the truth movement, or at least confine it to the 3-5% of the population who value truth over authority.

         Responses range from "Everyone look at this guy! What an idiot!" to "What? Why?"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Conspiracy Believer says "I guess it's because of this research
         <em>
          links to YouTube and other wacko sites
         </em>
         that my mind is so open."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Response: "Oh God, he really is one of THOSE people. Get out of here, weirdo!"

       shooting on the 14th !?

       the two evacuation photos came from the drill of the 13th, ditto the police webcam footage of their picnic in the parking lot. lots and lots of food in bags and drinks placed on the hood of the police car.
      </p>
      <p>
       and another oopsie, the aerial photographs of the two cop cars at the end of the parking lot do not match up with the angles of the cop cars as seen in the dashcam footage. similar but not the same.

       The lid on Sandy Hook is loose. That's why there is always a concerned effort to defend it in a public forum. You get people to really look at the details and it's as plain as day that nothing really happened there.

       You are a tourist. Discovery of the truth isn't a feel good pursuit. Stop pretending you and I have anything in common in search of it. You like your "dissent" in an easily digestible socially acceptable package. I don't presume to evaluate the truth. It is self-evident.

       Sandy hook is the best intelligence test besides 9-11... Which is fucking scary because even on r/conspiracy you idiots are failing it with your downvoting of dissenting opinions... We dont need to speculate on what happened, just to point out that 99% of americans, including those quackademics who think they are above faith, openly believe something without a shred of evidence. No, an agenda-controlled newspaper claiming something aint evidence you morons, thats a claim. Sandy hook is one giant psyop. Its more than just gun control. Its to make Americans become used to the new status quo. The choice between living a lie or going against everything you have been raised, taught, brainwashed, lied to, and fed. Not many people will choose the latter, no matter how blatant the lie is. The agenda has realized this, friends, we are at a turning point, the agenda is starting to get sloppy, ON PURPOSE. Sandy hook is such a bad false flag event it looks like a 13 year old kid planned it. With the technology and intelligence they have, one must assume this is intentional. Here is some real psychology. When the agenda makes itself more obvious, the result is more cognitive dissonance for those faithful, reality denying servants of the agenda. Which means more anger, more stigmatization of "conspiracy theorists". That is the point. To end the truth movement, or at least confine it to the 3-5% of the population who value truth over authority.

       I definitely get that, but I wonder if they've thought about the unintended consequences of quelling dissent in that manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, in other countries where there's not some enormous surveillance machine trying to identify potential challengers... Those countries will continue to produce spirited young people, independent thinkers, potential "threats" that could also turn out to be an enormous boon to their society.

       Honestly it feels more manipulated than that.  The Anderson Cooper video was a year old, had no current relevance, and all the agreeing comments are upvoted and all the disagreeing comments are buried instantly.  Or maybe I've seen too much and now I'll never integrate into normal society again (whatever "normal" is these days).

       This is my favorite complicit response. Why wouldn't they just kill a bunch of people? Because they don't even have to anymore! The majority has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they don't even need evidence anymore. Just tell them what they believe.

       They aren't mocking my intelligence, they are mocking yours!

       They know for a fact that most people are to apathetic, well-conditioned and just plain stupid to question anything they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop asking yourself "why" and just honestly look at the evidence. You might surprise yourself.

       I totally agree about that history part. The way I see the world, majority of people are nay-sayers. They have a very limited sense of the possible. Those few who do not are the ones who rise out of the crowds and are remembered. The more I look into it, the more I see that it is a stringent requirement to be successful to have access to deep knowledge of all this, and/or esoteric knowledge. Not just politicians but musicians, scientists, writers, etc.

       Why even come to this sub and dole out ad hominem attacks? You're not earnestly trying to argue a viewpoint, and you're adding nothing to the discussion. Just pointlessly talking shit.
