Probably not even multiple people, as then there would be much less of a chance of a mistake being made if it was only one person/admin behind all the mod accounts.

<p>All i can say is that in all my time here i have never seen the reddit admins removing posts from r/conspiracy. On the occasions where there have been issues with certain posts -sandy hook dox for example, or if a post violates reddit T&amp;C, the admins have messaged the moderator team directly and explained their actions for removing a post.</p>

It might be my ignorance about this system, but Im pointing out that there appears to be some kind of system where posts that are important and have a high discussion rate are getting pushed down by new posts that repeat the same information or are duplicate posts, and nobody seems to be doing anything about it. And another thing. Mods are often not responding to communications on a regular basis.

<p>The reddit ranking algorithm is not something I have much insight into. For example, I have a suspicion that posts from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are kept artificially low in the <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> rankings. I dont know if the github code for reddit is able to shed anylight on either of our questions, but it might be a place to start. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t say &quot;this is an exact replica of what&#39;s running on our servers&quot;. In fact, I&#39;d imagine it is a lot of work to do the dev, QA and Prod environments and then take another step to migrate to github.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider also the use of chains of trust/recommendation both as the way to vouch for who is real. Create a new crypto (votecoin) [could be btc, this is just for illustration]. When you get one, you are able to &quot;register&quot; by sending a tenth from the same wallet to the &quot;registry&quot;. Plus probably some sort of social media validation to avoid sock puppets. Now you are registered and you get five &quot;votecoins&quot; to send to anyone you want to recommend. If three of those register, you get two more, etc.</p>

<p>I will copy and paste my comments into a plain text file. If in the future they are deleted, I can easily copy and paste them into a new comment.</p>

<p>My comments, even in my own threads, have been deleted due to downvoting. Some of my threads in <a href="/r/BadBIOS">/r/BadBIOS</a> do not get on the front page of new. In other incidents, my threads get on the front page of new but within a few hours are removed. The moderator is not removing them. The moderator cannot put my threads on the front page as they were mysteriously deleted.</p>

<p>Some of my threads in other subreddits that has been on the front page for sometime, were deleted but not by the moderators. It is time consuming to investigate the status of my other threads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The post  in /r/ 911truth was about the plane coming in to the south tower. The plane had been photographed by all camera&#39;s with an unexplained pod underneath it. The pod was finally investigated by the airline recently with  ambiguous  results.</p>

<p>In the second before  the plane reached the tower there was also  an unexplained  flash , both of those anomalies are seen here.</p>

<p><a href="http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/Splitscreen%20Low.wmv">http://thewebfairy.com/911/binaries/Splitscreen%20Low.wmv</a></p>

<p>Since neither of these anomalies have  ever had any explanation proposed as to what they were for, I provided one.</p>

<p>After the plane with &#39;missile and pod&#39; hit the building, the next thing that happened was the strange anomaly  of the  terrorist face, with beard and turban,  that developed in the photo&#39;s of the explosion. seen here. it was even stranger in the video&#39;s which I don&#39;t have a link to at hand.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/2d4jxk/is_this_the_first_giant_psyop_of_911_the_photo/%5B1%5D">http://np.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/2d4jxk/is_this_the_first_giant_psyop_of_911_the_photo/[1]</a> </p>

<p>If that post still cannot be seen, it refers to this photo used in newspapers all over the country that day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vargtass.net/9-11.jpg">http://www.vargtass.net/9-11.jpg</a></p>

<p>I propose that the pod and the flash were involved in making the appearance of bin Laden in the flames using  a sort of fireworks display. and that that image was a planned psy-op.</p>

<p>If you look at the image of the explosion developing after the crash you will see something so unlikely that it is unbelievable.</p>

<p>In it you can see the image of a bearded turban wearing terrorist who comes into existence, appears to look around briefly and then disappears.</p>

<p>The image  was a perfect tool to frighten and psychologically propagandize a gullible world. </p>

<p>The odds against it developing by coincidence are beyond reason.</p>

<p>My post about this was taken down and never appeared on the  9/11 truth new page.</p>

<p>After I inquired as to what happened to the post Mod, SovereignMan sent me a pm saying &quot;It was removed by GayUnicorn6969 and I can see why. Looks like trolling to me.&quot;</p>

<p>I explained my reasoning further, saying that since the attack was not done by Arabs, the people who did do it probably planned the psychological imagery, the optics,  they wanted to project and that this was the probable result.</p>

<p>SovereignMan sent me  a second pm that said &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Looks more like Santa Claus to me. I agree with the post&#39;s removal. It certainly looks like a troll post even if it wasn&#39;t intended that way.&quot;</p>

<p>As a result the man in the explosion cannot be discussed on the forum <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>.
 .........</p>

<p>The list of links sent in a comment  here to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>  about  this post</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2d8e1d/lindsay_graham_is_threatening_us_again_with/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2d8e1d/lindsay_graham_is_threatening_us_again_with/</a></p>

<p>,with a set of links I will send separately showing the aftermath of the first Lindsay Graham threat, was removed as &quot;spam&quot;.</p>

<p>it showed, using several different websites, that a nuke had disappeared from a base in Texas the day Lindsay Graham made a threat</p>

<p>His statement was that  if the U.S. didn&#39;t start a war in Syria then a nuke might go off in Charleston Harbor. </p>

<p>The kicker is that an actual  tactical nuke from Texas   was  then shipped to South Carolina </p>

<p>Some of the top brass in the military refused to nuke Charleston S.C. and sent  it instead to be blown up in the Atlantic about 650 miles out to sea. Subsequently a number of Generals were fired, presumably replaced with people more willing to attack their own country.</p>

<p>The reply when I asked about that comment not showing up was </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve just cleared this from the spam queue.
One of those links is auto-spammed by reddit.&quot;</p>

<p>If it ever was allowed, late,  it wasn&#39;t seen or voted on. so people were denied that extremely important compounded  information  here in r//conspiracy. the links follow, just in case they are deleted again.</p>

<p>&quot;it appears that you account has been  shadow banned by an admin you will have to appeal to the admin or make a new account&quot;</p>

<p>No explanation  or information about <strong>which</strong> admin  was ever forthcoming.</p>

<p>Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>I think there is wholesale banning to reset the counters of those who achieve credibility  and to make them appear as the dreaded &#39;new users&#39; with far less credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are there specific, topical examples of what is &quot;not  allowed&quot; here? This nebulous problem stuff does not mean anything to me. I am relatively new to this sub, but I was under the impression that everything was and has been allowed as long as it &quot;fits&quot; and does not violate ethical posting guidelines (i.e. no doxxing, witchunts, etc). </p>

<p>I came over here to have freedom do discuss topics like Zionism, 9/11, govt spying and such because pretty much everywhere else I have  looked at those topics are taboo and routinely get deleted despite the fact that those are the topics that <em>really</em> matter and the issues that needs discussion and need to be brought to people&#39;s awareness the most.</p>

<p>So far I have not been disappointed at all here, it is the first place I stop to check on the news and what&#39;s going on in the world, so I guess I don&#39;t understand what the problem is, perhaps it is because I am not familiar with aspects of reddit that maybe I should be, but I am not really here to get into the weeds on that kind of thing. I am here because I like the variety of opinions and topics and the very open and interesting discussions I have been reading every day.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who does not see the problem here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a post today, leading to a google dox. The article was  Something along the lines of ISIS attacking america, crossing over from mexico. </p>

<p>People commented that the date was 1899 September eleventh, I cant remember what they concluded by that. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I cant remember the publication, or website it was on rather. </p>

<p>I will say that I cant find it anywhere, strangely enough, not even in my history(it was no more that 5 hours ago) I don&#39;t know how web history works, or to be more specific, if the page has to &quot;exist&quot; to still to appear in my history or not.. </p>

<p>So yeah, that kind of info seems, if true, like something that would be taken down (Think about all the excuses for the militarization of our police if we had another, possibly allowed, terrorist attack).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried directly messaging you about the front page and have not yet received a response regarding posts on the front page that have low scores getting a better placement the posts with higher scores. It might be my ignorance about this system, but Im pointing out that there appears to be some kind of system where posts that are important and have a high discussion rate are getting pushed down by new posts that repeat the same information or are duplicate posts, and nobody seems to be doing anything about it. And another thing. Mods are often not responding to communications on a regular basis. I messaged the admins at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about stickying a post and maybe one admin responded the rest just ignore my request. </p>

<p>We rarely see them in the conversations. Is there a reason, a rule or something to that effect?</p>

<p>Just curious, no other motives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s because I&#39;m much further down the rabbit hole than I was in 2009.  People are likely to up vote posts on topics they are already familiar with.  If it sounds too &quot;out there,&quot; they immediately dismiss it.  That&#39;s as true of the denizens of r/conspiracy as it is of anyone.  </p>

<p>Downvotes often come within seconds of posting, before anyone has had a chance to read/watch what I&#39;ve submitted.  </p>
