       To provide some context, Quinnspiracy is basically a scandal involving a female game developer and many game journalists, even a reddit mod and shows the corruption and censorship within the game industry. Take into account that there was a huge effort to suppress this info from reddit yesterday. This video which is allowed on reddit explains it pretty thoroughly:

      </p>
      <p>
       I have a few examples screencapped but the shadowbans are literaly dozens:

       Specifically the r/videos thread is a minefield.

       What the fuck is going on in this site? Are admins now free to start their own crusades or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw the rule about posting about other subreddits is kind of vague so please remove if I break any rules.

       Going against the neckbeard trend.

      <p>
       In a world without consequences* and with proper protection I'd happily "make sex" with her.   But yeah,  not even in the same hemisphere as "hot".

      <p>
       *Consequences = wouldn't have to see her again.   Wouldn't make people question my sanity or professional ethics.

       Of course they can fuck. But if you're a guy, and you're going to throw away your credibility for some girl, then for fucks sake, at least make sure they're hot.

       No matter how many times this community is proven right, which lately has been over and over again, people will still call us crazy conspiracy theorists because of how well TPTB have conditioned the masses to think and feel. It will take years upon years of facts and evidence for everyone to actually learn and understand what's truly going on.

       I think most of the people calling us out right now are actual shills. They are pissed that more people started supporting a CT worldview and are trying to bring back the ridicule to shut us up or at least stop more people from joining us.

       No, it's an attitude like this that makes people ridicule conspiracy theorists.  I mean the idea that most of the people that disagree with you
       <strong>
        must
       </strong>
       be shilling is just incredible.  It's just such a convenient and easy defense to throw around when there is a lack of evidence.

       Please, get a bit of perspective. This comment is a bit silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, this whole fiasco is peanuts compared to dozens of other conspiracies in the world. 'Huge' is an overstatement.
      </p>
      <p>
       People think conspiracy theorists are loons because all the 'big' conspiracy theories fall into one of these two categories: 1) Absolute nonsense and demonstrably not true 2) True, but impossible to believe without changing your whole thought structure. People will generally reject the truth rather than change their model of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This story is quite believable to everyone, it fits people's idea of how the world works, it's not a representative sample of

       It's a male feminist. Used in this context it's a guy that bashes his own gender in order to fit in with the SJW crowd (social justice warriors love to be offended by proxy for others. They're the types that say men can't be raped or PoC can't be racist). Many users in SRS (the admins favorite brigading sub) are males not females. Same with many users in Reddit's "fempire" (a group of subs run by SRS style SJWs. They took over
       <a href="/r/creepyPms">
        /r/creepyPms
       </a>
       and turned it into basically a male bashing sub. SRSsucks discusses it
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1isftt/">
        here
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/1jp7c6/">
        here
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       These types of 3rd wave "feminists" (really I wouldn't even call them that since they treat women like they need to be coddled and are completely weak compared to men. Their views are insulting to men and women. Basically treating men as rapist oppressors and women as victims not capable of abusing or raping or things like that against men.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/tumblrinaction">
        /r/tumblrinaction
       </a>
       is a good sub to go to to see loony SJWs at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit admins seem to have a hard on for SJWs. The userbase usually is against SJWs. Still, doing things like censorship in threads, refusing to ban SRS (a sub that brigades worse than any sub I've seen), defaulting
       <a href="/r/twoxchromosomes">
        /r/twoxchromosomes
       </a>
       (even though the users didn't want it, and the subscribers didn't want it), making it where
       <a href="/r/mensrights">
        /r/mensrights
       </a>
       (I don't necessarily agree with them on everything but they still deserve a fair share of a voice) can't be posted in r/bestof (
       <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1iwc8s/rbestof_no_longer_accepts_links_from_rmensrights/">
        thread here
       </a>
       ) all show that there is quite a bit of bias by the admins and large sub mods towards feminists and SJWs.

       They act like this is the best thing you could ever do for a female, but in reality this kind of thought is extremely sexist. Treating the opposite gender in any less of a 'completely equal way' is just showing the world how little you consider a female equal in the whole scheme of things. Almost to the point (if not exactly the same) as that cop who just got fired...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sickening, especially when women do it... when I see or hear females say "I can't do X, I'm a girl." I feel like they should be stripped of their gender entirely (if only it was possible).

       I'm not guilty of anything you retard. I asked what male-ally meant.  The first sentence summed it up. The guy proceeded to write a wall of text which I didn't read.  It struck me as strange that someone has that much energy to expend on something most people don't spend a lot of time thinking about.  That's it.

       Let's be honest, in this day and age it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've completely destroyed the feminist movement with their crazy, and god forbid you try to argue any legitimate thing that males have as a disadvantage in society, they always make it about themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, idk why but they keep pushing the lie that being a feminist means you want true equality between the sexes. That simply isn't true, and never has been. This is causing many people to incorrectly categorize themselves as feminists
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck feminists
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck MRAs
      </p>
      <p>
       If you care about true equality between all people (sex, gender, race... ect)
       <strong>
        you are an egalitarian.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Any movement that is created and focused on promoting one side of a group cannot claim to represent both groups equally. You can't fight inequality by only focusing on one side of the coin when both sides face disadvantages in society.

       MRA's are egalitarian. They want men and women to be treated the same. However they are simply aware that our society has an anti-male focus. Primarily because of the feminist movement.

       Maybe not all feminists but let's face it, the ones running the movement and making all the money are anti-male. The movement was  hijacked and that's what a mainstream feminist is.
      </p>
      <p>
       No double standards here. Nor am I assuming anything; this fact is  acknowledged by pro-male feminists themselves. I know where the line is I just didn't think I was going to have to draw it for someone else.

       Yeah it does and I'll tell you why. Tell a feminist you're pro-male and they will assume you're anti-female and a woman hater/beater/rapist.

       Well it shows that mainstream media can and are whores (most of us already know this, but it further solidifies it). They will present PR and call it journalism and we're supposed to trust it. This time someone got good PR because they slept with a "reporter" other times because the company is a sponsor...

       I've been playing games over 20 years, have about 500 steam games and I've never heard of any of the people involver except total biscuit. Game journalism is just boring most of the time. And unnecessary. There's not enough time to play all the games let alone read about them all the time.

       I disagree within the context of Zoe Quinn. She's an indie developer, who made a fairly crappy game. The guys she banged hardly even mentioned her (though exposure is exposure). I believe Depression Quest has close to zero reviews from critics (though this may of changed since yesterday).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, outside of the indie gaming community, with major developers, collusion IS a problem, and on a much larger level. Way more money and influence at steak. Zoegate is just a symptom of a greater disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to point a guilty finger at Quinn, I would advise you direct yor attention to her maliciously destroying a charity, only to create her own. Her charity project has no date, no real information other than it's similar to the one she destroyed (raising money to help women game developers get their games off the ground). Despite having an event planned, with no date, she's (of course) accepting your money.

       Part of me thinks that because she has been/is depressed that maybe all the media, mods and admins think that if the tide turns against her that they may have a suicide on the gaming community's hands.

       Either that or she is a secret alien taking refuge here on our planet and we need to keep good relations because of the technology she's taught us - or something.

       My own theory is that there's some legally motivated ass-covering going on. The admins are probably getting orders to put out the fire in order to minimize the chance of some kind of slander/libel lawsuit.

       A lot of people have been following cross-posting links and voting on them. Reddit instituted a new algorithm to catch vote-brigades, so that's most likely what caught the OPs.

       At absolute worst, an indie developer may have traded sex for good reviews, a bunch of individuals cheated on their spouses, and now a ham-fisted attempt is being made to cover their asses; and that's assuming the absolute worst of the accusations are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bribing journalists is nothing compared to what the big players do with their war chests of cash; the money that changes hands for shelf space, for exclusivity deals, to cripple products on certain hardware, and nefarious agreements to suppress wages industry-wide... Oh, but Reddit blows its collective mind because a feminist may have fucked a few men for some positive feedback.

       Regarding moderation response to all of this: yuck. Not even remotely cool. Those moderators should be called out until they are made to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the "scandal" in a larger sense: I don't get it. So what? Just because she fucked someone doesn't mean they are obligated to help her career. There are probably other reasons, irrespective of sexual relations, that caused these people to help her out--I dunno, like maybe a solid product?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe she likes sex. I don't see anything wrong with that. I don't give two shits about anyone she's had sex with. Why should you?

       I don't know who she is, why she's more important that others, and only that there was some sex and perhaps that lead to some sort of inflated reviews. Other than that, I could give a fuck about any of them.

       I don't quite understand what is going on here but if someone wants to have sex isn't that their business. It's like y'all are trying to destroy this woman's life and career cause she had sex. And worse she had sex while not hot. Who cares?

       Reddit won't get sued because corporate staff are taking reasonable action to prevent dissemination of defamatory materials. Quinn's exBF, on the other hand, made claims about sexual conduct, published private correspondence, and has been updating his web page about her throughout. Showing continued intent to harm. Folks like InternetAristocrat continue to present these claims, and pile on others such as unproved claims of quid-pro-quo in reviews by sexual favoritism, thus involving the media companies who'd hired some of the people it's claimed she had trysts with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder who's hired lawyers here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've got release of private communication with malicious intent to defame and harass. In Massachusetts no less, a place with real anti-harassment statues. You've got at least two or three named figures who've had their professional reputations as journalists besmirched. And then there's the companies they work for, who are alleged to be willing participants in some grand conspiracy. All of these players have good cause to seek legal redress.

       She fucked people for good reviews on her games. How is that not any of our business? As consumers its completely our business. I don't want to be reading fake reviews.

       The shadow banning sounds ridiculous, but the whole reaction of gamer dudes in this Quinnspiracy is just...proof that there are too many estrogen analogs in the US  water supply? These guys' behavior and weird obsession with this woman is just embarrassing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do young men not have pride/ego anymore? The behavior is just so petty and ignoble...I dunno, step back and take a look at yourselves, guys, it's not a good look. Maybe watch some John Wayne movies? Based on this thing, police brutality lately towards women and children, and some of the bitchy, petty posts I see by men in our town's facebook group, I'm really starting to worry about American manhood.

       A girl gamer to a male gamer is super hot even if she is ugly and fat. We have two chics in my clan and you can literally hear some of my teammates fapping to their voices. The come ons are fucking epic and sad. Its truly hilarious. I can't think of a better way to spend my time really.

       I can't "this" enough. Female online gamers tend to fall into two categories: those who spam the fact that they got bewbs and a vag, and those that don't. It doesn't matter at all how attractive or not they are. However, none of that matters to a lot of d00ds, the fact that there's a female in their presence, is fap worthy.

       Seriously though, iirc more fat is related to more estrogen production.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the entire western world gets fatter, more estrogen and less testosterone in the population does weird things to males.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in the fact that many fat guys just aren't attractive to attractive girls and you'll have a bunch of fat emasculated men that are starved for any female attention they can get. Even if it's online.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know from experience. I was a fat loser like that for a few years, 1400miles and 5 pairs of running shoes later and I feel 100x better, and more masculine. I cringe thinking of the stupid bitch shit I did before.

       It's the weirdest combination, too - this pussification and emasculation mixed with violence and anger. So angry they'd spend all day sitting behind computers abusing a female developer they've never met because she dared to have sex with some dudes while on "a break" from the guy she was seeing instead of going out into the world and creating things themselves. Making videos, making memes, crying big whiny text walls all over Reddit. But not, you know, fucking developing a goddamned game themselves if they're so mad that a female developer exists. It's not that hard guys, stop circle-jerking and abusing women you don't even know and give it a try...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so ignoble and it's embarrassing to watch, but for some reason they don't have the ability to step back and look at themselves. I like to blame the BPAs in the soda cans, the Modafinil and Risperdal cocktails, and Prozac-pissed out water, but I fear there's also a huge cultural component, too.

       I just got here and don't give a shit about zoey quinn or what she does with her ladyparts, but there are also allegations of irresponsible game journalism here, which makes the issue somewhat relevant to my interests.

       You are being intellectually dishonest to pretend that the internet is angry about Z.Q. putting out. The outrage and longevity in this debate is 100% due to the streisand effect. When you start abusing your internet power, to censor and control, cover up something, you put a magnifying glass on it instead. Also the internet HATES censorship so yes, things are going to get ugly.

       I wish people could just look at this issue rationally. I think that what she did is despicable and that people need to be investigated and possibly fired if she truly slept around with all of these journalists and influenced their scores. I also think that the censorship needs to stop, however, looking at the comments here, its sort of understandable why posts are getting deleted. We should be above circlejerking about how ugly she is, downvoting people who say otherwise and calling her a whore. Everybody is kind of disappointing me with this.

       I did watch that video and I do not recall any admittances made by anyone, just innuendos from the asshole narrator. Even if she had sex with a gaming journalist it means diddly as far as corruption charges are concerned. Ask yourself why it's all about this girl and not the journalist and his magazine - if there is fault it should lie there. The answer is because everyone wants to believe the worst about people and young neckbeards on the internet who cant get laid feel powerful in attacking a girl. There's no proof of anything.

       Why is it about this girl? Because she is the centre of this whole shit storm. If you follow the right sub reddits, the guys involved have been on the receiving end of disdain as well.

       Watch the freaking video before commenting. One particular idiot, the most important one, the journalist even admitted of having a sexual relationship with her.

       I did watch that video and I do not recall any admittances made by anyone, just innuendos from the asshole narrator. Even if she had sex with a gaming journalist it means diddly as far as corruption charges are concerned. Ask yourself why it's all about this girl and not the journalist and his magazine - if there is fault it should lie there. The answer is because everyone wants to believe the worst about people and young neckbeards on the internet who cant get laid feel powerful in attacking a girl. There's no proof of anything.

       And rock.journalists used to fuck rock stars. And no one cared. Hell they even called Rolling Stone's owner, Jan Werner, a starfucker, but that was probably more a philosophical attitude. Who was fucking who was less significant than what record companies were buying ads and expecting good reviews as part of the deal.

       Well that's bad, though it's still one person's version against another. But these comment threads are almost entirely about her appearance and fucking while not hot.

       that'll be 39.99, unless you want your air filter checked? Oh look, there's a cock in it (your mouth).
