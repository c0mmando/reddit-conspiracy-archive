       Maybe the PTB know unrest is coming, so they're trying to engineer a race/class war so were too busy fighting amongst ourselves to fight the real baddies.

       When you protest something you should have clear, focused and constant goals. The more things you try to protest the more diffused your position becomes and it alienates some of your base which either don't think it's a problem, or don't care too much about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be simplest enough to understand yet grand enough to change things. For ferguson it ought to be very simple more accountability for the police, more transparency about their involvement with the public and justice for the family that originally caused the outrage. Which all tie to the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you starts adding this cause or that cause people stop taking you seriously. People find the easiest one to placate you with and do that, while ignoring the rest. Look at occupy Wall Street, no clear goal and thus no real change. One thing at a time, focus your protest to things that can be done rather than everything that should be done. Once you add to much it become difficult for the protesters (and the public) to understand what they are doing, understand  their voices are saying something when too many opinions and stances have been added. One loud and clear voice is much stronger than many voices talking about many issues, easily it can turn into rabble....rabble, rabble rabble, and nothing gets done, no one understand why you are there anymore, including yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that this isn't an issue that should be addressed, but it's not the issue being protested.
