       I just had an 7.5 year old account deleted a few days ago. I didn't even do anything bad with it. I guess they connected it to the 3 other accounts they banned a few weeks ago. Reddit fucking sucks, fuck the admins.

       Seems like ~30 seconds or so.  They did this when people realized that one downvote will censor post.  Used to say posted ... ms ago.  Now it says posted recently.  It gives insider-mods first shot at censorship.

       This isn't an effective solution because its implementation rests upon a single, flawed assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paraphrasing the assumption:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Reddit is only censored after posts / comments are made available to the public or to some moderation / admin log for some amount of time".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       With the solution being:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Just get the posts before they are deleted"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If I had the resources and motivation of a 3-letter agency, I wouldn't go about it in the ham-handed way of deleting things
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       they had made it to the public-facing part of Reddit. Natural language processing and machine learning techniques enable the filtering / shadow deletion of posts without human supervision such that these posts
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       see the light of day in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those unfamiliar with
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">
        data mining
       </a>
       /
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">

       /
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">
        machine learning
       </a>
       - very roughly, the steps to filtering out content you don't 'want (for a very naive system far more simplistic than what an organization with the resources of the NSA would implement) are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Gather lots of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set">
        training examples
       </a>
       of posts / comments you don't want posted
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Train your
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">
        classifier
       </a>
       with these examples so that it "learns" what a "bad" comment / article / title looks like
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Choose a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_boundary">
        decision boundary
       </a>
       (or the particular classifier that reports the highest confidence of it's own decision-boundary-based choice - depending on the kind of system you are building) that gives the best possible accuracy for the most critical cases you want to focus on, while not getting it wrong for other cases as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)  Issue Reddit a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter">
        national security letter
       </a>
       , send in some goons to Reddit's data centers to install the hardware / software along with a gag order. The engineers that arrive to do the work are disguised as "network engineer consultants" brought in to work on "system-wide infrastructure upgrades", etc. This is essentially the same process that compromised

      <p>
       Anyway - If you combine this with known

        NSA methods
       </a>
       for capturing social network credentials by creating, for example, a "Facebook facade" that makes it appear to the mark that they are actually interacting directly with Facebook - it's possible that this technique could be generalized to convince marks they are interacting with vanilla Reddit (rather than a three-letter agency intermediary facade intercepting and pre/post-processing requests and responses at the Reddit data center).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the unsuspecting user - their posts are being posted, and perhaps they are even upvoted and commented upon by cyberwarfare agents and/or sock puppet accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way of discovering that something is amiss at this point is to
       <strong>
        not sign in
       </strong>
       on a random machine somewhere and look for one of your old posts / comments. If it doesn't appear, you assume it was deleted - but never come to the conclusion that it
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       actually appeared to the rest of Reddit at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This whole scheme is
        <em>
         extremely
        </em>
        unlikely, in my opinion...
       </strong>
       I don't think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       (or Reddit in general, for that matter) is important enough to merit such heroic (and expensive) acrobatics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that it's possible - and that if blatant filtering / censorship of specific topics
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       happening en masse - this method (or some improvement that someone smarter / more experienced than me thought about for more than 5 minutes) would be more effective and less discoverable than
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       system which censors posts and comments after they've been made available publicly (especially if that system relies on a large cabal of secretly recruited admins / moderators keeping their mouth shut).
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case - Reddit is completely compromised. Not necessarily (or even by the most remote measure probably) in the way I've outlined above - but systemically, in a general sense. Blatant, non-secret censorship is already rampant. The moderator selection system is broken. The voting, ranking and display algorithms are gamed easily and often by a myriad of special interest groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is needed is a total Reddit replacement. Not just the kind of new and improved "Digg" that brought most of us old-timers here - but something completely revolutionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to put design, developer and engineering resources into something - I would put them into building an open-source, anonymous, secure, distributed system for social discourse and interaction.

       Hopefully you'll fare better than Ilya Zhitomirskiy, Aaron Swartz, Len Sassaman and Gene Kan.

       or across reddit?

       Did that person post any data on their observations by any chance?

       Wish I had time to build something to run some tests and probe the posting / commenting system...

       yeah that comment. i realise he provides no proof but it would not surprise me. should be easy enough to test, i would suggest over a few days/weeks since they may turn it off (temporarily) after this post. my guess would be across all reddit, they are worried real classified/secret stuff reaching the public, it could be here but it could be anywhere on reddit. network news and radio is on a 3-4s delay for similar reasons, someone gets into the control room and starts broadcasting their "message" or shoots themselves in the head it can be cut before it goes live.
