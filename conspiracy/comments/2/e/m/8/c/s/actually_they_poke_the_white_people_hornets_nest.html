        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know the majority of you are white males. So what I am going to say to you right now will be met with heavy resistance in your heads and hearts. But remember, when you are trained to think one way anything you hear that goes against that is going to be hard for you to shake. </p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that racism in American is 100% a white problem, and this is how the people in power have wanted it. It is white people they have been riling up.</p>

<p>Lets go back to 1915. Birth of a Nation, an entirely fictional story about a alternative history for the Civil War had a black man as one of the villains. A white woman jumped to her death rather than be ravaged by the black man. Specifically because of this film, lynching skyrocketed. White men were motivated and angry because of a fictional account and killed as many blacks as they could. Since at LEAST that day media has been used as a tool of propaganda to prop up the image of the white male and deride the image of &quot;the other&quot; in this case the black male. </p>

<p>I am sure many of you play video games online. All of you have heard (and some taken place in) the rantings of &quot;nigger nigger nigger&quot; during games, many times unprovoked. Or at times done because the black or latino &quot;talked shit&quot; and the only thing the white male could do is come back with a racial attack. You will very MINIMALLY hear black people start off with these attacks on white males provoked or otherwise. We all know that racism is mainly a white male attack.</p>

<p>On reddit I can&#39;t find any real subreddits where blacks attack whites in any real way jokes or otherwise. But the mean jokes subreddit is essentially an excuse for white males to be racists and sexist. </p>

<p>4chan is racist as fuck. The list goes on. These times of havens simply don&#39;t exist for blacks, and even if you could find ONE it would be the exception not the rule. </p>

<p>Look around you. Look at what some of you reading this do. You know I am not making any of this shit up. White males get agitated and go for that racial shit more than anyone else. Full on vitriol, foaming at the mouth type of angry racism. </p>

<p>Hell, the SOUTH in America is such a haven for racist thoughts that as a group, poor white southerns continue to vote against their own economic interests as poor people simply because of their allegiance to the idea that their race makes them better so scare tactics from politicians have fucked with their heads since the slavery days. </p>

<p>When will white males realize THEY are the ones being poked and prodded more than anyone else? For so long you have been told you are Zack Morris, John McClane, Superman....and you are slowly realizing its all a bunch of shit. You are just like everyone else. And it makes you mad as hell. </p>

<p>Realize that blacks, latinos, asians, women, none of us hate you. We hate being fucked with. Its all about action reaction. Recognize that your enemy, OUR collective enemy mostly is going to be white, male, hetero and rich as fuck, and they don&#39;t care about your poor asses or our poor asses. </p>

<p>MLK and Malcolm X were alive when they were agitating whites. But the second they realized we are all in this together, the second they realized that globally the war was one of class, they were silenced. </p>

<p>Know that Al Sharpton and Bill OReilly are two sides to the same coin. </p>

<p>And above all, realize that racism is a majority white male problem. And fix the fucking problem by hearing me. Make this shit your concern. Don&#39;t fucking stand for it, even from your own family members. Break the fucking chain already. END IT. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to sum up your post, white males have essentially allowed themselves to be built up so that they can be used as agitators in a situation that really only exists in our minds? In short, white people have to stop racism amongst white people and no amount of protesting or standing up will stop the mind set of white males, unless we take a stand for ourselves, against our fellow white males.  </p>

<p>Makes sense actually.  You can see it in how they portray poor black communities.  When someone talks about (fake) welfare queens its always underhandedly referring to a black woman with lots of kids.  When they talk about minority families needing a dad its always an underhanded way of saying the black father doesn&#39;t exist.  And honestly, can anyone name a REAL racist insult towards white people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Its full on propaganda, and its been around for a very, very long time.  Rich people pushing the poor people around. A really good example of how this worked was when blacks and whites would work together on a farm or chicken factory. They were all poor workers. They banded together and had meetings. Started demanding more pay. Rich white owners tried to break the meetings up, threatened all kinds of shit that just made the poor blacks and whites band together more. The rich whites then used a tactic that has worked for years. They went to the whites and said &quot;its the blacks fault you are not paid as well. I&#39;ll make you, a good white man into a manager and pay you a little more, because white men should get more, and you can control those darkies&quot;. Enough whites fell for that shit and the racial divide then happens. The connection the poor blacks and whites had together is lost. The rich white guy smiles, keeps the majority of his profits and fucks model bitches and shit. </p>

<p>This keeps happening over and over again. When will the poor white guys get a clue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not.  Consider that we still sell the same trope about the &quot;American Dream&quot;, still telling people to pull themselves up by their boot straps, while the upward mobility index is at a negative.  Literally now, if you want to move up, and work hard to move up, you are more likely to make more to do the same job, than to actually move up. </p>

<p>the american dream is dead, and people are looking for someone to blame.  Its easier than ever to spark racial hatred.  &quot;look at that black family on food stamps getting a steak&quot; since being on food stamps require you eat the worst possible shit you can find? We (the lower tier) can&#39;t stop eating ourselves and blaming each other for our condition.  Race is no different.  To those susceptible to it, easy eating when they toss out the race bait. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really I thought it would probably be from the hang over from slavery that was always not so much an offer to white men as a push at gun point to the black man. Add to that the complicated issue of some white men owning and others running like the English in Jamaica and then the Scots (hence many Scottish names out there) as managers - shipped in from Scotland rather than toiling the fields themselves.</p>

<p>After that you had indentured servitude which again was not used to divide and conquer but to ship in cheep labour much as slavery happened.</p>

<p>You could also ask why did the white (well mixed really) royal navy stopped slaving ships that was a command from the white government of Great Britain.</p>

<p>So the nice little narrative you have is an overly simplistic piece of clap trap that glosses over historical fact and reduces everything to nothing more than a fairy story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could say the exact same thing about what you wrote. You didnt address anything I said, you just rambled about other shit. You missed the point and ranted to be heard because you have no clue what I am saying. Its cool tho.

<p>You dont have to like the narrative for it to be true, man. The truth is rich whites divide poor white and poor blacks by making poor whites think that their race makes them better and that one day they too can be rich whites. They take a few token whites along for the rid while the others keep up the racist antics as they wish for the day that they too will get their golden ticket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course people who aren&#39;t white face additional challenges in America, but all the indicators are moving in the right direction and have been for the last 50 years. It takes time to change the way you think, moreso for entire societies, and the reconciliation between blacks and white in America in the 20th century is one of history&#39;s most amazing success stories. Even still though, there&#39;s more progress to be made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you make a great point by saying its not just a &quot;black&quot; problem. But, i feel you overemphasize that this is mostly a &quot;white&quot; problem. In truth, i believe, it is neither.</p>

<p>It is a political problem. It is a People problem. With all this political correctness bullshit, we have the choice to either become blatant with emotional vitriol, or we cower behind silence. But it certainly isnt a white/black issue.</p>

<p>It is political in nature. A ploy. Divide and conquer, and not much else other than that. There is no &quot;black&quot; hornets nest, no &quot;white&quot; hornets nest, no. None of that. There is but one nest. The <strong>People&#39;s</strong> hornet nest. This is what is being provoked. But the underlying problem is ignorance. The folks rising up against the racial divide are deluded (i dont mean disrespect, here.)</p>

<p>They are deluded because they erroneously think it is whites vs blacks. But its not.</p>

<p>Like you hinted at, but largely failed to expound, is the fact thst this is class warfare. I have lived under the poverty line for most of my life. I am white. I have many white friends, amd many black friends. Besides the cultural differences and colloquial jargon, there is no conceivable difference between my friends who are white and my friends who are black. They all get equally pissed off about each &quot;racial problem&quot; that gets plastered all over the news. </p>

<p>But the ones who relay this black vs white bullshit, they are ignorsnt. They are ignorant of the fact that racism is largely dead, and that what provokes actions in the name of racism is actualky emotional fervor based in falsified accounts. </p>

<p>Now, thats not to say racism is <em>completely</em> dead. White power enthusiasts exist, so do the black panthers. So does ISIS. So does the KKK (still). These radicsl groups exist because they fullheartedly and fsithfully believe their race is in danger. They believe the racial divide thst is engineered so much, that they delusionally believe that their existence is at stake, amd fall prey to the defense mechanisms inherent in all of us for the sake of self-preservation. </p>

<p>They believe this because they are ignorant to the fsct thst they are being lied to. All of them. </p>

<p>So, to summarize: i do not believe mkdern racism is organic. It is lesrned, taught, fscilitated by misconstruing of statistics and falsified data. It is perpetusted by sensationalism aimed at guarding the preservstion of each of their respective races. But, whilst playing the game set up by TPTB, they are blind to the sleight of hand thst will effectively make us all equal, on all accounts, by enslaving us all together. </p>

<p>By focusing on the hatred and putrid vitriol, we are unorganized as a people, not unified as a people, and we all will be brought to our knees together. We may have different skin colors, but shackles look the same, no matter whose wrists they are placed on.</p>

<p>So, i say, enough of this black on white, white on black, whatever, bullshit. We need to start seeing this as americans on americans, regardless of context. We are one People. And we need to start acting like it, lest we allow TPTB to be successful in dividing us by superficial attributes that mean nothing and does nothing other than to distrsct us from unity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your post, but I honestly feel like you are not hearing me. Racism is not some 50% blacks do this 50% whites do that shit. Mentioning white power enthusiasts with black panthers is INSANITY. 1. Black Panthers were something of the 70s, not 2014 (that new black panther shit is in name only) 2. black panthers were never about hating white people 3. black panthers were a REACTION to hate, which was self empowerment and gun ownership. In fact, we lost many of our gun rights specifically because white america was scared of black america arming themselves. PLEASE know your history. </p>

<p>There is no equal racism here. Its purely a white male issue. Everyone else is just reacting to the racism. Like, I just outlined (briefly) how this has worked in American history. Its a white male thing. Blacks, latinos, asians, native americans have not had that power to do this. Its rich white males selling racist ideas to poor white males who lap it all up for hopes that one day they too will be rich. That is all it is. Once poor white males understand they are pawns, everything changes. Its up to poor white males to stop being fucking stupid. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for the respect, and i will recipricate that, as well. But, i heard you. I may be ignorant of the history of the black panthers but the mentioning of them wasnt the main point i was making. </p>

<p>So, i wamt to direct your attention to the quoted lines above. This, i believe, serves as a rudimentary summary of your views on this subject. (And though i will not say you are completely wrong, i will admit that i disagree with you, here.)</p>

<p>Once <strong><em>we all figure out that we are pawns</em></strong>, everything changes. As in everything. It is <strong><em>UP TO ALL OF US TO STOP BEING SO FUCKING STUPID.</em></strong> (FTFY)</p>

<p>Blacks are not victims. Whites are not victims. Latinos, jews, whoever, are not victims. </p>

<p><em>The People, as a whole, are victims.</em></p>

<p>In my opinion, and i say this with respect, your views are just as much the problem as those who wish to perpetuate racial discord. Only until we become color blind on this topic can we truely see the discriminatory practices that cause such strife. </p>

<p>History is one thing, and the past is where your views are most valid. Today, things are different. You are right by pointing out the rich vs the poor, but you fail to monochromaticize this issue. This is purely a class warfare issue. The rich, who make the laws, judge the laws, and enforce the laws (quite selectively), do so in such a way that pits the poor amongst themselves. They feast while we fight over their crumbs. </p>

<p>You see, poverty strikes indiscriminatorily. Lies are selective. And the racial divide we see today strikes accurately and effectively. It is perpetuated and facilitated by those who succumb to gullibility. And it is engineered by those with the most wealth and power. It is a game of numbers. </p>

<p>How does a small group control a much larger group? Not by might. Not by pure brawn. But by psychological means aimed at keeping the larger group from unifying as one force. Hence, the psychological warfare games being played and masqueraded as a racial issue, when it is covertly a class warfare issue.</p>

<p>The longer we acknowledge the erroneous belief thst the color of our skin matters, the deeper they entrench themselves into our psyche, and the harder we all fall as one People.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The past was once the present which, without change becomes the future. We ARE our history. This is the very foundation that America was built upon, it does not simply change. Its indoctrination. My viewpoint is extremely valid today, as I used historical examples AND present day examples. Look to the south as the #1 example. Do you realize that poor white southerners are the only group to vote against their own economic interest? They have always done it historically and they still do it today. They do it primarily because they believe their race makes them better and the rich whites sell them on bullshit while continuing to keep them poor and uneducated. If poor white southerners banded together with poor blacks and poor latinos America would change overnight. Instead we are kept from really growing because one segment is just stuck on stupid. Still in 2014. I also gave you internet examples. Xbox Live, reddit, 4chan you name it. This is all real stuff. Its primarily based in white males showering racist bullshit on others with impunity. I know it is hard to be told that &quot;hey buddy, you are the problem here&quot; ESPECIALLY as a white male in America, but its the truth. The mindstate that they sold you on is pure bullshit, and its up to white guys to stop believing the hype about themselves.  </p>

<p>White males sip the kool aid that their they are all important and can do anything and when they fail and are still poor, they become bitter and blame the blacks, the jews, the women, the latinos, the gays. Everyone else becomes reason they did not achieve. They never think about their inflated sense of self worth that was provided to them by propaganda insinuating that white males all essentially have the powers of superman. Blame your affliction.</p>

<p>Only when THAT is done can white males come together at the table with everyone else as equals. Because right now, racism is very much in existence. Its not just class in real life, because many of these whites in power push the racist sexist bullshit. Judges, juries,lawyers, cops the entire system is supported by it. The only way that falls away is if white guys realize it has obviously not helped them. You are still poor as fuck and its not a black guy&#39;s fault. Its a crooked system. But first understand your place in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you certainly have identified the symptoms quite accurately. But where you fail is by labelling the symptoms as the problem. The problem is <strong>we all</strong> are being fed this bullshit. It does not matter who you are, as long as you arent one of the &quot;wealthies.&quot;</p>

<p>To constructively fix this problem, we must seperately identify the problem, amd then the consequential symptoms. As i said, you pointed out many of the symptoms quite clearly. But the symptoms are not the problem. It is caused by the problem.</p>

<p>By saying that this is a poor white male problem, you are further perpetuating the delusion of racial discord. By continuing this postition, you are helping to facilitate racial divide. I do not believe this is your intention, btw. Many people, who rightfully feel victimized, will oftem try and put the blame on their neighbor. On anyone else besides themselves. Whites certainly do this. So do blacks. So do latinos and asians and every culture around the world. </p>

<p>Racism is fabricated. It is engineered. And it is disseminated selectively to feed the reward systems of those who feel the most pain --- the impoverished.</p>

<p>Our society has moved apart from the slavery era. That mentality is mostly long gone. The remnants thereof, or what you perceive as the remnants, is synthesized for the sole purpose to cause division amongst our people. Amongst <strong><em>ALL</em></strong> peoples. </p>

<p>You are condoning racial divide by acknowledging what TPTB wish you to acknowledge --- that the problem is with someone else besides you. But the truth is, the problem is with all of us. </p>

<p>You see, there are some clear points we both agree on. But it is our interpretation thereof that causes the difference in opinion between us. This is precisely what TPTB are aiming for. Division, at all costs.</p>

<p>And, ive noticed you said this a second time, of which i ignored it the first time. But by reiterating it, i feel you believe it is essential to your argument. So, i ask, concerning this quoted line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you realize that poor white southerners are the only group to vote against their own economic interest? They have always done it historically and they still do it today. They do it primarily because they believe their race makes them better and the rich whites sell them on bullshit while continuing to keep them poor and uneducated. </p>

<p>First, i ask, where do you get this from? Id like to see the source so i can analyze it and come to my own conclusion, if you dont mind. Second, i can make the argument that ALL of us vote against our own economic interest. Third, i wish to argue against your claim that they do it primarily because they are arrogant in regards to their race over others. </p>

<p>Also, are you aware that over half of the black population lives in the south? This fact seems to discredit your assertion that the results of the votes in the south are due to the poor white males, when <a href="http://www.censusscope.org/us/map_nhblack.html">the majority of the black population lives in the south</a>.</p>

<p>But nonetheless, my main point in responding to your submission is to make the notion that racism is largely fabricated and is selectively disseminated to incite division amongst the people to stifle any attempts of unity against TPTB. The folks who buy into this scam, regardless of whichever side or color they choose to represent and support, they are all deluded by thinking this is organic in nature, and that any of the individual races are at fault. </p>

<p>Again, it is purely class warfare. The longer we stray from this fact, the harder it is to rid our country of the ills of synthetic racial divide. And the longer we say &quot;They are at fault&quot;, indicating whichever race, the longer we all stand shackled to the same wall. </p>

<p>This truely is a crooked system. And it behooves us all to understand our place within it, and to understand that by willfully allowing us to be divided by trivial attributes, we are also part of the problem. </p>

<p>This wont be fixed when &quot;all the poor white males come together at the table with everyone else as equals.&quot; That wont do shit, because it ignores the delusions within the other groups. </p>

<p>The only way this shit will be fixed is when we all, <strong><em>We, The People</em></strong>, each and every individual, stand up and say, &quot;Fuck this bullshit. Fuck tyrannical assholes who are purposely pitting us against our brothers and sisters.&quot; </p>

<p>We all must drop our guards against one another. It wont work if just one group (the &quot;poor white males&quot; you have been blaming repeatedly) does it. We all need to do it because we all are equally victimized by it. </p>

<p>Browse the sub. You won&#39;t find that racist, sexist, homophobic shit there. I press you to find a sub that is as bad as whiterights that is done by blacks or women or latinos etc. </p>

<p>White males are the problem bro. its a learned behavior, media has a lot to do with it the way our history is taught has a lot to do with it, but no matter how we talk about it it is still a very white male problem.  I don&#39;t know what else to tell you. Its right before our eyes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, im not trying to discredit your intentions. R/whitepower, r/stormfront, and dozens more subreddits spewing hatred and white supremacy all make me sick. I wont deny that they exist. </p>

<p>But what i am trying to portray to you is that the blacks and the other races are playing the victim card wrongfully. Now, dont get me wrong. They are victims. But not because of the whites. They are victimized by those with power who incite this divide. By saying that these minority groups are victims of the majority group, you are just playing the game that was set up for you. </p>

<p>The whites full of hatred and vitriol, they are victims, too. But they are victims because their logical facilities has been usurped. They believe in their supremacy because that is what they were tricked into believing. It is sad. I pity them. But i also denounce their beliefs fullheartedly. It is wrong to believe that way. We are all victims. </p>

<p>TPTB are very good at selectively inciting fear amongst all of us. This fear is hidden within the hatred and vitriol spewing from foaming mouths who waived their right to think for themselves. They have become thoughtless drones controlled by the elites for this very purpose --- to cause the illusion that all other races are victims of this group. </p>

<p>I am merely making the argument that it is those playing behind the scenes that are responsible for this racial divide. (Those who perpetuate the racial discourse also have a stake in the blame, too, no matter how ignorant of this fact they may be.)</p>

<p>The bottom line is this is a very effective scheme --- divide and conquer. Pure and simple. Once we all realize this, we can stop putting blame on our countrymen amd recognize the fact thst our system of governance has been usurped by evil men and women who constantly avoid accountability in all this strife because of their very simple yet effective ploy of engineered racial divisions. </p>

<p>While we are here arguing who is at fault, who is to blame, or who is responsible, TPTB are still working behind the scenes to disarm all of us, to de-liberate all of us, to oppress all of us, to herd all of us below the poverty line, to steal all of our assets, and to de-educate all of us. We are all peasants in this caste system. They are systematicslly and indiscriminatorily stealing our livlihoods. <strong><em>All of us</em></strong> are victims. We have to look past the pawns to identify the masterminds. </p>

<p>But yet, we all, for whatever reason, choose to argue who is to blame, which race is worst, all while forgetting who really is to blame, because we are too distracted pointing fingers at our own. </p>

<p>They distract us with racial divisions, we fight over the engineered conflict, taking our focus away from the real solution, all the while they sit fat and happy and content knowing that we will never agree on this issue, and will never hold them responsible or accountable for their evil agenda, due to the fact that we are merely taking the easy way. </p>

<p>Its like dogfighting, actually. The dogs are not bad. They are inherently good creatures. They are mistreated, beaten, oppressed, denied their rights, and are pitted against one another for their hsndlers entertainment who are all very much happy that they can take such joy in establishing their dominion over such beautiful creatures.</p>

<p>Here, we are the dogs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me preface by saying republican and democrat are not real choices,both are full of shit. But for sake of argument regarding the world we live in lets briefly discuss their differences. Democrats champion as being of the people, for human rights, women rights to choice etc etc. Republicans use racial fear, against womens rights to choice, tone deaf and the party of rich white corporate ceos etc. poor blacks, poor latinos, are majority democrats. poor southern whites are primarily republicans. the bible thumping, gun rack owning uneducated who watch fox news and supported sarah palin. The ones who always vote republican and against their own economic interests. they believe the lies their leaders tell them and off go the jobs overseas anyway. </p>

<p>its a white male problem because of how the power system is set up. If white males stop buying into the hype, everything fixes itself. the pressure they apply thru racism is lifted. not just on a PERSONAL level, but in a systemic way as well. Without personal support the people actually doing the jobs as police officers, judges, lawyers, policy makers, police officers, real estate agents, teachers, history book writers dont buy into it, their children dont buy into it. Policies that allow funds to be diverted or not even put into poor black neighborhoods then no longer exist. Schools get the funding they need. Teachers get paid. Books are up to date. White directors arent putting fat black sassy women in their movies, tv shows, commercials because &quot;its just funnier that way&quot;. If white males &quot;get it&#39; SO MUCH changes. Really allow yourself to see the extent of the damage that is done by the belief system that has been set up for you by rich white males. Blacks, latinos, women, they don&#39;t run this sytem, they don&#39;t thrive in it like white males do and can.  We the people can&#39;t do SHIT. We the people have been TRYING. But white males keep eating that shit up. Im telling you, its time for white males to get off their collective high horses and face the problem head on like everyone else has been battling for years. Women, blacks, gays, latinos etc have been fighting this for a loooooooooooooong time. Its poor white guys who refuse to even acknowledge their place in the battle. That in itself makes it a white male problem. White guys, get your shit together and join the battle that we have already been fighting. </p>

<p>I find it odd that, on one hand, you posit that its a poor white male problem, while on the other hand, it is only the white males who thrive in this system. I have problems with this because i know many wealthy black folks. Doctors, lawyers, hell, one is even president. In light of this, i want to illustrate why i believe you have fallen to the poor statistics backed arguments that serve as a foundation to your claim.</p>

<p>In america, about three fourths of all people are white (about 63% when you negate the hispanics who also label themselves as white). But lets go with the three fourths number. Now, considering thst the vast majority of people in america are white, it makes perfect logical sense that whites make up the majority of wealthy folks, too. </p>

<p>But the problem arises when you ignore this fact of statistics and probabilities, and erroneously claim that it is the white mans fault that racism exists because most wealthy people are white. </p>

<p>You then further this wrongful idea that it is up to the poor white males to understand their place. Yet, in other comments you have correctly indicated why this racial divide exists. I have no doubts that you understand the uprising of racial divide. But it is your conclusion thereafter that i find fault in. </p>

<p>It is the wealthy elites, of which comprises of all the races, but relative to the population as a whole, that is the cause of this. They pit the poor versus the poor, and label and classify each individual by a mark (their skin color) to create &quot;teams&quot; in the arena of political divide, primarily using race as a &quot;team&quot; identifier. </p>

<p>By doing this, they spread the idea that whites are different than blacks, regardless of their social status or affluence, and vice versa. The same goes with all the other races. Their scheme here is to have everyone believe that we are different from those who have more or less melatonin in their skin. Any inequality (wealth, status, poverty, etc.) is blamed upon the scapegoat of the amount of melatonin within the individual with the inequalities, when it is in fact the result of the wealthy elites&#39; politics and firm grips on the legislature and judicial systems.</p>

<p>We cannot continue putting blame on one race or another, lest we continue to play their game under their rules, inevitably losing time and time again, ad infinitum.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The first part of this upset me at first, as it seemed to imply that the poor white males arent of The People. But i know (i hope) this isnt what you meant. But regardless, you definstely seem to wish to blame the racial discord on the white males. It is prevalent in your arguments, and you remain closed to the idea that this whole subject is perverted and orchestrated by those in charge (whites, blacks, jews, women, whoever alike) to cause such a social disturbance that charges you with this emotional concept of baseless arguments. </p>

<p>Again, by continuing the placement of blame and the onus of change upon the white males, you are perpetually preserving their divide and conquer scheme. </p>

<p>In summation, your argument implies that only the white males need to buck up and join the battle. My argument implies that we all need to nut up, drop the racial descriptions, think a little more, hold hands or whatever, and join a new fight. We can end this fight over racial discord by dropping the acknowledgement of it entirely, as it is not a necessity in regards to the bigger picture. </p>

<p>We can end this by unifying as one people, as Americans, and organize a push against social imperialism, political tyranny, and oppression in general. Race need not be a card in the hand that wins the pot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the crux of this issue, and to expand on what the OP is saying, is that racism is one of the original psychological operations created. Its purpose is simple, exacerbate the differences in people, form castes and reward systems for being a part of one group over another. Exploit mentally troubled or vulnerable peoples fears, insecurities, low self-esteem and self-hatred and indoctrinate them to other people being the cause of their miseries. Then have crypto-governmental sponsorship of racist front-groups (i.e. the KKK) for recruitment and use as terrorism as covert policy. There&#39;s a fantastic article here: <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_21614_5-things-i-learned-as-neo-nazi.html">http://www.cracked.com/article_21614_5-things-i-learned-as-neo-nazi.html</a> that provides some great introspection on just how people get caught up in this race horseshit. </p>

<p>I keep saying this over and over, but this racial PSYOPs is nothing more than a strategic ruse to get us fighting amongst ourselves by the self-dubbed &quot;elite&quot;. While we are rucking about with one another they are fucking laughing at us hard and are incredulous at just how stupid we are to fall for such a scam. The moment they know we&#39;ve woken up and evolved past this shite, is the moment that it all gets very real quickly. Until we get past this mindfuckery of bigotry based on race, religion, etc, etc. we&#39;re just spinning wheels in the muck and getting nowhere fast. </p>

<p>The grand majority of racial jackasses you see braying inflammatory rubbish on forums, blogs, Reddit, etc. are nothing more than shills, operatives, agent provocateurs and other assorted fools serving the agenda of our collective enemies. Bottom line is that we&#39;re going to have to all unite against our common enemy for the advancement of the collective good pursuing a common interest.</p>

<p>For a few examples: Do we want to stop militarised cops tyrannically murdering and kicking anyone&#39;s ass regardless of their race? The sane answer is YES, and I believe we can all agree on that right?</p>

<p>Can we also all agree that we are ALL getting looted by organised government sponsored corporate interests and the central banking houses? </p>

<p>Seriously, lets get our shit together, for time is running out. When we unite, we win and that is what they&#39;re most terrified of and why they keep running these PSYOPs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are completely wrong about your understanding of history. Blacks have been favored in Western history written from around 1940 up to the present. They have been presented more favorably than should be the case, if they were presented honestly. The views of blacks held by whites in the 1920s weren&#39;t evil and racist -- they were largely accurate. It is we who have debased and distorted history, not earlier generations. True black history is a history of ignorance, violence, tribal hatred, torture, slavery inflicted by blacks on other blacks, and even cannibalism. The modern West has whitwashed black history, making it much rosier and more positive than it has any right to be.</p>

<p>As for whites writing their own history, that was true up until the beginning of the 20th century or so, when Jews took over and grossly distorted white history to suit their own socio-political agenda. You don&#39;t believe me, fine. Others will do the research and discover that I write the truth here. Our history has been written by Jews for a long time now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Caucasians have done plenty cannibalism, tribal hatred, ignorance, violence, torture, and inflicted slavery, too. Blacks circumnavigated the seas and populated Europe tens of thousands of years ago, before the Romans. You&#39;ve heard of the Moors, I&#39;m sure. The Egyptians. Ever wonder why Israeli Jews are so possessive over and secretive about their archaeological finds? </p>

<p>And you are aware that Caucasians are African with Neanderthal, Denisovan, and some as-of-yet-unknown-homo-something DNA, right? That geneticists are pretty sure that&#39;s where we get our red/blonde hair and light eyes and skin? The Neanderthal. That if you&#39;re <em>really</em> into &quot;racial purity,&quot; Caucasians aren&#39;t really it? We&#39;re mutts. True Homo Sapiens can only still be found in Africa and I believe one island I&#39;ve forgotten the name of.</p>

<p>If you weren&#39;t previously aware of this, take a few minutes to dig into recent genetics discoveries - it will rock your world and it sounds like you could use the awakening. Stop falling for divisive bullshit, stop being a slave to race-baiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>old thread , excuse the late reply.</p>

<p>Would you not concede that the white population having the neandeandertal genetics could be an argument that some could use to suggest whites are different.   Africans being the originals does not imply superiority does it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, because we were taught that Neanderthals were so primitive, but now that the cat&#39;s out of the bag about genetics, you&#39;re seeing a lot of these &quot;Hey, the Neanderthals were smart after all!&quot; articles everywhere. The Washington Post published one just last week, hilariously enough.</p>

<p>I never mentioned the word &quot;superiority&quot;--I was talking about the farce of &quot;racial purity&quot; being pushed by certain people of the lightish persuasion. </p>

<p>I guess you could say that maybe my point was that supremacists pushing &quot;racial purity&quot; = &quot;superiority&quot; is pretty ironically hilarious. Because it is! But see paragraph 1 and your own comment for proof that they&#39;ve recognized this irony themselves and are backtracking.</p>

<p>I want no part of any &quot;superiority&quot; argument, I think it&#39;s straight ignorance. The more we divide ourselves over race, the more easily we are conquered and steered around as slaves by the elite. I see people fall for it every single day and it makes me sad as hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, as much as I knew this post was coming, I still dread reading it. This guy is stuck in the matrix and believes his race actually is superior to others, yet its obvious he is poor. If you are so great 4to4, why is your life so bad? This is why you blame the blacks, the latinos, the women, the jews, the media. You blame everyone except for the people pulling your strings. </p>

<p>And thats about all of the reply you will get out of me. I know people like YOU won&#39;t ever change. But there are others that are not as far gone as you are. Hopefully they will see the error of their thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all equal in the eyes of God. We all have equal worth as human beings. That does not mean we are all the same, or that we all have the same abilities or the same virtues. Some of us are indeed better than others, by any objective measure. The races are not equal. They differ in various ways genetically. For example, whites are significantly more intelligent than blacks. This is a fact. I don&#39;t have to beat a drum over it, because the research has been done and it is in the journals and the books and it is undeniable. If we were to judge human worth only by intelligence, then we would say that whites are indeed better than blacks. But there are many measures of human worth, and intelligence is only one of them. You imply that I&#39;m racist. For many years I thought the same as you do now, <em>because I didn&#39;t know any better</em>. I learned that I was wrong. Whether you ever come to understand that you are in error remains to be seen.</p>
