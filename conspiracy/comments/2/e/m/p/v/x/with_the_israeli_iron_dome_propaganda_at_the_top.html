       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM0J0LI1ymA">
        This video by the Paulstal Service
       </a>
       makes an extraordinarily compelling argument for this theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the video's description:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are told that Hamas missiles are being intercepted by the almost god-like Iron dome system, which intercepts allegedly 90% of the missiles launched toward Israel...Why lie about that?
       </p>
       <p>
        What proof is there that Iron Dome actually is hitting missiles in the first place? Well, there actually isn't any, the few Hamas missiles actually ever launched (Hamas is a group created by and controlled by the state of Israel) do not in fact even have warheads, and are basically hollow pipes and fireworks as has been proven time and time again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, it turns out the "Iron Dome" interceptor missiles are a similar scam. They aren't intercepting anything, but instead are exploding in thin air, making people feel they are intercepting alleged Hamas rockets, when in reality they're essentially billions of dollars worth of American taxpayer money self-detonating in the air.
       </p>
       <p>
        A group of Israeli skeptics asked the Israeli government to see the thermal imaging proof that the rockets were in fact intercepting other rockets, and they were denied.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no reason to withhold said proof, which is further evidence that there are no "Hamas rockets" being intercepted by Iron Dome, and Iron Dome is just a fireworks system.
       </p>
       <p>
        But why? Why would Israel do this? Well, the answer is obvious:
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason for the fake Hamas "missile attacks" and the phony Iron dome system is to keep the Israeli population in fear and thinking there is a legitimate attack on their lives (sound familiar?).
       </p>
       <p>
        It's to make them hate the Palestinians, and allow the actual ground invasion to take place, which will kill hundreds of thousands eventually, as well as to put in place the "no go zone" which essentially eliminates half of Gaza to residential habitation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also to guarantee billions of dollars of US funding "protecting Israel", and to make the American people feel Israel is in fact under attack, and to make the American people the money we are sending them (the Israelis) to protect themselves from the non-existent Hamas rocket threat is being well spent.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And finally, check out this incredible article:
       <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/12772-israeli-expert-says-iron-dome-defence-is-a-hoax">
        Israeli expert says Iron Dome defence is a hoax
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        An Israeli scientist and award-winning security expert has called the Iron Dome missile defence system "the biggest hoax the world has seen".
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Dr. Moti Shefer, "Today, there is no missile which can intercept other missiles or rocket-propelled grenades, and the Iron Dome is a light audio system which blocks Israeli public opinion and, of course, itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, all the explosions that we have seen in the atmosphere are self-destruction. The Iron Dome did not launch any rocket that could intercept at least one missile fired from Gaza."
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       From the video description:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While U.S. news anchors, pundits and politicians have repeatedly extolled the efficacy of the Iron Dome in deflecting rocket attacks, the acclaimed physicist Theodore Postol says there is no evidence Iron Dome is actually working.
       </p>
       <p>
        He estimates the Iron Dome, which is partially built by Raytheon, intercepts just 5 percent of rockets fired at Israel. A professor of science, technology and national security policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Postol is an expert in missiles, missile defenses, and other aspects of modern warfare.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Raytheon...you don't say...

        In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, 'just to keep people frightened'.

       This reminds me of the Patriot missile system debuted in Desert Storm to great acclaim. Some time later it was revealed that they actually barley worked at all.

       I phrased this title cautiously by using the word "may"...
      </p>
      <p>
       It just boggles my mind that the evidence
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       seem to support this theory, and that Israelis
       <em>
        themselves
       </em>
       are beginning to question the Iron Dome.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a simple matter to provide the thermal imaging to shut down this type of speculation, but by refusing they're only fueling it...

       If they had actually intercepted rockets, they would be raining all over that neighborhood.  Missile interception systems pretty much just shoot shrapnel into the incoming object and render it useless, then they fall from the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever seen piles of missiles and missile accessories from these intercepts?  Nope,
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       .  Just pictures of individual, homemade, large bottle rockets that land in parking lots and do 0 damage (save for the scuff mark they leave in the poor asphalt :'( )
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: For the record I'm sure there have been actual rocket attacks that actually killed people in Israel.  Who fired them, and where the missiles originated from, I haven't the foggiest.  No one can show me really solid proof either way.  Point being they are few and far between, and more often than not, the equivalent of bottle rockets.

       A couple questions I had myself:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) where is Hamas getting the material for all of these supposed thousands of rockets?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) It looks as if the "iron dome" rockets are traveling pretty fucking high. How is it that home made bottle rockets with no way of remote steering can go that high?

       Also is there a reason why the hamas rockets do not leave a trail? Are they just lobbed up and have no propellant?  With no warhead and no propellant it doesn't sound like much of a rocket. Sounds like a cannon ball to me.

       Actually, I think they are
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1Um3xJWGso">
        launched
       </a>
       very quickly with lots of propellant that burns very quickly, so they are just riding on the initial launch for the majority of the journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Iron Dome leaves a trail because it is a missile and it is better for the guided missile to have propulsion the majority of the time.

       This is one of the few upshots of the latest Israeli action in Gaza: Marketing the Iron Dome worlwide.  Rich Gulf Arabs will line up to buy a VERY expensive system that doesn't work but was tested during a war on poor Arabs.

       main problem is : I have yet to see news about one single country placing an order for Iron Dome (not Arab countries only , one single country at all)
      </p>
      <p>
       For a system developed 10 years ago (or so) , battle tested thousands of times , and with supposed 95% accuracy - very strange - if everything is as advertised it would be sold all over the world by now - to friendly governments if nothing more
      </p>
      <p>
       If I am wrong please (anyone) provide a source for news that some government (any) placed order (or bought) for Iron Dome system

       This is an incredibly good point.  It's likely that the governments of the world are well aware that it's a fraud.  They don't seem to have any problems importing

       Oh, I'm sure they'd love to touch it if they could.  But that would require some actual proof which is where they'd run into some problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's strange, I'd never given this "theory" much credence but now as I've looked into it more and more today it almost seems obvious.  I mean, we already knew that Hamas was an Israeli creation, we
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       see actual damage from the "rockets" in Tel Aviv or elsewhere, and (as the other guy pointed out) no other country has bothered to order an "Iron Dome" of their own, despite its supposedly incredible technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it makes perfect sense as to why they'd use it - much easier to indoctrinate a populace who believes it's under constant attack from some vague enemy and believes the only reason it's able to survive is with the aid and defense of its government.

       You are right...but they are currently winning the war of perceptions.  They sold false airport security to the US after 9/11.  Millions of tax dollars were spent on Israeli security theater by the US.

       oh perception is only for people in USA - to justify sending money to Israel because it supposedly is working good (Iron Dome)

       posted here awhile back that clearly presents the evidence for the system's inefficiency.  For the first few minutes he talks about how the current warning systems and bomb shelters alone are a very effective defense against incoming rockets.  Around the 6 minute mark he explains what they observe and why the interceptors don't hit.

      <blockquote>

        "We occasionally,
        <em>

        occasionally, see an iron dome interceptor rising in a near vertical trajectory.  That is the only engagement geometry where the iron dome has a non-zero chance of destroying the rocket..."

       This is interesting, but one thing to note in the 2nd quote, down the bottom, is that even if Iron Dome does work, intercepting 5% of fired missiles might be intentional. They would predict where the rocket will land and, if it's going to land in a field or somewhere else where there's no habitation, avoid wasting a missile.

       That video is hasbara at its finest. The only way they could have done it better is by having it posted it by someone who doesn't have an account full of pro-Israel talking points. Had they posted it from an account that stayed away from the entire Israel-Palestine conflict it would have made it appear as though, this Redditor was objectively impressed by the Iron Dome's technological capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe these hasbara agents are doing so well on r/worldnews and r/news that they've begun bleeding into other major subreddits.

       I don't doubt that the big firecrackers are being fired by somebody, maybe even the Palestinians, but I doubt that the Iron Dome system is intercepting more than a small fraction of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's suppose it is intercepting all of them, for the sake of argument. This isn't the case, but let's say it is. What is the result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hollow tubes with no warheads are being blown up in the air, high up in the air. Then what happens? The pieces of metal from the tubes rain down on israel over a wide area. How is this less destructive than a single hollow tube falling in a street or even on a roof? Instead of one projectile falling down, you get dozens, probably hundreds of projectiles.

       As an engineer myself, from a pure math/physics stand point it seems it would be rather trivial to program a system to intercept rockets. I'm not saying they are real, but why wouldn't a aerospace company create such a defense? I don't see any major technical/engineering limitation. The biggest threat would be debris still falling out of the sky from what is left.

       Will you please elaborate? Your comment is completely meaningless without a little more insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can say that I'm an aerospace engineer at NASA and then make claims about it being impossible to create such a system. Who would the masses believe? Probably me, because my claim of working at NASA is more impactful than your claim of simply being an engineer. What type of engineer are you, anyway? Water engineers have no clue about rocket interception systems. Just being "an engineer" isn't a strong enough claim for anyone to believe a single word you say.

       I don't care if anyone believes what I say, I just want the discussion. Can you point to any technical/engineering limitation that makes a missile defense impossible?
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is some simple programing experience to see that you can take sensors (IR, radar, video recognition, audio recognition) and fly an object into or near (only need near) another object without a lot of difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell we have harm missiles that fly at super high speed and will hit whatever is giving off the most radiation, we have IR missiles that will fly to whatever has the highest temp. We have radar, gps, and tv guided missiles too. So why not is my question.

       I had my israeli cousins over this weekend and i was speaking to them about exactly this. One of them is big in to the politics and actively does talks and conferences on the israel-gaza conflict (her best friend being a palestinian whom she travels with) to help find solutions, peace, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked her about Iron Dome specifically when I saw her because I had read similar articles and wanted to see what her response would be when I asked her "what if Iron Dome was fake" and she literally blasted me by saying that not a week before she came to the UK she saw a missle in the sky from when she got off the bus, alarms were going off, they were all told to take the position in the street and lay on the floor (iirc) and she said she was scared shitless but saw, with her OWN EYES the iron dome missle intercept the missle.

       I accept what she says as true.

       I was driving in the car with my wife and kids in the West Bank a few days ago and my wife saw the Hamas rocket get shot out of the sky by 2 Iron dome missiles. She commented how ridiculous it was that people think it's a conspiracy given that it was trivial to see the Hamas rocket and distinguish it from the Iron dome missiles.

       None taken. I have experienced the iron dome 6-7 times in the past few weeks. I was always running for cover so I did not get to see anything first hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side point, I also have friends with big chunks of Hamas rockets that came falling from the sky in parts after the iron dome shot them to bits. With evidence like this it's hard to believe the conspiracy here is if the system works but repeat her why Israel is going out of their way to make a conspiracy.

       I think the opposite is true.  I highly doubt that the Israeli government wants the masses (and/or its own citizens) doubting the legitimacy of the Iron Dome/Hamas rockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a lot easier to indoctrinate a young populace into a bloodthirsty mentality when they think they're under constant threat of death from some vague outside force.  Even many militant Zionist Israelis would likely balk at some of their orders if it came out that the "Hamas rockets" didn't actually exist and its government was lying to all of them about the Iron Dome.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Faking" the Iron Dome would have the added benefit of making people dependent upon and appreciative for their government who they believe is the only thing standing in the way of them and a missile.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there would be the additional benefit for the government in the form of US taxpayer money that's funneled to Israel ostensibly for the Iron Dome.  If it was fake, it wouldn't require billions of dollars in upkeep or investment, and so that would basically just be free money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying all of this is
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       the case but I think it's at least possible (if not likely).  I don't see any reason why the Israeli government would want people thinking that the Iron Dome doesn't work or that "Hamas rockets" are fictional.

       Then please encourage the Israeli government to release thermal image recordings proving the interception of a Hamas rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty obvious that they are eager to show the severe and imminent threat the Palestinians/Hamas pose to the Israeli people and publish any fact  that proves this. So why would they not use a simple technology such as thermal imaging to empirically prove the level of threat that these rockets impose?

       Since they refuse to release this footage, the only people encouraging the spread of conspiracy theories regarding Iron Dome are those in the Israeli government.

       Why would they want to prove it? Don't they benefit from giving over as little details as possible about if or how it works?

       The Iron Dome and Hamas dont actually exist? I appreciate your conservatism, but you've failed to mention one critical thing.
       <strong>
        ISRAEL DOESNT EXIST
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       think about it? have you ever been there? then how do you know its there? because the government tells you its there? stop being so gullible. Israel is just a distraction from the government taking our guns.

       Where did you get that idea? The video posted by OP doesn't say that at all.

       I think he's saying that because the claim is that the Iron Dome is a hoax, and the rockets were not actually fired by Hamas, but by Iron Dome operators as dummy missles, that the Iron Dome and Hamas "do not exist".
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, the whole "Israel doesn't exist" bit because he hasn't been there personally, as if the media has made up the entire existence of Israel as a Wag the Dog smoke and mirrors show (and not in a sense of legitimacy, but in a literal sense), just makes me shake my head in disbelief.
