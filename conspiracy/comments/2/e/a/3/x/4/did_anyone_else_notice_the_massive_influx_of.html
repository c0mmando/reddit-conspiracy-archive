       Oh like conspiratards posting anti-semetic stuff here like bipolar bear?   Weird how it's almost exactly the same, almost from a playbook.

       Edit: When they get caught, even the excuses are the same:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Beck said he got involved in an "ill-advised intellectual exercise," using "extremely poor judgment," that became a "psychological obsession," a kind of "tic." It was a particular "error in judgment" to use the university's computers. His aim, he claimed in one email, was "to gauge how pervasive anti-Semitism really was on websites like CD."

       I don't mean personal offense, but this statement is a textbook example of apathy. You're basically saying, "I have a real problem with the situation, but I don't like dealing with conflict so I'll just sit here and hope somebody else will fix it." It's an apathetic population that has allowed this and other situations to fester across the globe. It allows governments to infringe on the rights of their people. It allows governments, on behalf of the elite, to wage war and murder in the name of profit. I'm not suggesting you need to take up arms or even protest in the streets, but at least take a side.

       I like you. You're very right, yet I was only expressing the remorse that comes with understanding war: civilian casualties are the worst. That goes for the people who die simply because they live in a war-torn country and for the families of fallen soldiers both in and outside the country.

       Banks are the true mitigating evil behind most of the world's issues. Yet they seem to be a permanent evil...like taxes and soap scum.

       Whatever helps you see the way you want to see it. If you support Israel and you're an "American" (whatever that means) then you are hypocritical. Give back the land to the natives if you think those so-called "Jews" in Israel should get back theirs (even though they are in no way related to the original Israelites).

       and we think we've progressed. when has it ever had it's place in politics? Only when everything is already conveniently already "too late." Unless, you mean that Israel shouldn't be claiming this. In which, I agree with you. My first statement still stands tho.

       All stuff that matters because you THINK it was right for them to take what no longer belong to them. It' the same bullshit they pulled with the native in America. "well, they don't really have a state. So let's kill who we can and round them up. Limit their resources until they can no longer defend themselves. There also hadn't been a state of Israel in a couple thousand years. Get over yourself. The Torah is not a deed. Give the Americas back to the Natives.

       In case you're implying that they are all shills, I assure you they are not.  I'm sure a number of them are, but the vast majority believe what they are saying.

       In America, there is a great social front to protect the Jews at all costs.  This is accomplished though the media, entertainment, religion,  and education.  From the moment an American is born, they are subject to pro-Jew propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I fell into this trap for years.  No one could have tried to teach me different  I had to find out on my own what the real threat is.  Even that took years to sink in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is a bitter pill, but it's the truth all the same.  The truth is Muslim and Christian would normally have very little problems if it weren't for the Jews.  The Jews have been pitting us against each other for generations while profiting and laughing at both of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, before anyone gets butthurt, please allow me to explain myself.  When I speak of "Jews", I refer to the fake, Khazar Jews.  European Jews.  These fake, lying, Satan worshiping creatures born with no empathy...these...Khazarians.
      </p>
      <p>
       True Jews are a blessing to mankind, and I'm proud to be with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Khazars, on the other hand, have proven that they are unable to give up their ways of deceit and manipulation, and therefor must be declared an enemy to mankind.

       kind of like the trayvon martin incident where all the "progressive liberal" whites were crying racism, saying it was racist simply because he was black. jews are thought to be innocent victims by default, which makes it much easier for them to get away with things without it even being widely questioned.

       How many civilians were killed by the allies in ww2? How about the axis? War isn't pretty, and one of the reasons we (the us) has sucked at it is we're adding arbitrary rules to a rule less game.

       So by your rules an invading army marching with civilians in front of them should not be attacked?  And the only reason this isnt a "war" is because Hamas' rockets have the same level of explosive power as a firecracker.  You give them some big toys and you dont think they would blow up kids?  Get over yourself dude, neither side is full of angels, but one is clearly worse then the other.

       Exactly.  But Israel's are much more effective, as demonstrated on the UN safehouses full of civilians they've bombed.

       you hide weapons and high ranking members of your organization around women and children.  BOOM instant invincibility.  Plus you can show pictures and "muh feels" people to your side.  The reason the jews blew that shit up is because there was stuff there worth blowing up.

       Got some proof for that claim?  What was in the UN safehouses that was worth blowing up?  Ya know, besides all of those civilians and children...

       i said it was the US destabilizing the region to piss off the soviets, but i wouldnt be surprised if it was the jews.  We found out about the law of unintended consequences fairly well a couple years back.  Doesnt mean we shouldnt blow them the fuck up.  Next your going to tell me ISIS is just misunderstood, right?

       I can't prove it because this happened over a decade ago and I don't have a link handy, but this was a standard PLO infantry formation during the second intifadah. They would form a group of 40+ child protesters and have two or three snipers in the back ducking behind the kids and popping up to take a shot at the Israelis. There was more than one report of bloodthirsty Israeli soldiers shooting Arab children in the back of the head with AK-47s during these peaceful protests (hint: Israelis don't use AK-47s), and there were cases when the Israelis did hit the kids while aiming for the snipers. The PLO stopped using this tactic after a year or two.

       im not sure who is who in your analysis.  But if you (hamas) live in a bad neighborhood, and throw rocks at your neighboors for being mean to you, and they happen to be armed to the gills, your an idiot, and should expect to (at the very least) to get the shit kicked out of you.
