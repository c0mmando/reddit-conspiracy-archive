<p>I don&#39;t mean personal offense, but this statement is a textbook example of apathy. You&#39;re basically saying, &quot;I have a real problem with the situation, but I don&#39;t like dealing with conflict so I&#39;ll just sit here and hope somebody else will fix it.&quot; It&#39;s an apathetic population that has allowed this and other situations to fester across the globe. It allows governments to infringe on the rights of their people. It allows governments, on behalf of the elite, to wage war and murder in the name of profit. I&#39;m not suggesting you need to take up arms or even protest in the streets, but at least take a side.</p>

That goes for the people who die simply because they live in a war-torn country and for the families of fallen soldiers both in and outside the country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case you&#39;re implying that they are all shills, I assure you they are not.  I&#39;m sure a number of them are, but the vast majority believe what they are saying.</p>

<p>In America, there is a great social front to protect the Jews at all costs.  This is accomplished though the media, entertainment, religion,  and education.  From the moment an American is born, they are subject to pro-Jew propaganda.</p>

<p>Personally I fell into this trap for years.  No one could have tried to teach me different  I had to find out on my own what the real threat is.  Even that took years to sink in.</p>

<p>The truth is a bitter pill, but it&#39;s the truth all the same.  The truth is Muslim and Christian would normally have very little problems if it weren&#39;t for the Jews.  The Jews have been pitting us against each other for generations while profiting and laughing at both of us.</p>

<p>Now, before anyone gets butthurt, please allow me to explain myself.  When I speak of &quot;Jews&quot;, I refer to the fake, Khazar Jews.  European Jews.  These fake, lying, Satan worshiping creatures born with no empathy...these...Khazarians.</p>

<p>True Jews are a blessing to mankind, and I&#39;m proud to be with them.</p>

<p>The Khazars, on the other hand, have proven that they are unable to give up their ways of deceit and manipulation, and therefor must be declared an enemy to mankind.</p>

<p>Exactly.  But Israel&#39;s are much more effective, as demonstrated on the UN safehouses full of civilians they&#39;ve bombed.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t prove it because this happened over a decade ago and I don&#39;t have a link handy, but this was a standard PLO infantry formation during the second intifadah. They would form a group of 40+ child protesters and have two or three snipers in the back ducking behind the kids and popping up to take a shot at the Israelis. There was more than one report of bloodthirsty Israeli soldiers shooting Arab children in the back of the head with AK-47s during these peaceful protests (hint: Israelis don&#39;t use AK-47s), and there were cases when the Israelis did hit the kids while aiming for the snipers. The PLO stopped using this tactic after a year or two.</p>
