       Whats the word, participatory economics?
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem with our free trade capitalism is that the men in charge have complete control and the labourers(proletariat) are stuck in a system they have extremely little control or say in(you can quit and work for another corporation).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all working as intended, if you watched the "Human Resources" doc from last week they lay out a lot of the framework that was conceived to put us and the world in the current state it is in.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is still all rather new economics in the scope of human history. Since the Industrial revolution we have built up a system slowly and surely that favors the wealthy. It works this way because America was founded on the principles to enforce this protection of wealth concentration.
       <a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/">
        http://www.historyisaweapon.com/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to see a change in the dynamics of the economic system in place the only proven method is war against those in power. But that method of regime change only worked in the pre industrialized world, we have no successful example of how a group of people can win over and change a government who has such mass concentrations of wealth and power as America does in the 21st century. Throughout the past 100 years laws have been created or abolished to reinforce this system so as to protect the interests of those with power. The move of corporations from mere business "entities" to having equal rights as human beings is the greatest mark of how grossly corrupted the US government has become.
      </p>
      <p>
       Factions are the greatest threat to a Republic. Our rich forefathers feared the growing discontent among the poor factions and so redirected their anger towards the crown of England, regardless of the fact that once removed from the empire they established the same laws and protections to ensure the continuation of their wealth and power, the factions of the time were misled into believing that this new America would be different from the previous establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of divide and conquer is the American Gov. modus operandi. Do not become satisfied with directing your anger away from those in power. They would have us direct our anger outwards to other nations(terrorism/immigration) or amongst our own factions(ex. red v blue).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have no great answer to all the problems we face in changing this system to a system that can be perceived as better but I can say that factions are the downfall of any government and if you want real change figure out your goals, find a faction that supports them and focus your energies on TPTB not on other factions.

       I do think that kind of wealth is a bad thing. It gives one person too much control over too many people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't mean we need to scrap capitalism entirely. I like the idea of a crypto currency that limits each person to the equivalent of $1B. It's still crazy rich, just not "hey let's exterminate humanity!" rich.

       Not people, money. Very different.

       Also, how would you regulate wealth in a way that capitalists would support? The dream is to own everything and anything, I don't think the hyper elite would settle for anything less.

       You get the billionaires to sign on, and I'll vote for it today. To be fair, I don't think that's how capitalism works. Might be a very generous version of socialism.

       Of course it is, but that's not the point. The point is that any regulation on personal wealth (just read up on the inheritance tax shit storm) would be met with loud cries of socialism, and that would play pretty well in the US right now with a black, democratic president.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying the US absolutely will not support this, poor or rich alike.

       The American People, for the most part, have no idea their government is criminal organization hell-bent on killing most of them, either. I don't think a $1B personal wealth cap is such a deal-breaker compared to dying in global genocide.

       This is exactly where you lost me. This is not realistic, rational, or in any way a conspiracy. It's doomsaying, just a different spin.

       Buy a bunker, guns, and water. And then watch as the world keeps spinning while you wait for it to end. Don't worry though, thousands of people (both smarter and dumber then you) throughout history have predicted the same thing, and been just as wrong.

       I'm saying that they are not trying to kill ninety percent of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were, then yes it would be the biggest conspiracy in the world. Also the most rediculous strategy I have ever heard of in my life.
       <strong>
        What government wants to kill their workforce? Who would produce their goods, sell their products, and clean up their waste?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Killing off ninety percent of their population would mean that the remaining ten percent would then have to pick up that huge amount of slack.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I don't believe the elite or the super wealthy are lining up to clean their own houses, maintain their own sewer/water, and grow their own food.
       </strong>
       (Just to name a few of the thousands of things they would then have to do on their own.)

       Also killing billions of people makes no kind of rational, physical, or economical sense in any way. The pool of wealth they siphon off needs to be large.

       Being a billionaire in a world where the most valuable thing is food/shelter/clothing seems a lot less appealing then a world where they can get all that, and Bugatti's, Yachts, and thousand dollar an hour escorts.

       America isn't a capitalist country.  America is a social corporate oligarchy with a dash of capitalism for the poor.  That's why the banks can get a bail out and I can't.

       You can't get a bail out because your personal finances has little to zero effect on the economy at large. That is capitalism in a nutshell. You have little financial value, and thus offering you free money to end your debts doesn't make any financial sense.

       I didn't say consumers, I said you. Consumers completely control the economy at large, but I don't imagine your debts are going to make much of a dent in things.

       Bailing out the banks to the tune of several billion dollars has a far higher return rate on investment then assuming any measly debts you might have.

       Although in all honesty, I would love to see what kind of country you would have now if the government said screw the banks, and took those billions and bought out everyone who was underwater on their mortgage.

       This is as true as saying that you can buy a lottery ticket and end up rich. Sure, it is "possible", but it's not realistic. In fact, I wonder what the ratio of people who "worked their way from the bottom" to lottery winners is?

       I imagine most significant wealth is inherited, not earned in the conventional sense.

       Nice rebuttal I still think its the best model though. What do you thjnk is better? The disparity would make people rise up because a majority of the wealth will be distributed between only a few while normal people suffer with barely anything. Personally I don't complain about it. Its the best model. Capitalism is the only proven modal to bring people out of poverty. Has raised over a billion out of poverty

       We're not disagreeing on capitalism, I completely agree it's the best of any system we have. That is why I was confused by the title, it seemed to imply wealth was a tool for global revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I know anything about the wealthy, it is that they want more wealth. They won't tear down the current system at all (IE global revolution),
       <em>
        simply because it put them where they are
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As an aside, I think it is amazing that a majority of poor people in America believe that if they work hard, and pull up their bootstraps, they'll get everything they want. Working hard =/= wealth, unless you offer something that hundreds of thousands of other people don't also have. A bit off topic, but something that bothers me.

       Of course it is, but that's not the point. The point is that any regulation on personal wealth (just read up on the inheritance tax shit storm) would be met with loud cries of socialism, and that would play pretty well in the US right now with a black, democratic president.
