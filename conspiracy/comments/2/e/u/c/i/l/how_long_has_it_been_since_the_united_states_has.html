I think it&#39;s becoming increasingly clear to anybody with their head not completely up their ass this is not a free country. So I&#39;m curious, when did we lose our freedom? Was is closer to 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act, or more recently with the TSA, NSA, War on Drugs, police militarization, failing fiat currency...I&#39;m sure it was not a single event, but I&#39;m also curious when the totality of everything that has happened led us to be objectively not free. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My original thought was that the us hasn&#39;t been a free country since it has owed debt to other countries. From 1836-38ish there was no public debt in America, but other than that, we are at the will of the people we owe money to, in my eyes.  </p>

<p>From a more contemporary standpoint, I feel like most freedoms lasted until 9/11. Of course, I was only 7 when 9/11 happened so I don&#39;t remember a lot of life before then. But! I know the TSA wasn&#39;t nearly so intense, the boarders weren&#39;t being watched as carefully, the NSA barely existed. The war on terror has helped erase of a lot of American freedoms under the guise of protection, while holding support from Americans to make those changes. 9/11 changed the world, sure, but it changed America a lot more than people remember.</p>

<p>You can leave, for travel or permanent residence, any time you want. </p>

<p>You can move to a different state without seeking the government&#39;s permission to do so.</p>

<p>You can seek employment, education, friendship, etc. all without first obtaining government permission.</p>

<p>So when you suggest that the US is not a &quot;free&quot; country, could you first maybe describe which freedoms you think are lacking, that other nations might have or that Americans used to have but do not any longer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every single &#39;freedom&#39; you listed is permitted in at least 90% of the world. Note I didn&#39;t even say &quot;civilized world&quot;, so my stat even includes the 3rd world.</p>

<p>Also, the US is one of the only countries in the world that makes its citizens pay taxes, even when they live and work in another country.</p>

<p>Not to mention, in the US, it is extremely hard for people to leave the country after college, because most of them are deeply in debt from student loans. They could do it, but then they would probably be arrested when they came back.</p>

<p>Most countries in the world do not leave their students in crippling debt.</p>

<p>Most countries in the world also do not leave people in crippling debt over medical expenses.</p>

<p>And there are little things as well. Most countries in the world allow adults to drink alcohol in public parks, or at the beach, or even when just walking around at night. You may see this as a little thing, but this small thing brings a pretty large feeling of freedom when considering the fact that the government is treating you as an adult able to make adult decisions.</p>

<p>Most countries in the world have developed infrastructures that allow people to use safe and affordable public transportation, so that owning a car is not necessary. </p>

<p>The US has decided they are &quot;better&quot; than this and didn&#39;t learn at all from older countries. Now the people are forced to have cars just to maintain their way of life and go to work, to the store, etc...</p>

<p>This also ropes you into debt over car payments, and not to mention gas.</p>

<p>I prefer the freedom to be able to leave my home and get on a safe bus, trolley, tramway, or subway. And I can drink a beer on the way and nobody will call the cops on me. If I happen to get in an accident on the way, I will get medical help for practically nothing.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>a US citizen who left the country 8 years ago</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just moved to Europe and have been staying in various countries and applying for various visa&#39;s depending on if I want to stay in X country longer than 3 months.</p>

<p>The biggest issue is probably finding a job, I am able to do this because my job is digital and I can do it from anywhere as long as I have a laptop.</p>

<p>Honestly, it is a breath of fresh air to leave the bubble that is the US. I spent over 20 years of my life in the US without ever leaving once. </p>

<p>Once I left, I realized that so many things that I had been told about the &quot;outside world&quot; were all bullshit, exaggerations, and sensationalism. Looking back, it seems so blatant that it is hard to believe it was designed to keep people in ignorance and fear to never leave the US.</p>

<p>The US really is like an island. An island away from all the rest of the world. And because our media is so powerful, the people are bombarded constantly by a one-sided agenda. </p>

<p>edit: I also spent time in South America.</p>

<p>College debt is not a factor of the government, unless perhaps you&#39;re advocating for free college for everyone? Regardless, you&#39;re describing an economic alternative / individual choice, not a lack of a freedom.</p>

<p>Same comment on your medical debt point.</p>

<p>Ah, a real freedom impugned - you can&#39;t drink in public places in many municipalities. Devastating.</p>

<p>Public transportation exists in many cities in the USA and, again, its capabilities (or lack thereof) is not indicative of a freedom.</p>

<p>You&#39;re describing conveniences and economic choices, not freedoms.</p>

<p>Here, read this to get an idea of what a freedom is in the context of government: <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html">http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s what people like you have in mind I guess, but don&#39;t assume that actions like that won&#39;t be prevented due to harsher punishments and consequences. You kill or rape some one and expect to be mutilated. Freedom goes all ways. But think about this if everyone is free from the get go as of today people would be more aware of people like you, that have things like that in mind, and they would teach their children that there would be no reason to act that way because there&#39;s no need to do it in a free world. On the chance that it does happen... So what? You think that you can determine someone&#39;s morals based on some crack question like that? Their not my children and I don&#39;t fuck women so that wouldn&#39;t be my problem ever. If you&#39;re worried about it, don&#39;t have kids. If you feel your child would act out and disobey your parenting, you probably are a horrible parent giving the child something to base his rebellion from you off so again, don&#39;t have kids. Very simple steps to avoid even facing a question like that, and btw you never gave me that definition of what freedom is. If that question that was supposed to make me &quot;feel&quot; bad or sad or responsible for children was your definition then I want a refund for all this text cause for a guy like me it wouldn&#39;t apply. Next...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please define what you mean by &#39;people like me&#39;.</p>

<p>As to the rest of your rant, I don&#39;t think I would enjoy living in a world in which groups of vigilantes chased down and mutilated or murdered suspected criminals. That&#39;s not freedom.</p>

<p>I totally don&#39;t get your rant about kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like you = folks who set up questions assuming you will know the answer before it is given. And when you don&#39;t get an answer you expect, you seem baffled about it and use the &quot;what about the children&quot; question as if that would bend anyone&#39;s mindset. 
My rant was a way of expressing 1) I don&#39;t give a fuck about children, I understand that our species can&#39;t continue without them but I believe that if I am unable to produce a child I shouldn&#39;t be held responsible with what happens to them. They are born, oh well. They die, oh well. 2) And so I explained as to how I justified your question of rape and murder. I say defend yourself and loved ones and stay out of others nerves and you&#39;ll live, I don&#39;t picture any of my neighbors murdering anyone now and I doubt they will be filled with the need or want to do so if real freedom was ever upon us. Yes I forget some people are pussies and wouldn&#39;t want to live in the world if they had to defend themselves, though there are those who can. 
And again forget my rants, you have yet to give me a definition of freedom. So if you will please do so, or else shut the fuck up commenting about what freedom is or isn&#39;t, because if you think that you live in a free world, country, state, city, town, or where ever you live I bet your life that anyone can point out &quot;freedoms&quot; that would causer them to get one of those pesky bullets through their head, or in jail if they managed to become overpowered. You&#39;re not a free person my friend, sorry.</p>

<p>Feel free to research on the growing number of nations who have decided higher taxes are preferable to the corruption of endless bureaucracy. </p>

<p>Does this make you not free to leave? I&#39;ve looked into this quite a bit. There&#39;s a shitton of work on the arrival side to relocate or travel. There&#39;s a passport (required by the arrival side) that cost all of $150 and a few weeks and no other issues on the USA side.</p>

<p>Taxes or lack thereof is not a freedom. Go read the link I posted for an idea of what freedom is in the context of government.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re really hung up on taxes, aren&#39;t you? This does not make anyone less free to relocate.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Apparently FAFSA loans aren&#39;t a requirement because I&#39;ve lived in the USA for many decades and I&#39;d have to Google it to figure out what it is, so no lack of freedom there.</p>

<p>A driver&#39;s license is not an example of a lack of freedom. It&#39;s an example of a tax and an implementation of a basic public safety measure. Anyone who is incapable of getting a driver&#39;s license should sure as fuck not be driving!</p>

<p>Plenty of people with licenses that should not be driving. </p>

<p>You can split hairs all you want about definitions and taxes. I was just pointing out that you are not free to do as you please, like you assert. There are still many instances where you are expected as a citizen to answer to the government, regardless of your will or intent. Neither of us are denying that, clearly. </p>

<p>So feel free to descend into pedantry if you must, that&#39;s your right.</p>

<p>When you commit a crime.</p>

<p>When you need to pay a tax.</p>

<p>When you need to get a license.</p>

<p>There are no lacks of freedoms there. Anarchy is not a rational solution.</p>
