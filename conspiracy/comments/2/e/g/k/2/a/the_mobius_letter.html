       Yesterday I received the following email from
       <a href="mailto:mobius@lelantos.org">
        mobius@lelantos.org
       </a>
       .  I do not know what to make of it, so I'm leaving it here.  The text is too long to submit, so I'll paste the introduction only.
       <a href="http://pastebin.com/rjN3hmth">
        The rest is here

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dear Members of the House of Commons
&amp; The House of Lords
       </p>
       <p>
        The recipients of this open letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin include the Russian Embassy in London, the Kremlin, every head of state and serving politician in the BRICS, NATO and Commonwealth member nations, journalists and news organisations throughout the world, and the agents for every major Hollywood actor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyone is reading this.
       </p>
       <p>
        This letter outlines an electromagnetic breakthrough that can now obsolete oil and gas as fuel sources, bring an end to Industrial Era relics and insanities, such as the combustion engine and nuclear power, prevent fracking, and eventually liberate mankind from all forms of slavery, through a global technological revolution.
       </p>
       <p>
        This letter also clearly explains the extreme danger that Prince William is now in. A danger that has placed all of us under tremendous threat. The lucidity, sanity, clarity and quality of the mind that is writing this letter is proven by the Nobel Prize worthy articulation of the relationship between matter and space-time contained herein.
       </p>
       <p>
        That level of proof of my sanity, a sanity that can be verified by any physicist, was necessary in order to give my voice the authority it must have to name the danger now posed to Prince William. That danger cannot be verified by any ordinary means, but it can be verified by the extraordinary means that were used to develop the technology that can now deliver mankind from the chains of oil, gas and nuclear power.
       </p>
       <p>
        This letter contains a full written description of the technology, which can be built, tested and verified by any nation. Once this information is verified at the highest levels of global government, the full contents of this letter will send a lightning strike through the political class. In the fullness of time, this letter will be honoured as the founding document of the 21st Century.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although this thorough articulation of the relationship between matter and space-time is worthy of the highest honours, I am remaining anonymous for as long as possible, to protect the lives of those I love. If you know who I am, do not use my name when discussing this letter online, or in a reply.
       </p>
       <p>
        All email traffic is observed by the NSA, the CIA, the FBI and GCHQ. Corrupt and self-serving enemies of the just are entrenched within our own western establishment, but I am your ally. Who I am will eventually become known, but protect my identity until this letter can do its work around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the turning of the tables, revolving power from out of the hands of governments and corporations, back into the hands of humanity. This is the rising of the tide beneath Noah's Ark.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is checkmate.

       I think the following part helps with it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is worth underlining here briefly, out of love and compassion, that the pending psychedelic and telepathic revolution that is about to sweep the earth (partly as a result of the publication of this letter) will be the final and complete vindication of the ministry of David Icke. The level of foul abuse and ridicule that he has suffered for over 20 years will not continue beyond the telepathic awakening of mankind, which is now pending. Words cannot overstate my respect for the bravery and courage of those who have blown the whistle on the Royal Family and the Black Clan over the last few decades, in the face of such vicious attacks.

      <p>
       I'll cut to the chase for everyone:
      </p>
      <p>
       My device makes three significant adaptations to Lord Kelvin’s Thunderstorm. I have converted the two rings into hollow copper toroids with a large central hole: a 16cm outer diameter with an 8cm inner diameter. I have also replaced the wires with insulated and hollow copper tubes, due to my ancillary observation that electromagnetism prefers to flow around its direction of travel.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you force electricity straight down a wire, it will meet maximum resistance along its directional axis, through the core of the copper, but sent down a copper tunnel instead: it will flow around the tunnel, using the tunnel’s outer wall as a circular train track, with an inbuilt cooling mechanism (the air inside the tunnel). This technique is used in particle accelerators, to reduce heat from massive currents of electricity flowing down conductors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also placed four holes around the equators of the two copper toroids at the points of the compass. This allows the insulated copper tubing to attach to each toroid, through one hole, which leaves three holes for three hollow acrylic tubes that provide an exit for warm air and an entrance for cool air, as the electricity builds in the copper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I have built hollow and cylindrical acrylic cases to house the Thunderstorm, which are water-tight and electrically insulated. The two cases stand three meters apart and they are each 90cm high. The casings are each made of three detachable parts, joined by watertight flanges. The casings act as wells to hold the water as it falls. I have done away with metal buckets and simply allowed the copper tube-wires to act as electrodes, resting on the bottom of each acrylic well, under the surface of the gathering water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each insulated copper tube-wire enters the opposing well through a watertight rubber dimple just above the join with the bottom section of the casing. The acrylic cases are 90cm tall with 1cm thick walls and they are split into three sections: a lid 10cm tall, a base 40cm tall, and a mid section 40cm tall: drilled with four holes around the top, 3cm below the join with the lid, for the acrylic pipes and insulated copper tube to exit through, which also hold the copper toroid in place, and one hole at the bottom, 3cm above the join with the base, for the insulated copper tube from the other toroid to enter through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I then supply water droplets through a 10cm diameter opening in the two lids, with two jets of spray from a pair of vivarium foggers, originally designed to mist reptile enclosures. The jets are powerful and they turbo-charge the momentum of the falling droplets, rapidly accelerating the build-up of voltage.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all happens naturally in weather systems due to the spin that occurs when atmospheres of different temperatures and pressures collide. They rotate around each other to dissipate their differentials and by doing so accelerate and excite 3D particles into higher 4D and 5D states, which unwinds atomic nuclei, creates magnetic monopoles and opens anti-gravitic quantum wormholes between droplets.
      </p>
      <p>
       These droplet wormholes are wide open portals to the infinite and eternal energy source that created the cosmos (which I call the Source Light of the Creator) and they tend to slam shut, which happens “en masse” during lightning strikes between thunderheads and the earth. You will notice that rain falls heavily after a lightning strike, because the quantum paired particles in the atmosphere suddenly lose their anti-gravitic properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to all the acrylic insulation, the only sparks that can fly in my wells are between the top toroids and the surface of the water directly below them. However, to cross that distance, a distance of 90cm (when the well is empty), takes hundreds of thousands of volts. With further adaptations, this technology could be improved and adapted to tap millions of volts from the beyond-verse that resides beneath the space-time plenum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that this new form of highly energised water will have huge implications for human health. My colleague and I have begun drinking vortexed water. We have noticed telepathic effects that are beyond any explanation. This technology may be about to create the first psychedelic with no political stigma attached to it, for it is only water. We may be about to telepathically awaken the world with nothing more advanced than electromagnetically polarised water.
      </p>
      <p>
       We plan to use the water to create batteries that could eventually run any home or vehicle. The water from one bucket is kept separate from the water in the other bucket, then both bodies of water are connected like the two ends of a battery to the same electrical circuit, with loads attached. In this way, huge voltage reservoirs can be used to power the relatively tiny energy needs of a family home or car. Soon we could be running entire cities off batteries that take years to run down, but can be replenished within a few minutes or hours.

       I got this email too, I've been searching around trying to find more about it, but for something that "will become one of the founding documents of the 21st century" this is the only reference on the web I've found so far... 
[edit] there's now a reference on 4chan, but I'm not sure that counts...

       You know, there is something about Tesla and his accidental exposures to 'time travel' that really bothers me. Part of me thinks he is the secret partner of the company that bares his name. I hope I am just being silly. At least I don't claim to be the Messiah!

       I resent your pessimism and how you seemingly try to belittle people even when you aren't addressing anyone. How telling it is of you to assume I haven't already read that and most of Plato's work, but anyways, dont be so negative, its true that the sheeple are not going to win this battle, but check this out:

       I agree with you completely, and I doubt whoever wrote this letter is truly the messiah, but what confused me about your first comment was that it seemed like you were implying that some time before someone had tried to jolt people awake in this manner and it had ended in tragedy, I couldn't think of any such event though which is the main reason I replied. Also "looking crazy" isn't a concern of the enlightened.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question for you then is where should we get info from to understand what is really happening in the world? It would be nice to completely rely on ourselves and meditate and become wise from within, but i think that is naive as implying that jesus wrote this letter and is about to save us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, im convinced this letter is more truth than disinformation. If you took out the opening part about being the messiah, it would be a very interesting document proposing a new model of the atom and zero point energy generator. Could be wrong, but i think it would be more worthwile if the whole world read this and commented on it, rather than putting that energy into watching american idol.
