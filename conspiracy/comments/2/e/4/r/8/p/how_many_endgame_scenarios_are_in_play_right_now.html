<p>However, it&#39;s not &quot;endgame&quot; time yet.</p>

<p>That&#39;s next year.</p>

<p>This autumn will be the economic disaster, the 400 missing surface-to-air missiles used in a simultaneous International 9/11, Obama&#39;s heart attack, President Biden steps down to let his Vice President Hillary become president without an election (like Ford did after Nixon), and the mystery bombing of the &quot;Twin Towers&quot; (twin temples) on Temple Mount in Jerusalem, allegedly ushering in the Antichrist according to Christian eschatology.</p>

<p>Then next April is the U.S. military coup disguised as &quot;disgruntled USAF infiltrator Lone Gunmen&quot; crashing their plane into the Capitol Dome (which is currently being renovated by the same company that &quot;renovated&quot; the exact 6 floors, and ONLY those 6 floors, of WTC-1 that were struck:  Turner Construction), killing all national-level Democrats during a GOP walkout that accuses Hillary of &quot;staging a coup&quot;, then the Operation Falcon roundups &amp; assassinations, the Pentagon/intelligence community purges, the showtrials of &quot;Al Qaeda/ISIS conspirators within the government&quot;, the appointment of an &quot;emergency President&quot; and &quot;handpicked Congress&quot;, the shutdown of Twitter, the roundups in sports stadiums across the U.S., the new checkpoints established to enter and leave major cities, the &quot;temporary&quot; injunctions against &quot;free press spreading Al Qaeda/ISIS code words&quot; by &quot;moles within the media&quot;, the New Madrid fault earthquake, the California earthquake, the July 2015 Tianenmen Square-style massacre of protesters on the National Mall, the military operations beginning against Venezuela, Ecuador &amp; Bolivia, then finally WW3, but mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, but followed by a 9-year nuclear winter and famine.</p>

<p>But then it will be OK.  After the axis/pole shift of 2022 that wipes out any survivors within 200 miles of a coast.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is best not to worry, but be prepared. When and <strong><em>if</em></strong> shit hits the fan, you will have no control over the result other than to be the best prepared you can to take care of your family. Our lives are not under our control as we like to understand it. Knowing you cannot control tomorrow&#39;s outcome, some see that as a comfort. For if you could control the chaos, who would you choose to live or die?</p>

<p>Simply being aware of the potential future problems means you are more prepared than those ignorant of the fact. Worrying is okay but allowing it to control your emotions to the extent of disallowing you to fully function to protect your family is not. Mind this and you will do great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been paying attention to the doom level of the world for the past 15 years and I am 100% certain it has never been this bad. In the early 2000s, we would have doomish events happening maybe once every 4-5 months. After 2008 it started accelerating until these huge events started happening about every 1-2 months. </p>

<p>Now we see collapse type events happening about every 1-2 weeks. We are getting close. I think we have 5 years maximum before the majority of the people in the western world are struggling to survive on a day-to-day basis. Personally, I think the dollar will be abandoned by most of the world before BO leaves office. I also think we are already in the early stages of ww3, which involves economic and cyber warfare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its like pushing on a water balloon..  you apply pressure to one area and other areas erupt.  they are in a game of catch up and are losing more control every day. its not like they are not trying to control every inch of the balloon.. but its just an impossibility at this point. you would think a mass culling is in the cards as they have to know they cannot win if this continues.. </p>
