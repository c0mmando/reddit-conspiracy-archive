        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was reading about the recent beheading of the US journalist by ISIS when I stumbled upon Nick Berg. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Berg">Wikipedia link</a>.</p>

<p>Short summary of what I&#39;ve read from mainstream sources:</p>

<p>Nick Berg was a 26-year-old Jewish kid from Philly who was captured and beheaded in Iraq in 2004. His family was secular but Nick became a devout Jew in adulthood and carried a prayer shawl. He had his own business inspecting and rebuilding communication antennae. Berg did work in Uganda and Kenya. In Kenya he set up a subsidiary of his company. In early 2004, Berg was in Iraq looking at communications towers and trying to drum up business. He was traveling alone without a translator or bodyguard. About a month before he was scheduled to leave, his parents stopped hearing from him and became worried. The hired an investigator and it turned out he was arrested by Iraqi Police and/or US Army (not clear who as the US denied capturing him but did talk to him) on suspicion of being an &quot;Iranian&quot; spy. &quot;He carried books about Iran and kept a detailed inventory of Iraqi communications towers.&quot; The FBI contacted his parents and said he was being held. The parents filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming he was being held in violation of the constitution, and he was released thereafter. US Officials offered to transport him out of Iraq, but he refused and checked into a hotel in Baghdad. A few days later a US military patrol found his decapitated body on an overpass. Two days later a video of his execution was released, titled &quot;Abu Musa&#39;b al-Zarqawi slaughters an American.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is where it gets really weird:</p>

<p>In 2002, the FBI questioned Berg because while he was taking classes at the University of Oklahoma, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacarias_Moussaoui">Zacarias Moussaoui</a> used Berg&#39;s OU password to access the university network and he may have used Berg&#39;s e-mail address. What happened, according to Berg&#39;s family, was a man on a bus in Norman, OK asked to borrow Berg&#39;s laptop. Berg gave the man his password. Unbeknownst to Berg, this man was an associate of Moussaoui. [Note: Moussaoui attended flight school  at the airport near OU&#39;s campus.] The FBI cleared Berg of any connection to terrorist groups. [Note: It&#39;s highly unlikely someone was sending e-mail on a laptop from a Bus sometime in 2001 but that is what Berg&#39;s father seems to be suggesting in the CNN article below.]</p>

<p>An extremely unlikely coincidence. He just happened to meet a 9/11 terrorist on a bus in Oklahoma while doing graduate studies? Then 3 or 4 years later he decides to jaunt around Iraq during the invasion, falls under suspicion of US officials again, and turns up dead a few days later at the hands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi">Zarqawi</a>?</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing this guy was affiliated with Mossad. Has anyone heard anything about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nick Berg&#39;s log-on was also used to purchase tickets for Flight 93. Tickets were purchased on the computers in Bizzell Library. And the man wasn&#39;t an associate of Moussaoui, it was him. Nick Berg has/had a blog about his profession in the communications tower construction. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a loooot to this story, 9/11, and the Murrah Bombing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the tip. I just saw <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2bqxrq/berlin_cia_station_chief_monitors_hamburg_911/cj8dc19">your comment from last month</a> too. This is all new to me. Not really much of a 9/11 conspiracy buff, but this Nick Berg stuff is one of the more promising leads I&#39;ve seen. Came across it today totally by accident when I was reading an article today in the Financial Times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was supposedly killed by a masked al zarqawi. That guy was basically a binladen style boogeyman.  His parents sued to get him released in iraq, but the government lied about ever having him.  Very strange story.</p>
