Is there evidence that will show us that this cop was justified in shooting an unarmed man SIX times, TWICE in the head. At the very least we need to talk about retraining police not to kill with such ease</p>

<p>What new information? All I have heard is second hand accounts from friends of the shooter that he says it happened differently. I think there has been a concerted effort to change the narrative on this incident. Not saying that first account by Michael Brown&#39;s friend right after the incident shouldn&#39;t be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very suspicious that it has taken the police so long to get their story straight about what exactly happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it has to do with race.  The discussions I&#39;m having have nothing to do with race and everything to with police brutality and the growing police state. </p>

<p>As a side note, there were 3-4 witnesses in the beginning that all said there was just a few people who would have seen it.  They all backed up the story of the person standing near Michael Brown.  </p>

<p>Fast forward a week or so, and suddenly the police have a DOZEN witnesses that all back up his story and one of them is the officers girlfriend? </p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t sound suspicious as hell you aren&#39;t thinking critically enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I was very optimistic to see white people in the protests as well, and even a white militia was reported as showing up.  We have to stay united or we stand no chance.  All dividing it by race does is make sure the people immediately affected, are separated as a group from the wider majority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most white people in the us are taught from a very early age to feel guilt for past events they had no part in, and that to question a black persons claims of racism is in itself racist. Combine that with the fact that many black people are taught that anything negative between a white and black person is inherently racist and you&#39;ve got a frothing horde of glazed eyed cattle chanting rhetoric and willingly blocking out any sort of fact or reason. </p>
