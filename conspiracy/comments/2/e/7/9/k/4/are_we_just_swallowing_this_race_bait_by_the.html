       Initially I was disturbed by the alleged execution style shooting of Michael Brown. As new information comes to light, it appears that maybe, we didn't get all of the facts. There may well be a more reasonable explanation for the shooting. The evidence still needs to be examined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the political wheels are turning and this is being turned into a racial divide between white and black America with echoes of Dred Scott and the West Memphis three. I can hear the racial war drums beating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Militarization and aggression of the police during the protests aside, is America taking this cultural Marxist, race baiting meme hook, line and sinker?

       Well then it's the job of those who don't take the bait to steer the conversation back to where it belongs. The police vs the people. 
Is there evidence that will show us that this cop was justified in shooting an unarmed man SIX times, TWICE in the head. At the very least we need to talk about retraining police not to kill with such ease

       What new information? All I have heard is second hand accounts from friends of the shooter that he says it happened differently. I think there has been a concerted effort to change the narrative on this incident. Not saying that first account by Michael Brown's friend right after the incident shouldn't be taken with a grain of salt.

       I don't think it has to do with race.  The discussions I'm having have nothing to do with race and everything to with police brutality and the growing police state.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, there were 3-4 witnesses in the beginning that all said there was just a few people who would have seen it.  They all backed up the story of the person standing near Michael Brown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward a week or so, and suddenly the police have a DOZEN witnesses that all back up his story and one of them is the officers girlfriend?

       If that doesn't sound suspicious as hell you aren't thinking critically enough.

       Some are trying to divide it into being about race. Some are remembering who is polarising our debate field, and taking notes about who has contributed to fucking things up.

       Some are falling for the race bait, tensions are high, but I don't see it in the protests fortunately. Just In the propaganda, and the ignorant.

       Yes.  I was very optimistic to see white people in the protests as well, and even a white militia was reported as showing up.  We have to stay united or we stand no chance.  All dividing it by race does is make sure the people immediately affected, are separated as a group from the wider majority.

       Most white people in the us are taught from a very early age to feel guilt for past events they had no part in, and that to question a black persons claims of racism is in itself racist. Combine that with the fact that many black people are taught that anything negative between a white and black person is inherently racist and you've got a frothing horde of glazed eyed cattle chanting rhetoric and willingly blocking out any sort of fact or reason.

       If you attack a cop like the guy in ferguson did, you're going to get shot.

       No, when you said this 4 days ago: "All of this so called 'police militarization' is necessitated by violent aggressors. A curfew ha sbeen implemented
       <strong>
        due to the monkeys
       </strong>
       causing a shitstorm after sunset. They are making everyone go home, including the protestors, due to the dickheads that are turning my back yard into Watts(the rioters/looters)."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what makes people call you a 'a white supremacist, police shill and asshole.' At least you're honest with your username, too bad it's permanent.

       The Americans that don't pay attention to what's really going on are buying it.  Keep hammering it wasn't the kid vs the cop that was the real problem (although it's true a problem does exist there), rather it was the police response to the protests that is the real issue.

       when real people get killed - i seriously doubt this is
       <em>
        baiting
       </em>
       , you should realize that Ferguson, MO has a history of abuse (and killing),
      </p>
      <p>
       that may not bother
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       ppl; until it happens to them,
should the police
       <em>
        occupy
       </em>
       your neighborhood, let me know how you feel.

       it is partly a racial issue. no, it's not whites vs. blacks. it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       police vs
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of us, but the cops
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       target blacks. it's really not that hard to understand. America's legacy of racism continues and if you don't see that then, well, I think you aren't aware of the reality of what it's like for blacks in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race is definitely part of the issue here. get over it.

       I think people are not swallowing it up.  I used to be racist as hell when I moved to the USA &amp; will never forget the 2 unknown black gentleman that asked if I was alright when I had sudden heart problems at two different times. Everybody else didn't pay any attention (I am white.). I will never forget those guys. My perspective on race changed in a few seconds. Thanks guys... I appreciate your concern for other human beings. Really good people.
