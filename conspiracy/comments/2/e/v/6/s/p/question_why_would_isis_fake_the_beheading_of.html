       If they're so dastardly why do you think they faked his death?  I mean CIA and Mossad could potentially work together and still kill James Foley. Why are we saying it was a fake?

       What is this fairy tale world? There is no acting troupe. The idea of CIA and Mossad collaborating is technically conceivable. But in what world is James foley so important that faking his death would prove to be more effective than releasing a video of his actual execution. I'm just saying sometimes these conspiracy theorists reach tooo far

       Because the powers that be need to maintain the illusion of consent. If 'they' want a war in Syria but the people are overwhelmingly opposed, it limits their options. They can either submit to the will of the people (not get their way), or ignore the people, go to war anyways, and risk a revolution. TPTB
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       get their way, whether it takes a year or a century. They aren't worried about small or even medium-sized pockets of dissent. These can be managed and/or marginalized. However, they are terrified by the possibility of mass, organized opposition (whether physical or ideological). If 3/4 of the American population suddenly wake the fuck up and decide they've had enough of the banksters and co-ordinate to throw them all in jail, TPTB will be forced to either abandon a system they have spent centuries putting in place, or resort to Plan B, which would be martial law and civil war. And despite how it might look, they really want to avoid Plan B, because there is a
       <em>
        significant chance they would lose
       </em>
       . Military and law enforcement might have a lot of fancy toys, but in terms of sheer numbers the people outnumber military and law enforcement 100-1, and have them outgunned at about 95-1. If the people ever get past their differences and unite against the government, they're gonna have a bad time. If/when they decide to start 'governing' against the apparent will of the people, then they will have given away the game, shown their hand, and left themselves with only one option, Plan B. Which is why they work so hard to keep people at odds ideologically, with race, religion, sexuality, feminism, etc. It's why they crushed the Occupy movement so brutally, and blatantly displayed their authoritarian capability in Ferguson. It's why they try so hard to keep people afraid. Frightened people are easy to control, but angry people are not, and they are unpredictable. When the U.S. invaded Iraq in the aftermath of 9/11, people were so scared that they were willing to give the government carte blanche in the name of 'protecting us from terrorism'. But when they tried to invade Syria last year on the heels of the fear created by the Boston Bombing, they realized at the 11th hour that going against the will of the people at that time would have created an anger that they weren't ready or willing to deal with. They followed the Iraq blueprint almost to a tee, and
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to have realized that the public was starting to see through their bullshit. So, here we are a year later, with a new terrorist 'threat' (ISIS, ISIL, IS, IL, whatever the fuck they're calling it today), a 'shocking' beheading, and a seemingly plausible reason to get soldiers' toes wet in Syria. Anyone with a modicum of common sense could have predicted the current situation a year ago, and are
       <em>
        sure as fuck
       </em>
       not fooled by it now. But that doesn't matter, because enough people have fallen for the plot hook, line, and sinker. There are millions of frightened people calling for boots on the ground and heads to roll. To borrow from Chomsky, they have manufactured consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - Its easier and safer to con people into compliance than to force them into compliance.

       Perhaps a more "hardened" member of IS carried out the actual beheading and the video was poorly edited so that it would appear that a British IS fighter carried out the act to make it more shocking for the West, maybe.

       It would just make sense to have a person who's native tongue is English to "host" a video aimed directly at the West, and for him to then go and carry out the shocking act is even better, better for propaganda purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, perhaps this guy was part of the recent influx of British nationals travelling to Syria to fight with IS. So he wouldn't be a hardened soldier, but he does speak English.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it's a CIA/MOSAD hoax for one pretext or another! If that was the case though, you'd think they would do a better job with the video editing, no?

       This is what makes the most sense for me. ISIS have proven themselves to be aware of the role that social media plays in the western world, and they are trying to reach that public with this.

       It's not an easy thing for most people to cut a man's head off, rather than the easy route of shooting him from a distance. I think the new guy probably couldn't do it, or at least not without possibly botching it on camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like they can reattach his head and have a few goes at it.

       They demonized themselves plenty before the James Foley incident.

       I'd say that ISIS is more of a symptom of US and Western foreign policy in Iraq since 2003.

       it seems like their own form of propaganda. if he still is alive, he might be more useful as a secret kind of leverage, while the rest of the world thinks he is dead and that ISIS have the gaul to kill an American. i have no evidence to support it, so it is just a thought.

       because it could be seen as a direct attack on american citizens, and involved Syria, and claims of other journalists being held there, providing an impetus to repackage a Syrian intervention as a battle against IS and justice for killing americans as well as consolidating a new "generational threat" for American Defense spending and security state justification.
      </p>
      <p>
       why would IS make such a video sure to draw action against them while they're building their infrastructure and seeking markets for their assets? well, who trained and funded IS fighters? for what purpose? is this a proxy force mutiny? or an intentional balkanization scheme? these are the questions i like to ask.

       If he was in on the plan to fake the video then they get the footage they need. Then when they really behead him he doesn't blow the cover by giving anything away like "we had an agreement" or "Jeff wtf" with his last words.

       What if ISIS wasn't ones who faked the video?  It was never firmly established that Foley was ever in the custody of IS or an allied group, and the rescue operation that was mounted obviously never found them.
