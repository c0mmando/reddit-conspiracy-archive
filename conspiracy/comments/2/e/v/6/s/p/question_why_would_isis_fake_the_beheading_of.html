    <div class="md"><p>Because the powers that be need to maintain the illusion of consent. If &#39;they&#39; want a war in Syria but the people are overwhelmingly opposed, it limits their options. They can either submit to the will of the people (not get their way), or ignore the people, go to war anyways, and risk a revolution. TPTB <em>always</em> get their way, whether it takes a year or a century. They aren&#39;t worried about small or even medium-sized pockets of dissent. These can be managed and/or marginalized. However, they are terrified by the possibility of mass, organized opposition (whether physical or ideological). If 3/4 of the American population suddenly wake the fuck up and decide they&#39;ve had enough of the banksters and co-ordinate to throw them all in jail, TPTB will be forced to either abandon a system they have spent centuries putting in place, or resort to Plan B, which would be martial law and civil war. And despite how it might look, they really want to avoid Plan B, because there is a <em>significant chance they would lose</em>. Military and law enforcement might have a lot of fancy toys, but in terms of sheer numbers the people outnumber military and law enforcement 100-1, and have them outgunned at about 95-1. If the people ever get past their differences and unite against the government, they&#39;re gonna have a bad time. If/when they decide to start &#39;governing&#39; against the apparent will of the people, then they will have given away the game, shown their hand, and left themselves with only one option, Plan B. Which is why they work so hard to keep people at odds ideologically, with race, religion, sexuality, feminism, etc. It&#39;s why they crushed the Occupy movement so brutally, and blatantly displayed their authoritarian capability in Ferguson. It&#39;s why they try so hard to keep people afraid. Frightened people are easy to control, but angry people are not, and they are unpredictable. When the U.S. invaded Iraq in the aftermath of 9/11, people were so scared that they were willing to give the government carte blanche in the name of &#39;protecting us from terrorism&#39;. But when they tried to invade Syria last year on the heels of the fear created by the Boston Bombing, they realized at the 11th hour that going against the will of the people at that time would have created an anger that they weren&#39;t ready or willing to deal with. They followed the Iraq blueprint almost to a tee, and <em>had</em> to have realized that the public was starting to see through their bullshit. So, here we are a year later, with a new terrorist &#39;threat&#39; (ISIS, ISIL, IS, IL, whatever the fuck they&#39;re calling it today), a &#39;shocking&#39; beheading, and a seemingly plausible reason to get soldiers&#39; toes wet in Syria. Anyone with a modicum of common sense could have predicted the current situation a year ago, and are <em>sure as fuck</em> not fooled by it now. But that doesn&#39;t matter, because enough people have fallen for the plot hook, line, and sinker. There are millions of frightened people calling for boots on the ground and heads to roll. To borrow from Chomsky, they have manufactured consent. </p>

<p>TL;DR - Its easier and safer to con people into compliance than to force them into compliance.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an easy thing for most people to cut a man&#39;s head off, rather than the easy route of shooting him from a distance. I think the new guy probably couldn&#39;t do it, or at least not without possibly botching it on camera.</p>
