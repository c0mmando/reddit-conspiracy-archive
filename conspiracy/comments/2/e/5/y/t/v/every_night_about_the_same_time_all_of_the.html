<p>Tonight the live feeds went down about 12:30 AM (2:30A in Ferguson), the last two nights about the same time. It always seems to happen after the police spokesman holds his end of day press conference. Then all the feeds are gone.</p>

<p>And the last feed I was watching had craploads of cops in the street, swat vehicles, police lines, plenty of unhappy people milling around and then - poof, it was gone (<a href="http://www.livestream.com/civilianmediatv">http://www.livestream.com/civilianmediatv</a>). And all the rest of the live feeds too. Just off.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to screenshot, but this post went up on Twitter #Ferguson just about the same time I was wondering the same thing.</p>

<p>Irene Thompson ‚Äè@maccalled 56m</p>

<p>For about an hour, can&#39;t find a livestream of #Ferguson, and tweets are not current ones from the street. What&#39;s going on?</p>

<p>Anybody know anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No honestly I&#39;m serious. Both live Twitter tweets and all of the livestream videos from Ferguson have just ceased about 2:00 - 2:30AM Ferguson time, the last three nights I&#39;ve been watching.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it some kind of coincidence that all of the independent internet media seem to evaporate about the same time every night? And tonight (Tues Aug 21, early AM) when the livefeeds stopped, there were still plenty of people in the street and there had been a lot of unrest - then communications went gone.</p>

<p>I think there is a lesson to be taken from this. They own the internet more than we think they do. Much more. And unsurprisingly, the internet is more important to organizing protest than is television, so that when the livefeeds and the Tweets stop, the community is left to flail for itself. I have no idea what happened to all those people in the streets when the feeds went off, none.</p>

<p>And for illustrative purposes, I&#39;ve been watching all of these for days/and nights. About 2:00 AM every day they&#39;re gone (or reverted to previous recordings). All.of.them.</p>

<p>We talk here about how Turkey and Syria and Egypt, Ukrania and Thailand, etc attempt to control and throttle internet communications at times of protest and unrest, but nobody is talking about how it seems to be going on in America right here right now. I could only find one mention of it in an ActivistPost article, and even then the article <em>had no comments</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of it has to do with police driving the media into little pockets with no action as the night goes on. Once they look around and see nothing but media they go home, missing the fact that things have moved elsewhere. The few journalists that did follow were getting begged not to leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s when the action dies down (STL resident here). Last night for example was very calm, streamers packed it in around midnight, there were only maybe 1/3 the media outlets at the wrap up press conference compared to the prior night. Everyone is sleep deprived, they can use the break. Protestors included. It also rained, which helps calm things down.</p>
