       This is only the second time I've been banned from a subreddit. 
The first was SRS. 
I'm pretty proud of both.

       Honestly I wasn't trying to be a troll, though. But so it goes.

       Well, starting off by calling the OP and every user there "full of hate" was a very poor choice of words. So that started off things badly. And then "That's truly the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard one of you conspiratard-tards say." Come on! What sub WOULDN'T ban someone who said that?
      </p>
      <p>
       You then get hung up on JFK and 9/11 ("Just goes to show that the mainstream interpretation of history isn't always correct (coughJFKcough9/11coughcoguh)."), which could be considered "changing the subject", and then, when asked for sources, reply "No, I don't have any sources." Seriously? That's textbook trolling. You're going in there, flinging your excrement all over their walls and then wondering why you've been banned?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you call the con artists in AE911 "experts" ("It's what actual experts have to say that's important."). Jesus, dude. There are so many redacted comments after that I can't comment further, but how can you look back on all that and not see it from their view? It's trolling, plain and simple. Sorry you had to hear that, but you're not helping our cause going off like that.

       You shouldn't be upset. You should be proud of your ban and continuously skeptical. Don't ask people to tell you why you should be upset, determine for yourself if it's upsetting.

       They took in almost half a million dollars that year. What did it get spent on? Scientific studies? No. Billboards, DVDs, travel, calling for a new investigation, etc. Does that sound like a group that wants the truth about a national tragedy and potential false flag that could finally put those responsible behind bars and give the country back to the people?
      </p>
      <p>
       And it looks like the president of the tax-exempt, non-profit organization Richard Gage works a staggering 80 hours a week! It's probably due to to him counting all the hours traveling and talking at seminars that he set up. He does all that for the measly salary of...$85,000. Does THAT sound like a man who wants a quick investigation into 9/11 and a conclusion?

       How much more awareness could they possibly want to raise before they do something constructive?

       There's definitely parallels you could draw between them and Susan G Komen.

      <p>
       There's enough flipping awareness of 9/11 - they need to get on with it, and start showing solid evidence to back themselves up. Billboards and DVDs are not going to cut it.

       What's interesting about this it is the amount of publicity and reach they're achieving with a budget under $500,000. Shit I heard them on cspan the other week. TV and national radio for under a half a mil?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize how stuff works in the real world? Do you understand the concept of lobbying?
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for them to reach a wide audience of uninterested people they're going to have to spend a lot of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       And $85,000 for a non profit director salary is nothing compared to a for profits PR firm or Marketing dept. Stop trolling this person with your trolling questions and rigid opinions.

       So why are people donating money to him if he's just a marketing business? And did you see how there's more than $40,000 earmarked for "other salaries", despite everyone else mentioned as staff receiving no compensation? Where's THAT money going?
