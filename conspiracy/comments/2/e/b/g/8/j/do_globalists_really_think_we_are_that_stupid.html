<p>Do they really believe l think the American people are That stupid to not know the difference? </p>

<p>Now Obama administration is openly saying that they won&#39;t take bombing ISIS in Syria off the table, helping Assad, when less then 6 months ago they wanted to bomb Assad himself! </p>

<p>What, let me guess the decapitated heads were all Hollywood props or something? Sorry that is just is not plausible.</p>

<p>Plus people do realize that ISIS were against Asad, however they are always mentioned as only one of the groups against him.  There is no proof that the US has armed ISIS, if it had then why would ISIS have been so intent on taking war spoils from the Iraqi security troups?</p>

<p>So yeah until I see a legit, believable source claiming we armed and trained these guys, I will continue to simply the view the situation as &quot;complex&quot; with interests aligning in one region and not in Iraq.  Why is so implausible to happen?</p>

<p>See there&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong. There are many groups operating in the Syrian Civil War, nobody is advocating funding or arming ISIS.</p>

<p>Conflating the entire rebel umbrella with ISIS is wrong and misleading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Some of it probably is. I&#39;m not naive at all. </p>

<p>War is incredibly messy. A lot of ISIS&#39; current military hardware was captured from the Iraqi Army who got it from....the US Army! This sort of thing happens when you&#39;ve got a large bunch of yahoos trying to st up a new country based on ancient murderous bullshit.</p>

<p>Arming/funding Syrian &quot;Moderates&quot; may have been seen as the best choice, even if some of the equipment would end up back with al-Nusra etc. Trying to fund and arm moderates, because you see it as the best of a bad bunch of choices - doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be problems down the line.</p>

<p>Point is, there are hardly any &quot;good&quot; rebels, as you put it. A patchwork of various nasty and not so nasty groups fighting one very nasty man.</p>

<p>And the crazy thing is not we might have to give Assad a break because he&#39;s also fighting ISIS, and apparently doing a decent job of it. Again, awful awful choices. But definitely real and not the imaginary meddlesome puppet show OP seems to believe in. </p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the point. There&#39;s a wide umbrella of groups fighting Assad, of course it&#39;s more solidified now than a few years ago, but butchers like ISIS are not in the majority.  </p>

<p>His security forces regularly torture, kidnap and kill people for merely disagreeing with the regime. This was happening long before the war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He had protected Christians, and other minorities, he wears a suit and tie, and is very Western</p>

<p>He could have worn a fucking clown suit and been from Framingham and it wouldn&#39;t change anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So 6 months ago we wanted to bomb Assad, and now we want to bomb ISIS and help Assad out? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Nobody&#39;s looking to help Assad out. What <em>may</em> happen is coordination with Assad to fight ISIS more effectively. Yes that would be of benefit to Assad but the express purpose of this is not to &quot;help him out&quot;. This isn&#39;t a firm plan yet but it&#39;s a possibility. Triangular diplomacy is a pain in the arse most of the time. This time too.</p>

<p>What it is is a shitty situation. What it isn&#39;t is a joke. </p>

<p>Not the biggest chance of rebels being mistaken for ISIS, as ISIS is actually at war with an awful lot of the rebel groups as well as at war with Assad. </p>
