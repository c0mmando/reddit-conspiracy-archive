       This documentary is misinformation and propaganda at its finest. Its conclusion is not supported by the tidbits of information scattered throughout it and seeks to exploit the ignorance of the viewer. Its conclusion is sloppy and unclear where at times it seems to be making the sweeping generalization that all governments are bad(absurd thing to claim). Often times lumping Stalin's communist regimes, Hitler's Nazism, with our 21st century American government by showing images of them one right after another.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note while discussing the psychological experiments there is ominous music playing in the background meant to cloud your judgment on the nature and purpose of these experiments. The most egregious results of this “documentary” is the demonization of academia and especially the field of psychology. All of a sudden all these great advances in psychology were designed to “control and subordinate the masses” which is nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note that the “Dr” Colin Ross who pretty much narrates the last half of the documentary is a quack and moron spewing falsehoods. Not only is he not qualified to discuss the history or intentions of these programs he is describing he states obvious falsehoods. The most disgusting and idiotic one being that the standards that exist in the field of psychology are the same ones that existed during world war 2 and even as far back as ANCIENT ROME AND GREECE. The ethical standards that exist today are radically different then they were when the experiments depicted took place let alone ANCIENT ROME(it was like the filmmaker just gave up and threw this entire nutjob's interview on there. He is a nutjob by the way, he has convinced patients of his of satanic abuse during the whole scare, and he claims to have super powers. He states he can emit energy out of his eyes to disrupt electronics. The latter he tested to claim James Randi's million dollar prize and... failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is littered with out of context quotes by leading academics, filmmaker asserts that juvenile delinquency is not the product of shitty parenting and poverty, and that serial killers are not responsible for their murders, it is the government(it is not a surprise he does not go into much detail on this matter). Another interviewee who is on the fringes of his field says we should replace capitalism with this fantasy economic system that he does not go into much detail about. There is a reason he does not go into detail because he would have won a nobel prize in economics and be a millionaire if he could conceptualize a functioning sustainable economy that is as flowery as the interviewee wants in a world full of limited resources. It also discusses how education system is based on teaching kids how to function in a free market(be a commodity in this guys mind) and not what humans need in life. People need to feed their kids and need jobs to do that, so in order for people to thrive they need to be educated on the things that will produce them jobs. This guy is trying to dupe people who made shitty grades in school act like they can know something that the kids with good grades do not. It also lumps the government and private sector into one big label, “elites,” which robs people of the ability to critically think about the relationship between the two and identify good policy from bad policy when it comes to politicians actually producing things that WILL impact future and current generations. It exploits credible people's interviews, takes their interview out of context by creating their own message, and at the same time giving his own message credibility because of their presence. Oh my goodness look its Noam Chompsky, and Howard Zinn. There is a reason the filmmaker did not use more of their interview, it was because they did not support this morons message.
      </p>
      <p>
       This documentary tries to exploit people's ignorance of psychology, international relations, economics, politics, and a slew of rigorously examined, studied, and written about subjects. I can go on an on but these specific things but these particular things are what really stood out. I feel I am now dumber after watching this documentary and urge nobody watch this horrendous bag of misinformation.
      </p>

       Choose a better documentary for next week, this one was garbage.

       I have seen century of the self awhile back and they make similar assumptions. Yes the studies on the human mind(psychology) have and are being used by corporations to get you to buy things, and politicians use these studies to get elected(no shit).  Neoconservatives no longer have as much sway in American politics if you are following the rifts that exist in the republican party.  So many of Adam Curtis's thoughts are irrelevant and only related to Bush era politics.  Both documentaries make unsubstantiated claims and most importantly make horrendously over  simplified explanations for the cultural trends and that emerged throughout America's history.  Of course PR campaigns have existed to create support for the policies being fought for by politicians in office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would I delete my comment when all of my criticisms were of the Human Resources documentary and how it has no credibility.  The main interviewee of this documentary was responsible for the satanic abuse scare of the 90's(look into that if you are not familiar) and thinks he can emit energy out of his eyes.  Old quacks like that usually come out of the woodwork because they are old, lonely, and irrelevant.  Also a sloppy and broad conclusion is being made that can easily be fact checked by looking at what is on tv and why(ratings/profits not a vast conspiracy to make you complacent).  Which is more likely?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason why you don't attack my very specific criticisms of this documentary, because you can't.  The guy said the ethics that govern modern psychology are the same used in ANCIENT ROME for goodness sake. Credible and quality documentaries don't have morons like that expressing their worldview even though not a single interviewee's quotes outright described the filmmaker's conclusion which never happens in quality documentaries. Not even the crazy guy's interview explicitly implied the filmmakers conclusion, he was just giving a historical rundown of shady things that the CIA has done in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will delete my post if you can respond to my criticisms and explain to me how they are incorrect.  Something tells me you won't though.

       Ok, here we go. Why should you delete your comment and how it's connected with The century of the self. You referred to the documentary maker as a moron. This is the worst thing you said. The author has a personal connection to the atrocities he's speaking of. His Aunt was abused by this system and this documentary is his well researched attempt to try and understand the society that would do such things. 
                                                                                                                                "Often times lumping Stalin's communist regimes, Hitler's Nazism, with our 21st century American government by showing images of them one right after another."    ...if you listened to the words that accompanied the images you would have heard what they had in common and how the mechanisms employed to subvert democracy were the same as the ones used to subvert communism. Both systems originally intended to essentially protect and safeguard the working class from being exploited for the benefit of the land/factory owners. Which in turn would safeguard the land/factory owners from bloody revolution. Then they realised, you just need to make people think they have democracy, this is achieved by keeping the middle class happy/drugged/oversexed/weight obsessed/ignorant while demonising anybody who sees the truth, or is worst affected by the hypocrisy. You saw images of the Nazi's for many reasons- Not only did Nazi war criminal scientists escape justice through the CIA's project paperclip ... THEY WERE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THEIR RESEARCH ON AMERICAN SOIL ,ON AMERICAN PEOPLE, WITH AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS., also the documentary mentions the Rockerfellers massive investments in eugenics.
       <br/>
       Demonising academia? How can you justify the poisoning of 32,000 Americans?
      </p>
      <p>
       " It also lumps the government and private sector into one big label, “elites,” which robs people of the ability to critically think about the relationship between the two and identify good policy from bad".
       <br/>
       This comment ironically accuses the doc of doing what the education system does... Fails to teach people to think critically. That's all people really need to learn. Because then you can learn from anything, you'll be able to see through lies. If watching this made you feel dumber.. Your subconscious is trying to tell you something.

       You forgot to respond to any of my criticisms...
      </p>
      <p>
       Who cares if one of your relatives was subjected to some of these atrocious experiments, that does not give you the right to misinform and manipulate millions into believing your worldview.  If you make a documentary that goes out of its way to misinform the masses you are a moron and a shitty person.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...if you listened to the words that accompanied the images you would have heard what they had in common and how the mechanisms employed to subvert democracy were the same as the ones used to subvert communism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       None of which still exist today, this is one of the many criticisms that you ignored.  It just eludes to the government using television to control people without giving any examples... If they did give examples, you would see how farfetched and delusional they are.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then they realised, you just need to make people think they have democracy, this is achieved by keeping the middle class happy/drugged/oversexed/weight obsessed/ignorant while demonizing anybody who sees the truth, or is worst affected by the hypocrisy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You are falling for the mistake in thinking that the documentary wants you to.  You are categorizing both government and corporations as the "elite" or ruling powers.  It is only the profit driven private sector that is responsible for creating a culture of "obesity, drugs, oversexualization, and ignorance."  To allege that the government is responsible for deceiving the masses into embracing these things to prevent the people from seeing reality is counter to common sense and evidence.  If people are vain and materialistic it is because of the profit driven private sector(perfectly reasonable) not some incentive to deceive people's belief in democracy(why the hell that would be an incentive unless you are some cartoon villain).
      </p>
      <p>
       Private corporations seek profits and create marketing that causes people to overeat, be overly sexualized, and to consume their products. It has nothing to do with some vast conspiracy to keep people to vote against their interests. WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES OF THIS IN MODERN TIMES. THERE ARE NONE.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government actively tries to reduce obesity, reduce unwanted pregnancy, and to EDUCATE everyone.  There is no evidence or logic to prove your statements or else you would have provided it, instead of expecting me to just take your word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, there is no evidence of the type of manipulation depicted coming from the governments end.  This documentary is deceiving because it shows the horrendous experiments that the government did, and tries to associate past atrocities with what they COULD be doing now while giving NO EXAMPLES.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This comment ironically accuses the doc of doing what the education system does...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What are you talking about?  The U.S government provides free education to everyone who lives here even illegals.  They are educated on government(mandatory) and economics for FREE.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Demonizing academia? How can you justify the poisoning of 32,000 Americans?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That logically has nothing to do with one another.  Academia does not do things like this anymore... This documentary would have you believe that this is common place still, by providing the quote of that guy who believes he can control electronics with his eyes, stating that the ethical standards are the same now as in ANCIENT GREECE.  This filmmaker is a moron for leaving that part of the interview in and could not be further from the truth. There are ethical standards at universities all around the world that are top notch. The documentary just outright lies to the viewer in a moronic way... ANCIENT GREECE!!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there are mechanisms that force governments to behave a certain way at risk of not existing anymore. The biggest force being the "military arms race." If a foreign government can control the minds of your people then it is an actual security risk.  If a foreign government can decimate your population with a biological weapon, your own government must know the effects of certain agents and how to counter them. There was a time when the CIA was studying the occult, just in case there were actual powers that could be gained and used for an advantage in warfare.  The experiments by today's standards were atrocious but in a time where imminent non existence was a real threat because of the actions of a foreign governments, Nazi's and Cold War, they were necessary, which is why we kept many of the Nazi scientists.  It is best not to react to such things like an emotional child, but you should act like a rational and understanding adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that we know the minds of people cannot be controlled, all efforts, by all governments have seized and the main focus is going into the information going into the humans minds.  Again this documentary would have you believe that the government was successful in researching how the mind can be manipulated, when that could not be further from the truth. If the minds of people can be manipulated, ie Manchurian candidate, then that is a serious security risk.  We needed to know if that was possible in order to continue existing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have not responded to any of my criticisms and would prefer to live in world where things are black and white.  This documentary maker does not know what he is talking about do not give him any special trust just because he made a documentary, ANYONE CAN MAKE A DOCUMENTARY.
      </p>
      <p>
       Academia is a sacred institution that produces knowledge of reality that allows us to better human civilization. It is not this thing that this documentary presents. Serious academics on the subjects discussed in this film would laugh at this documentary at the amount of spin and misinformation being propagated there in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again the effects of profit driven marketing on culture and society is not evidence of the government manipulating the masses. Please think critically and don't trust documentary makers just because they are documentary makers and are confirming something you read off this guys blog, of whom is equally as uneducated as the person reading his material.  Shit is complicated and does not fit into easily understood categorizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would appreciate if you responded to my main criticisms of the film so that we can have a rational discussion of the validity of the conclusions made with in it.  I get the feeling you won't be able to do this for one reason or another....ANCIENT GREECE!!! Come on.

       Nice rebuttal of my criticisms.  I'll assume you just ignored them because willful ignorance is your thing because that is what your dismissive "lol" is a real manifestation of.  I am presenting facts that bring into question the credibility of the documentary and you don't care clearly.  That is the definition of willful ignorance.

       Manufacturing Consent, The Corporation, Outfoxed
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturing Consent is based on Chomsky's book of the same and has credible data and evidence gathering to support the conclusions being argued for while providing a good understanding about possible bias from any media source.  There is a reason why this book/documentary is studied in university journalism and political science curriculums around the world. Important to know if you want to understand how the main stream media actually operates which is contrary to the unsubstantiated assumptions held by most people on this subreddit.  This system of understanding how media functions is essential to understanding the world around us and the degree to which we can understand the policies being made guiding foreign and domestic policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another awesome documentary that is not bull shit is The Corporation, which shows why corporations do what they do and explores their natures.  I'll give you a hint on what motivates corporations behavior, it is to make profits, not depopulate the earth like so many here think.  This documentary single handedly got me to switch my major from business oriented to political science and philosophy.  This documentary goes into the specifics on how and why corporations interact with policy making insititutions which is important to understand if you care a bout the quality of life of your kids and future generations(I assume most people here actually care about these things unless they are only here to feel like they are doing something and that they know something special that others don't).
      </p>
      <p>
       Many documentaries come from people who actually believe the things they are arguing for, many are simply uneducated people exploiting other people's ignorance of a subject matter to make a living off of.  Jesse Ventura hit the nail on the head when he asked David Icke about how much money he has made off his theories of lizard people.   These self righteous doomsday proclaimers make millions and they know what they are doing because it takes a lot of conscious effort to use that many logical fallacies and rhetorical techniques to make bull shit sound true.  They know they have not read the things you would need to read in order to be qualified to make the claims that they do such as history, international relations, economics, political science, anthropology, etc. Much like this documentary that pretty much shows 20 mins of historical facts followed by a 2 minute of unsubstantiated interpretation of what all those historical facts mean from beginning to end.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you notice not a single  person here has responded to my very specific criticism of this documentary, and appear to be in a state of self imposed, or willful ignorance.  Confirmation bias is a bitch and shit is more complicated than what most of these documentaries can ever simplify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outfoxed is an incredible documentary on what real propaganda looks like.  Conservative media sources are textbook propaganda in the sense they are paid by big money interests to demonize any regulation and all government. This belief system also conveniently is co-opted by many conspiracy theorists.  Of course corporations want the masses to think that any government is bad and that we should be opposed to any government  regulations.  The realities are that most regulations have the greater good in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, don't take anyone's word for it, ANYONE can make a documentary.  Think for yourself. Look at the facts they present, the logic they use, and see if their conclusion follow.  Most of these bull shit documentaries use music to short circuit your logical part of the brain, and to get you to feel fear or as if great peril is around the next corner.  Don't get me wrong, music is an essential part of documentaries, but they are only good if they match the evidence and the argument being made. Not to get you to stop thinking and to get you emotional to cloud your judgement.

       Science, though, has no morals or ethics. We place them there to safeguard against certain tragedies, but to get the best breakthroughs, no moral qualms will be had. I think it is a sad truth behind science to find what aids and what hinders humans.

       You are limiting your options to only humans. I am not, there is science without humans, and just because human sentience gives us the potential to do great harm or great good does not mean that those traits are inherent to science.

       I believe what he is trying to say is that the universe spins on whether humans are involved or not and when it comes to evolution for example, ethics and morality have nothing to do with it. Survival of the species is based on cold, hard realities.

       Sigh. Humans subjectively do what they want. Humans conducting science do what they subjectively want. Science all by itself, without humans, does not have morals or ethics, because science is objective. I do not see how this concept is hard to grasp.

       Watched it last night. Great movie, not nutty like a lot of the conspiracy theory documentaries out there.

       The music used in the documentary is used to create a false context and to make the viewer make false connections where none can be presented in an objective fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are praising a technique that is being used to manipulate you into having inaccurate beliefs.  That makes no sense. You will notice quality documentaries don't have misleading music playing in the background while rather benign images are being depicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you not see the use of music as tool for propaganda and spreading misinformation?  The music is only there to prevent you from being objective... Unless you like being willfully deceived your praise for this aspect of this documentary is baffling.
      </p>
      <p>
       This documentary was nutty.  The last 4 minutes it implies the government is using the tv to control people... After spending 2 hours discussing the shadier side or government programs and psychological experiments trying to get the viewer to think the government is still doing things like that in the 21st century.  Misinformation at is finest.

       Century of Self, on steroids. How "Science" evolved into human manipulation (social engineering), eugenics, experimentations (including insights into MK-ULTRA and what might've countinued from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is much more disturbing that CoS, yet eye opener.

      <p>
       Favorite part: How Human Resources were applied into the manufacturing scene as a means to drive workers into compliacency, simply by taking in their suggestions (participation) even if such suggestions were never meant to be implemented .... voting

       This doco is awesome, was one of the first ones I watched when starting to look into social engineering - it's a great place to start. I found a lot of the info on corbettreport.com related to social engineering, mind control etc. is a good place to go after this doco!

       The music used in the documentary is used to create a false context and to make the viewer make false connections where none can be presented in an objective fashion.

       You are praising a technique that is being used to manipulate you into having inaccurate beliefs.  That makes no sense. You will notice quality documentaries don't have misleading music playing in the background while rather benign images are being depicted.

       How can you not see the use of music as tool for propaganda and spreading misinformation?  The music is only there to prevent you from being objective... Unless you like being willfully deceived your praise for this aspect of this documentary is baffling.

       This documentary was nutty.  The last 4 minutes it implies the government is using the tv to control people... After spending 2 hours discussing the shadier side or government programs and psychological experiments trying to get the viewer to think the government is still doing things like that in the 21st century.  Misinformation at is finest.
