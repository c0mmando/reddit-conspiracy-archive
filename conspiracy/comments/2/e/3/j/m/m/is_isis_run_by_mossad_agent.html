<p>&#39;Snowden added that the American CIA and the British Intelligence collaborated with the Israeli Mossad to create a terrorist organization that is able to attract all extremists of the world to one place, using a strategy called “the hornet’s nest”.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This makes sense, but it would seem logical that ISIS would be connected to the Mossad. Especially since their caliphate (Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi) is a shady and unknown character.</p>

<p>The Zionist regime and terrorist existence lives on conflict, they started the recent Sunni/Shia sectarian violence during the first Gulf War (between Saddam&#39;s Iraq and Iran). They supplied Shia Iran with weapons to weaken Iraq - at the time a strong Arab and Sunni-run country. Weakening the Sunnis or Shias gives Israel a win-win scenario since whoever is left will be exhausted from the conflict and they could easily face and defeat them.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the vast majority of the Arab and Muslim World do not recognize Israel (apart from Egypt and Jordan - they all call the region Palestine, even in Egypt and Jordan the people oppose the existence of Israel). Right now the strongest threats to Israel are : Iran, the Muslim Brotherhood (weakened by the replacement of ex-President Morsi with the dictator-puppet General Al-Sisi in Egypt), Hamas, and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>By creating an extremist crazy Sunni group like ISIS it would put pressure on Iran and Hezbollah to fight them and in the process create a stronger divide between Muslims.</p>

<p>Also, it is important to note that the Israeli regime has always backed an independent Kurdish state in Iraq. Kurdish regions are rich in oil, and with the backing of the Israelis they can be lured to leave the united Arab and Muslim resistance to Israel and establish an ally to Israel in the region.</p>

<p>Its all very devious and evil, but sadly the Muslims and Arabs are falling for it. I hope they wake up before its too late. The close relationship between Hamas (Sunnis) and Hezbollah and Iran (Shia), terrifies the Israeli regime and they need ISIS to destroy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of I&#39;m seeing Snowden being used to &quot;leak&quot; all kinds of stuff, so I dunno about that.</p>

<p>2nd, although things like ISIS being run by the Mossad brings invaluable geopolitical advantages to Israel and thus provide its own motivation, it has scant to little proof.</p>

<p>There was a Moroccan Times article alleging this, and a separate whatsupic article that had a Dutch security official as a source as well.</p>

<p>I suppose I&#39;m not immediately buying it because I don&#39;t trust the sources, which is what most of this speculation comes down to.
And I suppose, that&#39;s the real tragedy of our new current digital era, the abundance of information coupled with the dissolution of trust. </p>

<p>I even wonder if this state of affairs has been brought about intentionally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone see the irony and the effectiveness of this strategy if true.</p>

<p>How clever to wage a jihad that has extremist Muslims from all over thee world going to Iraq to fight and die.</p>

<p>What better way to rid your country of terrorists by giving them the chance to get what they want in the middle east. When they get too out of line and too big for their briches send in the drones to level them and keep them contained where you want them.</p>

<p>Thanks to the NSA finding these extremist types is probably very easy. Then they have an agent make contact with them pretend to be some holy man fill the suspects heads with thoughts of a Muslim caliphate and send them to the middle east to go die in their holy war thus leaving the usa or Canada or britian or Israel or Australia or wherever these foreign fighters are from free of the threat these extremists pose to their home country.</p>

<p>So very clever. Probably why Obama has not went in and crushed these fools yet.</p>

<p>Isis is a cia /mossad honeypot trap for terrorists.</p>
