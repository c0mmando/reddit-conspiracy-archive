       All this stuff has come out yet there is no official story of Darren Wilson.
      </p>
      <p>
       First he didnt know about the robbery, then now maybe he could have seen the cigars and thought Mike Brown was the robber.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the autopsy comes out so we know the number of shots and where they hit Mike, so Darren can spin his story to fit that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a tape of the shots being fired with a delay in the middle. NOW, he gets time to come up with a story to account for the delay.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it possible that he can just sit there and watch all this stuff come out so he can have a tailor made story that fits around all the evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of stuff leads me to believe whatever he says will line up and "make sense"regardless of if it is true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why arent more people talking about this? There is no transparency.

       Maybe you missed the part where he killed someone? This isn't a "who dun it" case of figuring out if a crime was committed. Homicide has been committed and we already know by whom.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a matter of
       <em>
        justifying
       </em>
       that homicide at this point, which I cannot possibly see happen given the lack of any effort by the officer (no incident/use of force report, no dispatcher radio call in, no EMS, nada).
      </p>
      <p>
       If this had been someone with a concealed carry permit, they'd have been arrested. The sad part is a badge gets you out of this and lets you fabricate evidence.

       I didn't miss that part. But courts should, because they can't be prejudiced. And that's why he should be silent at this point. Which is his right.

       You're not a fan of innocent until proven guilty, then? It's exactly a case of of figuring out if a crime, and which one, was committed before he's judged guilty in a court.

       Start at the beginning. He didn't complete his routine incident report that is supposed to be filed after any interaction with a civilian where a police officer witnesses a crime. Probably because the first person he spoke with was a fellow officer on the scene who told him to get a lawyer and not complete the report. That lawyer probably told him to keep his mouth closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of off-the-record conversations happening right now in the police department to make sure that
       <em>
        Wilson's memory
       </em>
       matches all the physical evidence, witness testimony, videos, images, etc. They are manufacturing testimony behind closed doors.

       But this is DEAD wrong. He is NOT a suspect of anything. There was no crime as far as the cops go.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a cop that had an incident and and has failed to file a police report on said incident. Its like any other incident a cop is involved in. They file a report in a reasonable manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       By waiting to file a report and choosing to hide behind a line of cops, hide behind his badge he is refusing to put his word as a cop to record. Hell, we didnt even know his name for nearly a week. Is THIS the America you want to live in?  Where a public official can kill someone, not have his name revealed and have no report filed? Because its only going to get worse.

      <p>
       I imagine if Mike Brown was white we would be having a very different conversation.

       Some of you people have no iidea how frustrating it is that you will seemingly be against injustice, but only selectively. White males who refuse to defend the rights of black males in the same fucking boat as them. It makes you traitors to your people. The AMERICAN people.

       Every interaction between civilian and police can lead to investigation and prosecution of a police officer, from simple traffic stop to homicide. The purpose of law enforcement is to enforce the law, so they are granted authorities. One of the guidelines that must be followed to retain these authorities is to provide accurate justification as to why any action was taken against a civilian (i.e. an incident report, other paperwork, communications, chains of custody, collection of evidence - and all of this information is supposed to exist for the fair trial of the
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       suspect - the civilian).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a police officer arrests someone for loitering, and the suspect says "I'm going to sue you for this, I'm gonna make sure you're prosecuted for misconduct", and then the officer says I plead the fifth and refuses to complete the incident report of what led to the arrest and even concealed the incident itself - that is dereliction of duty. It's misconduct in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr:
       </strong>
       A cop is not a civilian when he's acting under color of law, just as his free speech is limited, so is his right to remain silent (if he wants to keep his job) because his silence is counter-intuitive to his ultimate purpose: a trustworthy witness for the State. You can't have cops going around fining, arresting and assaulting civilians if they don't provide justification.

       Let me try to clarify:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         I know every person has the right to remain silent, including law enforcement officers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         However, I think a person does not have the
         <strong>
          right to keep their job
         </strong>
         for exercising the right to remain silent, especially if not remaining silent is paramount to the employment.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm fully respecting the Constitution. There is no amendment that reads:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The right of an employee, to remain gainfully employed, shall not be infringed by the employer, even upon employee refusing to complete the tasks agreed upon by both employee and employer.

       And the crazy thing is, I am sure most people here know this, but for some reason they are acting stuck on stupid with all this free speech nonsense for cops. Its a shame that you even have to state what you did, but I am happy you did. They automatically jump to defending the cop. I think it goes like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       white cop black shot - defend cop
white cop white shot - defend shot
black cop white shot - defend shot
black cop black shot - defend shot
      </p>
      <p>
       and the sad part of THAT is that 99% of these case are white cop black shot.  Sigh.

       There was no automatically defending the white cop, you must have been watching the news and living on a different planet if you think that's true. there was automatic support for MB and villainization of this police officer, who ABSOLUTELY has the right to remain silent and I can guarantee that in this case his attorneys have demanded that he remain silent. It also contaminates the witness statements for them to release certain info before the investigation is completed. Some people must be trying to be willfully ignorant of these facts in order to continue their evil cop narrative. It seems too many peoples here have this strange view of lynch mob justice vs. trying to figure out how the law actually works. Trying to say that he mishandled the incident by not "filing a routine report" is also bogus because the case was almost immediately turned over to the FBI for investigation, so it does NOT mean that he therefore gives up his right to remain silent (how would that make sense??). Is NOBODY here going to mention how because he has been getting death threats and so much violence has occurred "protesting" the shooting...he is even MORE entitled to hide and stay silent. So the very people demanding transparency are the people who are giving him justification to be in hiding. Maybe if people hadn't of lost their crap and starting looting and burning down buildings things would be a little different.

       The news media's already made their minds up and they're not going to listen to what anyone else has to say on the matter.  Even if it is the cop who shot the kid. It doesn't matter.  He's white, kid's black, obviously it was a racist shooting, Al Sharpton said so, end of story, go back to bed now.

       Something I was saying two weeks ago when the witnesses went on, why? Its well within his rights to not speak to the public is it not? Why would you tell your version when the defense is going to be watching and writing defenses for what you say? Perfectly fine in my opinion for him not to speak.  Why tell your whole defense on national tv when its not in court

       He's supposed to follow protocol and file an incident report. He doesn't even need to give the entire version of events, but having nothing written down in a report that is MANDATORY for officers to fill out after having an interaction with a civilian seems fishy.

       It's a sound strategy to take penalty for 1. if it helps you defend against 2.

       I agree that he deserves due process and a fair trial. I also agree with the fact that if you exercise your rights you don't automatically have something to hide. However for a police officer to avoid the incident report is sketchy. I'm not saying he's guilty, he very well may have had a reason on why he shot Brown. But without the incident report there is no way to know if he had a reason to or not. The fact that he may be going to court over this ordeal should not matter. He's a police officer. He has duties he is supposed to uphold and for not upholding them he should be suspended without pay for now. It is sickening what this country has turned into.

       Because HIS LAWYERS would obviously advise him to not talk because a) it could effect the investigations and b) that isn't how our justice system works. you don't just use mobs to demand answers on your own bogus timeline, while also wreaking havoc on a Ferguson and putting out death threats. This crap has gotten so out of control that they obviously want to make sure the investigation is thorough because it will be put under a lot of criticism, and clearly some people have made up their minds without knowing the facts and no amount of evidence will change their opinion. Total ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       and what do you mean why is nobody talking about this? EVERYONE has been talking about this WAY too much from the beginning. why is nobody talking about the other people who have gotten killed by police while being unarmed, or the people who have died from black on black violence, or all the people who were injured during the rioting???

       And of course he shouldn't even provide any story at all. Giving your own version to police will only ever make things worse for yourself.
      </p>

       <em>
        Even if you are innocent and are telling the truth
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It just opens your story to be contested by prosecution. If you give no story at all, there will only be the (probably) conflicting accounts from witnesses, which opens reasonable doubt. If you decide to speak, your version will be (probably) conflicting and you will seem more guilty because the prosecution can point to your "lies", even if it's the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally people should remember that they
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       have to speak to police. They will try something like "you aren't even a suspect" or "you're obstructing investigation", but you can never know when you will become a suspect and remaining silent is not obstruction.

       Darren Wilson doesn't have to talk to the press.  He has to talk to his attorney, investigators and his superiors.

      <p>
       Anything he says to the press or releases to the press is going to be spun and misinterpreted.  It's not in his best interest to release anything.  I think he's playing it smart by not talking.

       Everybody in town knows the cop was innocent and Mike Brown was a piece of shit that started it.  He won't even be indicted at the State level.  It will take a Fed indictment with Holder and even then nothing will come of it.  The evidence is clear Mike Brown attacked him and tried to take his gun.  The society is better off with him dead.  All he was going to do was start making babies he won't support and sucking up welfare just like his parent(s).

       Half the people that replied are being idiots saying "dur dur he needs to remain silent thats what you do when confronted by the police" - He IS the police! Its his JOB to file an incident report as soon as possible after an incident to get it all on record for his protection and the protection from him. So that stuff like this does not happen where stories can be changed etc. We as citizens dont have to file reports. COPS do. For his own personal preservation it makes sense to not file his report until more facts come out and he can make sure his ducks are in a row, but doing so under the color of law is actually not really legal. Additionally, its interesting to see so many people in this sub immediately go to defend Wilson, a cop, from possibly being a part of this police state that is a big issue on this board. And then also go and be all extra racist against blacks making stupid statements. You motherfuckers cant have it both ways. "The police state is real but only when it applies to police attacking whites. If they attack blacks, then good". Like, get the fuck out of here with that sentiment.
       <br/>
       If I dont know any better I would just think YOU were part of the group sent here to divide us even more. But nah, I just think you are really that stupid.

       I never said anything of the sort.  I'm saying it's widely accepted here in the local media that Mike Brown had it coming based on his behaviors.  It has nothing more to do with racism or anything like that.  I am certainly not supporting police brutality against minorities just because I think in this case the cop was innocent.  The Media have an agenda to spread and they aren't interested in the truth, at the personal expense of the cop and his family and their safety.

       Some of the most ignorant comments I've ever seen are in this thread. Shocking to see so many people think that a police officer has the authority to act under color of law and simultaneously the right to remain silent (i.e. doesn't have to complete the necessary paperwork associated with civilian incident reports, etc). Absolutely stupid.

       Actually we DO know hie hasnt filed a report. The Brown family would actually be able to request it and there is nothing. As Hawk also said, the cops also admitted that he didnt file it.

       They will retroactively come up with something though, signed and dated before that audio tape and twitter account of what happened came out and no one will be able to prove otherwise.

       Nah, just you. You are a dickhead racist loser. Just you. But there are many like you. You come to this board because you believe there are issues with how the governing elite control us, you understand the workings of the police state, but you stop short of defending black males who are on the front lines of these atrocities. People that are just like you. People who ARE you. For this, you are worse than a regular racist. They are mostly just stupid and ignorant. But you, you understand the ills of society, at least enough to have sought out this place. But even with that knowledge you let your racism control you. You let them control your brain and even your heart. Makes you a coward and a traitor to the American people.

       No need. your words speak for themselves. Keep thinking people don't understand coded language tho. You are not nearly as intelligent as you think. Your smug demeanor is hilarious.

Lastly, he hasnt been charged with anything! You cant pick and choose when to do your job as an officer, but his superiors are letting him because they dont want his report getting ripped apart. They probably told him lets just wait until everything comes out then write it. They are stretching the "reasonable time to file" in this case and we all know it. No matter how big the attention is on the case, the report is still the report. He still takes the same time to write it and file it. The family should already be able to see the report but they have not because it does not exist. So its like the situation does not even exist yet as an official record. How do you not see the problem with that? A cop hiding behind his cops when he does something. Why would this sub NOT be against that no matter if the guy was innocent or guilty? All these excuses for a cop are killing me right now.

       I don't get why you were downvoted. You are 100% correct, and any reader of this sub should remember what you said, because it applies to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       You never gain anything from talking to police, and it is very possible you make things worse for yourself. Only talk to your lawyer.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's very good vids on youtube that explain all the possible scenarios, and why it is bad to talk to police in any of them:
      </p>
      <p>
       You're guilty and tell a lie
      </p>
      <p>
       You're guilty and tell the truth (you doofus)
      </p>
      <p>
       You're innocent and tell a lie (happens more often than you would believe)
      </p>
      <p>
       You're innocent and tell the truth
      </p>
      <p>
       Every scenario is worse for you than not speaking to cops. Strangely enough.

       People forget their rights in this country.  Thats why they go away.  They have fallen into this mentality that if you don't talk, you must be guilty and not talking is a sign of guilt.  That whole BS nonsense the NSA says "if you aren't guilty, you shouldn't be worried about the spying"

       Yeah, I don't know why the downvotes, but what I wrote is pretty accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The justice system is not actually fundamentally fucked: the jury of peers is a pretty good system. It's the later additions and changes that made the system unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Namely, mandatory sentencing minimums that mean the prosecutor has unfair negotiation leverage in most cases, and prohibitive costs of jury trials for the defendant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those things mean that 90% of court cases are plead guilty. But if you can afford a decent lawyer and only talk to him, the system is one of the best in the world.

       He doesn't owe you or anyone else an explanation at this time. He is entitled to defend himself and to use his right to silence. That would include not making any statements that could be taken out of context or that will most definitely be tried in a court of public opinion and poison the jury pool.
      </p>
      <p>
       He shouldn't say a word other than what is required for his law enforcement report or until he is on a stand and his attorney thinks it is ok to testify.

       He is a white cop, so

       rights matter, but Mike Brown does not even get to go before a court of law. Darren Wilson was the judge, jury and executioner.

       Michael Brown's rights do matter. Which is why this entire event with Wilson is taking place. If Brown's rights were violated, if Wilson did not act in self defense, then it will be determined and appropriate action taken. There is literally nothing else to do. We can't bring Brown back to life and it wouldn't be just to execute Wilson if he IS NOT guilty.

       I did not say Michael Brown's former rights should not matter. That being said, the fact is his rights at the time did not matter at all, he got shot at least 6 times and is dead now.

       He's owes the PD an explanation because it's homicide without evidence it was in self-defense. His actions afterwards pretty much prove it was a crime of passion (murder). Not calling for an EMS after shooting someone? Not filing a report? Are you kidding me...

       We don't know ANY of that yet. We don't know what their investigations are revealing. They are not releasing information that is vital to the neutrality of the case. I marvel every day at how stupid people are. Like, if you don't understand how the judicial process works, go learn, or just be quiet and watch it unfold.

       You are so dumb. The instant the officer fired his weapon, it was no longer a routine incident report kind of situation. Once Brown was deceased, that same thought applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know their standard response to an officer shooting incident. You have no fucking clue what transpires in their department or how it is handled.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the video of Brown, it has nothing to do with whether they release information pertinent to their investigation of the officer. There are no charges being filed in the store robbery.

       I don't care what "criminal history" he has, that does not preclude you from a fair trial (or a trial at all). That's not how the justice system works, police are not judge, jury, and executioner in the streets.
      </p>

       Adam Lanza can come out in full tactical gear after shooting up a movie theater with a rifle, and surrender to the police without issue. Mike Brown was jaywalking and gets shot 6+ times while being unarmed...

       From what information we have,
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is the reason Darren Wilson stopped/approached Mike Brown -- jaywalking. He was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       responding to a robbery/shoplifting call. This is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the other facts:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Mike Brown was roughly 6'4 and 300 lbs.
       </li>
       <li>
        Mike Brown was found dead in the street, ~35ft from the police cruiser.
       </li>
       <li>
        Mike Brown suffered six gunshot wounds total.
       </li>
       <li>
        The last two gunshot wounds were in the head, one at the top of the head (likely fatal).
       </li>
       <li>
        Mike Brown's body has no gun powder residue (meaning no close quarter gunfire).
       </li>
       <li>
        There was no police report filed by Darren Wilson.
       </li>
       <li>
        There was no use of force report filed by Darren Wilson.
       </li>
       <li>
        There was no EMS ever dispatched to either Darren Wilson or Mike Brown.
       </li>
       <li>
        Dispatch recordings show that Darren Wilson never called in the stop nor the incidents following it.
       </li>
       <li>
        Mike Brown's body laid in the streets for over 4 hours before being picked up by a police SUV.
       </li>
       <li>
        Audio surfacing shows at least 10-11 shots were fired, with a brief pause in between volleys.
       </li>
       <li>
        Darren Wilson's previous police precinct was dissolved due to misconduct and racism.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So you tell me what conclusions I should reach?

       . OP believes the distance from the vehicle to the body was more like 150ft. I verified within a couple feet the location of the body. I haven't been able to find a source to verify the officer's car though.

       FBI UCR stats show that white on white is the same. It's about 90% whites killing other white people. Not about racism as much as it is about holding police to a higher standard than gang members.

       That is patently false and was proven in Ferguson. The violence and chaos was directly proportional to the level of police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Riot police in their militarized hardware caused the biggest problems of all. The following days where it was just state police in standard uniforms it was much more tame. Riot police come back out, it gets worse. They go away, it gets better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you're going to say that "they were deployed in response to.." but that's bogus. If you say that I know for a fact you did not watch any of it live because I did and that's not what happened at all. Police were the aggressors every time, even to the media. That's why several officers have been suspended/fired due to their overly hostile behavior to citizens and media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police did
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       do shit for the small businesses. Looters were
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       arrested and police did not answer calls from businesses. A large majority (~90%) of the arrests were from "failure to disperse." The protestors themselves did more to stop looting than the police did.
      </p>

       You can spout whatever bullshit you want, but all of the facts and events say otherwise so keep it coming and I'll shoot it down.

       Maybe its because theres higher percentage of black people in poverty? Its more like poor on poor crime. Id love to see how its their blackness that causes them to be violent.. Seems more of an education, culteral and economic thing. Youre not going to get me on the bandwagon of hating eny specific group of people.

       Ferguson is not dangerous. Saying that it is dangerous because it is black
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a racist statement. Black on black crime is just as rampant as white on white crime. Don't believe it? Go look at the FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCR).
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops are acting like jackboot thugs there. Black on black crime is largely due to gang violence, which is not the case in Ferguson. Actually, the first homicide all year in Ferguson was the murder of Mike Brown.
      </p>
      <p>
       All your statement says is how racist and ignorant you are. Not all black neighborhoods are dangerous just like not all white ones are safe. Quit being obtuse and generalizing.

       You are so dumb. The instant the officer fired his weapon, it was no longer a routine incident report kind of situation. Once Brown was deceased, that same thought applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know their standard response to an officer shooting incident. You have no fucking clue what transpires in their department or how it is handled.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the video of Brown, it has nothing to do with whether they release information pertinent to their investigation of the officer. There are no charges being filed in the store robbery.
