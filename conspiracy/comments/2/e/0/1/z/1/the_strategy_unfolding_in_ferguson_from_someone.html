       The "violence" has been strategically provoked every night by the police. It is clear that every time the police make a military line with their military vehicles it agitates the peaceful protesters. Every, night like clockwork, around 9pm the cops make their pissing line. And every night the crowd grows in front of them. And every night at some point for a ridiculous reason, like a thrown water bottle, or any excuse,  they then order the crowd off the street or back. When the crowd doesn't comply they then start with the tear gas and rubber bullets. And only after this police aggression the crazy stuff happens. Never before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night was a little different. They played their same strategy. Peaceful protest with one or 2 obvious agitators and a whole lot of media. A plastic water bottle got thrown, they ordered everyone off the street and started up with the noise weapon. It was obvious to everyone there from their previous pattern they were going to start with the tear gas. But this time all the media  put themselves in between the the military line and the protester, because they knew what was going to happen. This made them pause for long enough for the alderman and some other community leaders to get the crowd onto the side walk to comply with the order. They couldn't use their strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the MRAP shoots past the protesters and flanks them from the back and several cops and another vehicle go in and grab someone that wasn't completely on the side walk.  But the community leaders would not allow these provocation tactics to provoke the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       So some vehicles shot down the road out of the view of all the cameras and then you see in the distance a bunch of tear gas and hear rubber bullets being shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that starts it again. The MSN starts to report the thrown plastic water bottles as moltov cocktails. And the narrative starts to be set yet again.

       There have been a few fires reported in streets where the media was kicked out. There was a picture on a vice tweet, a small fire in the street,presumably by a molly.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also a molly thrown on the first night of curfew at the Asian restaurant, I saw that. A lot of people rushed to stomp it out
      </p>
      <p>
       But in reference to Molotov's thrown at police line, not one. I've watched it to.

       Why dont all of us cop haters help our brothers in Ferguson but driving down there and occupying all of the sidewalks. No one in the street, no one even look at the cops. Face away from them. We can win this peacefully, or at least make it as clear as possible to the rest of the population who the agitators truly are.

       Although I like your enthusiasm, you can see this is an orchestrated strategic provocation. At least that was the message I was trying to convey. There is an agenda going on here, and that agenda requires civil unrest. With the media in their pocket they can justify and demonize anything.

       There was live fire last night. That line of vehicles speeding away from the police line was headed towards shots fired.

       Good analysis. But there is a curfew. A fucking curfew. People aren't supposed to be in the streets at night, and police are instructed to disperse people. Not that I agree with their tactics and rapidly escalating situations...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be far more concerned when incidents like this start occurring during the day at peaceful protests.
