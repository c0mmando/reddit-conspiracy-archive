         gets deleted when it has more than 3000 votes and 3000 commets. Excuse: misleading title. Real reason: it challenged the US-Israel official narrative from a strong moral platform (holocaust survivors and descendants condemning Israel operation in Gaza).

         Since today, subthreads which hit a certain amount of downvoted are completely closed, blocking any further discussion. This only reinforces mainstream point of views and punishes "unpopular" thinking. Also makes non-mainstream opinions a lot more vulnerable to vote brigading (and there is a lot of it in politically sensitive issues on that sub).

         Mods are now deleting threads in such a fashion that the original posters still believes his thread is up. Only if you ask another user or log on from a different account you realize your thread has been deleted. Clear bad faith and shady behavior.

       post something there and see if it sticks. It basically means any news story that is not from a blog. even small news sources like youtube channels. The content must be recent world news and it must have no pornography. That is all. You can editorialize if you want as long as the story and source are good. We don't delete anything unless it is from a blogsite, or porn. The subscribers decide to let something live or to kill it. As it should be.

       I saw a headline on the front page a few minutes ago that made me think we should start a sub called DebunkWorldNews. Post up a story that seems like bullshit and then others can come in and pick it apart or support the msm article with evidence and we can get closer to the truth.

        gets deleted when it has more than 3000 votes and 3000 commets. Excuse: misleading title. Real reason: it challenged the US-Israel official narrative from a strong moral platform (holocaust survivors and descendants condemning Israel operation in Gaza).

       The reason for removal was valid. It was not 225 survivors, it was a total of 225 survivors
       <em>
        and their descendants
       </em>
       , which is a very different thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can make up whatever explanations or excuses you want, but they were right to remove it.

       That's just an innacuracy on the tittle that could have been corrected with a flair, not by deleting a thread with 3000 comments.

       It was deleted when resubmitted with the correction too.

       Most of what I've written in the last week has never been seen on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of that was right here on r/conspiracy.

       When I post something, with important  links,  I have the capacity to realize the links are important to the conversation at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       When  less salient  and detailed  material rises to the top I can also tell that it isn't being seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       That has been confirmed.

       Last week I commented on a post  that was about reddit being in cahoots with the CIA

       It's crazy how they censor stuff like that but leave a LOT of racist and anti-Semitic stuff up. There's got to be a solution.

       If they prove reddit is racist and anti-Semitic, then they can continue to accuse people they don't agree with of being racist and anti-Semitic.
