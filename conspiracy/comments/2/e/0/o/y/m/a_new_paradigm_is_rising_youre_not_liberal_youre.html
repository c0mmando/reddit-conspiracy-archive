       It's happening everywhere, but it's most concentrated in places like
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       and the media and powers that be don't know how to "box it in".
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not reactively part of identity politics like Independents once were. You don't even see the liberal/conservative as relevant to the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you see happening right here in
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       is what's (more slowly) happening around the country. It's amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be an individual interested how politics works without participating in the theatrics. Keep it up!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I did NOT mean you shouldn't vote. I simply meant you can participate without being influenced by bullshit and propaganda.

       oh I totally don't vote, because no matter who wins, the people lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead I become involved in specific local community interests to make an actual difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, the best path forward that I see would be if NOBODY voted. If EVERYONE ignored the politicians and just did their own thing, I think at the very least it would be an interesting social experiment. And when you get right down to it, that's what a lot of people do anyway; part of that is apathy, which I have difficulty endorsing; I think it's entirely possible to be an active community minded citizen and have much more impact than a simple vote.

       I thought it might be a good idea to stage an event durring the 2016 elections where everyone started nominating leaders based on their P.A.T.S (Participation, Accountability, Trustworthiness and Skillfulness) to form commonwealths in each town. But I need help to get it going, I think its a good idea and would be something to get people to stop thinking about the elections and instead contribute to something that empowers the people. We need to create a vision of how things can be like first with a media campaign of some kind.
Here is the proposal:
       <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths">
        http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths
       </a>
       Currently working on the website for it:
       <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org">
        www.commonwealths.org
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested nominating someone with a P.A.T.S history in the creation of the committee to create the media campaign and help develop a website platform for this idea subscribe to the news letter. The nominee can be vetted by there Reddit history and must have an account that is at least 3 months old with a history of P.A.S.T based on the original posting of this idea (
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/250yf1/2016_presidential_elections_what_if_an/">
        http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/250yf1/2016_presidential_elections_what_if_an/
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Im completely open to ideas to make this campaign  P.A.T.S. Dont rock the vote, rock the boat :D

       In order to keep the whole process free from ego driven desires. Which I talk about in
       <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/commonwealths#reform-problem">
        The Problem
       </a>
       part of the proposal it works by making a nomination of someone you feel would be P.A.S.T worthy to operate the campaign. If you are interested in making the world a better place you will understand that I can make any direct connections to anyone as it distorts that process. This may sound over the top, but I feel its necessary for some intuitive reason. You can also wait to see if the site goes live and register for an account and start building P.A.S.T history.

       I am trying to find ways to vett trustworthy people. I would not think it be beneficial to the commonwealths to inadvertently have someone that has ulterior motives being part of the process. We need people that actually want to create commonwealths that empower people instead of dis-empower people. If you have a better idea let me know. This would only be for the initial media campaign and building of the website. Once the commonwealth website got underway, people will be able to register on the commonwealth website and build their own P.A.T.S or P.A.S.T history.

       Or how to prevent persona accounts from simply nominating themselves.  As the old saying goes, those who seek power are exactly the same who should never possess power over other individuals.  And as we've seen clearly here, the Zionists will infiltrate and marginalize almost instantly if this starts receiving traction.  there must be a method to isolate them, and force them out.  No more.

       The P.A.S.T history will vet those people out, they need to have built a history of being P.A.S.T before they can have any influence on the development of the Commonwealths. In terms of decisions, its similar to a co-operative business. People who try to make proposals that are self-interest related will be discovered by others who are able to monitor each persons actions within the commonwealth since ever action that is significant in moving the Commonwealth forward will need to be submitted to the community for support. At least thats the idea and I need help to look for flaws and make improvements.

       I am very very interested in participating in this project and helping out in any way I can.  Organization is a powerful tool that allows us to do so much more than we can as indivduals.  We just need to ensure that that organization and the energy of its constituents are not subverted to a narrow agenda.  We need people who are courageous and GENUINE.

       People would be appointed  to roles not to power. People who are skilled in what ever position that is needed for the committee to launch the website and the media campaign who are trustworthy skillful accountable and participatory. Its something like a direct democratic process that puts the right people in place, instead of using majority rule which doesn't work. I base that idea of off Thoreau's

       Because history teaches is the best leaders are thow who do not seek power. Those who do not seek the role.  Take almost every police officer for example.  the same is true of almost every CEO.  A breeding ground for narcissists.  For psychopaths.  It never works when they are involved.

       dual power is best - pirates used this technique to ensure that power wouldn't  easily concentrate in the hands of only one.

       the cap'n was a war chief and leader but other than that, all decisions were made democratically and the 'dual' power existed in the form of a ship's quartermaster who was also elected and who was in charge of the treasury

       I vote in local, small elections no one pays attention to, but as a homeowner, I feel compelled to, as they are always trying to throw shifty ass bull crap on these ballots.

       Local elections matter more as far as I can tell.

       Exactly. That's how government works. Good job. Gold Star.
      </p>
      <p>
       We give up the ability to murder our neighbor for the government's promise that if our neighbor murders us, they will be punished. Other laws are mostly just extensions of that, or meant as ways to facilitate that.

       I advocate for voluntary anarchism. I've seen it already work in my neighborhood, where we get virtually zero city clean up and service to roadways and sidewalks and crime was through the roof 5-6 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we hired our own private security and crime is virtually non-existent, and we clean and mow our own sidewalks and public spaces.

        The problem is we here all still pay the city to do it and they don't.

       Watching this and there are a lot of really good points and astute observations. Thanks for posting this. My favourite part is when he distinguishes between political, scientific, deity and spiritual religions (monetarily driven) that give people a choice to end up at the same place of mental slavery. The binding (religion) of one side of the neocortex or the other to get the same result through apparently unrelated methods.

       I would really like to see how true the idiom remains; "Democracy is 10 wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure it's still true in some places, but I think we've come a long way in the last 70 years. My state would not vote to eat the sheep.

       how interesting, so all the rich white families in the South were just waiting for their slaves to naturally stage a revolt rather than waiting for an oppressive northern government to free them?  or more logically, the South should have freed / bought out their own slaves and then proposed a zero taxation rate on them rather than hem and hawing for so long?
      </p>
      <p>
       it's almost like the South was just legitimiately racist.  i think it's silly to argue over which side was more oppressive when one side literally enslaved an entire ethnicity.

       When you have government sanctioned bigotry (Gov Wallace) it's just wrong, plain and simple.  You can hide behind the whole tax thing all you want but when a local government is turning a blind eye to the blatant violations to the constitution (all men are created equal) the federal government had to step in and right a wrong.  from what your saying is that Woolworth should have not let black people sit at the lunch counter because taxes are bad.

        At this point, the best path forward that I see would be if NOBODY voted. If EVERYONE ignored the politicians and just did their own thing, I think at the very least it would be an interesting social experiment.

       No.  We should not "ignore" politicians.  They have the power to make deisions that affect all of us.  Sure, you may have a grater impact on a local level, but we need to hold all law makers and politicians accountable.

       E-voting has been proven corrupt.  It's a sham and has always been.  The integrity of voting in America is nonexistent.  The only way Bush and his fucked up son could have been elected to the highest puppet executive position within the US.  A continuation of the near silent coup on America that occurred in Dallas.  We haven't had anything even resembling a representative democracy since.  They control every aspect.  they are Zionist non-Jews.  This is nothing new.  We see Biden even today sucking their dicks to get ahead.

       well it sounds to me as if people would eventually recognize that the people in power are only supported by a minority, and are illegitimate rulers; in time, I would expect that they would be overthrown; usually this would involve some sort of rebellion and possibly warfare, but in this time of technology and social media, perhaps it would be possible to build a new system; one where we voted for the best IDEAS instead of people, and the voting system was open to the public for inspection, and so on, instead of just the existing system which has been corrupted and is filled with incestuous relationships and a system that works for politicians and corporations, and against the people

       They are worried, but not about the Americans.  Paradoxically, they are worried about Russia and more immediately about Ukrainian rebels, because unbeknownst to the people in the West there is a war going on there against the powers that be.  People don’t know about it because western MSM has been brainwashing them to view Russia as if it was still the "evil" USSR and not a modern multi-party democracy which happens to challenge, by mere existence, the supremacy of the West.  The rebels and political movement in Russia are fighting for the restoration of the sovereignty and liberation from occupiers.  Sounds nuts right?  Russia is a sovereign country, right?  Wrong!

       We are the powers that be.  Unless you believe in a higher authority, in which case it's there.  The rest is born out of fear that we will somehow survive all of this - but that's impossible and irrational because we all die.  Thus, if the man comes to my door to tell me he is in control - I'd have to agree with him.  He is in control.  Hopefully of himself.  However, control over me (or anyone) is impossible without consent.  Thus, if in not consenting we are a threat to his control over himself (and his percieved life) then yes, he is likely worried.  Else, he's likely not worried.  But it sounds to me like if the man who would say he is in control is not in control of himself out of worry of me then indeed I would beg the question of if he ever truly was in control in the first place.

       Why does somebody have to ask this whenever some sort of non groupthink thought is posted? Or said in a group? It's like a funny idiom recited to relive the awkward tension after some original thinking has been stated. Most people don't know how to respond because they are so lost in their own pseudo-intellectual narrative, when somebody brings up drugs, it's a way for them to laugh, reassure themselves that what they just heard is not worth pondering, and that their selfish narrative is good enough for them.

       You're right it was a stretch to infer hes on drugs. I think there's a lot to be gained from this subreddit but a good portion of comments here read like a word salad. There's a general theme present but the declarations don't string together strongly enough to back up said theme. So if users communicated with more clarity when summarizing articles maybe the sub would be taken more seriously.

       I see that as a problem In it of itself. We are so conditioned to hearing and reading "opinion" (news, entertainment, etc) in a spell-checked, non regional diction, proof-read, edited, and altered for specific context, that anybody who does NOT sound like this is labelled as a fucking moron, an idiot, misinformed, etc.

       You can extrapolate the same idea if you compare it to standardized testing in schools. Not every child can express themselves and listens/understands the same way. But we test them all the same way, therefore anybody who does Poorly on the test is obviously an idiot.

       Here's the kicker though. He does not necessarily have to be in complete control of anything, but simply put the idea out there in order to distract the masses with debate. All he needs to be is the driver of certain events. In a sense nudging and directing chaos to a desired outcome. Over time the practice is refined as society becomes more civilized.

       civilized?  How is debate distracting?  To go into this a bit: something chaotic happens - an earthquake, a riot, x - how best should we react if we do not discuss it?  Plans.  Plans are like saved discussions that have coalesced into a plan of action.  And when something chaotic happens, we enact a plan.  But what if the plan doesn't work?  Should not we discuss it so we can cooperate towards forming a better plan?

       Debate can be the biggest distraction. That's the entire idea of politics in a plutocracy. It's a show meant to divide and create debate between two sides of the same coin. See-&gt; republicans vs. democrats when it comes to actual important constitution ignoring nonsense. I'm not saying us discussing this reality is pointless.

       Thats true. Thats why there are leaders who are able to detect those things and help steer people into the right direction. The reality is the power structures are not as pervasive as we might think. They have created an illusion of pervasiveness that people tend to latch onto. In reality its probably much more chaotic with both sides, freeing awareness and controlling awareness in a large balancing act.

       discussing this is actually very important.  Especially if we come away with an improved idea of what to do.  We don't have to agree - but without discussion, we can never cooperate.

       Neat answer, but when you put it like that, then no one is in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man will not be the one coming to tell you he is in control. He would not risk his own life knowing how little control he has over the powers that be(us). Instead, he will empower some of us to knock on other doors to let them know that the man is in control. Now, we have people who are not in control of themselves, knocking on doors and speaking on behalf of the man.

       Hahaha!  I like it.  But let's look at this - man asks other men to do his work.  Who is in control?  If the man is in control then are those men not?  Are they automatons?  Do they execute fully the duty they've been told?  If so, then perhaps it is because they, too, think that idea is a good idea?  Thus the man who does the ill deed, who we assume is in control of himself and not a robot, has decided to do the deed.  So does it matter if it is the man who ordered the man or the man who was ordered?  To me, I like to be in control of myself.  To the man who appears on my doorstep, I hope he is control of himself.  But if the man who appears on my doorstep feels threatened by me then I would argue he could never be in control of me.  Now, he could shoot me or burn my house down or rape my wife.  That's a possibility.  But are we arguing because you can destroy a thing - you control a thing?

       That is a relative question, and would be difficult to answer adequately. It depends who the players involved are. We have people like Charles Manson going to jail for convincing others to commit murder, while US Presidents convince others to go to war. In one situation, the man who ordered is at fault, and in the other, the man who was ordered, killed in war, and was not at fault, simply for following orders.  Simply, it does matter depending on who you are.

       When I read this, TPTB are representative of the banking/media/corporate elite, essentially the plutocracy.  I agree with what you're saying about perceiving authority and control, ultimately that you're in control of yourself.  However, the plutocracy doesn't only want to be in control of themselves, they also want (and ultimately have) control over the spending power of the general populous.  So when they see that our spending may be swayed to a market that is not under their control (ex. local farming, etc.), yes they are worried. They're worried that their advertising isn't effective enough to override our own critical thinking, they're worried that they're losing ROI.  The basis of their control is the obfuscation of truth, thus when that truth comes out, down falls their house of cards.

       They are worried, alright, but not about what you think that they are worried about. TPTB get the real information, not the daily propaganda spewed forth from the teevee. They know where we really stand with respect to resource scarcity, climate change, and economic sustainability and are planning accordingly.

       96.723% of Americans could shove their food up their asses and it doesn't change the fact that global oil production is peaking. The elite have known this for a while and have gone to ridiculous lengths to convince the public that it isnt happening.

       TPTB knows those methods will further escalate problems, and are a threat to their power. I did not ask if they were worried. I asked How do you know?, in response to someone saying they are fucking not.

      <p>
       My question, How do you know, TPTB are not worried?

       We know there are lists. We know our government tortures and indefinitely detains. They worry because more people know that the government have always been worried.

       That is correct. Always be wary of ideology and refrain from labeling yourself. There are nuggets of truth everywhere, no
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       set of ideas or beliefs will ever usher in a new enlightenment. And even "truth" will always be somewhat of an abstraction - because no one can ever know everything, only fools try and only psychopaths claim to have succeeded.

       Also, those labels have been pre-defined to not contain the dissent we seem to be causing.  the labels themselves are tools of the establishment, but we don't have to acknowlege their importance.  None of the existing labels accurately depict my opinion or thinking.

       Not really. Plenty of people who call themselves liberals or conservatives are in disagreement over the status quo. 96% of Americans want the money out of politics, that certainly counts as dissent and it definitely involves people who define themselves as traditional democrats or conservatives.

       This is very important to understand, well said. Labels are a great way for us to talk about important topics. Be careful on relying to much on them as they can distract from the real purpose which goes beyond labeling. I think people understand intuitively ideas and goals that are beneficial to humanity, so we dont need to worry to much about trying to get the right titles

       My question is how can you prevent the media from talking all that bullshit for the next two years?  They refuse to deviate from their scripts, regardless of any rationality that is presented to them.  Unless we can rally the troops and storm the CNN/FOX/Whatever headquarters with pitchforks (which wouldn't work anyway), I don't see how to get them to deviate from the dialectic.

       Sure we can boycott (as I already have and suspect a lot of us have too) but the reality is that too many people are still dependent on them for their news and daily fill of divisive rhetoric.

       But that's inconsiderate.  Stalin didn't personally kill 20 million Ukrainians.  He had others do it.  A lot of others.  Likewise, if we keep giving credit to individual sociopaths, we neglect the truth that it is impossible for one sociopath to single-handedly kill so many people.  People have to consent to be part of the mass murder.  So indeed, the real question is how do you negotiate with a mob willing to kill so many people needlessly?  Can one man kill the mob of men who agree to listen to orders from another man who has told them to kill?  If no, then that man will have to enlist an entire mob of his own, on orders to kill that other mob who is trying to kill another group.  Invariably, we are not left with individual sociopaths but a collective of sociopaths.

       This hit me hard.  We're giving the Stalins of the world too much credit and absolving ourselves of responsibility.

      <p>
       Every war going on right now is happening because of hundreds of thousands (millions?) of individuals choosing to make it so.  Some joined their military for opportunity, some for money, education, legal requirement; some because they have to, the war was brought to them.  But all relinquish consent for their actions.  They will do as another tells them, without question, because it's for the good of the unit and in a time of war there are no rules except keeping yourself and your allies alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if all of these people left the military; if every army that has subsequently evolved into the powerful arm of any dictator capable to wield it had said collectively, "Fuck you, we're not killing anyone", then war stops.  We'll stop war once we master ourselves and have the confidence to lead for ourselves.

       I had a dream two nights ago that me and two friends were arrested during a traffic stop. We were not charged and were released from this jail but were handed an iPad and told to play this game before being released. The game was basically a Call of Duty style game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thought came into my head that the better you are at killing and the higher score you receive, the more likely you were to become targeted to be spied on by NSA or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I decided I would not kill. I sat next to someone in the game sitting with his back to a wall and his hands covering his head in fear. I sat down and put my arm around him and hugged him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I decided to play the game MY WAY.

       Bemol, they might just be lead to believe they should kill so many people needlessly. And the crux of this thread is that the propaganda works less and less as people swap capital media for crowd-sourced media. Only the future will answer the question as to whether we are naturally willing to kill so many people needlessly or not. But when I look at Israelians and Iranians on facebook sending each other collective love messages, i tend to lean on the very optimistic side, for me this shit is not natural, it's just one of the new religions, militarism, it goes well with all the other ones...  liberalism, communism, anarchism, consumerism, individualism...

       I dunno if that's necessarily true. This is a special case where sociopaths are specifically selected for high-level government and elite positions via gatekeeper ceremonies.

       Maybe power will always tend to attract sociopaths, but it doesn't have to be as bad as it is now with the current batch.

       The thing that's necessary to understand about that, is that no one is the bad guy in the story of himself.  In Stalin's mind, Stalin was the hero of his story.  Almost none of us have the ability to be truly objective, if that's even a thing that exists, about how our words and deeds affect the world.

       Social change is good for society as a whole, but the individual takes one for the team. The nation-state form of government has further perpetuated social problems we face today. People look to the state for  solutions while those problems were created due to the incompetence of the state.

       Those traits can be seen as weakness. Also, the way media is controlled, dreams and ambitions can be manipulated. Mainly, dreams and ambitions accomplish nothing. What matters is the work that people do in regards to their dreams and ambition. Show your passion through your actions.

       Ambition comes from a need to be something or be somewhere where you are not already, its an ego driven desire that causes people's ideals to become corrupted because they haven't worked though knowing their subconscious desires. If you know anything about this process people tend to be manipulated by repressed subconscious desires. This is why you will see someone who wants to accomplish something good start out with great intentions and in the end become corrupted though the process of achieving those desires. You can't really complete worthwhile goals until you have worked out or discovered who you are on a subconscious level first. Once you know thy self, then you can act on anything and there will not be any real ego driven need or want to accomplish it.
      </p>

       In transcendentalism, you discover who you are not by who you can be, but by who your now and work from there.

       See, there you go. Your dream for the future is a totalitarian regime. This will necessarily be a brutally oppressive world, because that's the only way to deal with people who disobey your allegedly noble commands. And people WILL disobey. They always do.  Modern America would be an egalitarian utopia compared to the Orwellian nightmare you propose.

       I do not share your hateful view of humanity, and it don't think most people will ever be convinced that the Nazis were right after all. If you truly believe that human nature is the problem, then the only possible solution is the extermination of the human species.

       I saw the part where you stated that human nature is what's wrong with human beings. That is, humans are by their nature inherently bad. You aren't going to change human nature by decree. You'll need to slaughter everyone who won't get with the program.  Pol Pot, Mao, Hitler, Stalin, Che; they all understood this reality.  Make no mistake, it is their precedent you are suggesting we follow.

       Its really hard to gauge this though, it really depends on where you focus your attention. Understand that Attention is everything and when you shift your attention to something empowering, and other people see you do it it creates a cascade effect in the same way the power structures create change that harms the world. It is really a battle of attention. When you start to grasp how powerful attention really is and you know where to put your attention, you start to see real change and other people shift with you.

       No, people actually got up off their asses more instead of signing useless online petitions. "The internet" ain't going to do shit. People aren't standing up to the police in Ferguson because of the internet. Bitching online and "spreading the truth" from your basement does nothing.

       Exactly, and the reversal of milleniums of beliefs will not happen overnight either, it will take time. I too was sitting there 10 years ago thinking the same as kittenhormones, but despite the initial disappointment, i have learned to appreciate how fast it really is still. And eventually, all this knowledge in the masses will result in shit hitting their fan.

       One problem is that the correlation between authority and merit long ago diverged. If you simply stick the 'anti-authoritarian' label on yourself, you might be mistaken for a dirty
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2975578/">
        'anarchist'
       </a>
       that wants to murder and steal whenever you can. There's nothing wrong with authority per se; if you are the only person that knows and understands the best way to do something, then I'd want you to be an authority on that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if your position of authority revolves around some piece of knowledge anyone can look up on the internet in a few minutes, then I feel much less obliged to respect that authority than would have someone in the past, and the person in authority has much less leeway to be an asshole without inviting rebuke than in the past. People respect cops when the cops protect and serve, not harass and intimidate. Sometimes cops and detectives solve a big case and catch some real bad guys or cocaine. But in general the only institutional merit cops merit is that they followed orders, and in this way they are similar to their own prisoners.

       The powers that be are not worried in the least. You forget that most people are unaware. Ferguson should have made that loud and clear. All they have to do is say the right words and a spell is cast. The enlightened are few, the ignorant are many and are easily swayed.  This is how its always been. You will have to find creative ways to enlighten them.

       The authoritarian ruling class of people are banking on the notion that the general masses of people are too ignorant and stupid to realize just what is taking place around them. They honestly think they have fooled us all into being pre occupied with trivial idealisms, and that we have forgotten what is truly right and wrong. Fortunately for us, we all still have that moral spark. That little bit of empathy still left inside us. And though it has been slowly washed away by the mainstream idea of segregation and dualistic idealism, we still, in times of utmost turmoil redeem the qualities of basic human instinct. To set aside differences and to take on the

       All this information, easily cross-referenced, accessible, free and transparent. It would be a herculean endeavour, but entirely possible. Most of this information is already available, it's just spread out so thinly that it is virtually impossible to make any consensus out of it (unless of course it is your profession: political PR managers and journalists).

       This sinlge source of information, while not "revolutionary" or "failure-proof", will certainly be less biased than MSM, and possibly reach the same level of importance as Wikipedia (along with the obvious problems regarding deliberate attempts of sabotage, doxxing, PR). This will be a very important step for true Democracy.

       Let me nail it down for you. Here's the new paradigm from what I see from Reddit users. I see people who love memes, naked pictures of girls, armchair activists who decry everything and demanding something be done while eating cheeto's and smoking a joint and playing Call of duty. I see people who see everything wrong with their government, while never attempting to work in it and trying to fix it. I basically see people who do everything that is right ion their own eyes but see everything wrong with everyone else especially those in power.  Have I nailed down an average Reddit user?

       More than a soundbyte, but it's a damn good explanation; short, crisp, to the point, and correct.  What are they going to do about it? -- when 10s of millions believe that way.  Just say it's "conspiracy" minded still?  I have a strange (and good) feeling that it is just the start of something very big.

       What happens outside and AFK is often only one side of the equation you suggest:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Only 12.3 percent of people voted in this year's municipal elections. Turnout was even lower in 2013 and 2012, with 11.7 percent and 8.9 percent voting, respectively. On Sunday, Sharpton decried the dismal turnout in an address at a local church. "You all have got to start voting and showing up. Twelve percent turnout is an insult to your children," he said. Local resident Debra Reed, who set up a voter registration tent near the memorial, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch they are "trying to make young people understand that this is how to change things."

       It is called left-liberal here in India.  There is only one rule.  As long as  you are quiet about the islamic atrocities its all good.  the moment you speak against the atrocities by muslims you are a right wing crazy.  Dont believe me? Try it.

       There are any number of people speaking out against rapes and calling for castration of rapists, doing candle light vigils and so forth.  Not a single one of them is doing the same for the women 'captured' and 'forced into marriage' in nigeria, the IS and other places.  Even the way it is reported is different.  Why do you think that is?

       They call themselves secular, thereby confusing westerners.  They are called out as 'sickulars', 'suckulars', 'secularists', 'pseudo-secular' or even 'pseculars'... as these people are not truly secular, they are pro-muslim and anti-hindu, but they call themselves secular.

       This is the urban legend part.  Very small percentage, about 5-10% of hindus are vegetarians on moral grounds.  Eating of meat, including beef, is not prohibited in general.  You should taste the non-veg from other sources, like bengali, gomantak, chettinad and rajasthan... basically anything other than mughlai and punjabi... and you will be amazed at how awesome it is.

       Capitalism in and of itself is a materialistic mindset. If you want to change something you will need to at least start from a transcendental approach.

       Is a philosophy, it emphasizes idealism rather than materialism; that is, it views the world as an expression of spirit and every individual as an expression of a common humanity. To be human is to be born with moral imperatives that are not learned from experience but which are discovered through introspection. Therefore, everyone must be free to act according to his conscience in order to find the truth buried within.

       To me at least, that's perfectly 100% compatible with anarcho-capitalism. I know it has the word 'capitalism' in the title, but to me at least, it's so much more and so much different than just 'capitalism without a government'. To me, being an an-cap is about exactly what you just said. Treating individuals with respect and love, and letting everyone develop themselves according to who they wish to be, rather than what someone else wants of them. That's what both human rights and property rights ARE. Rules that allow an individual to be safe from outside interference. Anarcho-capitalism (as I define it) is no more or less than a recognition that statutory law is illegitimate and should be replaced by other methods of bringing aggressors to justice. It is not necessarily materialistic, tho of course if one wished to be materialistic within that system then they are more than welcome to be. But that's the whole point, individuals are individuals. No system that claims a transcendental approach as you put it could possibly be imposed on anyone without losing what made it transcendental in the first place. Hence, any transcendental approach will necessarily fall under the umbrella of anarcho-capitalism even if it that (admittedly bad) label doesn't appear to fit it at first.

       I've never really understood proposals along these veins. I feel like they miss the point. The problem with political power is not that it is directed incorrectly, or controlled by the wrong people, it's that it exists. People believe political power is legitimate. As long as you simply try to take over or change political power, you simply reinforce the idea that that power is legitimate. I will admit, that at times, political change CAN have benefits, but these benefits are akin to putting a bandaid on a festering wound. At best it's only a temporary small improvement, and at worst it backfires by being co-opted by or becoming the very powers it meant to remove. Real, lasting change will only occur when people realize that political power is bunk. It's a bunch of smoke and mirrors. Only voluntary, consensual action is legitimate. Rallying people to create a new group to hold power is just a continuation of the same failed system.

       Umm, its not a system that holds power, its a partisipitory network that allows people to have a voice. I dont think you read though it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a website that uses a conversation engine to creating P.A.S.T histories of everyone involved to track accountability. The commonwealth is a lose formation of groups working togeather for mutal benifit. Where are you getting power consoldation from?

       A voice. When people talk about having a 'voice' in politics what they normally mean is to have influence on what those in power do. They want to influence what laws are made or make sure issue A is resolved in such and such a way and issue B resolved in some other way. It's simply a way of organizing political influence to control political power. If I misread your proposal and you're simply talking about some sort of educational network that seeks to convince people that politics is dumb, then my apologies. That not generally what's meant when saying you want a 'voice' tho.

       Yeah you are latching on to specific words I am using instead of looking at the proposal. It has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with working together to operate in society. There are no power structures in this configuration. Only people who have a P.A.S.T history (Participatory, Accountable, Skillful and Trustworthy) which is tracked by the website. What we are doing with this proposal is using political campaigns to shift the attention from the political structure over to a participatory structure of accountability. Politics get weaker while People in participatory actions get stronger.

       <p>
        The formation of Commonwealths is an idea that I got from this Storm Clouds Gathering Video [8] : He talks about an group six Indian tribes all with their own cultures and traditions called the Iroquois that formed a Federation that lasted well before Columbus and up until 1779 when they were conquered militarily by the U.S. Many historians believe that the the Iroquois Federation was the inspiration for the United States, the difference being the Federation never had a central government. Nobody at the top had any power to force the member tribes to do anything against their will. This system worked and it worked well for a very long time. There is every reason to believe that it can work again in our own country. In order to do that we have to systematically deter people from perusing ego driven desires to create power structures which is just a form of separation. To do that we use incentives like the P.A.S.T conversation history each person develops over the course of his or her commonwealths website membership. Its not a utopian fantasy, its a viable option and its one we should be considering as we move forward with new ideas about how to empower each other. We use the website and peoples P.A.S.T conversation histories support to vet people and proposals to operate the Commonwealths. That way good intentions and corruption like behavior can is easily identified.

       We see and actively resist the divide and conquer distraction the plutocrats fight so hard to corral and keep us fighting each other rather than focusing on Thor extreme evil.  Rather than focusing on the Zionists who have usurped control over America.  The Bush dynasty post Kennedy assassination coup still hold all power.  We reject them, and will resist them at every turn.

       The powers that shouldn't be have every reason to be worried. We all know that they're as crooked as corkscrews, operating the world's largest bribery and extortion racket, and bleeding all but the wealthiest Americans to death for their benefit and that of their "campaign donors."
      </p>
      <p>
       I was mortified recently to discover the following language in 18 USC 201, the definition of bribery:
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Whoever—
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) directly or indirectly,
       <strong>
        corruptly
       </strong>
       gives, offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official, or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity, with intent—
      </p>
      <p>
       (A) to influence any official act; or
      </p>
      <p>
       (B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing, or collude in, or allow, any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud, on the United States; or
      </p>
      <p>
       (C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person;
      </p>
      <p>
       "Corruptly" is ubiquitous in the state definitions of bribery and this notion that bribes must be offered and received "corruptly" in order to be unlawful pervades the statutes. Many people would consider the offer and acceptance of something of value in exchange for official action to constitute a bribe, but as it turns out, politicians must be bribed "corruptly" in order to have done something wrong... Puhleeeeze...

       In a two party system, those who want to corrupt the system only need to corrupt the major presidential candidates on both sides of the two party divide. Then, no matter who wins the election, the corruption succeeds. This also works for any congressional office. It doesn't take advanced mathematics to calculate the number of politicians such tactics would need to corrupt to thwart the will of the people. The number is relatively small.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in such a system, which is our real world, what can the people of the US do to have any hope of combating such corruption?

       I agree. Neither party represents anyone but the 1% in America. The more Independents show that Americans have more than 2 views of politics, things will improve over time. Assuming, of course, we can push out the lobbyists first.

       I agree with all of your points.  People are definitely becoming more "truth-seeking" but unfortunately there's a lot of BS info floating around coming from people who claim to be intelligent, but aren't, or are just making bogus facts up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really wanna know and realize what's going on in the world, you cannot automatically discount any source, and you can't automatically credit any source that you've trusted in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many times I've seen some of my friends, who question everything, get completely misled by just uneducated information just because it aligns with their views.  I don't know everything, but I do know a lot about a few things, and when I see conspiracies posted so matter-of-factly that I know for a fact contradict the truth, it's hard to explain the real purpose to them.  They've essentially become close-minded to things that contradict their view or take on a particular story, which is exactly what they started rebelling against in the first place!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read something on a website, no matter if its MSM or any of these so-called "activist" or "free-thinking" websites, do your own research, because a lot of times those sites exist just to come up with outlandish things to get you to share on this subreddit and Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be complacent with info you read, and don't become the sheep that you accuse MSM digesters of being.

       That's pretty much correct but I don't attribute a negative modifier to us.  We are pro liberty, or 'libertarian' in the very broad sense of the word as it is the political antithesis of authoritarian, pro human rights and truth seeking.

       Liberal in American politics, and is one facet that demonstrates how both Democrat and Republican policies favor ultra-authoritarianism in their own ways.  Democrats want to set mandatory social norms for conservatives to ensure that their worldview is the only one supported by law, and also push for programs that support and reinforce utter reliance on the government for survival.  Republican policy, on the other hand, thanks to its corruption by the religious right, wants to establish antiquated and draconian social norms based upon the rules established and reinforced by their faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to condemn all mainstream policy initiatives of either party, both of which are sides of the same coin and are striving for total control over the populace.  That's also not to suggest that members of both parties don't fall outside of the mainstream of their respective groups.

       Sorry, but a break from social norms is part of liberalism too. What that has to do with 'ultra authoritarianism' is beyond me. Nice try painting the freedom wanting slaves as the slave driving masters.

       It's an objective truth that the laws, like the Civil Rights Acts of 64 and 68 were enacted by the Democrats.  It's also objectively true that the effect of those laws is to force people to behave a certain way.  I didn't express any of the crap contained in your post.  Frankly, I think it's sick that we need laws to force people to treat everyone else equally.  History has shown, though, that we do, and the Democratic party spearheaded by LBJ put some of those laws into place, imposing their worldview on other individuals through coercive governance.  I'm not saying that it shouldn't have happened.  I'm simply saying that it did happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latter half of your well-reasoned and articulate response demonstrates exactly what's wrong with the Democratic party in particular.  Many people who vote Democrat consider themselves "liberal," when their actual worldview is historically conservative.  Most policies pushed through today by Democrats and railed against by Republicans would not have appeared out of place in Reagan's policies and would probably have been lauded by Republicans if they had been proposed by one of their own.  Liberals trading under the name Democrat, by and large, simply want to maintain the status quo with a little tweak here or there.  They do not want true social change and upheaval that typically marks periods of extremely liberal political climes.

       And I said liberal, not democrat. By historic / worldwide standards the american democratic party is not considered very liberal. They do vocalize change and reform, but, vocalization  is about it. Compare them to classical liberal standards or Europe and all bets are off. The torries are more liberal in many regards.

       There's a major difference between expressing your opinions and forcing a worldview on a society.  If you disagree that using the government to enact and enforce laws that require a human being to act in a manner such that they can be placed in financial ruin for failing to comply, which the 64 and 68 acts did, constitutes use of government to control behavior, I'm curious to know what you would consider it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be mindful of a few things, though.  First, I think that discrimination on almost any grounds, including because someone is a member of a protected class or because someone has some attribute that is no statutorily protected is awful.  It pains me that we even have to have some kind of laws on the books to enforce behavior that should be the norm.  Sadly, history and current events prove that we do need those laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I'm a civil rights attorney, who spends 75% of his professional life litigating claims across the country under the ADA, the ADEA, the FHA, and other facets of Titles VII-X, along with their state law analogues.  Actively working in, presenting on, and writing on these issues has provided me with the insight into how poorly implemented those laws are, and how readily and often the civil remedies portions of those statutes are misused and abused.  A big part of those failures come from poor drafting that allows for vilification of people who do not have ill intent, but who slip and say or do something that violates the law.  Another big part of those failures stems from a lack of ability for the wrongfully accused to fight back and hold the false accused accountable and liable for their actions.  Do I have a solution?  No, I wish that I did, but outside of rewriting every part of those acts to conform to Title VII's newer language, we'll continue to see innocent, well meaning people have their lives thrown into chaos through overly liberal enforcement of those well intentioned laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you take a leap and think I'm talking about someone like the moron in Ohio who had a No Blacks sign on her swimming pool because she thought she could do what she wanted on her privately owned, but rented, property, I'm not.  I'm talking about innocuous cases I see every day.  Like the one case where a guy brand new to leasing a property of his mentioned in an ad that the third floor apartment opened onto a steep, steel, unenclosed staircase, so tenants with very young children may want to take that into consideration.  Did he intend to discriminate against someone based on familial status?  Of course not.  He believed that he was helping to protect a child from potentially getting hurt by advising potential tenants of a dangerous condition.  The result?  Potential tenant files a complaint with HUD and the renter is forced to pay me money to defend him and to pay thousands of dollars to the claimant to avoid dealing with a federal lawsuit where his fees alone would have eclipsed $100,000, and where he would have lost because his intent isn't even a consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe I'm talking about the apartment manager who has a tenant who is a member of a protected class who stops paying rent.  The apartment manager gives notice of eviction proceedings and all of a sudden it's a Section 3604 claim followed by a Section 3617 claim.  The apartment manager ultimately wins, of course, but not until spending tens of thousands of dollars in unrecoupable attorneys fees to draft and argue motions to dismiss, to conduct discovery, and to draft and argue a winning summary judgment motion, only to have spend another twenty or thirty grand fighting the appeal.  For a large management company or REIT, that's no big deal.  For someone who owns a small multiunit rental property, it can put them out of business.  And why?  Because the government, particularly the Democrat party, has put in place a poorly drafted statute designed to change the way people act and think, and because interpretive case law has allowed BS claims to proceed as often as valid claims and has not provided the supposed "oppressors" with a real remedy to fight back against spurious claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe I'm talking about a woman who did not have the skills of accumen to advance in her position, or who possessed character flaws that were undesirable for the workplace, let alone for advancement, or who participated in bawdy language with her co-workers, male and female alike, and then sued when she wasn't promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lawsuits like the ones I described above are an unfortunate, but real, consequence of the laws that were enacted, really, to make sure that everyone got a fair shake, regardless of their race, sex, national origin, age, religion or disability.  The principle behind the laws are admirable, but the social impact caused by forcing people to engage in any kind of activity inevitably leads to a large number of those protected class members assuming a victim mentality and abusing those laws for purposes other than what they were originally intended to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not passing negative judgment on the enactment of these statutes.  I'm all for equal treatment and completely opposed to unreasonable discrimination.  We have enough ignorant, discriminatory jerks in our population who make them necessary.  However, I can and do acknowledge that those statutes constitute government enactment and enforcement of social norms that run contra to some people's cultural beliefs, wrong or right, and have created a system that causes it's own set of unfortunate problems that impact our society by reinforcing an "us against them" mentality, and negatively impact our economy on both a macro and micro level.

       Your response is puerile, your arguments are facile and demonstrative of both an unwillingness and inability to understand the substance of my post, and you are actually the one incapable of considering other worldviews outside of your own.  It is nonsensical that having in depth knowledge of a subject and real world experience regarding the application of that subject disqualifies one from commenting on that subject. In sum, your reply is not worthy of a substantive response.

       What is my world view ? Where have I expressed except for an accuracy of language ? Words have meaning, lets try to use them correctly. The desire to overturn authoritarian regimes is a core feature of liberalism. Even conservatives would agree with this. Who really wants authoritarianism. Who really knowingly embraces lies ? What a joke of an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear. You are arguing that any law passed is oppressive. Litter laws which prohibit me from turning my community into a third world beach are "ultra authoritarian" because it "forces me" to do something. What a joke. Your lack of discernment and black / white mentality is a handicap.

       Agreed. However if you have a vested interest in a frame, you have motivation to lie and twist to meet that vested interest. Such as you have demonstrated above. But dont let me stop you from pouding your authoritarian chest in self righteous "I know Better cus im a lawyer" glory.

       I do find it amusing.  I'm always curious to see how people with such reactive, violent, thoughtless, unresearched, and condescending replies to my posts respond to thoughtful, well reasoned, borderline respectful (I'm a litigator.  I write and debate for a living.  Small jabs inevitably slip through my internal filter.) responses to their mean spirited posts. I guess that I hope that one day I'll see evidence that is taught someone something and they appreciate it, even if they don't agree with it, and I have that hope because I have been taught a lot by other users who know a lot more about things than I do, and is always appreciated the insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit, just today, I had someone teach me a great deal about Icelandic politics and current events, and provide me with a ton of cool information, including their thoughts on the state of Icelandic society, and had someone else teach me how to read and pronounce all of those crazy protogermanic letters in the Icelandic.  How did it start?  Because I made an ignorant (not disrespectful, but uneducated) comment about Iceland.  Within an hour a bunch of cool people from Iceland brought me some knowledge.  I've corrected my understanding, learned something new, met a couple of cool folks, and loved every minute of it.  I guess I'd like to know that I had that influence once here, but a board full of users with strong, strong biases and opinions may not be it.  I had some hope with this one, though, because he or she came across as someone who was simply unlearned and that was defensive because he or she is a member of a protected class that some people find to be overly privileged. (Rightly or wrongly).  Time will tell, but my confidence is diminishing.

        Safaris through ancestral memories teach me many things. The patterns, ahhh, the patterns. Liberal bigots are the ones who trouble me most. I distrust the extremes. Scratch a conservative and you find someone who prefers the past over any future. Scratch a liberal and find a closet aristocrat. It's true! Liberal governments always develop into aristocracies. The bureaucracies betray the true intent of people who form such governments. Right from the first the little people who formed the governments which promised to equalize the social burdens found themselves suddenly in the hands of bureaucratic aristocracies. Of course, all bureaucracies follow this pattern, but what a hypocrisy to find this even under a communized banner. Ahhh, well, if patterns teach me anything it's that patterns are repeated. My oppressions, by and large, are no worse than any of the others and, at least, I teach a new lesson.

       Those who self identify as "liberal progressives" today end up invariably being petty authoritarians and arbitrary or inconsistent moralists and prohibitionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       See: the consistent liberal progressive attack on the human/natural/human right of self defense (via 2A and other related human rights and self defense law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another good example of the liberal progressive inconsistency in supporting human rights (and true agendas, often based on misinformation) is the liberal progressive outrage narrative against lack of reciprocity in same sex marriages in different states, all the while supporting lack of reciprocity in recognizing the human right of self defense in different states (via opposition against reciprocity in firearms carry permits).
      </p>
      <p>
       I support human/natural/constitutional rights for all American citizens. If people of the same sex want to get married, great. If people want to exercise their human right of self defense and arm themselves with a firearm, great. However, oddly enough that second right I just listed puts me at odds with the liberal progressive political beliefs and agendas.

       It's an objective truth that the laws, like the Civil Rights Acts of 64 and 68 were enacted by the Democrats.  It's also objectively true that the effect of those laws is to force people to behave a certain way.  I didn't express any of the crap contained in your post.  Frankly, I think it's sick that we need laws to force people to treat everyone else equally.  History has shown, though, that we do, and the Democratic party spearheaded by LBJ put some of those laws into place, imposing their worldview on other individuals through coercive governance.  I'm not saying that it shouldn't have happened.  I'm simply saying that it did happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latter half of your well-reasoned and articulate response demonstrates exactly what's wrong with the Democratic party in particular.  Many people who vote Democrat consider themselves "liberal," when their actual worldview is historically conservative.  Most policies pushed through today by Democrats and railed against by Republicans would not have appeared out of place in Reagan's policies and would probably have been lauded by Republicans if they had been proposed by one of their own.  Liberals trading under the name Democrat, by and large, simply want to maintain the status quo with a little tweak here or there.  They do not want true social change and upheaval that typically marks periods of extremely liberal political climes.

       There's a major difference between expressing your opinions and forcing a worldview on a society.  If you disagree that using the government to enact and enforce laws that require a human being to act in a manner such that they can be placed in financial ruin for failing to comply, which the 64 and 68 acts did, constitutes use of government to control behavior, I'm curious to know what you would consider it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be mindful of a few things, though.  First, I think that discrimination on almost any grounds, including because someone is a member of a protected class or because someone has some attribute that is no statutorily protected is awful.  It pains me that we even have to have some kind of laws on the books to enforce behavior that should be the norm.  Sadly, history and current events prove that we do need those laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I'm a civil rights attorney, who spends 75% of his professional life litigating claims across the country under the ADA, the ADEA, the FHA, and other facets of Titles VII-X, along with their state law analogues.  Actively working in, presenting on, and writing on these issues has provided me with the insight into how poorly implemented those laws are, and how readily and often the civil remedies portions of those statutes are misused and abused.  A big part of those failures come from poor drafting that allows for vilification of people who do not have ill intent, but who slip and say or do something that violates the law.  Another big part of those failures stems from a lack of ability for the wrongfully accused to fight back and hold the false accused accountable and liable for their actions.  Do I have a solution?  No, I wish that I did, but outside of rewriting every part of those acts to conform to Title VII's newer language, we'll continue to see innocent, well meaning people have their lives thrown into chaos through overly liberal enforcement of those well intentioned laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you take a leap and think I'm talking about someone like the moron in Ohio who had a No Blacks sign on her swimming pool because she thought she could do what she wanted on her privately owned, but rented, property, I'm not.  I'm talking about innocuous cases I see every day.  Like the one case where a guy brand new to leasing a property of his mentioned in an ad that the third floor apartment opened onto a steep, steel, unenclosed staircase, so tenants with very young children may want to take that into consideration.  Did he intend to discriminate against someone based on familial status?  Of course not.  He believed that he was helping to protect a child from potentially getting hurt by advising potential tenants of a dangerous condition.  The result?  Potential tenant files a complaint with HUD and the renter is forced to pay me money to defend him and to pay thousands of dollars to the claimant to avoid dealing with a federal lawsuit where his fees alone would have eclipsed $100,000, and where he would have lost because his intent isn't even a consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe I'm talking about the apartment manager who has a tenant who is a member of a protected class who stops paying rent.  The apartment manager gives notice of eviction proceedings and all of a sudden it's a Section 3604 claim followed by a Section 3617 claim.  The apartment manager ultimately wins, of course, but not until spending tens of thousands of dollars in unrecoupable attorneys fees to draft and argue motions to dismiss, to conduct discovery, and to draft and argue a winning summary judgment motion, only to have spend another twenty or thirty grand fighting the appeal.  For a large management company or REIT, that's no big deal.  For someone who owns a small multiunit rental property, it can put them out of business.  And why?  Because the government, particularly the Democrat party, has put in place a poorly drafted statute designed to change the way people act and think, and because interpretive case law has allowed BS claims to proceed as often as valid claims and has not provided the supposed "oppressors" with a real remedy to fight back against spurious claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe I'm talking about a woman who did not have the skills of accumen to advance in her position, or who possessed character flaws that were undesirable for the workplace, let alone for advancement, or who participated in bawdy language with her co-workers, male and female alike, and then sued when she wasn't promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lawsuits like the ones I described above are an unfortunate, but real, consequence of the laws that were enacted, really, to make sure that everyone got a fair shake, regardless of their race, sex, national origin, age, religion or disability.  The principle behind the laws are admirable, but the social impact caused by forcing people to engage in any kind of activity inevitably leads to a large number of those protected class members assuming a victim mentality and abusing those laws for purposes other than what they were originally intended to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not passing negative judgment on the enactment of these statutes.  I'm all for equal treatment and completely opposed to unreasonable discrimination.  We have enough ignorant, discriminatory jerks in our population who make them necessary.  However, I can and do acknowledge that those statutes constitute government enactment and enforcement of social norms that run contra to some people's cultural beliefs, wrong or right, and have created a system that causes it's own set of unfortunate problems that impact our society by reinforcing an "us against them" mentality, and negatively impact our economy on both a macro and micro level.

       I do find it amusing.  I'm always curious to see how people with such reactive, violent, thoughtless, unresearched, and condescending replies to my posts respond to thoughtful, well reasoned, borderline respectful (I'm a litigator.  I write and debate for a living.  Small jabs inevitably slip through my internal filter.) responses to their mean spirited posts. I guess that I hope that one day I'll see evidence that is taught someone something and they appreciate it, even if they don't agree with it, and I have that hope because I have been taught a lot by other users who know a lot more about things than I do, and is always appreciated the insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit, just today, I had someone teach me a great deal about Icelandic politics and current events, and provide me with a ton of cool information, including their thoughts on the state of Icelandic society, and had someone else teach me how to read and pronounce all of those crazy protogermanic letters in the Icelandic.  How did it start?  Because I made an ignorant (not disrespectful, but uneducated) comment about Iceland.  Within an hour a bunch of cool people from Iceland brought me some knowledge.  I've corrected my understanding, learned something new, met a couple of cool folks, and loved every minute of it.  I guess I'd like to know that I had that influence once here, but a board full of users with strong, strong biases and opinions may not be it.  I had some hope with this one, though, because he or she came across as someone who was simply unlearned and that was defensive because he or she is a member of a protected class that some people find to be overly privileged. (Rightly or wrongly).  Time will tell, but my confidence is diminishing.
