        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is obvious that the police at this moment is purposefully escalating the conflict, very likely receiving orders to arrest journalists and harass the press. They are gassing and arresting reporters for no reason at all, even from international MSM. I really doubt the governor and military contractors would want to create such a huge mess, the former sacrifices his reelection, the latter loses money if action is taken to de-militarize the police. We all know by now that power in US is dictated by larger financial interests, including Hollywood (which MSM is part of), banks and military contractors, all which have historically acted in concert, and I really doubt the Police and governor there would even think I about defying them: they appoint judges to the supreme court, they control the flow of public money and private money that feeds the police and they also finance the campaign of the democratic party (which the governor is part of). The head of any officer could roll instantly if they were actually doing that by their own. So, what is the reason for such escalation? I have seen that the idea of cameras on police are trending, and I believe that very soon they will be compulsory for all policemen. Is that it, perhaps? Instead of CCTV cameras feeding NSA datacenter with face recognition and full profiling, like in London, which would be very unpopular and met with immense resistance, they will implement them with popular support? Is this the next step in our dystopian 1984 society?</p>

<p>The government was able to coordinate a large scale project that  not even movie-makers would be able to conceive. It was discovered only two years after it has been officially halted. Even so, most of the documents disappeared (after Watergate). Not only they were able to coordinate this project with many independent scientists, universities, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, clinics, research foundations, prisons and even other countries (such as Canada), they were able to do so secretly. No one was indicted, or faced prosecution.</p>

<p>The idea that the government is too incompetent is a psy-op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government is the structure used by the running elite to maintain and further their power. It has been so since the dawn of history, and today is no different. </p>

<p>The upper section is managed by the same people that manages the largest and most successful private companies: with their money they elect the congress and the president, appoint judges, create commissions, while keeping everyone under control (population and politicians) using the media (and the State) apparatus. These companies have names: Monsanto, Exxon-Mobil, Comcast, CBS, Lockheed Martin, Booz Allen Hamilton, Goldman-Sachs, etc.. They also have faces, though they tend to remain well-hidden, with very little publicity (because they control publicity).</p>

<p>Sure, low-level government can be highly inefficient or incompetent, but so are these large private companies.</p>

<p>The government will change only after the running elite changes (from industrialists of the industrial revolution and traditional media to the elite emerging from new technologies).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can imagine an American near future where racist hackers try to hunt down or otherwise intimidate people who think they’re commenting anonymously online against what they perceive to be racist police brutality and other issues (the frequency, immediacy, persistence, and hyper-aggressive psychology and methodology of anti-Brown commenters in all manner of forums suggested this idea to me)–this within the wider context of oligarchic fomentation of racial animus through media mind control as distraction against the “dangers” of social and economic solidarity among large sectors of the poor and middling population in an ever more unequal and Third World-like America.</p>
