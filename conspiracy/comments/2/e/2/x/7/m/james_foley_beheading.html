<p>the &quot;ISIS&quot; &quot;terrorist&quot; takes a knife and pulls James hair back.. CUT TO BLACK.. next shot is a guy laying there.. upper torso is black barred.. so all you see is legs.. no blood. no head. in the shot.. just legs.. it seems 100% fake</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly I want to make clear that I intend no disrespect to James Foley or any other Human being who has perished because of all this war and violence and bloodshed.</p>

<p>I think this video is fake VERY fake and a blatant attempt to justify more intervention in a warzone (for whatever reason I honestly do not know - a blanket use of the word &quot;money&quot; would not go astray).
  The reasons I believe it to be fake - apart from the &#39;no blood&#39; and the &#39;no fear&#39; aspect - there is quite obviously an overly edited aspect to this clip with the actual act completely cut out (pun not intended).</p>

<p>As someone who has been taught throughout my schooling of the implications of editing - and the fact that once you see something has been edited you instantly question the motive behind a) the media itself and b) the editing itself. By which I mean what would there be to gain from the &quot;Good Guys&quot; and the &quot;Bad Guys&quot; releasing this video? What would there be to gain BY EDITING this from the &quot;Good Guys&quot; and the &quot;Bad Guys&quot;? Ask yourself this and have a deeper ponder...</p>

<p>Next would be the atmosphere - the location, people present (from what I can tell 2 separate cameras - one which pans out and the other set to the side (for the record I only watched it once and don&#39;t intend on doing so again simply for the reason IF it is real it&#39;s not something I want to keep giving views to so my recollections may not be 100%). There were 2 people I could see and if the use of these cameras is legitimate it would indicate the use of a camera crew - not to mention a sound guy - notice the wind rustling their clothes which you dont hear? Also notice the impeccable video AND sound quality? This smacks to me of a pre planned and choreographed clip done by people who know what they are doing - vaguely and have access to decent forms of technology in the middle of a war zone - instead of the grainy and static ridden footage which usually surfaces from these sort of places by unprofessional camera holders.</p>

<p>From a &quot;cultural&quot; (if you want to call it that) point of view there is no one else around - by which I mean if you have ever seen any video like this before you can see other people, hear other people and of course being an Islamic region you would hear &#39;Allu Albar&#39; before any blood was spilt. You hear nothing, which to me means one of 2 things: a) this man who was murdered was murdered by someone who is not Islamic or someone who is not directly affiliated with the upper echelon of &quot;terrorists&quot; (not saying Islam goes hand in hand with terrorism either) b) this is some kind of propaganda &quot;fall back&quot; in case the whole &quot;lets go get the terrorists - again&quot; thing doesnt work and they can go on ahead and find the terrorist wannabes from London who are knocking off US journalists.</p>

<p>Finally without carbon copying most of what&#39;s already been said - I&#39;d like to sign off saying - &quot;Question Everything&quot; dont let media control you or your thoughts - this will only change your opinion and remove you from being an individual with a voice - this makes it a lot harder for propaganda to work and a lot harder for you to be pigeon holed with the rest of the sheep who instantly assume whatever is in front of them is correct.</p>

<p>Fuck I hope this world gets better...</p>

<p>Peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me the quality and editing just looks wrong. I&#39;m by no means an expert, but it just doesn&#39;t feel right.  One thing I wondered also, the pistol holster he&#39;s wearing would seem to be for a right hand draw.  But he uses his left hand to do the cutting. I don&#39;t see any blood when he&#39;s cutting, and that just doesn&#39;t seem right.  There is a brief sound which I personally have heard more than once when a goat or sheep has its throat cut, and maybe that is what a man sounds like too, I don&#39;t know.  Anybody have an idea on the holster, knife hand thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the video also. It doesn&#39;t seem fake, nor did the prospect of it being fake come to my mind. Why would they execute a load of people, and then fake the death of some American they&#39;ve had in captivity? It just doesn&#39;t make much sense to why they would do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument plays off logical fallacy. &quot;Why would they fake this death?&quot; is just as hard of an answer as &quot;Why would they edit out the execution after publicly executing thousands with no editing?&quot;</p>

<p>The problem is, in this new era, we cannot simply believe everything we see. Take the facts: You see him alive. You see the knife go to his neck. Then you see him dead.</p>

<p>Sure your brain can easily connect the dots, and fill in the missing parts, but that&#39;s not a reasonable substitute for what&#39;s missing in this video when it comes to deciphering fact from fiction.</p>

<p>It would be a disservice to make a conclusion simply because you &quot;don&#39;t understand&quot; why they would do something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There could be a number of non conspirasist reasons behind why they edited it out. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>They want this to be heard and shown to a wide audience. They know a full 30 seconds of sawing someones head off isn&#39;t going to be allowed on the news.</p></li>
<li><p>The executioner could have had a bit of trouble getting his head off, the spinal cord is very thick and isn&#39;t easy to cut through with a medium sized knife that he used. Maybe it was something as simple as he didn&#39;t want to be embarrassed and wanted to be taken seriously.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve seen combat footage by Al Qaeda members where they assaulted a checkpoint in Yemen. The guy filming went up to one of the wounded soldiers and put a couple of rounds in his head. They blurred out the head for some reason which I&#39;m not to sure about. Why would they censor his face after they hadn&#39;t censored anything so far?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t understand why they would fake it, but more that there is no logical reasoning behind why it would be faked. If it comes out as fake and that hes still alive, IS look weak and rather silly. If they actually kill him, all that changes from the current situation is that they would have to look after another prisoner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re failing to consider a whole other scenario: Consider that the whole video was not produced by real IS at all, and is a Mossad or CIA psy-op. The severed head/corpse image could have easily been created, photo-wise, by taking a photo of his head (while alive) with eyes closed and smeared with blood. Also a spot on the ground with &quot;blood&quot; poured there would be needed too. Someone in the orange garb would lay down on the ground. Then in Photoshop the rest is easy. I think I can even see layering artifacts/artificial shadows under the head in the &quot;death photo.&quot;</p>

<p>Think about the fact that it is about a hundred times easier to make a fake death photo than a fake death video. They skipped the hardest part—staging a fake beheading—and decided to not even try. They cut right to a single still image, and as you all know it is extremely easy to concoct a doctored image in Photoshop to show virtually anything you want it to show. It&#39;s funny, they had just used a video camera to perform the first part, but when it came time to show the decapitated American, instead of walking up to the corpse with a video camera running, they take a single pixelated still shot? Right...</p>

<p>Notice also that there is a big problem with the length of the shirt. In the video of the man on his knees, the shirt goes well past his waist. Then in the corpse shot, the shirt is only at the waist yet no material is hiked up or gathered to offset how short it now is.</p>

<p>I also have a hard time with the fact that Foley doesn&#39;t seem stressed out despite that ostensibly he believes he&#39;s about to be killed. Most people would be practically apoplectic with fear and anxiety... that means hyperventilation, cracking voice, twitchy movements, pleading, stuff like that. Instead Foley is cool as a cucumber.</p>

<p>Something is very weird here...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you actually watched the video? When they show his decapitated head it&#39;s not a picture, but still video. They sort of pan the camera over him. While I do think his calmness is strange, he has been in captivity for 2 years, he&#39;s probably been threatened with death a lot, or has been tortured in which case death would be an escape. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not actually video though. It&#39;s a pan effect, which is applied to a still frame. People do it all the time in cheap YouTube videos. It all makes me wonder why they would do that, why not literally walk around the body with a video camera shooting video? To my mind, there&#39;s one very likely reason: it&#39;s a doctored photo, which is easy to create. The whole thing seems really questionable to me.</p>

<p>A lot of questions and they all point to the military industrial complex profiting while the general public loses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean no disrespect, but...</p>

<p>Why does it matter? This video calls for American Intervention in Iraq against ISIS. (indirectly)</p>

<p>For months, America has watched as Iraqi people have been slaughtered, and Americans did practically nothing. Then suddenly, the beheading of a single reporter is aired, with the threat of another beheading, and we are supposed to declare war? If we care so much about stoping these monsters from beheading people, why the call to arms after this video? Why not the day after we saw all those heads on that fence. [<strong>google search &quot;ISIS fence heads&quot;</strong>]</p>

<p>Why not the day after reports of Christians being slaughtered?
Why this video?</p>

<p>In the video, the ISIS terrorist tells America to back off, and stay out of Iraq. The response has been overwelmingly &quot;Lets kill these assholes.&quot;</p>

<p>I hope we do not. We DO NOT CARE ABOUT IRAQ. If we did, America and the UN should have led a full attack against the ISIS leadership months ago, in the same way they went after Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>Ive done better with my first year student films 13 years ago...</p>

<p>this shows nothing.. this shows a guy getting his head pulled back.. a rubber knife &quot;cutting&quot; his neck for 3 seconds.. not a drop of blood during this cut.. and then an image of what appeared to be a really bad prop head sitting on a body.. Why is it we see all these other beheadings in full.. real time video.. which are clearly real.. and then this one, which has a hollywood camera slider ending, crystal clear dialog, and fits the agenda perfectly &quot;go after his killers&quot; aka ISIS</p>

<p>its called a false flag.. </p>

<p>can you show me exactly who did it and prove they were ISIS? because the guy in the full body suit and mask spoke perfect english, and there is no record of who really made that perfectly edited video</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that because he is English and not middle eastern doesn&#39;t mean anything. ISIS have used plenty of Brits for propaganda videos. </p>

<p>I was about to write my thoughts on the video when I realised that you seem to be talking about a completely different one to what I saw. So now I&#39;m confused. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because everything from the mainstream media is hard to believe. I thought the same thing until I saw your post (thanks by the way). Does look real, but dont give the guy a hard time for not believing a media that constantly lies. You may be following this story closer than OP and find it hard to believe anyone could doubt this story. But, take it from someone who isn&#39;t following it too close that it seemed fake when watching the mainstream&#39;s black barred version.</p>
