    <div class="md"><p>OK but, what about the news that pope Francis is possible involved in a satanic child sacrifice cult?

    <div class="md"><p>Cause there&#39;s prophecies made every year basically. I&#39;m sure they are involved in religion as no one would want to elect an atheist.

    <div class="md"><p>These were prophecies made a very very long time ago. Not yearly. I mean there are those too but that&#39;s besides the current point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m as anti-religion as anyone, was raised as a Muslim and had to reverse the indoctrination that took place on my mind.</p>

<p>But even I&#39;m startled every now and then by things that are happening historically in the world and how they relate to the Holy Books. </p>

<p>All I&#39;m trying to help realize is sometimes powerful people in control have plans in place for a very very long time. I&#39;m just saying 30-60 years based on movements like the Nazi movement, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would be holding them back from not executing said prophecy if it was planned? Nothing came together in the last 2000 years for it to happen? I feel like prophecies were just written down, whatever they could think of by the hundreds and just crossed them off as time passed or just fudged to last longer. Prophecies by people from  before Christ, by people a few centuries after that up to Nostradamus, that had no idea what the future could possibly look like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That book was the single biggest reason for the Dark Ages beginning in the first place. Thanks to that stupid religious movement the philosophical movements with traditions steeped in Ancient Greece and Rome were obliterated. The Library of Alexandria was laid to waste and brilliant scientists like Hypatia were brutally tormented and killed.</p>

<p>What brought us out of the dark ages were the works of Newton, Leonardo, and others studying the ancient Latin texts - not because of the Bible - but in spite of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are completely ignorant on the subject. During the dark ages bibles were outlawed by the Catholic authorities. Translating the bible into a common language that everyone could understand was outlawed and punishable by death, which is what happened to Tyndale, who revolutionized the oppressed minds of all those &quot;heretics&quot; who began a movement known as the Protestant Reformation. Even today, most every papist will suggest that Tyndale was justifiably arrested, starved, and executed for his actions. </p>

<p>The Protestant Reformation led to the founding of America, the Constitution, Bill of Rights, your freedom to express worthless opinions, etc. The Jesuit counter reformation was the Vatican&#39;s answer to the Protestant Reformation, and among other things, it aims to destroy everything it (the Protestant Reformation) has contributed to, including the constitution, which as we speak, is literally kaput. So we are indeed entering a new dark age, not because of the bible, but because of the Jesuits counter reformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christianity was invented by the Roman Church to legitimize the reign of the Flavian Dynasty following the collapse of the previous dynasty. Jesus Christ never existed. During the Roman conquest of the middle east, the Jewish Messianic movement would not recognize the Caesar as their God. The Caesars were obsessed with being viewed as Gods. </p>

<p>So, under the advisement of the Jewish traitor Josephus, the Bible was written to fictionalize a Jewish prophet that prophesized the coming of Titus as fulfilled in the War of the Jews. Again, written by Josephus. The fictional Jesus character was philosophically modeled after Philo of Alexandria. The Herods assisted with the writing of the text and the task was passed down to the Council of Nicea where the works were separated out from the other Apocrypha of Josephus during a conflict with the worshippers of another figure named Sarapis.</p>

<p>Now, lets see what is more logical:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A conquering Roman Emperor attempting to subjugate a Jewish rebellion conscripts the services of Josephus to invent the story of Jesus, and then founds the Catholic Church headquartered in Rome in order to continue the propaganda campaign against the Jewish resistance to Roman authority.</p></li>
<li><p>Some Nostradamus time-wizard that could see into the future or was receiving a dictation by some Doctor Who God wrote the Book of Revelations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Answer: 1 is real. 2 is some fictional garbage you picked up from some Lost Behind bullshit book series.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because the person responsible for the popularization of what I have contended is Joseph Atwell. Whoever Jordan Maxwell is, that&#39;s in your own damn head.</p>

<p>Regardless, perhaps you should go bow down to your Time Wizard God. Maybe Doctor Who wrote the Bible in your fantasy world right? It would make just as much sense, and don&#39;t get me wrong; I love Doctor Who. But you&#39;re a delusional schitzo if you think the Bible was written by a Nostradamus Time Wizard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cause there&#39;s prophecies made every year basically. I&#39;m sure they are involved in religion as no one would want to elect an atheist. But to say they made prophecies and are somehow making them real just gets absurd. I was done because I saw the influx of other commenters that I was going to save my critical thinking for the day trying to persuade someone of something that probably wasn&#39;t going to budge.</p>
