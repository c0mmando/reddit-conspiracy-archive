       I don't think Robin Williams' death is helping people w/ depression. If anything, the idea that a man with so much to live for would take his life makes anyone else with depression feel that much more hopeless. I'm going to let you in on a more likely scenario b/c depression awareness is NOT more important than people w/ depression getting one step closer to killing themselves b/c they think Robin did too. So if the mainstream view is a lie, the ends do NOT justify the means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robin was found clothed, not fully according to the coroner. He was found in the seated position leaning against the closet door, the belt was in the top of the closet door frame. All he would have to do is twist the door knob, the door would open and the belt would pop out. This is the exact position people put themselves in during autoerotic asphyxiation. Even the cuts on his wrist were consistent with masochistic tendencies, not suicide since they were superficial and horizontal, not vertical. Unless a suicide note surfaces, which as of now has not been confirmed or denied by the coroner, I for one would think that Robin died with a happy ending. Sorry if you don't like my theory, but it comforts me knowing he didn't throw it all away on purpose.

       I wouldn't be surprised if it was autoerotic asphyxiation or something as other has suggested. There was that movie he did about it and reports that he was fully engaged in business meetings just days before he did it. That being said I'd also not be surprised if it was just your run of the mill suicide.

       And death by sexual deviancy is not a better death than by suicide. Suicide shouldn't be considered shameful.

       Let me reverse it so your slow mind can catch up. If the facts showed he committed suicide, eg. a suicide note, I would accept the media's report at face value. B/c they have not, and from watching the coroner's report, which you either didn't or don't have the capacity to understand, the facts point more to him accidentally killing himself, and that comforts me b/c then I know that someone with so much to live for did not throw it away on purpose.

       Your obsession with a strangers cause of death is disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've interpreted the facts in a way that provides a "comforting" answer to something that you don't need to personally understand. And since you clearly have an emotional investment in determining the way he died, you're just like so many other Americans who are infatuated with the cult of celebrity.

       Stranger? How much of an idiot are you? He's a celebrity who's had an impact on my life and many people around the world. And who the fuck are you to determine what I do and don't need to personally understand? I sure as shit do for closure.

       And if anyone's gonna end up w/ a shaved head w/ a little rat tail in the back and no possessions, it's gonna be the guy distancing himself from America and entertainment. In case you're too obtuse to get that, I'm talking about you getting sucked into a cult and repeatedly fucked in the ass by a leader who promises you redemption.

Yes, of course both. Are you actually asking me to  open up and tell you how Robin Williams' death, not suicide, death impacts me? Hahaha.

       But your "facts" are imagined. Your desperate need for a stranger's death to be accidental for "comfort" and "closure", smacks of OCD or other behavioral issues. So yes, maybe you should tell me (or someone) about it.

       It's the opposite. I find the theory that he committed suicide with everything going for him disturbing. I wish he didn't die, but I would prefer that he didn't kill himself. If you can't get that, I can't help you. But I can try. Perhaps you can start by telling me about your mother.

       You, like so many others, have allowed yourself to become emotionally vulnerable to issues that have no relevance to you personally. America's obsession with celebrities is a symptom of a disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I wish he didn't die" is proof that your personal attachment to this person has distorted your perception.

      <p>
       You don't

       it to be a suicide so you've twisted the facts to fit your narrative.

       Even if it was accidental kink death, it's his family's right to cover it up. If it's suicide they have every right to conceal the letter.

       This is what happens when you give a keyboard to a monkey. You keep using the word obsession, but I think it's you who's obsessed. I'm concerned. I'm not going to let Robin Williams death permanently affect my life, but I care. And I'm not ashamed b/c it makes me part of the human experience. But you? You're scared of being a part of the human experience. This is your way. Online, hiding, away from sight like a little bitch. I didn't twist the narrative, I analyzed the facts. Something you never did b/c you wanted to make his death a platform for your verbal diarrhea.

       It's in reference to the fact that you care so much about Robin fucking Williams, that you're willing to conclude he was found with his dick in his hand, ala some coked up rock star. And that makes you feel better? it's fake, or at least socially induced. Either way it's weird.

       Slow choke is a very common way of performing suicide. Its very simple, choke yourself unconscious and hang there till dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mix in onset Parkinson's and the meds he was on years of drug abuse plus his financial troubles (which Im dubious of, the guy had 4 movies out this year) and I can see him killing himself.

       Watch the coroner's detailed report on youtube. Around 9 min's, 30 seconds, a reporter asks if he was fully clothed, the coroner says he did NOT say he was fully clothed.

       Dude, the coroner denies saying Robin was fully clothed. So all the 'reports' that say he was fully clothed are bullshit. And it sounds like that's the side you're on.

       I don't think it does.  This guy (a deputy coroner, I believe) was giving a press conference and throughout it he was very careful to make sure his exact words and definitions were used.  And he never said "unclothed." the question was "So he was found fully clothed?" and his response was, "I didn't say 'fully clothed' I said 'clothed.'  That's a very small distinction and not enough to hang a theory on in my opinion.

       Don't you see, it's not about hanging my theory on this, it's about the media hanging their theory on theirs- WORSE- all the search engine news reports now say he was FULLY clothed- which is NOT from the coroner's mouth. Given the situation in which Robin died, this small distinction, as you call it, is very BIG, and part of the reason in which it has been switched in all the news stories which all now use the adjective "fully" clothed, even though the coroner does NOT say this.

       The media reports are based on police and coroner reports.  Those reports are based on physical findings present at the scene - a clothed body with a belt around its neck, presenting with a condition and lividity consistent with suicide.  The body is determined to be that of a late-middle aged male with a history of alcohol and drug dependence, depression and a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (a degenerative disease for which there is no cure).
      </p>
      <p>
       Your theory is based on a Deputy Coroner's statement (one sentence out of an 18 minute press conference) that the body was "clothed" and not necessarily "fully clothed" and that the position the body was found in would have made it easy for the decedent to open the door to the closet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were auto erotic asphyxiation and the door knob was in reach of his hand, why not just open the door?

       It's not impossible;  however, I find it more likely that he killed himself deliberately.

       Also, as far as your note theory goes, the deputy coroner, in the video you provided, refers to "the note" and then corrects himself to "a note" so it is possible he left a note, they just don't want to release the contents.

       Here's what you don't get (among many other things). My theory is based on the FACTS presented by the coroner. It's the mainstream media, and idiots like you, who have determined Robin Williams committed suicide. I believe the facts, but I do not believe the media's interpretation of those facts.

       look, I believe you, not leaving a note does happen. And that MIGHT have been the case with Robin, BUT a suicide note would confirm suicide, and at this point, I'm looking for evidence to support one theory or the other.

       No sir you are the fucking retard.  This was a preliminary press conference.  A real coroner's report would be better at explaining your point.  But since facts to you are whatever is on youtube it's no wonder you encountering resistence in this thread.  Go catch fire scott.

       Here's what I think. Ironically, the wife and assistant were protecting Robin from the same 'embarrassing' death Robin saved his son from in the movie The World's Greatest Dad (someone posted a link). To do this, they would have put some clothes on him. Having said that, if it were confirmed he was "fully clothed," that would point heavily toward suicide. Again, I'm looking for evidence that points one way strongly or the other. A note, being fully clothed, these point to suicide. Everything else, to me, points to autoerotic asphyxiation.
