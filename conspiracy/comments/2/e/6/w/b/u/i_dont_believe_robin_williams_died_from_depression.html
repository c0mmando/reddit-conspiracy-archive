        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t think Robin Williams&#39; death is helping people w/ depression. If anything, the idea that a man with so much to live for would take his life makes anyone else with depression feel that much more hopeless. I&#39;m going to let you in on a more likely scenario b/c depression awareness is NOT more important than people w/ depression getting one step closer to killing themselves b/c they think Robin did too. So if the mainstream view is a lie, the ends do NOT justify the means. </p>

<p>Robin was found clothed, not fully according to the coroner. He was found in the seated position leaning against the closet door, the belt was in the top of the closet door frame. All he would have to do is twist the door knob, the door would open and the belt would pop out. This is the exact position people put themselves in during autoerotic asphyxiation. Even the cuts on his wrist were consistent with masochistic tendencies, not suicide since they were superficial and horizontal, not vertical. Unless a suicide note surfaces, which as of now has not been confirmed or denied by the coroner, I for one would think that Robin died with a happy ending. Sorry if you don&#39;t like my theory, but it comforts me knowing he didn&#39;t throw it all away on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media reports are based on police and coroner reports.  Those reports are based on physical findings present at the scene - a clothed body with a belt around its neck, presenting with a condition and lividity consistent with suicide.  The body is determined to be that of a late-middle aged male with a history of alcohol and drug dependence, depression and a recent diagnosis of Parkinson&#39;s disease (a degenerative disease for which there is no cure).  </p>

<p>Your theory is based on a Deputy Coroner&#39;s statement (one sentence out of an 18 minute press conference) that the body was &quot;clothed&quot; and not necessarily &quot;fully clothed&quot; and that the position the body was found in would have made it easy for the decedent to open the door to the closet.</p>

<p>If it were auto erotic asphyxiation and the door knob was in reach of his hand, why not just open the door?  </p>

<p>Also, as far as your note theory goes, the deputy coroner, in the video you provided, refers to &quot;the note&quot; and then corrects himself to &quot;a note&quot; so it is possible he left a note, they just don&#39;t want to release the contents.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I think. Ironically, the wife and assistant were protecting Robin from the same &#39;embarrassing&#39; death Robin saved his son from in the movie The World&#39;s Greatest Dad (someone posted a link). To do this, they would have put some clothes on him. Having said that, if it were confirmed he was &quot;fully clothed,&quot; that would point heavily toward suicide. Again, I&#39;m looking for evidence that points one way strongly or the other. A note, being fully clothed, these point to suicide. Everything else, to me, points to autoerotic asphyxiation. </p>
