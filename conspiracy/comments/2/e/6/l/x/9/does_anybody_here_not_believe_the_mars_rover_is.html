       Its really on Pluto, but with it not being a planet now NASA thought people would lose interest and so they continue to keep up this whole Mars charade.

       From what I've seen a lot of people who believe the moon missions were faked think they were done by unmanned vehicles, so I think even those people would believe the mars rover was possible.

       Well one of the theories (maybe only in my own head) is that Mars is fairly well developed and militarized, and the Mars rover is intended to give the impression that we're just now getting there, just now exploring a barren surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have similar thoughts about the Moon.

       Not really, just whispers. You read snippets here and there from former military, former CIA. The Kubrick material shows that
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of the moon landing video was fake. But why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes me think: If I were an evil super-villain with unlimited resources, what would
       <strong>
        I
       </strong>
       do? A: A base on the far side of the moon, mining O3. And a base on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, the "If I were an evil super-villain" approach seems to work pretty well...

       Exactly, I was wondering if there was anyone who didn't believe it, and I figured this was the place to ask. Didn't realise everyone would be so uptight abt it - it's hardly the most crazy theory out there.

       I came here out of interest in the question, as nobody is opposing it there isn't anything to talk abt is there? Do u want to discuss something we both believe and create some imaginary conflict to play out?

       Sorry, I'm just so sick of this place getting raided

       If you're genuinely just asking a question I apologize

      <p>
       Here, let me atleast say this. The reason I don't think it was faked is because we have definitely been to the moon since the first landing (whether or not it was fake). And the technology it took to get into space doesn't even compare to my calculator. I honestly believe we are capable of sending even humans to mars. Oh wait, we defended nasa &gt;:(

       I think you're just being too vague and open ended.. you came here and posed a question, looking for someone to respond with what you already personally believe - whether you were looking for personal validation or maybe afraid that your own beliefs would be rejected before a dialogue can begin is irrelevant because all of your replies have been non-descript and added nothing to the conversation...
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I personally believe that it's an inhabited planet, at least in the multi-dimensional sense. I believe that there are questionable things raised in the photos that Nasa has been delivering, whether they're real or not... and I think that the billions of dollars of undocumented black budget projects could easily support a much more advanced space exploration program under the guise of military expansion.... So, whatever the real case is - we're getting spoonfed bullshit, with just enough truth to make it believable for those happy enough to occupy their days with repetitive menial tasks and polarized reality TV competitions at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       We won't know, until we do... likely, when the powers that be are disassembled, leaving behind decades of secret technological developments that have been repressed, mostly because the current enforced systems of control are accomplishing the intended results.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about next time, you do some research, pull some points, string together some sentences - fuck, even throw a theory or idea or hypothesis my way and we'll do our best to have an actual discussion. I'll take it slow, value honest dialogue and am open to changing my understanding/opinions based on information/arguments presented. Don't put yourself and your ideas on a pedestal waiting for someone to come along and do your formal arguing for you, you're wasting time and essentially covering your own ass, afraid of le olde downvote brigade - because up and down arrows have any kind of real impact on our life. It's lazy, and it will never produce the outcome you seem to be looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Create a new topic, maybe we can get some interested parties involved in the co-creation of a discussion supporting/denying/investigating/hell-even just pondering your purposed hypothesis.

       I don't have a hypothesis abt the Mars rover, I believe the status quo. I came here to find someone like you. I repeat; I have no alternative theory or hypothesis, I believe wholeheartedly in all the official information pertaining to the Mars rover expedition. 
I came here to see if someone such as yourself would exist. It turns out, you do.

       Actually, I purpose no "alternative theories". We live in a quantum universe, I have heavily researched string theory/m-theory and their pertaining to multiple dimensions, of which - in infinite possibilities - one of those dimensions would inevitably have had a combination of factors that would produce the circumstances and inevitably the viability for life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't claim that the mars rovers pictures are either real or unreal, but use heavily supported and openly documented knowledge around the US's black budget, and from there assert that the amount of money WOULD easily support a militarily backed space research/exploration program. Again, I have no proof of this, but it's a logical conclusion that the military complex would want to remain a foothold in the space race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I've asserted that it's obvious that technology has been repressed to retain the current system of standards, as the infastructure already exists and the global economy is ultimately dependent on the energy consumption of a limited fuel source, thus creating a controlled market. It makes sense that those garnering the most profits from this market would not want any technology that would undercut their profit margins divulged to the public. We've seen this with electric motor vehicles being the easiest example often referred to.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe the "status quo" why did you come here? Why were you hoping to sniff out individuals "such as [myself, who] exist"? The whole point of presenting a topic is to be a part of the ensuing discussion... you don't seem to have anything to add constructively, in critique or otherwise to anyone's replies... so.. did you ultimately just come here to mock? I just don't know what you want, and it's exactly why you're getting downvoted... there's no back and forth, witty rhetoric, analysis or otherwise and I'm not even sure what you believe I've turned out to be? I do my best to follow everything to it's most logical conclusions, I find r/conspiracy to be an interesting outlet for those who wish to question outside of the status quo or at least to question the existence of the status quo...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I was expecting something more out of this, there's been a lot of interesting space related news/posts the past few days, all over reddit... I guess I'll go contribute to those conversations. Laters Titties.

       You can't just string together a huge list of thoughts peppered with unnecessary words to make it sound intelligent. I didn't ask whether you believed in quantum physics or the existence of life in alternative realities mate, I asked everyone if they thought the Mars rover was really on Mars. You clearly think it is, though are reluctant to admit it for some reason. I'm not very interested in how intelligent you think you are. Most of what you said is not even remotely related to what I was asking. You've answered my very simple question now please stop replying to this thread.

       Its really on Pluto, but with it not being a planet now NASA thought people would lose interest and so they continue to keep up this whole Mars charade.
