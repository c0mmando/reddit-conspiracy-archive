       Not in the conventional sense. There can't be a WW3 in that everyone has nukes. No matter what the US or Russia do, they can't attack each other without blowing up the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they can try to destroy each other's economies, spread lies to try and stir unrest in the opposing populous, and attack each other's allies (ie. proxy wars).
      </p>

       Having said all that the REAL "world" war is the bankers/Fortune 500/.001% versus the citizens of this planet.  THAT my friend is who will enslave us all. It won't be Russia or China.

       bingo.
      </p>
      <p>
       US wants to run the world (via the banking system and the dollar)... the irony in all this is that the US probably doesn't even really want to rule the world, they've racked up so much debt though that this is their only option. It's either rule everything (especially the monetary supply) or go broke.

       The reason
       <a href="/u/joekerr37">
        /u/joekerr37
       </a>
       underestimates the likelihood of war is because he doesn't follow the consequences of the US dollar hegemony collapsing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the empire collapses before the government is seized by the people and used to turn things around, there will be mass rioting, starvation, etc.  Something resembling a zombie apocalypse.  The US doesn't have enough light sweet crude to run it's economy without imports.    If it had to pay fair price for them tomorrow, even if they were still available, it would mean instant collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't have much left except whatever sustainable underground bases there are if the dollar hegemony fails prior to revamping of the economy.  In this environment, sacrificing the surface to nuclear Armageddon isn't a big deal because you've already written it off as a loss anyway.  If you manage to pull off a first strike to cripple the other side, whatever of yours that survives is a bonus that you didn't expect to have anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how the psychos in D.C. think.  You can bet your last dollar on it.

       if they thought that way they'd have blown up the world already.

      <p>
       They don't want to rule of a world of ash. They want to rule over this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to remember that all the people in power have amazing lives. They eat the best food, are swimming in money, are treated like royalty, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes they squabble with each other and try to amass more and more power and what not, but at the end of the day they don't want to destroy the world (enslave it sure, destroy it no).
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin or Obama doesn't want to have to go live in some underground bunker for the rest of his life surrounded by 500 other elites all trapped waiting for when they can return to the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would MUCH rather enjoy what's left of their current life.

       I really can't fathom why you would say this.  The US still has dollar hegemony.  It isn't guaranteed that US hegemony will end.  Why on Earth blow up the planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, various others are trying to challenge US finance hegemony.  We blew up Libya because they tried to create an African Union currency based on gold.  We blew up Saddam for trying to switch oil trade to Euros.  We contain Iran for similar reasons.  We're attacking Russia in Syria and Ukraine and Obama has started a geopolitical "pivot" to Asia building up forward deployments there because China is making noise about moving away from the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are skirmishes in a larger conflict which isn't entirely decided.  Launching nukes now would be preemptive and without cause.  I'm talking about a possible future date when it is decided by US policy makers that they have lost the ability to retain financial hegemony.  We're not quite there yet.

       It's all saber rattling until the usa gets their LNG tanker depots up and running to sell cheap fracked natural gas to the world.  Once the rug gets pulled out from under Russia ' economy they have a potential to be very dangerous.  They will try to scuttle the eu/usa economy before that,  so things will be interesting over the next 10 years... but nothing is likely to happen in the next few years I think.

       Not in the same sense as WWI and WWII. WWIII is an ongoing, long drawn out type of war consisting of economic destruction, famine, disease, control, etc... I'd be really surprised if someone dropped a nuke on another country.

       Conventional warfare still exists in order to give the illusion that people control their fate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latest weapons are built to mimic nature... think missiles disguised as meteors, artificial earthquakes, viruses, storms etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you get hit by a fake meteor make sure to blame nature or God mmkaay? Don't look at me, that's what it says in the script.

       I agree with ya magnora2. The nukes will be used. In the US, I predict a financial collapse which will bring about looting and rioting, then marshall law. Must go to war to blame the financial collapse on the war.

       Agreed, that may very well happy. Then as the Euro and USD and Yen collapse, along with the economies that are dependent on them, the BRICS version of the IMF will step in to pick up the slack and offer their new basket currency as a stable alternative. My guess is China will sit back and let Russia do the heavy lifting in terms of war, and then China be there to pick up the pieces and help the US and Western Europe rebuild, similar to how the US became rich from rebuilding Europe after WW2. Sort of a good cop/bad cop strategy. The nukes will be the finale, just like in WW2. That's all speculation, of course, but that's my best guess.

       They sure as hell are trying their hardest to force it.  Yet again, heavy Mossad involvement from the onset.  Their poor job hiding their stored coph of the exact plane used in the last two "incidents."

      <p>
       This is exactly where us speaking up, proving their involvement and the critical flaws in their engineered stories will be critical.  WE were able to stop public US involvement removing Assad.  Not on our watch, Zionist scum.

       Yeah but I don't think Europe will participate on it at all. It'll be between U.S. and Russia and Europe will let both sides duke it out to destabilize both countries and nit pick the spoils like the U.S. did during WW1 and WW2. People who think it'll be a breeze and like WW1 and 2 are very much wrong, there is no way the U.S. is going to come out on top as it did after those two world wars if it's fought in here and in Russia. I also expect other countries like Iran, Israel, China to take advantage of the chaos.
