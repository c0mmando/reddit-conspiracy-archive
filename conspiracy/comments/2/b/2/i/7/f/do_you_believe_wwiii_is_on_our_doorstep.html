<p>US wants to run the world (via the banking system and the dollar)... the irony in all this is that the US probably doesn&#39;t even really want to rule the world, they&#39;ve racked up so much debt though that this is their only option. It&#39;s either rule everything (especially the monetary supply) or go broke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason <a href="/u/joekerr37">/u/joekerr37</a> underestimates the likelihood of war is because he doesn&#39;t follow the consequences of the US dollar hegemony collapsing.</p>

<p>If the empire collapses before the government is seized by the people and used to turn things around, there will be mass rioting, starvation, etc.  Something resembling a zombie apocalypse.  The US doesn&#39;t have enough light sweet crude to run it&#39;s economy without imports.    If it had to pay fair price for them tomorrow, even if they were still available, it would mean instant collapse.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t have much left except whatever sustainable underground bases there are if the dollar hegemony fails prior to revamping of the economy.  In this environment, sacrificing the surface to nuclear Armageddon isn&#39;t a big deal because you&#39;ve already written it off as a loss anyway.  If you manage to pull off a first strike to cripple the other side, whatever of yours that survives is a bonus that you didn&#39;t expect to have anyway.</p>

<p>This is how the psychos in D.C. think.  You can bet your last dollar on it.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t want to rule of a world of ash. They want to rule over this world. </p>

<p>You have to remember that all the people in power have amazing lives. They eat the best food, are swimming in money, are treated like royalty, etc.  </p>

<p>Yes they squabble with each other and try to amass more and more power and what not, but at the end of the day they don&#39;t want to destroy the world (enslave it sure, destroy it no). </p>

<p>Putin or Obama doesn&#39;t want to have to go live in some underground bunker for the rest of his life surrounded by 500 other elites all trapped waiting for when they can return to the surface. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I really can&#39;t fathom why you would say this.  The US still has dollar hegemony.  It isn&#39;t guaranteed that US hegemony will end.  Why on Earth blow up the planet?</p>

<p>Now, various others are trying to challenge US finance hegemony.  We blew up Libya because they tried to create an African Union currency based on gold.  We blew up Saddam for trying to switch oil trade to Euros.  We contain Iran for similar reasons.  We&#39;re attacking Russia in Syria and Ukraine and Obama has started a geopolitical &quot;pivot&quot; to Asia building up forward deployments there because China is making noise about moving away from the dollar.</p>

<p>These are skirmishes in a larger conflict which isn&#39;t entirely decided.  Launching nukes now would be preemptive and without cause.  I&#39;m talking about a possible future date when it is decided by US policy makers that they have lost the ability to retain financial hegemony.  We&#39;re not quite there yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, that may very well happy. Then as the Euro and USD and Yen collapse, along with the economies that are dependent on them, the BRICS version of the IMF will step in to pick up the slack and offer their new basket currency as a stable alternative. My guess is China will sit back and let Russia do the heavy lifting in terms of war, and then China be there to pick up the pieces and help the US and Western Europe rebuild, similar to how the US became rich from rebuilding Europe after WW2. Sort of a good cop/bad cop strategy. The nukes will be the finale, just like in WW2. That&#39;s all speculation, of course, but that&#39;s my best guess. </p>
