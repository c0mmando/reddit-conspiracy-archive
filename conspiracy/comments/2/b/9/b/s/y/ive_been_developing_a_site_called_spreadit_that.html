        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks I&#39;ve been developing a somewhat experimental site which falls into the category of link aggregator with voting &amp; comments. I&#39;ve been rushing to develop it faster as I see reddit fall further everyday.
So, some of the serious issues I saw:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The automatic downvoting of content / vote brigading. The same goes for upvote-brigading to push certain content to the front page. </p></li>
<li><p>Moderators censoring</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of actual privacy (no https)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I haven&#39;t solved these problems completely, but I think I am on to something with this design. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It costs a point to upvote or downvote somebody else. When a user is completely out of points he can no longer post / interact with the site. </p></li>
<li><p>There are no moderators other than myself.. and I wont moderate unless there is something that puts my legal status in jeopardy by having it on the site. I am incredibly anti-censorship, and have some history with Tor including running a router &amp; making a few other sites designed for anonymity. </p></li>
<li><p>All votes on comments &amp; posts can be seen by clicking a link right next to the vote buttons.</p></li>
<li><p>https always on, as well as a tor hidden service available. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>It still is new and really not tested well so if you run into a bug I&#39;d appreciate it if you let me know. I created a /s/theory in case you want to play around with it. Hoping to hear any feedback / ideas / thoughts. <a href="https://spreadit.io">link</a>. </p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;d like updates on the progress via reddit I&#39;ve made a subreddit <a href="/r/spreadit_io">/r/spreadit_io</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There needs to be a way to discriminate spam and to ban spammers &amp; trolls and propagandists openly in a transparent manner. Downvotes don&#39;t hide comments at all - doesn&#39;t even move their position (might change this in future). </p>

<p>Since downvoting costs a point whereas commenting is free I would think that people would move more towards commenting if someone was wrong/disagreement rather than just downvoting them as downvoting punishes you both equally.</p>

<p>Might be cool to have some spreadits with {no downvoting, no upvoting, no voting, regular voting} though, I could try to implement something like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds bad but honestly you have to design and prepare around shills and bots. The best way is by limiting what they can do. You have to also think you can&#39;t eliminate the human element of real people being paid to vote/comment a certain way.</p>

<p>Downvotes are unnecessary. Good content will get a nod from many users whereas crap won&#39;t. The absence of up votes in effect are down votes. This eliminates shills trying to hide content they dislike.</p>

<p>Then you have shill comments. To prevent bots, make a captcha system. For humans you&#39;ll just have to deal with it. Unless you can come up with some smart algorithm which can determine shill accounts from legit users.. Good luck.</p>

<p>Now you will always need a report feature for spam and disrespectful members.</p>

<p>Be careful with moderation. It&#39;s a necessary evil but do be careful in who and how it&#39;s implemented. The shills and fiends hate transparency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s a cool idea, I&#39;ve written down in me notes. And I agree with you on your second point as well, I think maaaybe the point system would stop people from voting on something prior to reading it but alas I have no real clue. I think that it is hard to really fix as it is more of a widespread human condition.. but perhaps there is a way. Though I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve seen a site yet where it wasn&#39;t an issue. Luckily people trying to psyche everyone up for their latest kickstarter fraud is pretty minor issue compared to people trying to cover up the people they kill and spy on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine any centralized website you develop would eventually by manipulated should it become successful a la reddit. The trick to overcoming this is to reduce your points of failure, and atm the biggest point of failure is you OP as the single moderator (no offence). </p>

<p>Perhaps a voting system based on cryptocurrency could alleviate some of the spam problems by incorporating scarcity and large-scale cost into the core voting mechanism (see Mike Hearn&#39;s &#39;Lighthouse&#39; project for inspiration). </p>

<p>Decentralizing is key to the longevity of any network and I would value this attribute above moderation of any kind. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re working on this growing problem. </p>

<p>No, I agree. I just trust myself more than other people; but it should really be trustless and proven secure from manipulation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, I was thinking about this.. if votes on site were satoshi&#39;s or something and we just put the necessary ids in OP_RETURN. I would love if people were far enough along to be able to use other cc&#39;s, but at this point I don&#39;t think it is feasible to have a decently sized site with verification using a coin other than btc... btc alone would very severely limit users - but its something to look into. </p>

<p>My main goal is to have all site data available so it can be obvious that no manipulation is happening (by me) - and gives users the ability to run statistics on other users better.. (so we can find the 200 nestle accounts or whatever it may be). This isn&#39;t the best possible setup but I think it is a good improvement from the current walled garden sites. NSA already has our data and they are the biggest threat, it doesn&#39;t matter if <a href="/u/comicalecaholic">/u/comicalecaholic</a> has it as well. </p>

<p>Decentralization is the future as far as stability goes; it has very interesting properties if implemented correctly. Very dynamic systems can emerge. </p>

<p>&amp; On your side note- I took a look at it- perhaps I&#39;ll try to do something with selecting different themes or something for preferences. I think unless there is a big call for it to not have the subreddit styling reddit has all over I think most of it sucks.. prefer single theme across sites. </p>

I think if you divided the point scoresheet for each individual spreadit it may be better, so someone who is popular in a garbage spreadit for example like <a href="/r/adviceanimals">/r/adviceanimals</a> doesnt have sway over discussion in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, or maybe remove that system altogether as it promotes point whoring and groupthink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll preface this by saying I have no programming or computer science experience what so ever. But I am an active citizen of the internet and would love to offer you my praise for your endeavor.</p>

<p>I have a cool idea that is probably all kinds of illegal and at the very least involves &#39;criminal&#39; hacking knowledge. But I was thinking it would be a good system to have an upvote threshold where let&#39;s say the &quot;truth behind 9/11 confirmed&quot; was posted, or any story of equal significance. Once such a story reaches X amount of upvotes, it is automatically sent out to every mainstream media outlet possible.</p>

<p>The illegal version would be along the lines of posting significant stories directly to as many individual media devices as possible. The more legal one might be sending an automatic email to every reporter at every news station out there.</p>

<p>The effect would be every person with a voice being notified that every person who gives a damn has decided that they give the most damns about this particular story. </p>

<p>I think this would maximize the chances of a story spreading virally as well as put pressure on the mainstream media to report what needs to be reported.</p>

<p>It will also help in the identification of news agencies who are blatantly ignoring important stories and from there, they could be blacklisted as misinforation sources.</p>
