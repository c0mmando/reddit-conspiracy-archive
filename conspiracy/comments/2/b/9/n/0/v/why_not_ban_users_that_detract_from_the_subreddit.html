<p>To take such drastic action, which has crossed my mind briefly in the past (though not the extent of bringing it up), would have to be a last resort option. </p>

<p>While we have had an influx of users who post here solely with the intent of engaging in straw man arguments, forum sliding if you will, without having any other prior interest in posting to r/conspiracy, those how have an apparent agenda (whether it be corporate, pro-government, political, or simply to express an anti-conspiracist viewpoint), it would be hypocritical at best, quite literally a form of censorship to ban them in such an arbitrary manner.</p>

<p>Considering your post history, I can see why OP&#39;s suggestion would rub you the wrong way, or make you react in such a defensive manner. </p>

<p>According to his proposal, he would not be subject to a ban for simply expressing an opinion. His idea was to target those who habitually disrupt or derail the conversation, those would have made it obvious they other interest in posting to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>And if the &quot;Fine by me&quot; comment wasn&#39;t enough to ban OP after his own rules, then the dragon comment clearly is.</p>

<p>Since poking fun at the more absurd comments and posts isn&#39;t allowed here, people take it to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. Isn&#39;t it better to have those comments elsewhere? I don&#39;t think we should ban someone just because of where they comment, post or read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably to avoid censorship. Though, there are some truely obvious trolls around here. Definately a few users could dissappear and no one would be sad about it.</p>

<p>But again, its all about perspective. I actually kind of agree to not ban users who make noncontributional comments/submissions. After several warnings and advice on how to contribute constructively though, and if thry still fail after those attempts, then i would be okay with such bans. </p>

<p>What ive learned this far on reddit, some users just simply dont understand how to submit posts. They will submit low invest posts, but when i call them out on it, they typically fix it and repost a more contributional submission on the same topic.</p>

<p>What im saying is we need to give people a chance to learn first, and when they arrogantly refuse to respect discussional paradigms, then i wouldnt mind hearing the thump of the banhammer, so long as moderator discretion makes it publicly known about the warnings and shit.</p>

<p>I hope all this was coherent enough... Havent had my morning coffee yet...</p>

<p>With all due respect, this seems to resemble circular logic too much for my taste. </p>

<p>Anyways, i do not agree with banning a user just because they post at, say, r/conspiratard. I do not support that notion whatsoever. </p>

<p>I do support banning users who show their true character, which can only be revealed if given the benefit of the doubt. I could care less if they offer me the same in return. </p>

<p>By blanket-banning folks because of their other subscriptions is tantamount to oppression and tyranny, everything this sub is fighting against. </p>

<p>If we ban anybody, it needs to be because of their history in r/conspiracy. Because they have continued to post low invest submissions, racist submissions, or noncontributional submissions. But only after warnings and clear and public transparency for the reasons of banishment. </p>

<p>Otherwise, we would be no better than TPTB.</p>
