       I've always had a hunch that Kurt Cobain was murdered and that his crazy wife Courtney Love was somehow involved. But that's all it was, a hunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking if this community has any information to bolster this theory?

       I remember that. And the heroin is the one fact that I have always pointed to. Somewhere along the way I remember hearing that the gun was too long for him to operate, but maybe that's just a rumor.

       I definitely believe if she didnt pull the trigger herself she was definitely the one that drove him to suicide. There was a documentary about Colbain and they never explicitly say she was implicated but they push you in that direction, Ill see if I can find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the heroin aspect hardcore users can have a wild tolerance, especially opiates.

       The BBC did an interesting documentary about Kurt Cobain and touched off the theory that Kurt could have been murdered. They spoke to a man (who admittedly did seem to suffer from mental illness) who claimed he was approached by Courtney to kill Kurt. The man was found dead within days of the interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       The production crew also got an answering machine message from Courtney Love herself who was extremely abusive and threatening.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a compelling watch.

       I was a huge Kurt Cobain/Nirvana fan.  I remember that my father owned a gun of similar length and that when I told my dad (not a nirvana or cobain fan) he answers "how can you commit suicide like that, the gun is too long".
      </p>
      <p>
       I've thought someone else was in the room with him that night since then.  I do not believe it was murder though.  Cobain had long dealt with nasty stomach pain.  I saw him twice on stage wince and grab his stomach going off stage.  When I won a contest and got to go back stage, I saw him walking around with pepto bismal three different times and he wasn't able to meet us due to stomach pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he was taking pain meds for that, which probably made an undiagnosed ulcer much worse and painful and ultimately mixed with his depression he was ready to die, and he found someone to help him.

       I have no clue what happened, but it doesn't make much sense for Courtney to have killed him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, she got control of his royalties (or did that go to his daughter?)... but regardless she would have been way richer if he had lived.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen any clear cut evidence, just theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's face, dude was most likely clinically depressed. Guy was on top of the world and in every interview he did his speech was slurred and mumbled...you could tell he was not enjoying any of the fame and fortune he had accumulated.
