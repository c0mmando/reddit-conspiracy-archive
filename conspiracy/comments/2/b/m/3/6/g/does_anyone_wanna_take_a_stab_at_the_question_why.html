    <div class="md"><p>Its not very reasonable to record events or information on a sheet or tablet of gold. Yes, you can use it as an adornment, but is that something people would spend their lives on - digging for things to be melted into jewelry? Do you have a practical use for it other than adornment, currency, and I guess in electronics?  Currency and electronics are nixed as reasons, as electronics were most likely not being made, and currency is what it became once people started giving it value. That leaves jewelry.  Maybe I&#39;m different than most people, but I can&#39;t wrap my head around laboring hard for something that gives no physical reward.</p>

<p>Actually, i would think it to be extremely reasonable to do so, as gold does not react to its environment as it is very stable, and it never corrodes or tarnishes, so whatever marking/engravings/whatever could potentially last tens or even hundreds of thousands of years without losing its legibility... Thats very important, at least in my opinion, as i view writing as one of the greatest inventions of all time...</p>

<p>There have been, and will always be some people who have certain &quot;necessities&quot; (food, water, shelter, tools, sex) that other humans want, and will trade for. </p>

<p>Humans who had a surplus of &quot;necessities&quot; needed a way of getting paid, storing and measuring their wealth, and that, paradoxically was going to be something which wasn&#39;t particularly useful, but was rare, indestructible and recognisable.</p>

<p>Gold satisfies all these requirements, and crucially, it is hard to fake - not just because it is uniquely yellow and soft, but solid gold was the densest material known for thousands of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>kind of. Look into monoatomic gold.</p>

<p>before you say anything, i understand that its a stretch. But since we are bio-electric, we still conduct electricity, and having gold as a mineral supplement would do wonders.</p>

<p>FYI- mono gold does not look like the same yellow, its a bright white/yellow powder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to some theories, &quot;gods&quot; came down from the heavens to earth in order to acquire gold. They needed this gold to fix their atmosphere on their home world. These &quot;gods&quot; created humans to toil the mines to extract the gold. Theze humans had no idea why the gold was important, they only understood that it was importantbto their &quot;gods.&quot;</p>

<p>When an individual human pleased the &quot;gods&quot; in such a way, they were rewarded with small bits of gold, which the humans placed such importance and value on it because it was so important to their &quot;gods.&quot; Once their &quot;gods&quot; had enough gold, they went back home, leaving a confused race of beings behind, with gold being the main artifacts left behind for humans to value. Over generations, this reverance for gold grew along with the natural tendency for those with power to grow gluttonous for more.</p>

<p><strong><em>Or</em></strong> it could be because gold is one of the only metals (possibly the only, someone help me out here) that never tarnishes and is incredibly stable amd doesnt decay or react with the environment. This would prove to he beneficial for jewelry and and portraying status within the community.</p>

<p>Gold has been valued for many thousands of years, so it cant be about its wonderful electrical conductivity, or, once powdered into an incredibly small dust, proves to be a fantastic atmospheric fixer-upper, as these things are relatively new findings (unless you believe the theories about yhe baghdad batteries and ancient egypt having electricity, which i think is at least plausible.)</p>

<p>Therr are a million different answer, but no one knows which one or which ones are true. But, if you believe in aliens as i do (but not <em>necessarily</em> the ancient astronaut theories), then maybe the first explanation works for you. If not, then the others could be fine, too. But i like the idea of aliens. It fascinates me. (Everyones got that one theory that nobody else finds plausible, right?)</p>

<p>This guy seems to think that gold separates itself due to its ability to be chemically stable with all other elements on earth.  But I think this article talks about how other elements can&#39;t be as valuable as gold because of certain properties they have.
I have read some of Zechariah Sitchin&#39;s books and I would have to agree with his theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting read.  The whole basis for his theory is that it was a deliberate act, because a currency was desired, and gold made the best choice out of the elements.  Which begs the question - how do you convince someone to take this shiny, chemically inert metal, in exchange for 15 cows, a sheep, and a ton of corn? How were people convinced to switch from barter to currency?  Was it seriously just blind faith? Someone said, &quot;we are gonna pay you in gold&quot; and everyone else just trusted it?</p>

<p>just saying, but there are gemstones which could easily be said to be worth tens of thousands of dollars, but for what reason?
Emeralds, rubies, sapphires, opals, etc  might have had spiritual aspects that we do not know of, so the very same might be considered of gold</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gold represents debt. Or it used to. Debt has existed as a functional concept in societies for at least 5000 years. People used all kinds of things as a proxy for value. Nails, chips of wood, seashells, etc. It functioned in place of barter because there was an understanding in the small communities of the proxy value and how the debts would transfer from person to person based on the transactions. </p>

<p>In larger societies, the state would regulate the proxy value by minting coins. Gold and silver functioned well for this use because it was difficult to acquire new sources of large quantities of the metals which helped secure its value. It also served no practical purpose so a state wouldnt be hurting itself as it would if it had to devote a needed resource to minting a fuck load of coins.</p>

<p>The other part of it is that the gold smiths were the ones with the big vaults to store their gold. People deposited their stuff in these vaults because they didn&#39;t have protection like that themselves. This is how gold became the defacto backup currency for paper money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most metals do degrade - with the exception of gold. Even silver reacts with sulfur. However, metals such as iron/steel and copper had actual everyday uses - from swords and axes to mirrors and handles. Gold would do poorly for these uses.</p>

<p>Why would a gold smith need to store your gold for you if it didn&#39;t already have value? Your scenario would take place after gold had been given value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>possibly. remember that salt was once more valuable than gold, hence the word sal-ary from ancient Rome</p>

<p>but gold was, depending on whether you look at pre- or post- empire forging, either a spiritual metal that allowed you to commune with or be on par with the &#39;gods&#39;, or &quot;oooh-shiny-shiny-wanderlust lets start a caste system&quot;</p>

<p>Might you consider ingesting gold if it was in its ionic salt form?</p>

<p>Knowing what gold as a metal does in the form of wires and such, do you think it would translate to the human body in a similar way?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gold is shiny. And it&#39;s fairly rare. And it takes energy to extract. People like to have things that other people don&#39;t have. If there was lots and lots of gold, it would not be rare, and so it would never have become a symbol of wealth, and nobody would give a shit about it.</p>

<p>You are trying to apply logic to a bunch of illogical, irrational, emotional apes. Somewhere lost in the sands of time, a male ape found a gold nugget, found that it was soft and pliable when heated, made a ring like a lifesaver  and gave it to a female ape, and she saw that it was good, and she accepted it and permitted him to fornicate with her. Other female apes saw this shiny metal and decided that they, too, wanted shiny gold lifesavers on their fingers. And the apes lusted after gold almost as much as they lusted after each other, ever after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and they went on to land on the moon, and today these same apes buy diamonds purely due to marketing; diamonds have very little inherent value; and they are not even particularly rare at all. De Beers basically had a whole lot of shiny worthless little rocks until they came up with a marketing campaign. Yes, we apes build tall structures, skyscraper 120 stories, good enough for King Kong; we are still illogical, irrational, emotional apes who trade lumps of mostly useless but shiny rock for fornication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i cant say i disagree. But i do want to point out that correlation does not imply causation. Meaning, that yes humans have been infatuated with gold and diamond for some time now (gold for a much longer time), but our infatuation with gold and the reasons for that infatuation do not necessarily have to be for the same reasons we are infatuated with diamond, nor does our infatuation with gold necessitate the idea that the learned infatuation spread to diamonds in the same fashion and venerability. </p>

<p>You mentioned de beers using marketing schemes to bring value to diamonds. Im not too knowledgable about this specific topic, so ill assume you are right until i look into it more. But my point was that de beers diamond campaign may have caused us to become infatuated with diamond, but in addition to and not directly connected to our already existant infatuation with gold. </p>

<p>As far as i know, these are two seperate things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, when you think of it that way it makes no sence. But, bassically it was to make trade easier. Without the paper that shows a value it is just the bartter system. Say if I sell you a sword and you off 1 nugget of gold. I hold it and decide naw I was two nuggets. You agree and give me two. But come to find out those two nuggets are actually worth 5 swords. But there really is no way to know the true value of a sword vs a nugget. We only decide based on our deal. So trades weren&#39;t fair all the time. But with paper,, it allowed a price to be determined by the market. I want 10 slips but the next sword maker only wants 5. Then I have to match his price. It is an easier way to make sure both paries get a fair deal when there is a set price. </p>
