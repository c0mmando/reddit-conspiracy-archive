       Like a way of making it look like we are free when we really aren't possibly?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting though because the outlets for weed are so tiny that they can still maintain the illegal drug trade while pot is supposedly legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing I find odd is that many people claim pot is a way of defeating government mind control. I wonder if this could be disinfo and the opposite is true -  pot could facilitate mind control. LSD does supposedly...

       These are all possibilities. I do not think a government with an agenda wants to deal with a populace of critical thinkers discussing how they are getting fucked over by their owners. Russia uses cheap vodka (and the "tradition" propaganda tool) to squelch the possibility of a unified voice among the plebes.

       Not true, watch the video of LSD testing British soldiers.

      <p>
       They tell them "Go march with your guns and try and keep your squadron regimented".
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty shortly into the exercise all the men have put their guns down and are laughing with each other, having a great time.

       You put a person on LSD and tell them to pick up a gun and go kill somebody, they'll probably say "Hey somebody lock this guy up he's talking about killing people for no reason!".

       Seriously, LSD does NOT facilitate mind control, and neither does marijuana.

       The really dark shit in MK Ultra was about giving people huge doses to "wipe clean" the mind and start with a blank canvas. The experiments with soldiers were just tests to see how LSD could be use as an aerosolized weapon to render them useless. The difference between the two could be compared to electroshock therapy vs. licking a 9volt battery.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my personal experience, LSD allows one to see hidden patterns in our world, literally and figuratively. Cannabis is different in that it allows one to judge oneself and their connection to the world more objectively, but it does not seem to affect pattern recognition nearly as much a LSD or psylosibin. The most important thing to know is that these things are ALREADY INSIDE YOU. You do not necessarily need drugs to operate on a higher level than Joe Schmoe with a hangover. Correct meditation can be just as useful a tool, and more powerful because it is induced by you, not a drug.

       If anything, I think pot just subverts action... People get lazy. They may be among the most awakened, but they're way to bake'ned to do anything significant.

       There's also not enough stoners out there to march. The march on marijuana that happens every 4/20 isn't all that big. It wouldn't be enough to make shit happen.

       Another thing is that Monsanto wants in, and for all the alleged cancer cure benefits it fucks with fertility, which I'm sure is seen as a benefit in TPTBs efforts to reduce world population.

       They're not alleged, they're medicinally proven. Look up the patent as an anti-oxidant and neuroprotectant from 1999, it's on google. There's way more evidence than just that as well.

       It CAN fuck with fertility while consuming it, but stop consuming and you go entirely back to normal, there are no permanent fertility effects. The fertility claims are highly exaggerated.

       Well, it can go several ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         First, lets be positive. :-) Maybe the world isnt so bad afterall?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Second, lets be real. This
         <strong>
          <em>
           is
          </em>
         </strong>
         r/conspiracy, afterall. Maybe they are allowing it to he illegalized (or at least tolerating it) because they know marijuana typically pacifies its users --- meaning less chances of participation in  protests. You know how the song goes, "I was gonna protest, then i got high."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Next, moving on towards the more malicious intentions, maybe theyre allowing it tentatively for a more sinister reason. Maybe, once enough states legalize it, they will legalize it on the federal level, with the contingency that you must register for a "pot license" or something along those lines. Then, just like thebnazis did with firearms and registrations and then confiscations, they can do a complete 180 and make it illegal again, knowing where all the pot is, and putting all those horrible drug users in the slammer. There is a small historical precendence set on this. Awhile back before marijuana prohibition, they made it legal, but you had to get stamps put on your dimes  in order for it to be legit. The loophole for that was the only place you could get those stamps was washington dc. And, it just so happened that in dc at the time it was conpletely illegal. Meaning, for anyone who was trying to obey theblaw and get stamps on their weed, they had to bring their weed to dc, breaking the law, and getting incarcerated before ever getting the stamps.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Even worse, whether or not marijuana becomes illegal on the federal level, or if more states legalize it, it is still a controlled substance in the United Nations eyes. Since we are a part of the UN, i can foresee, in the event of more legalization, the UN using this "drug problem" of legalization as justification to place "peacekeepers" on U.S. soil, possibly as a precursor to martial law.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Interestingly enough, the most evil corporation in the world, Monsanto, is vying for a patent on a genetically modified version of marijuana, to be sold in uganda (if i remember correctly) who has made it completely legal in their country. I havent come to any conclusion on what theyll be doing with patented GMO marijuana, but man, its
         <em>
          Monsanto
         </em>
         . You can bet its not for the hippies cause. Its gotta be something evil thatll help them with their agenda. But to what ends? I dont know.

       I agree with a lot of this. I hate too see Monsanto lick its greedy lips at the possibilities of genetically engineering weed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think legalization gives us slaves the illusion that we can change things. They had to give the people something to release the pressure.

       I know this is r/conspiracy but MAYBE, just MAYBE, enough of the population partakes in marijuana use to be fed up with the illegality of it. People are tired of seeing communities being disproportionately represented in prisons.

       It facilitates non-linear thought via increasing long-range associations, leading users to question habitual beliefs, and so threatens cultural institutions. Could it be that current means of control make cultural brainwashing obsolete?
      </p>
      <p>
       The surveillance state is growing, income inequality reinforces oligarchial power, and 3-letter agencies have entire playbooks on thwarting meaningful change. On a more speculative note, there's the subliminal "entrainment" technology mentioned by Catherine Austin Fitts (former Bush I White House insider, in association with
       <em>
        Thrive

       producer Adam Trombly) said to be a tool in engineering consent.

       Well, if by 'they' you mean the American people then hell no. Marijuana usage has been a staple government resistance trademark since LBJ and prior to that cannabis was grown in half of every home garden in the country. They have been trying, sure. But it's called 'weed' for a reason. You pull it out of the ground and more grows up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, it's not illegal. The right to grow marijuana is a freedom protected under the 9th and 10th Amendment. The politicians enforcing an unconstitutional prohibition are the ones commiting the crime here.
