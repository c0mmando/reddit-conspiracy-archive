       Retired Gen. Garner: We should never have gone to war with Iraq
      </p>
      <p>
       The retired general who briefly led America's postwar Iraq reconstruction efforts said Tuesday that the war was a mistake, calling it one of many foreign-policy missteps that have emboldened U.S. enemies and contributed to unrest throughout the world.

      <p>
       "We should never have gone to war with Iraq," he told the Orlando Sentinel after the speech. President George W. Bush, he said, "let his advisers talk him into it. ... Plus, he had a burr in his saddle on Iraq because they made an assassination attempt on his father."
      </p>
      <p>
       (snip)

       Weighing in on the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas, Garner voiced strong support for Israel, which, he said, was responding correctly to rocket attacks from its enemies. He also criticized the media for overplaying the carnage and suffering of Palestinians in Gaza while failing to report enough on the indiscriminate firing of more than 1,600 rockets and missiles into Israel during the past 10 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       "People say, 'Well, the Israelis ought to back off,'" Garner told his audience. "Hell, no, they shouldn't back off. They need to go in there and clean all that up," he said to applause.

       How about, "We shouldn't have gone to war at all". The war in Afghanistan isn't "the good war" as some people believe.

       War-mongering, cheerleading fuckface through and through. He can take his false sentiments about Iraq and shove 'em. His real sentiments toward aggression and violence are visible.
