       Police are not military, they just think they are. Perhaps this is the reason they are building up the police state, because while some of the military may have disagreement, the police will not. Police have already been turning against their citizens, they been brainwashed longer. Military have been focused on "terrorists" in countries they occupy.

       I see how military don't apply orders in Gaza right now. How they are not blindly complying and they even turn the weapons against the criminals they give this wrong orders.

       Ah, wait, didn't happened. Actually they kill everyone as the order say. Look at that, even children.

       Second, I didn't state an opinion. The propaganda fed the military today is not anti-citizen, it's "anti-terrorism". It's "we have to fight them over there so we don't have to fight them here". I didn't claim they aren't brainwashed at all, I said they aren't brainwashed against their fellow citizens. On the contrary, they are made to believe they are fighting terror to protect their fellow citizens.

       In many conclusions you would find that the majourity of the global elites are psychopaths and/or sociopaths and theistic Satanists.
This cabal is hell-bent on control of all of the worlds monitary systems (and they control very many central banks and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) (the central bank of central banks)), influence many federal governments, control many big corporations.

      <p>
       There was a study done (but is not news to those that have been paying attention) that the USA is cancer/crony "capitalism"/plutocracy/corporatocracy/oligarchy, and the same with much of the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Church of Satan and the Satanic Bible of said church pertains to atheistic Satanism.

       Unless you can provide a coherent argument about how atheists are also satanists. I'm honestly interested in how a group that doesn't believe in Satan can also somehow worship him.

       So they don't actually believe in Satan, they just use him as a symbol? This doesn't make your point at all.

       You may as well link the church of the flying spaghetti monster. They don't believe in him in reality, but use him as a symbol to explain their beliefs.

       Many things regarding or under influence of the Global Elites have theistic Satanic symbolism and other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you heard of The Bohemian Grove/Club? They practice theistic Satanic rituals and whatnot. In the intro ceremony, they (now) have a mock sacrifice of a wire and machete effigy of a child and thrust down an old rusty dagger into the chest area and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware of the Global Elite's pedophile rings in the UK and the USA?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a documentary that was designated to air on the Discovery Channel,  but was banned bwfore it had a chance to air, called "Conspiracy of Silence" that dives into this. The book titled, "The Franklin Cover-up" is also informative. However these are not for the faint of heart.

       I'm in complete agreement about the pedophile cover up. The political players covered for their colleagues in order to maintain power. This has happened many times. Sandusky, Jimmy Saville, add any celebrity child toucher to this list. It's both real and disgusting.

       If you want a couple good reads regarding the Global Elites, then I suggest reading "The Illuminati: Facts &amp; Fiction" for some history in the Global Elites, and for more modern stuff, "The New World Order: Facts &amp; Fiction", both by Mark Dice. All of his books on the Global Elites and what not have sources in the backs of the books that consist of 10% of each book.

       Sorry,  I forgot to get back to you. I have found out that Mark Dice "muddies-the-waters" with a portion of truth and a portion of bullshit. However, many of the books he references to are legit, but he had taken things out of context from at least one of them.
