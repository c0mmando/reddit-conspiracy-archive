<p>Have you heard of The Bohemian Grove/Club? They practice theistic Satanic rituals and whatnot. In the intro ceremony, they (now) have a mock sacrifice of a wire and machete effigy of a child and thrust down an old rusty dagger into the chest area and whatnot.</p>

<p>Are you aware of the Global Elite&#39;s pedophile rings in the UK and the USA?</p>

<p>There is a documentary that was designated to air on the Discovery Channel,  but was banned bwfore it had a chance to air, called &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; that dives into this. The book titled, &quot;The Franklin Cover-up&quot; is also informative. However these are not for the faint of heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want a couple good reads regarding the Global Elites, then I suggest reading &quot;The Illuminati: Facts &amp; Fiction&quot; for some history in the Global Elites, and for more modern stuff, &quot;The New World Order: Facts &amp; Fiction&quot;, both by Mark Dice. All of his books on the Global Elites and what not have sources in the backs of the books that consist of 10% of each book.</p>

<p>There are a lot of references to that book, it should be a good read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be able to find a copy online. If not, Amazon has them in physical copies or as ebooks for cheaper.</p>

<p>I had already studied into shadow politics et al for a while before reading his books, however I learned stuff that I didn&#39;t really know or didn&#39;t know too much about until reading them.</p>

<p>Edit: Clarification.</p>

<p>Might sound odd, but is there anything else you could recommend? I&#39;m a bit new to this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry,  I forgot to get back to you. I have found out that Mark Dice &quot;muddies-the-waters&quot; with a portion of truth and a portion of bullshit. However, many of the books he references to are legit, but he had taken things out of context from at least one of them.</p>
