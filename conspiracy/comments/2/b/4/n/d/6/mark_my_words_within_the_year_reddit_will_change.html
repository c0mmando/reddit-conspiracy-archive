       I have been paying attention to this site for over 6 years. Given what I know, this is the next most logical step for the people controlling it. The users will go into a predictable uproar "OMG, reddit is becoming facebook". But then a few days later everyone will have forgotten and it will be back to business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a new phase of the government's plan will be complete. And using their facial recognition programs, they will be able to directly match people's identities with years of logged reddit comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will make flagging the "agitators" very easy.

       Thats about it. Why would they need our pictures to be uploaded when they probably have access to our entire history at any time, photos of us, everything. I'm certain your identity could be traced from any website or forum you post on or visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus, do people really think they're this far behind still? That they need to ask us for information to get it, there's no other method? I find that pretty comical.

       My rule of thumb is that whatever capabilities I can come up with by looking at what exists and what's been released, they are probably at least 5 years ahead of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Current capabilities make this identity link idea possible.  Therefore it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I am quite convinced that the NSA isn't so much about you as an individual, it's more about crowd data and social dynamics.  That facebook study is a very tame example of what their capabilities might be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mood manipulation, social control via social networks.  Knowing which mouthpiece should say what when to maximize effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are the more terrifying aspects, imo, and also goes some way towards explaining why the public writ large seems to be doing nothing against it.

       You're communicating with a foreigner right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're totally right though about individuals.  I wonder if that's what is tripping Greenwald up.  He wants to be "serious" about this so badly, but what he's looking at are documents that explain that everything is being sucked up and processed, everything is surveilled.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's still a leap from that (evidence) to what you can do with that data (speculation) that he can't make without drawing a lot of criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So his case seems weaker because he can't put 2 and 2 together without evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Snowden had access to the really high-level stuff (which I bet he didn't) I don't think they make power-points about the good toys, and I also bet it'd be incomprehensible in terms of scale and what it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need is for a few big data people to explain what's possible if you had access to all internet data and a lot of computing power. Take what they say and add five years to it and you have a good idea of what NSA is doing today.

       i work in big data and am familiar with some techniques. my opinion is that with super game theory technology they will be able to spot trends long before you and i can even conceive of them. they will be able to look at the vast amonts of information and make pin point accurate predicitions regarding crowds. its like physics + game theory + sociology and alot of computer science mixed in

       It definitely is. Bernays started this crowd control "PR" movement in the early 20th century. It's incredible to see how far it's gone since then. Very sophisticated programming.

       Reminds me of the facebook thing going around right now where your friend will post 5 pictures where they think they are "most beautiful", then encourage about 50 friends at a time to do the same thing. No thanks.

       Reddit operates over http.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means with a very simple MITM you can associate login with IP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never mind the fact that many users use the same handle here that they use on other forums.

       Adding an avatar will not decrease the anonymity of an already open system.

If you just take a reddit break for a week or two then come back and look at the front page you will realize that the site is filled with dolts &amp; propaganda much more than if you look at it everyday.. it is pretty fucked at this point.

       I don't understand, do you think the government controls reddit? Yes, government agencies have mechanisms to elicit information, but I don't think they can influence something like this. Also, how will reddit know the picture you upload is really you? They can't verify every user. So what would be the point?

       When you say "control" RSA, what do you mean?
Does the government select the companies board of directors? The CEO?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I think you mean is some government agencies might have the ability to bypass RSA authentication? Sure, no doubt they do. Like I said above, no doubt that the USG can elicit information. That is very different than say the USG dictating that RSA collect photos of all RSA product users. RSA is a company with a product that caters to a large corporate base. How many RSA clients would stick around for that? Not many, its not like they have a monopoly on corporate VPN.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF reddit were to start collecting user photos, there would be a real cost to that. Coding, storing and bandwidth of hundreds of thousand of users uploading new photos of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is now owned by Conde Nast, a publicly traded company. Corporations have a responsibility to share holders. One of many is to make money and to be financially responsible. Some shareholders may have an issue with decisions that result in waste and provide little value.

You are talking about the USG getting access.

       I'm suggesting a mandate to require user photos is not access. It is not something the government can dictate to a private company. It cannot be dictated as there are real costs associated with such a mandate.

       You are right there. Explain this. What value is there to having a picture? None. All they need is an email address or IP. Do you think the NSA is starting files on redditt users? 
Do you you think there is a guy at the NSA who is saying to himself... "Wonder what unamerican trash

       The debate is not specific to IF some agency is watching reddit. It's what is the value to a speculative future mandate that users upload a photo of themselves that OP bets is going to happen in 1 year.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way to verify all user photos, Nevermind that people are convicted of cyber-crimes all the time and there is hardly ever a nice smiling pic of the offender associated.

       You can be sarcastic or you can try to be intelligent and articulate. I know it's hard. Tell me, what value is there to a photo? Pedos get convicted all the time, and I don't there is alway a picture associated with a post on the darknet.

       Photo 3, picture of a website for a company  Mark worked for. Looks like they are into marketing and have a product called storyscaping. OK
      </p>
      <p>
       Photo 4 is a picture taken the day of the Boston marathon bombing. We can see the bombers running away and there is a red arrow pointing to a guy with a lawn chair strapped to his back?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess you are trying to indicate that these photos helped crack who bombed the Boston Marathon?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are blowing this way out of proportion. In case I didn't make it clear let me reiterate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USG does not need your photo if they want to connect you, to any comments on reddit. They can probably find you just fine, if you posted something illegal to reddit, the police would show up at your door and be surprised to see how ugly you are. If they didnt want to be surprised they could probably pull something from the DMV. They would not be relying on a photo you chose to update to a website that is probably not you and could never be verified.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess maybe you are suggesting that comments on here would be used with facial recognition by cameras in public areas to profile individuals?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, I cant understand the level of paranoia you and
       <a href="/u/cafi">
        /u/cafi
       </a>
       must be experiencing. Do you guys actually think you are that interesting?
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me a example of why the USG would target you, search for you via a network of surveillance cameras that may or may not be prevalent in your city via some facial recognition technology?

       Why are you even here commenting then? Why don't you go back into one of the subreddits full of tools who can't see past their own nose and constantly made to look like assholes because the people in our subreddit keep being proven right.

       I chose to comment on your post because it was fun to point out to you how illogical a photo requirement would be to any agencies overseeing anything here. As have many other users. Butthurt much?

       Okay, so does liveleak. So does youtube. Have you seen the profile pictures for those sites? This isn't a
       <em>
        personal
       </em>
       social media site, this is an
       <em>
        impersonal
       </em>
       social media site. I see more "taking a shit jokes" than anything else, and I see more throwaways on "serious" threads than regular-accounts
       <em>
        because people don't want to be identified
