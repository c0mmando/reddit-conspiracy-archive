Given what I know, this is the next most logical step for the people controlling it. The users will go into a predictable uproar &quot;OMG, reddit is becoming facebook&quot;. But then a few days later everyone will have forgotten and it will be back to business as usual.</p>

<p>And a new phase of the government&#39;s plan will be complete. And using their facial recognition programs, they will be able to directly match people&#39;s identities with years of logged reddit comments.</p>

<p>This will make flagging the &quot;agitators&quot; very easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats about it. Why would they need our pictures to be uploaded when they probably have access to our entire history at any time, photos of us, everything. I&#39;m certain your identity could be traced from any website or forum you post on or visit.</p>

<p>Jesus, do people really think they&#39;re this far behind still? That they need to ask us for information to get it, there&#39;s no other method? I find that pretty comical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My rule of thumb is that whatever capabilities I can come up with by looking at what exists and what&#39;s been released, they are probably at least 5 years ahead of that.  </p>

<p>Current capabilities make this identity link idea possible.  Therefore it exists.  </p>

<p>Personally I am quite convinced that the NSA isn&#39;t so much about you as an individual, it&#39;s more about crowd data and social dynamics.  That facebook study is a very tame example of what their capabilities might be.  </p>

<p>Mood manipulation, social control via social networks.  Knowing which mouthpiece should say what when to maximize effect.   </p>

<p>Those are the more terrifying aspects, imo, and also goes some way towards explaining why the public writ large seems to be doing nothing against it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re communicating with a foreigner right now.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re totally right though about individuals.  I wonder if that&#39;s what is tripping Greenwald up.  He wants to be &quot;serious&quot; about this so badly, but what he&#39;s looking at are documents that explain that everything is being sucked up and processed, everything is surveilled.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s still a leap from that (evidence) to what you can do with that data (speculation) that he can&#39;t make without drawing a lot of criticism.  </p>

<p>So his case seems weaker because he can&#39;t put 2 and 2 together without evidence.  </p>

<p>Even if Snowden had access to the really high-level stuff (which I bet he didn&#39;t) I don&#39;t think they make power-points about the good toys, and I also bet it&#39;d be incomprehensible in terms of scale and what it does.  </p>

<p>What we need is for a few big data people to explain what&#39;s possible if you had access to all internet data and a lot of computing power. Take what they say and add five years to it and you have a good idea of what NSA is doing today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i work in big data and am familiar with some techniques. my opinion is that with super game theory technology they will be able to spot trends long before you and i can even conceive of them. they will be able to look at the vast amonts of information and make pin point accurate predicitions regarding crowds. its like physics + game theory + sociology and alot of computer science mixed in</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say &quot;control&quot; RSA, what do you mean?
Does the government select the companies board of directors? The CEO?</p>

<p>What I think you mean is some government agencies might have the ability to bypass RSA authentication? Sure, no doubt they do. Like I said above, no doubt that the USG can elicit information. That is very different than say the USG dictating that RSA collect photos of all RSA product users. RSA is a company with a product that caters to a large corporate base. How many RSA clients would stick around for that? Not many, its not like they have a monopoly on corporate VPN.  </p>

<p>IF reddit were to start collecting user photos, there would be a real cost to that. Coding, storing and bandwidth of hundreds of thousand of users uploading new photos of themselves. </p>

<p>Reddit is now owned by Conde Nast, a publicly traded company. Corporations have a responsibility to share holders. One of many is to make money and to be financially responsible. Some shareholders may have an issue with decisions that result in waste and provide little value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let me try to connect the dots here.</p>

<p>Photo 1, some guy named Stephen. Search indicates this guy and his family were murdered in texas.</p>

<p>You indicate this guy in &quot;linked&quot; to another dude named Mark, because people who viewed Marks profile also looked at Stephen&#39;s? OK</p>

<p>Photo 3, picture of a website for a company  Mark worked for. Looks like they are into marketing and have a product called storyscaping. OK</p>

<p>Photo 4 is a picture taken the day of the Boston marathon bombing. We can see the bombers running away and there is a red arrow pointing to a guy with a lawn chair strapped to his back?</p>

<p>I guess you are trying to indicate that these photos helped crack who bombed the Boston Marathon?</p>

<p>I think you are blowing this way out of proportion. In case I didn&#39;t make it clear let me reiterate. </p>

<p>The USG does not need your photo if they want to connect you, to any comments on reddit. They can probably find you just fine, if you posted something illegal to reddit, the police would show up at your door and be surprised to see how ugly you are. If they didnt want to be surprised they could probably pull something from the DMV. They would not be relying on a photo you chose to update to a website that is probably not you and could never be verified. </p>

<p>I guess maybe you are suggesting that comments on here would be used with facial recognition by cameras in public areas to profile individuals?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I cant understand the level of paranoia you and <a href="/u/cafi">/u/cafi</a> must be experiencing. Do you guys actually think you are that interesting?</p>

<p>Give me a example of why the USG would target you, search for you via a network of surveillance cameras that may or may not be prevalent in your city via some facial recognition technology?</p>
