       i can sum it up, your parent registered you at birth as a cooperation that has the exact  name your parent gave you at birth. because of that you are now regulated by government rules that originally were only intended for government officals now apply to you aswell. now that the government sees everyone on the same page they start passing vast amounts of vague 'policys'(which they call laws) that have multiple interpertaions. now if anyone breaks one of your rules all you have to prove is their part of the cooperation(the reason cops will always ask for you id before an arrest is made, the're told they can't make an arrest without doing so first) next time a cop ask for you ID tell him you have no clue what hes even talking about and have no obligation to.

       if you posses id, you have to show it, its one of there tens of thousands of policies, no point in even having it in the first place, except they've built systems within the exact same structuce to limit other parties from contracting with you if you dont have id. but theres ways around that aswell.

       I should add "modern". Having a unique identifier for every person makes record keeping a lot easier, and a lot easier to correlate. They can't use your name, since many other people would have your name, and they can't use almost any other piece of information for the same reason. So, what they do is tie your name and other information to a identification number so they can easily file and cross-reference records, as is done in many, many other fields.

       SIN is mainly funnelled through my employment, and i pay taxes directly off of my paycheck every week, as well as cpp, and ei, i also have to register my car, then pay every year to get it registered, i have to register my house, my gun,my business, my taxi cab, my resturant, my ability to sell liquor, even my children, etc.. , and then renew it every year ,all for what? clearly a way to take a little more off your check each month because you have to submit to this "system", and what do i get out of it, nothing as a matter of fact i lose from it. if they want to keep records, keep records, dont make me and employee of your system.

       I'm not sure if you're really looking for a serious answer to that question, but I will attempt to provide one anyways.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Tax withholding. This is because otherwise, quite a lot of it wouldn't get paid. People are very bad at saving their money, especially the relatively large amount paid in taxes. Its much easier to just withhold it every paycheck and then issue a refund at the end of the year for the extra amount that was withheld.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Car registration. Car registration and licensing has been around for almost as long as the car itself. The primary reasons for car registration
are to establish clear ownership of the vehicle, to properly assess tax on the vehicle, and to ensure cars are legal to drive on the road. The vehicle tax usually goes to upkeep of the roads you drive on.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gun registration. Similar to others, to establish proper ownership, and ensure they are legal to own.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         House registration. I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about here, but obviously there's the title to the house, and possibly things requiring your house to be up to code, meaning it is safe enough.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Business registration. Once again, lots of common sense reasons for this. If you are an incorporated business, you are a public entity, and people need to be able to search and make sure your business is legitimate, and a business license database does that job, along with properly registering what type of business you are and who the executive officers are.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Taxi cab registration. Not all places do this, but the main reasons to do so are to ensure a certain quality of service, make complaints possible (say if the cab purposely tried to extort you or racked up the fee), and to set rates properly. Many people have had very bad experiences with cabs, and licensing helps prevent a lot of that.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Restaurant registration. See business registration, pretty much the same reasons except for some food specific ones.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Liquor registration. Once again, see above.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Children registration? I assume by this you mean a birth certificate, which helps establish the child's rights and citizenship, and makes it much to establish the circumstances of your birth to get other benefits later in life.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Most of these things don't need to be renewed every year, and the ones that do give benefits of all sorts of things. Your taxes pay for the roads you drive on, the police that patrol it, the army that protects this country, the fire department which puts your house out if its on fire, the schools your children go to, etc, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, its not really possible to just go and make records only when people want to, because that would largely defeat the point of these kind of registrations.

       anyways registering something in your mind is completely different that what it actually is, your giving up ownership to the government. car registeration was originally only meant for people engaging in commerce on the road, why does proper ownership mean i have to renew it every year? how is that logical? its not keeping anything safe or efficent. i could go through evcery point just dont feel like it.

       I'm still failing to grasp your point apparently. How is any of that hand holding? You asked a question, and I answered. I'm not sure if there's a part of my answer you actually disagree with and have an alternate idea, as you haven't exactly replied to it, but you seem to be attacking me for actually attempting to give an honest answer to your question.

       I certainly don't think this system is perfect, not even close. However, a lot of them are the only real practical solution to a problem. Take taxes. Clearly, if you want to have individuals pay taxes, you must have some way to make sure you don't get two people's tax returns confused, and a unique number is the most logical way to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, you'd either have to have lots of confusion and vastly greater amount of paperwork that has to be done to process the tax returns, or you have to get rid of taxes entirely, which opens a much, much larger can of worms.

       agree'd using a number would help identify people, that point is obvious. but why do i have to become a government agent again? this is a logical fallacy of revelence(a popular one). the government is probably 100 times bigger than it was 100 years ago, taxes were really only collected through commerse, and teriffs, and the cooperate tax. that all changed when everyone became a cooperation.

       Not sure what you mean by this, since people aren't corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, the reason the government required more taxes is exactly as you said, the government became bigger. However, a lot of that is because the world has changed. For example, in the early 1900s you might have a single dirt road that goes between two states, whereas now you have six lane highways. Obviously, the six lane highway costs a lot more, and thus you need to have more taxes to pay for the highway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing with welfare. Its now considered inhumane to simply let people rot and die because they didn't save up enough money for healthcare. This is now mostly a thing of the past, and while medicaid and medicare aren't perfect, they save thousands of lives per year. A large factor in the cost there is that simply put, health care costs have gone
       <em>
        hugely
       </em>
       up in the last 100 years. In 1900, you might go to the doctor if you're feeling terribly sick, but you certainly didn't go there once a year regularly. The other related factor is that care has gotten a lot more complicated. There are a lot of diseases and wounds that we can now cure and fix, but it costs a lot of money to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, I'm not saying anything about the current system is perfect or even close, but I still fail to see what alternatives you see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how are you a government agent? I don't see how that's true at all.

       you have alot to learn about the law, theer not even speaking the same language as you, they use a legal dictionary called the "blacks law" dictionary, humans arnt cooperations, you've totally missed the point, they've associated with a cooperation with the exact same name as you. and because of people ignorance they go along with it, your consenting to it every day when you wake up, and everyday when you go to work, the supreme court has ruled that paying into a pension plan is evidence of employee status, you get paid  through your Social insurence number because thats who they hired, the government, and your thier agent.

       tax witholding: of couse if you have a controversial idea of making everyone pay 10% of thier labour money, you would of already had them registered as a cooperation, especially if the tax is unconstitutional.
      </p>
      <p>
       car registration: ask your grandparents im sure they remeber when they didn't have to register their vehicles, car registeration was only originally meant for people engaging in commerse on the raod (transportaion) because i have to pay doesnt make it safe
      </p>
      <p>
       house registration: how does registering it make it safe? how does it establish ownership? i bought the deed from the original owner why do i need to renew every year? sure a government offical coming by and inspecting you house is a good idea, but why should i have to pay every year afterwards, i shouldnt even have to pay upfront considering im paying taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business registration: by legitimite i assume you mean the business isnt breaking the law, so were gonna assume everyone is going to potentially break the law therefore you must register and pay to renew.
      </p>
      <p>
       taxi cab service: "to maintain quailty and service" more like to drive out competition because the barrier to entry is like a million dollars? tell me how does that help establish that an individual is of quality? it establishes hes rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       registering a cooperation in your birth name: rights arn't given to me by anyone, im born with them, rights are something thats taken away. you will always have a duty to uphold things you see as right.
      </p>
      <p>
       either way your post is riddled with logical fallacys of relevence and begging the question, so it wasnt even valid in the first place, you've failed to identify how registering actually establishes ownership,organization, and safety.  having to pay someone doesn't make it any of those things

       I won't downvote you for your post, as it was well thought out.  However, a question, what gives the government of yesterday (of which I had no representation in) the right to hold me to a licensure requirement, or any other requirement for that matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want my car, job, firearm, or life in general to be "registered."  Registration ALWAYS leads to confiscation, whether that be of firearms, wages, or lives (through conscription)
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl:DR the government can't be trusted to regulate the 32 oz soda industry why should I, or anyone else, trust them to regulate anything else?  Simply because they've been doing it for a long time?

       Your point largely stands, 30s was when traffic lights, road rules and highways started (no need before mass produced cars)

       Edit: but previous posters point stands too, government organisation is a comfort blanket as well as an outcome of increased population and technological complexity.  Self organising works on most all sensible scales where the individual has some measure of true autonomy.

       Because I am tired of being controlled by people who have no right to my allegiance. They have made a polluted carnal heap of this world. They are incredibly arrogant with all the foolishness that comes with that. And I think now they are finally going to bite off more than they can chew. I want to be there when that happens. I want to be a part of what they choke on.

       The constitution does not mention the draft. It doesn't need to contain a provision regarding a draft because of the 2nd amendment. The founding fathers envisioned the "well ordered militia" as the only serious defense we would need. They NEVER EVER envisioned the US becoming an imperial power to rival the great britain they had just fought.

       Article 1 sec 8 provides for the raising and funding of armies and if you agree with the 2nd amendment you realize that all able bodied citizens are considered militia. With the right to bear arms comes the responsibility of being considered part of that militia. The only reason for that militia to exist is to serve in times of national crisis. A declaration of war would qualify as a time of national crisis. So if Americans don't step up to meet the need they are pressed into service by a draft to meet that need. With rights come responsibilities, unless you're ready to give up your rights? In a larger sense you are responsible for defending the freedom afforded to you by all of those rights.

       You make some good points here. I won't deny that. However I don't think that a declaration of war is a national crisis. I don't agree with that at all. For instance in the most recent wars our soil was barely touched. Meanwhile our military was strewn across the planet combating shadow forces and after the battle the companies came in and made a lot of money. They created a nice little empire for themselves and they did it without a single regard for what was moral or just.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to this current discussion I don't agree that the declaration of war on Russia would be a national emergency. It might well be an emergency for the wealthy. It might be an emergency for people whose livelihood and power is centered around the preservation of the American Empire. But that's not an emergency for the people of this  country. Not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       For as long as I have lived I have watched election after election decided by the corporate media and by corporate campaign finance. I can't put it any plainer. The people in power over the US do not do the will of the people of the US. They do the will of bankers and financiers. Those men have no right to suborn my nation or my freedom. They have no right to command my allegiance or my body. They have no right at all and I will not follow them into war. Or rather, wage war for them while they cower in bunkers far from the fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The militia as described in the writings of the founding fathers were meant for defense of our land. Not for imperialist aggression. Not for the empires of rich sick old men.

       No debate? I don't think I agree with you there. For instance the Supreme Court has decided that corporations are citizens. A lot of people would like to debate that finding of theirs very much.
      </p>
      <p>
       To bad we won't get the chance. Frankly, the Supreme was a horrible idea. Especially in an age where the lawmakers are controlled by the business class. The SC is very easy to control due to reliance of being stocked by the business class controlled lawmakers.

       The Supreme Court gets to decide how to interpret laws and the Constitution. That is their purpose per our founding fathers. So that means the decision they make is Constitutional BY DEFINITION .
      </p>
      <p>
       No argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course as an American you have every RIGHT to disagree or even protest their decision. But by the Constitution whatever they say is the last say and legal by deffinition.

       I'm not sure if they have a "plan" for them per say. I would venture to say they would consider vets a "national security risk", and they would be rounded up just like the dissenters, anti war protestors, draft dodgers, and other "security risks". It's a very terrifying contingency plan they have.

       As usual, they are one step ahead of you. Why do you think they are flooding the country with illegal immigrants? 60% of US Army recruits in 2012 were third world immigrants seeking a quicker path to citizenship.

       If you look at the global game of risk our masters play, the last 3 years definitely seem like all the major alliances are squaring up for the final resource wars. The TPP seemed very obvious to me, and Ukraine has 25% of the world's natural gas reserves. Looks like curtains are going up on the big show fairly soon, to me at least.

       No it's not.

      <p>
       The main reason being that nuclear weapons still exist. A world war like the kind we had in the past is no longer possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way for the US to wage a conventional war against Russia because of the nuke issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can wage proxy wars, and wars against lesser powers, but at no point would there ever be a direct declared war between these two powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the fact that the US spends eight times the rest of the world on their military. Russia knows this, and the aren't stupid. They'll poke the bear (eagle?), but they won't fight it.

       Basically the people in power get their information from people who cannot tell them the truth. The underlings of the rulers must tell the rulers what they want to hear. Or they will be replaced with people who will tell the rulers what they want.

       Not to mention the fact that the sixties were the best time to shoot off a nuke, because you could claim ignorance at least. These days, everyone knows the cost of firing those things off, and it ends with billions dead.

       I'm a more pragmatic type of person. If the cold war didn't produce a nuclear war, then our current struggles aren't going to either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you are a hardcore racist, if you knew that killing (insert race here) meant that there was a risk to you, your family, and your entire country, you wouldn't pull the trigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would find a more devious way about things. The world is no longer able to sustain a world war.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that I have faith in our leaders, it's that I know they are at the very least as smart as I am, and have access to more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: I know I could kill a serial killer, but I would have to shoot through my own head to do it, would I pull the trigger? Would you?

      <p>
       This is a bad example. Because a lot of self-sacrificing sort of people would gladly do it. For instance when you ask the question if somebody could go back in time and kill hitler, would they do it? Often the answer is yes. But nobody ever talks about coming back from that mission. Same with the kamikaze pilots. People can and do sacrifice themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to address your sort of side point about the essential self destructive act of beginning a nuclear world war and whether or not I or YOU would do it.. Well no, we wouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But fundamental to my understanding of our rulers is the idea that they are not like us. See you and I are equals. We live in a world of people who are mostly our equals. So for instance, if I say something you think is stupid, you will say, "damn dude.. that was fucking stupid."
      </p>
      <p>
       But imagine being surrounded by people who are not your equals? Imagine being initiated into a cult of power that isolates you from others and places them in the position of being your underlings. In that company if I say something stupid, my underlings will respond, "hey great idea! I'll get to work on that right away!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think the world is full of such sycophants? Furthermore you don't think people in power deliberately surround themselves with yes men? You've never witnessed that among the small microcosmic power structures in various businesses?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you think people like Caligula or the various other raving madmen of history gained the power they had and kept it? They did it by surrounding themselves with people who would agree with them and obey them. And those people did that because it got them power and prestige in their turn to hold their own courts of sycophants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you might think that, "hey there's no way that people like that could be getting into power now a days!" But I will tell you in response that THESE ARE THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO SEEK POWER IN THE FIRST PLACE!
      </p>
      <p>
       For myself when I think of being a world ruler the first thing that comes to my mind is the horrendous guilt I would feel in that position. Of being exalted above so many others and leaving them in the dust. That would make me feel a responsibility and a drive to improve the lives and conditions of my people. In fact the very fear of being in such a position makes me resist leadership at every turn. This is because a moral person understands that to lead is to take responsibility for your followers and their conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But look at our leaders. Look at the ACA for instance recently passed by president Obama and the US Congress. Do you know how many poor people have been kicked off medicaid by this legislation? People who were already below the poverty level established by the feds and so qualified for federal and state health insurance. A LOT! So now these poor people who were so poor they were given free medical insurance are now being put into the position of having to pay for it. So there goes supper tonight kids, daddy has a hernia and has to pay for his insurance now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who else but a total lunatic would create a program meant to help people get health coverage that in fact takes it away? Furthermore look at how the vultures in Congress swooped down on this legislation and systematically took it apart and turned it into a profit source for the for profit health care industry. And why did they do it? Because of money of power. Money and power mattered more to these people than the health and livelihood of the people they are responsible for leading. For that matter the whole notion of making profit off of people's illness is psychotic to it's very core. It's utter and complete madness or pure calculated cruelty.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is just one example of their mindset and how they operate. So when you ask if I or you would pull the trigger on a nuclear war I answer no without hesitation. But these sick fucks who rule us? I hope they would say no, I beg and plead that they will say no. But will I bet on it? Will I put my fate into their hands on this matter? HELL NO!

       The solution here is a healthcare system that everyone pays for, and everyone benifits from.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the problem being that your republican brothers and their voters cry "socialism", and refuse it. Even though it would be to the benifit of all, they recoil at the idea they their health care needs will be met in the same way as a drug addict.

       Hey you are preaching to the choir here buddy. I find the healthcare situation in our country to be totally insane. It even killed my father. It's provided very poor treatment to my infant son when he started having seizures.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly I don't see anything getting done about it. The fact is the divide between Americans is becoming so drastic that I can't see any way out of the situation but another civil war. People think I'm crazy when I say that because they see how feckless and cowardly our politicians are.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's not politicians who start civil wars! It's angry people, pissed off by their perceived disenfranchisement. Or who are afraid that the other side is going to come for them in the night. I'm not advocating this by the way. It's just the likely projection for how things are going right now. It could all change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish it would change. Every goddamn election the politician run on a platform promising change but it never fucking happens and Americans never stop voting Democrat or Republican. It's a goddamned farce. The whole political system of the US is a fucking lie.

       If it helps at all, Canada is very welcoming. Citizenship isn't hard to get, providing you don't have any convictions.

       Honestly I'm hoping we get a flood of Americans here once they realize how much easier life is up north. Our politics are boring as fuck, as they should be. All the major political problems you have are settled issues here, and we have

       I love Canadians frankly. I went there for my honeymoon with my ex-wife. We were on a cruise into New Brunswick and around Nova Scotia. It was one of the best experiences of my life to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to emigrate to Canada but that kind of thing requires a cash reserve for moving expenses and you have to be able to provide for yourself for one year. That's not so easy.

       My main point is that no country in this type of position will fire first, unless you think billions dead are "acceptable losses". That's the entire point of maintaining a nuclear arsenal. Otherwise, you could just depend on your conventional army.

       Dick Cheney said, not two weeks ago, the United States is going to have an event worse than 9/11 occur. I believe that will be a chemical weapons false flag attack, blamed on Russia, and used (along with whatever else happens in Ukraine in the coming weeks) as an excuse to put troops on the ground in Russian border countries- if not engaging Russia in a military conflict at this point.

       There was an attempt made to stage a nuclear false flag last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       A nuke went missing from a Texas base.  The whistle blowers pointed to South Carolina as the destination.  A few hours later Sen. Graham warned ISIS was going to nuke Charleston.  Over the next couple of weeks, two of the top nuclear commanders were dismissed.
      </p>

       Reminds you of the missing nukes when Cheney was clamoring for war with Iran or Georgia back in 2007.  Fortunately these folks have been getting caught the last few times they tried and hopefully they continue to be caught.

       The inability of them to pull these stunts as smoothly as they did 9/11 indicates that almost the entire population is awake now.  You wouldn't get that impression if you naively believe the apparent consensus on reddit, but on the ground evidence shows that a knowledge of false flags is so pervasive that we've successfully stopped the last few domestic attempts.  Foreign operations like the chemical weapons attack falsely blamed on Assad are being exposed.  The US has lost the information war.

       Next step is revolution and we fix their mess :)

       Or very nasty global conflict if we don't :(

       This is from Alex Jones's Prison Planet where they don't name sources. Simply saying "high level sources". Is that all it takes to convince you of truth?

       Because of gambling issues. Not a good thing to have Generals with massive gambling debts who control nukes... you see that makes them very easily controlled by foreign spies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously if an Alex Jones link without any actual sources is enough to convince you that a random comment by a Senator and a clean up of messy Generals is a conspiracy you really need to get out more.

      <p>
       I'm all for outside the box thinking but your really drawing unsubstantiated lines between things without any good basis.

       IMO Russia has become a much stronger nation since the fall of the Soviet Union and has gotten on the path to becoming a dominant world power and leader for the future. The BRICS Bank is probably the biggest blow to the West because there is now something to challenge the dollar. The U.S.A., Great Britain, Israel, etc., have put themselves on the wrong side of history.

       Dude the Romans had roads.

      <p>
       Your point largely stands, 30s was when traffic lights, road rules and highways started (no need before mass produced cars)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: but previous posters point stands too, government organisation is a comfort blanket as well as an outcome of increased population and technological complexity.  Self organising works on most all sensible scales where the individual has some measure of true autonomy.

       logical fallacy alert: roads have nothing to do with SIN. also there were very little cars, and dirt roads and trails as well as cobbelstone roads were widely used because of horses. either way your argument isnt even valid

       I certainly don't think this system is perfect, not even close. However, a lot of them are the only real practical solution to a problem. Take taxes. Clearly, if you want to have individuals pay taxes, you must have some way to make sure you don't get two people's tax returns confused, and a unique number is the most logical way to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, you'd either have to have lots of confusion and vastly greater amount of paperwork that has to be done to process the tax returns, or you have to get rid of taxes entirely, which opens a much, much larger can of worms.

       agree'd using a number would help identify people, that point is obvious. but why do i have to become a government agent again? this is a logical fallacy of revelence(a popular one). the government is probably 100 times bigger than it was 100 years ago, taxes were really only collected through commerse, and teriffs, and the cooperate tax. that all changed when everyone became a cooperation.

       you have alot to learn about the law, theer not even speaking the same language as you, they use a legal dictionary called the "blacks law" dictionary, humans arnt cooperations, you've totally missed the point, they've associated with a cooperation with the exact same name as you. and because of people ignorance they go along with it, your consenting to it every day when you wake up, and everyday when you go to work, the supreme court has ruled that paying into a pension plan is evidence of employee status, you get paid  through your Social insurence number because thats who they hired, the government, and your thier agent.

       I won't downvote you for your post, as it was well thought out.  However, a question, what gives the government of yesterday (of which I had no representation in) the right to hold me to a licensure requirement, or any other requirement for that matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want my car, job, firearm, or life in general to be "registered."  Registration ALWAYS leads to confiscation, whether that be of firearms, wages, or lives (through conscription)
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl:DR the government can't be trusted to regulate the 32 oz soda industry why should I, or anyone else, trust them to regulate anything else?  Simply because they've been doing it for a long time?
