       Honestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       In every subbredit if you even point out the possibility of another side to the MH17 story you are voted down to oblivion and all the tv was running "russian missile downs plane" beofre they even had one day go by.  I got a screennshot of that Su title as George stephonopolous was literally asking who do we think did it.  I mean the subtitles were ordered up and ready to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just like before Iraq when there was rampant evidence Saddam had no weapons and the former inspector was saying they didn't yet every media outlet was pushing it and everywhere there was seeming unanimous consent.  Saddam had something to do with 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in something really big right now becuase the media directors are pulling out all the media manipulation tools into a full court press against Russia and Putin.

       The new BRICS development bank is a serious challenge to the judeomasonic bankster plutocracy; it's a rival global banking system, with seed money of 50 billion dollars in collateral, and 100 billion dollars to defend member currencies against reprisals. And this one isn't nearly as simple as the last one, which they didn't hesitate to drive the world into war over. They are trying to make Ukraine the Poland of the imminent conflict between NWO and BRICS countries, but Russia isn't cooperating.

       That's sounds like a scarily accurate conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that Putin isn't cooperating however they seem to be trying to frame him since he isn't . He is a smart guy. And he has seen it all from the inside and knows every trick probably in the book.  I imagine he has severla plans in play as well.  He knows if he does nothing the opposition will forever encroach further and further.
      </p>
      <p>
       It worries me frankly. I think eventually he or others will feel they have no choice but to pull some direct attack against the powers that be in the worldld.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe he just waits and hopes they self destruct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately it is us the regualr citizens who die or starve under the collapse however it happens.

       It's textbook crap that should be obvious to everyone at this point. How many times do we have to see this go on, learn how bogus it was, and then repeat our stupid behavior.

       I'm not talking about the war itself, we aren't in direct control, but buying into the bullshit media? It's time to call it out and refute it.

       The thing is most people simply havenct seen the lies first hand simply for lack of time or interest so they don't recognize it again.

       Idol never trust American media or government spokespeople again after the Iraq war build up. Orcs kind of horrifying to realize that about your own government.

       Yes, and Jimmy Carter paid for firing G.H.W. Bush, from head of CIA and firing 500-600,CIA Agents, by being subjected to 30  years of very public, very humiliating lies and abuse.

       He would have done it, however, he certainly did not know how much and how total the control of all the major news providers were at that time. We saw the repeat with Clinton and now it is Obama's term.
