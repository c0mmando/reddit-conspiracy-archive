<p>In every subbredit if you even point out the possibility of another side to the MH17 story you are voted down to oblivion and all the tv was running &quot;russian missile downs plane&quot; beofre they even had one day go by.  I got a screennshot of that Su title as George stephonopolous was literally asking who do we think did it.  I mean the subtitles were ordered up and ready to go.</p>

<p>Its just like before Iraq when there was rampant evidence Saddam had no weapons and the former inspector was saying they didn&#39;t yet every media outlet was pushing it and everywhere there was seeming unanimous consent.  Saddam had something to do with 9/11.</p>

<p>We are in something really big right now becuase the media directors are pulling out all the media manipulation tools into a full court press against Russia and Putin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The new BRICS development bank is a serious challenge to the judeomasonic bankster plutocracy; it&#39;s a rival global banking system, with seed money of 50 billion dollars in collateral, and 100 billion dollars to defend member currencies against reprisals. And this one isn&#39;t nearly as simple as the last one, which they didn&#39;t hesitate to drive the world into war over. They are trying to make Ukraine the Poland of the imminent conflict between NWO and BRICS countries, but Russia isn&#39;t cooperating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s sounds like a scarily accurate conclusion.</p>

<p>I agree that Putin isn&#39;t cooperating however they seem to be trying to frame him since he isn&#39;t . He is a smart guy. And he has seen it all from the inside and knows every trick probably in the book.  I imagine he has severla plans in play as well.  He knows if he does nothing the opposition will forever encroach further and further.</p>

<p>It worries me frankly. I think eventually he or others will feel they have no choice but to pull some direct attack against the powers that be in the worldld.</p>

<p>Or maybe he just waits and hopes they self destruct.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is us the regualr citizens who die or starve under the collapse however it happens.</p>

<p>Yes, and Jimmy Carter paid for firing G.H.W. Bush, from head of CIA and firing 500-600,CIA Agents, by being subjected to 30  years of very public, very humiliating lies and abuse. </p>
