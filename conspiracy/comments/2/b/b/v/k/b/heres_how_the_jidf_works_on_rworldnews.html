        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) Some JIDF members are agent provocateurs. They post controversial stuff in order to root out the members they should downvote</p>

<p>2) They have scouts or &quot;tracer bullet&quot; shooters, who try to extract opinion from neutral members.</p>

<p>3) When they detect someone who is not pro Israel, that user is placed in some software list.  I find it funny how comments made days ago get downvoted - this is a sign that it&#39;s not human.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one example of a scout: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/EatingSandwiches1">http://www.reddit.com/user/EatingSandwiches1</a></p>

<p>The up/downvote brigades are invisible. Only the scouts and provocateurs are visible, but some of them rotate accounts on a frequent basis, it&#39;s hard to pin them down.</p>

<p>After you chat with him, you&#39;ll be either placed on a pro Israel list or a &quot;black list&quot;. For instance, I think I&#39;ve been placed on a black list. Now every comment of mine is getting downvoted, about 3 to 4 downvotes per hour.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, the upvotes on my comments beat 3 to 4 downvotes per hour, the comment escapes the JIDF net. Otherwise you get buried.</p>

<p>In this system, they&#39;re able to censor a good percentage of comments. Of course if half of America comes in upvoting some comment, it escapes the JIDF censor net and gets seen. But a large large percentage of comments get buried before they exit the <a href="/r/worldnews/new">/r/worldnews/new</a> page. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how they work: one guy provokes, another guy extracts info and shoots tracer bullets, the gang comes in up or downvoting accordingly. They&#39;re gaming Reddit systematically and very efficiently I must say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>...</p>

<p>From what I understand worldnews has not been subject to a snoonet raid of the kind initiated by bear and friends; although it is certainly more likely that organized groups are working harder to manipulate worldnews than they are to manipulate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> due to readership. We have simply not found the backroom evidence as of yet; nor have the admins. Although we have asked them many times to keep an eye out. </p>

<p>In this regard the admins have many more tools at their disposal than mods. They can see when there&#39;s a blank referrer on votes. They can see when someone is voting with alts and or amassing armies of their friends to vote on things in subreddits they despise by organizing on snoonet, etc, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Whether the admins chose to act on this is their prerogative though, and I have no insight into the inner workings of &quot;reddits executive branch&quot;. </p>

<p>You can always message the modmail of worldnews if you feel your comments are taken down unfairly and then the entire modteam has the opportunity to weigh in on the action and debate its merit. </p>

<p>Are you saying you have not noticed a shift in the recent months to an anti-Russian stand (or anti-Gaza more recently)? If you have hundreds of people at hand each clicking from their own ip, admins, as white as they might be (i do not believe that for a second), have no way to discriminate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s more about money, politics, and power than the ethnic/religious identity of &quot;Judaism.&quot; Most people I&#39;ve seen assert they have no problem with Judaism, just Zionism. My problem with Zionism should be pretty obvious, as it&#39;s a blanket problem with all money in politics and foreign policy. The problem I have with wealthy Jews is a problem I have with ALL MONEY and ALL POWER. It just happens that 1/2 of reform Jews make over 100,000 a year. But I assure you, I don&#39;t discriminate between a wealthy, cold-blooded white Christian or a wealthy, cold-blooded Jew. </p>

<h1>1. I don&#39;t want my government supporting a foreign government that pisses a lot of people off. Israel has been around for 70 years. <strong>If Israel can&#39;t defend itself after 70 years and make peace in the region after 70 years, maybe it&#39;s time we give Israel an ultimatum to find a new home if they want our continued support.</strong> I&#39;d be appalled if we did it overnight, but how about a 5 year plan? A 10 year plan? We did it in Vietnam. We did it with other refugees. How long do we have to continue paying for their military?</h1>

<h1>2. I didn&#39;t support the Iraqi war. I&#39;d have supported pulling out of Vietnam. Why have I not ever been called an Iraqi-racist for not supporting the Iraqi war? But, if I don&#39;t support Israel I&#39;m literally worse than Hitler. I&#39;d prefer we be an isolationist country and let the rest of the world shit on each other, if they so choose. We have a natural boundary of water.</h1>

<h1>3. If Israel falls, ISRAELIS ARE FREE TO COME TO THE US IN MY BOOKS. Please, join us like any other refugees have in the past. I don&#39;t believe in special treatment. I shouldn&#39;t have to protect your stronghold in the middle of a perpetual warzone. We didn&#39;t support Laos or Vietnam when they fell. We sent the native Americans to fucking Oklahoma and don&#39;t feel guilty about that. I&#39;m sure we can find somewhere in the US that we could buy and develop for a hell of a lot cheaper than Israel&#39;s military funding. You&#39;re welcome here, just like I welcome every other people. Including the Mexicans that I think we should nationalize.</h1>

<h1>4. Israel provokes Iran. See: Stuxnet. If we&#39;re already supporting Israel&#39;s protection, then fuck Israel if they&#39;re willing to make shit more messy.</h1>

<h1>5. If any ethnic group started fucking lobbying all politicians on both sides, I&#39;d see that as a flat out BRIBES. <strong>Stay the fuck out of my elections, Israel.</strong> Plus: 61 percent of U.S. respondents said they believed the U.S. should not take either side. AIPAC makes me hate Israel, just like I hate the Koch brothers, oil money, or any other money to bribe politics. Israel&#39;s money pisses me off even more, because at least the Koch money/oil money DOES stay in this country.</h1>

<p>Now for my problems with the upper class:</p>

<h1>1. <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2008/02/jews-are-richer.html">55% of Reform Jews make over $100,000.</a> 18% over $1 million. If 50% of Reform Jews are high earners, odds are I hate 1/2 Reform Jews. Why? Because I dislike the upper class for their control in politics and business. It&#39;s not that I hate Jews disparagingly, it&#39;s that I hate wealth. I don&#39;t hate wealthy Jews any more than I hate wealthy white people. My problem with WEALTH is that most high-earning jobs are professional or financial positions that purposely aim for production and efficiency. Humans are worked to death with production goals - so fuck the wealthy for diminishing the quality of life. That leads to suffering and lower quality of life in the middle class. IN ADDITION, most of the wealthy are participants in the stock market, which dictates corporate strategy. FUCK YES I&#39;ll hate 1/2 reform Jews if 1/2 of reform Jews are willing participants in the same corporate strategy that cost my fellow man their jobs and life in 2007.</h1>

<h1>2. Orthodox Jews, poor/middle class Jews, and the other 1/2 of the Reform Jews? Fucking fine in my book. As a matter of fact, I wish they&#39;d be more willing to mingle with our culture. The Orthodox Jews? FUCK YES BROTHERS. I dislike this culture of violence and immorality and think they&#39;re a beautiful religion and culture.</h1>

<p>How&#39;s that for an answer?</p>

<p>The question, beyond bad publicity for reddit, was why did they chose to nuke VA by allowing him to be doxxed by the goons from something awful, even though that lead to a mod revolt and saw gawker banned site-wide by mods in the biggest act of protest the mod community has ever attempted. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ptsny/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/c3sc3dq">And I think the answer was he knew things about how the backroom of reddit operates that he should not have know, or perhaps could not be trusted with.</a></p>

<p>that suggests machine aided posts, ie they are not writing the bulk of the posts themselves, they might be just entering key details and some program makes up a post or response.</p>

<p>or they strictly follow key points on guides when posting or responding.</p>

<p>So much talk and no walk in this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An ad hominem (Latin for &quot;to the man&quot; or &quot;to the person&quot;), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a general category of fallacies in which a claim or argument is rejected on the basis of some irrelevant fact about the author of or the person presenting the claim or argument. Fallacious Ad hominem reasoning is normally categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance. Ad hominem reasoning is not always fallacious, for example, when it relates to the credibility of statements of fact.</p>

<p>Ad hominem arguments are the converse of appeals to authority, and may be used in response to such appeals.</p>

<p>My apologies then. I didn&#39;t mean to jump down your throat, at least in reference to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>My point still stands. JIDF shills won&#39;t be called out on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bad for the &#39;populace.&#39;</p>

<p>Edit: example</p>

<p>Why the hell were the kids playing in the beach in the middle of a bombardment? In Israel, all kids stay inside because of Hamas rockets. The kids are not to blame of course, but their parents are clearly irresponsible. Would you let your kids play outside, if your city was being bombed?</p>

<p>This is a pro Israeli poster, <a href="/u/drboomkin">/u/drboomkin</a>, giving us the truth, over and over again...</p>

<p>JIDF is rampant in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a></p>
