        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>At 19:00 Beit Hanoun Hospital was hit by an Israeli tank shell. Inside the hospital are 61 medical staff, civilians, three patients and two ISM volunteers, Charlie Andreasson and Fred Ekblad, both from Sweden, who are all trapped inside. </p>

<p>Israeli soldiers are close to the hospital. Gunfire can be heard in the area. A thick smoke is rolling into the hospital. </p>

<p>We need you to call your own representatives to demand that they fulfill their obligation to insure that Israel adheres to international law and immediately cease to target medical staff and facilities. </p>

<p>Some phone numbers are provided below.</p>

<p>Background:  Medical teams under fire</p>

<p>international volunteers, including some from Sweden, the U.S., and the UK, went to Beit Hanoun in North Gaza to accompany ambulances fallowing the targeting of an ambulance in Beit Hanoun this afternoon by Israeli forces. The Israeli attack on the ambulance killed one paramedic and the critical injury of another</p>

<p>The attack on the hospital in Beit Hanoun is the second Israeli attack on Gazan medical facilities and personnel in the last 24 hours. The first resulted in the destruction of Al Durrah Children’s Hospital in Gaza City last night. A two year-old child in the Intensive Care Unit was killed, and 30 others injured.</p>

<p>Due to shelling nearby, Beit Hanoun hospital has evacuated most of its patients to al-Shifa Hospital. Three patients remain in the hospital.  </p>

<p>Since Israel began its attack on Gaza, 13 ambulances have been completely destroyed and two paramedics have been killed. Throughout the massacre, medical staff and facilities have been repeatedly targeted. </p>

<p>&quot;Israel&#39;s attacks on Gaza hospitals are ongoing, with those in areas by the separation barrier forced to evacuate their patients, paramedics and other rescue workers are doing what they can under conditions of great risk.&quot; Stated Joe Catron, U.S. International Solidarity Movement activist.</p>

<p>According to the Gazan Ministry of Health, six out of Gaza’s 13 hospitals have already been severely damaged. One, el-Wafa rehabilitation hospital, has been completely destroyed.  Two medical clinics have been completely destroyed, seven other clinics have been damaged, 13 medical staff members have been injured, and five have been killed.  </p>

<p>The Ministry of Health in Gaza has demanded, &quot;the immediate cessation of Israeli occupation military attacks against medical facilities and personnel in Gaza, and demands that the international community soundly condemn this latest Israeli atrocity, and hold Israel accountable for these war crimes.&quot; </p>

<p>Back when the US was thinking about striking Syria with missiles, I participated in a campaign to call our representatives and tell them not to. They didn&#39;t end up doing it. It may be naïve of me but I feel proud about that. I feel like I actually helped prevent it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because it&#39;s on TV doesn&#39;t make it fact. This is the problem with the TV propaganda paradigm.</p>

<p>I am cynical enough to say it is possible these things are being planted as part of the propaganda to legitimize attacking civilians.</p>

<p>But then again I&#39;m also cynical enough to believe that part of Hamas is controlled by Mossad, acting as agent provocateur (fighting Fatah, the rockets, harassing PA civies etc). This sort of evidence is to be expected then.</p>

<p>There is evidence of Hamas being funded and assisted into power by the Israeli gov, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I&#39;m right. Though smoking gun proof is unlikely to ever turn up.</p>
