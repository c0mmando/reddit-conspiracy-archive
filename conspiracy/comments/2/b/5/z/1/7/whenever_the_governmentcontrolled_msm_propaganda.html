<p>Seriously, if reddit can be seen as a focus group on the effectiveness of MSM media propaganda on the public, then maybe humans deserve to be constantly manipulated into death, war, and famine. </p>

<p>The sad thing is that the idiot masses are going to drag us <em>all</em> along for the ride.</p>

<p>Logic would warrant that Russians are also being fed the same kind of propaganda from their government and media and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they had threads full of &quot;Fuck Obama&quot; and &quot;Nuke America&quot; to mirror the kind of things the people are now shouting on this side.</p>

<p>Does nobody ever learn? How lonely and depressing is it to be one of the few paying attention right now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah frankly that is what I&#39;m betting on. I think it was Goebbels who said that of course the peasants of germany don&#39;t want to fight the peasants of france. But that it is the job of the government to make them fight. </p>

<p>I really hope that I am not making the wrong move relying on Russian cynicism. On the other hand what else can they do but fight if the US invades? Which is the most likely situation if a war breaks out because the US military is not defensive in structure. </p>

<p>All I can say then is that I will not be one of the men invading Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s critically important that young people are aware of the lies behind this push to war. They always go for the youngest eligible in a draft. With the garbage being taught in schools these days 18 year olds won&#39;t understand what&#39;s really going on here. I was in high school when 9/11 happened, I recognized something was wrong with the story but it wasn&#39;t until years later that I started to really understand how the world is manipulated. I&#39;m almost 30 so a draft isn&#39;t as big of a personal concern for me, but I can&#39;t agree more that we need to see this stop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow being in high school when 9/11 happened must have been pretty spooky. That whole year right after 9/11 was completely crazy with the biggest censorship crackdown and just general oppression I had ever seen. I was an adult though and had for years been learning to distrust my government. Watching the government&#39;s reaction to 9/11 really cemented my belief that the people who rule us are psychopaths and totally out of touch with reality.</p>

<p>As for being to old to draft you should understand that if you have a necessary skillset you might still find yourself drafted. I read an article a few years ago about how they were going to change the enlistment standards to allow older people with IT skills for instance. Maybe that has changed now I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>But I do know that my son is getting into the draftable age and he won&#39;t be answering the call.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is certainly a herd-rush to indict Russia or Russia sponsored forces in the Malaysian airliner incident. </p>

<p>For me, the matter is not so cut and dried and I can see absolutely no positive gain any pro-Russian would derive from shooting down a civilian plane.</p>

<p>Additionally, we have history as a guide to such incidents; remarkably, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655">US</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007">Russia(USSR)</a> have shot down civilian planes in the past and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia_Airlines_Flight_1812">Ukraine</a> as well.</p>

<p>Each situation varied in details: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>1983: The Russians claim they mistook the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Boeing_747-2B5B%2C_Korean_Air_Lines_AN0600191.jpg">Korean airliner</a> for a US <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/RC-135_Rivet_Joint.jpg/300px-RC-135_Rivet_Joint.jpg">RC-135 Recon aircraft</a>...
<em>&quot;The Soviet government expressed regret over the loss of life, but offered no apology and did not respond to demands for compensation. Instead, the USSR blamed the CIA for this &quot;criminal, provocative act&quot;</em></p></li>
<li><p>1988: The US claims it <a href="http://ratbagger.com/A300F14.jpg">mistook</a> the Iranian Airliner for a F-14 Tomcat fighter...and paid reparations.</p></li>
<li><p>2001: The Ukrainian government blamed the shooting of the Siberia Airlines Flight 1812 on a &quot;mistake&quot; during the testing of the Buk, S-300.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The MH17 shootdown benefits NATO.  It puts Putin in a corner.  Putin will no longer be able to support the rebels without appearing to openly support terrorism when NATO/U.S. has finished their kangaroo &quot;investigation&quot; and concluded that the perps were the rebels.  (Let&#39;s remember that less than one year ago, Putin stopped a U.S. bombing of Syria in the U.S. &quot;WMD&quot; rerun of the Iraq invasion.  Let&#39;s watch and see now how quickly the attempted rape of Syria reoccurs).</p>

<p>Cui bono?  Who benefits?  NATO.  Not Putin.</p>

<p>Does this necessarily mean that the MH17 shootdown was a false flag?  No.</p>

<p>Could the MH17 shootdown have been an accident?  Yes.</p>

<p>Does it look more like a NATO false flag when NATO/the U.S. rushes to judgement, or establishes &quot;guilt&quot; while avoiding/purging unanswered questions in their eventual &quot;investigation&quot;?  Yes.</p>

<p>On that point, seeing as Russia taking the blame for this benefits nato greatly... how hard would it be to sneak into Russia and pull this off? I know it&#39;s practically a war zone these days, but I haven&#39;t heard of a resurgent Russian army so I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s poor coverage at best. Given the US government&#39;s proclivity for &quot;it never happened and you can&#39;t prove it&quot; black-ops.... what&#39;s to stop us, or another like minded country from setting this up? </p>

<p>Granted, any rational being knows that poking the bear, and by extension China is blatantly insane... but you never know. I realize this sounds like a conspiracy theory and may be written off as such, but it was just a thought. Seeing as we have so little information, curiosity got the better of me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget Russia, how about the story of &#39;elite pedophiles&#39; in Britain?</p>

<p>Guess what law was passed a few days before?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 10 the U.K. government introduced an emergency bill to provide law enforcers and intelligence agencies access to telecommunications data to help them investigate criminal activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/16/un-commissioner-criticises-decision-fast-track-emergency-surveillance-bill">http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/16/un-commissioner-criticises-decision-fast-track-emergency-surveillance-bill</a></p>

<p>That was definitely planned to whip some public anger against pedophiles so their new laws would pass with little protest.</p>

<p>So unless all of Mexico decides to jump the border, those bullets are probably destined for American civilians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because its been declared a war crime since 1899 at the Hague convention. These bullets are illegal to use in international wars. They are allowed to legally use them on us.              They cause significantly more damage and cause bigger wounds than using full metal jackets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely possible that this was the russian backed ukrainian rebels mistaking the airliner for a military transport.  The suspicious thing is that </p>

<p>1: they shouldn&#39;t have had a buk- can we prove that they do? </p>

<p>2: this works out really well for nato and we&#39;ve seen this exact plan before to justify conflict escalation</p>

<p>3: the talking points are really loud and aimed at russia</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey McCain just said the Kiev doesn&#39;t have this capability so they should have this capability.  It kills two birds with one ZNN interview; First it purports that Kiev couldn&#39;t have done it and Second it proposes that more arms be shipped to them.  I wonder how much of the population can even understand this if they were even to read a dissection of his position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the talking points are loud and aimed at Russia. sort of reminiscent of Bin laden after 9-11. I am not exactly unhappy about that. Russia is a threat to the US.  The cold war isn&#39;t really over and never really was. </p>

<p>In the 90&#39;s one of the major concerns was terrorists getting weapons from decaying Russian military bases. It is totally plausible that they had a buk. </p>

<p>The cries are in unison. The pressure is mounting. Russia will back off.</p>

<p>Now what to do about Israel and Palestine redux times infinity and ISIS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the cold war was supposedly about russia being a militaristic threat and the spread of communism.  Are you saying that the current threat is economic?</p>

<p>It seems like the current great game is about who can steal the most resources and who can sell and use the most weapons.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to live in a new world order dominated by russia or china, but I also don&#39;t understand why it is so important that ukraine be broken up and joined with the EU.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not going to apologize for the Soviet Union but times change and I think that the West and US much in particular has yet to reach peak insanity and dysfunction, even though it seems quite bad.  The Russians already went through this and their system collapsed and they had to regroup and to reflect on why things turned out so shitty.  Americans haven&#39;t gone though this yet and has even yet to reach peak disillusionment.  Americans are hardly even aware that their military is all around the world occupying numerous hostile regions and &quot;allies&quot;.  Its the empire that passes for something other than an empire.  Its completely insane and twisted.  The population at large is just not going to wise up voluntarily and the US elites are now trying to force a single choice onto the world instead of being able to present the more attractive option.  The dollar has gone parabolic from excessive monetary printing and other world powers are moving away from it.  Its &quot;use it or lose it&quot; time for the US military.  There won&#39;t be gas in the tank in 5-10 years to even get over there yet alone threaten anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let us take a look at the word &quot;seems&quot;.  Where is this dysfunction? Besides what the media portrays. Have you witnessed it personally (beyond the DMV idiots?) Peak insanity? Where? Again have you witnessed this yourself or is this conclusion influenced by the screen or the press?</p>

<p>For too long the contrary opinions have been dismissed or squelched but now with the advent of the internet we can read all kinds of sources that agree with our thinking. It doesn&#39;t mean our conclusions  are correct. It just merely means that the media has realized that there is an audience for alternative ideas. We need to be mindful of this trapping. </p>

I think that is coming.  After it goes to shit people will be very disillusioned with the system instead of merely dissatisfied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure so people are just going to ride it out and make very little change and the military and CIA will be trying to murder and bomb people who plan against using the dollar.  There is the possibility in all off this that the US will actually be successful in squashing alternative currency systems and will further grip the world through all of this political intrigue.  I predict though that the US will just become more obviously frothy looking trying to lock everything down and that enough people (in the rest of the world, leaders and otherwise) will have woken up to this that it will fail but not before a hell of a lot of chaos in Euroasia has ensued.  Also common people don&#39;t need to be literally starving for society to become quite miserable.  The vast majority of the people survived the collapse of the USSR but just ask them if that period of time was even tolerable at all.  It sucked ass.  The US is different though and it will be much better on the food front but far worse in violence and mental instability.  You should look up some of the item comparisons of the collapse of the USSR to the future collapse of the USA when the dollar tanks.  Neither is pretty at all.  I&#39;m from California and now am living in L&#39;viv, Ukraine and I can see how it will be similar and also different in my home state when things fall to shit.  If you are waiting for jackboots marching down your suburban street or tanks rolling around then you will miss out on seeing what a terrible shitty time is in store.  I really don&#39;t know if it will be insane like Serbia or something crazy like that and I suspect not but really that is complete hell and even multiple steps better than that is just completely intolerable for the human psyche.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You shouldn&#39;t quote people without giving credit, but I dig your point.  I think the problem is mainly that Russia has been the &quot;bad guy&quot; for so long that it&#39;s just really easy to dredge those emotions up even though obviously it&#39;s a very complicated country.  I don&#39;t agree with everything Russian (such as banning Bitcoin), but I think anyone who has been paying attention for the last decade or so would have to admit that many of the world&#39;s problems could be solved by US-Russian cooperation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to disagree. I&#39;ve seen more propaganda from the Russian government spread even on this very subreddit. It says something when I can tell where people are getting their misinformed information because I can trace the fabricated claims right back to Russia Today. An RT journalist even ragequit recently over the Russian government&#39;s plane crash propaganda (but you won&#39;t see that on the front page of reddit). </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually been comical to watch RT.com since the plane crash. For a solid 24 hours after the crash, the top story on RT.com read (paraphrasing here) &quot;the Ukrainian government <em>could have</em> downed the plane. Now we&#39;re not saying they did, and we have no evidence they did, but it is totally possible they did.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the exact kind of logicl Glenn Beck is famous for using to brainwash. </p>

Putin will no longer be able to support the rebels without appearing to openly support terrorism when NATO/U.S. has finished their kangaroo &quot;investigation&quot; and concluded that the perps were the rebels.  (Let&#39;s remember that less than one year ago, Putin stopped a U.S. bombing of Syria in the U.S. &quot;WMD&quot; rerun of the Iraq invasion.  Let&#39;s watch and see now how quickly the attempted rape of Syria reoccurs).</p>

<p>Does this necessarily mean that the MH17 shootdown was a false flag?  No.</p>

<p>Could the MH17 shootdown have been an accident?  Yes.</p>

<p>Does it look more like a NATO false flag when NATO/the U.S. rushes to judgement, or establishes &quot;guilt&quot; while avoiding/purging unanswered questions in their eventual &quot;investigation&quot;?  Yes.</p>
