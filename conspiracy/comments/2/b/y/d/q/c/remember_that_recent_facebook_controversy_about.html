        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I had started to suspect that Words with Friends was tinkering with psychological manipulation, and I have reasonable evidence to support my theory if anyone is curious*. So I started searching, and stumbled upon this press release dated July 9, 2014:</p>

<p><a href="http://investor.zynga.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=858927">http://investor.zynga.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=858927</a></p>

<p>My theory is that the manipulative experiment was conducted through a combination of Words With Friends, and its integration and notifications on Facebook.</p>

<p>*There are a limited number of letters that are available to make words, so it is possible for them to seed the available letters so that certain words stand out as the best or only moves. I play with my boss, and his best move once was the word &quot;quit.&quot; One time there were a couple days before I moved, and my best move was then the word &quot;shun.&quot; I played with my mom, and the best move was the word &quot;tit.&quot; I&#39;ve seen other examples. They are words that could be perceived as negative in context, and the app can also post the moves to your Facebook timeline.</p>

<p>Edit 7/29: I&#39;ll go ahead and update that my other boss just played &quot;tit.&quot; Maybe the post had been detected and someone thought it would be funny :p</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow.  and zynga has been such a failure with such an acknowledged overvalued IPO.  Where is the real value unless you are paying for microtransactions or they are able to sell you product.  Free gaming has to be about emotional manipulation if it is going to see any return.</p>
