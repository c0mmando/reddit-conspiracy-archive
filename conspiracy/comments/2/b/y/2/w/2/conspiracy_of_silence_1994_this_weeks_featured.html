    <div class="md"><p>Its this madness that took me down the rabbit hole, combined with the MK programming my friends that lived near Omaha. I only asked myself one question- If the government and/or our leaders can do things like this, what else are they doing? Little did I know that I would learn about the occult, false flags, PsyOps, Operation Paperclip, Phoenix Program, and more. Hell, I even up looking into Lewis Carroll just because of &quot;rabbit hole&quot;. It&#39;s all very troublesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is correct. Two of three siblings that are most likely related to Josef Mengele (Dr. Green/Variation of Dr. Green). The third, and youngest sibling, was very young when the three of them were taken from their parents. They lived near Offutt AFB. If you study Mengele, you&#39;ll find a twin anomaly in Brazil from the time he hid there. All of that generation of twins LOOKS JUST LIKE my friends. Also, if you Google &quot;world records twins&quot;, you&#39;ll find a Today&#39;s Show clip. City- Des Moines. The oldest (males) is schizophrenic according to his Psychiatrist, but I disagree. I think he suffers from DID, PTSD, and alcoholism. The middle child (female), has spent the last two years deprogramming with my help. Her triggers were/are tones, Shirley Temple song clips, the name Rosie Marie (from original Manchurian Candidate), along with others. She has kitten, improvised device, marksman, and at least two more personalities. Their father is former military and is likely CIA or civilian WO to this day. We contacted the FBI, local police, hometown PD, and Wiesenthal. Nobody cares. There is a lot to this case, but its not going anywhere. They were kept in cages, were tortured, victimized by incest from father and Mengele. My ex wife&#39;s father was a DoD WO/CIA &quot;foreman/supervisor&quot; during Operation Phoenix in Vietnam. His family has twins on both sides. I would love to find out if he had arranged the marriage with CIA or Mengele. Don&#39;t believe the hype- Mengele died in the Midwest US. I was gearing towards a book. I have lots of documentation. I would love to get a DNA sample from Mengele&#39;s son out in Cali that sells art, the Brazilian twins, and my friends. Truth is, I don&#39;t want to go to that town or near that base. There is a lot I&#39;m not saying. The eldest has gone BACK to live with these folks, but the middle child (30&#39;s) is a strong person, and is getting past it. BTW, if anyone can help me figure out my ex-in-laws company in Vietnam I would be estatic. Its DYNA______. He also was a &quot;foreigner airport taxi driver&quot;. Or so his permit seems to say. He has severe Alzheimer&#39;s, not that he would tell. He had two passports, stocks from Bermuda, Freemason first degree oath (I guess), and more in his briefcase. His DoD card said WO THRU CPT on the back and he had a FCC military bandwidth clearance. By his nightmares, I&#39;m positive he tortured and killed many people in his 9 yrs in Nam alone. I&#39;m certain of all of this to a very high degree. If I&#39;m not on here tomorrow, you know why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I was full of BS. I may do an AMA at some point. I plan on getting back to writing on the subject. My ex-in-law is in poor mental and physical health, and getting this info from my ex is like pulling teeth. I think its sickening that war crimes are not brought up against those that are amoral in their pursuits. If anyone is in the Omaha area, and wants to take a couple of pics for me, I would be happy. I suspect that one small town in the area was almost entirely Nazi. The German demographic is fairly high, and I have heard (not verified) that swastikas are on the courthouse floorings. Whats even more twisted than what you know, is where all of this has taken me. I suspect many of the school shooters are MKULTRA victims, OTO/Rosicrucian&#39;s occult rituals, and murders did go on in that area for some time. I suspect one of the handlers is a serial killer. Bodies have been seen, but seriously, the FBI hung up on me once and the other time scolded me for not calling the local police (which I did). The eldest sibling likely is reddit user poopacabre. Read that shit. Its in <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a>. His name is Daniel. He is dyslexic and speaks just like that. He&#39;s not Jewish however. Oh, all of their names (full) are acronyms. The truck driver&#39;s works out to be a version of this- Husher of whores. Mengele&#39;s - Amoral God (also modified). The name he used had 5 different dead owners in the same state. The name means &quot;twin&quot;. Yeah...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>from the blurb of Shurter&#39;s book</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the nationwide satanic panic in the 1980s to local political cover-ups, shocking kidnappings, unsolved child murders, and scandalous pedophile rings, this book takes you behind the deceptive headlines and, finally, reveals what was going on in Omaha when all hell broke loose. Rich and well-connected members of Omaha’s elite carried out unspeakable acts of abuse and even murder on innocent children. David Shurter was one of those sexually abused survivors forever scarred by the horrible rites performed on him by his own parents and other followers of Satan. It wasn’t until he entered psychotherapy in midlife that long ignored childhood memories came to light, and when he discovered his gruesome nightmares were indeed real. This book, finally, is an expose of the surprising participants and unbelievable horrors involving murder, drugs, lavish parties, pedophiles, suspected government conspiracies, and the Omaha gay scene that cast a dark cloud of suspicion over an unsuspecting city. David Shurter takes you down the rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mengele is the only individual that I have a firm link to regarding wanted Nazi criminals. I will probably do an AMA soon.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for my delay. I&#39;ve been away. I did not mean to leave anyone hanging. Understand, I have not just taken this person&#39;s word for anything. These are elements that I have witnessed, researched, and confirmed. These personalities presented themselves, and/or the individual regained fragments of disassociated memories without hypnosis, leading/direction, or influences. In fact, she did not have internet access or any real means to orchestrate these things. With marksmanship/weapons she knows how to break down weapons, with full descriptions/drawings without ever seeming to have access to such weapons. She displays knowledge of tactical maneuvers in what I define as stealth assassination techniques and military combat techniques. This is beyond what I would describe as civilian or typical military understanding. I will not elaborate much on improvised devices because of the nature of such, but I will say she definitely has a confirmable history with devices that are capable of being lethal. This said, I do not think she possess any knowledge of devices that are known to cause mass casualties. In other words- she&#39;s not T Kavinsky or T LeVeigh in scope. The other personalities involve sex/blackmail among other things. I should also clarify that these are my evolving thoughts regarding these different personality types. I&#39;m working in a taboo and often rejected subject matter. This is also a real live person that I care about, so I cannot simply push my will upon her. It&#39;s very much a process, and it takes patience. There is more to come.</p>

<p>While visiting his friends Wolfram and Liselotte Bossert in the coastal resort of Bertioga on 7 February 1979, he suffered another stroke while swimming and drowned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen photos of &quot;Mengele&quot; during this period? It&#39;s obviously not him. In fact, I would argue that the guy pictured is probably an intelligence op functioning as a possible Stalin double. Even Mengele&#39;s lawyer &quot;son&quot; admits they are not blood. There is a torrent &quot;Josef.Mengele.Angel.of.Dead&quot; (or similar) AVI that explains this very well. Its a VHS upload, but its of good quality. I also invite you to google &quot;fbi files hitler argentina&quot; Click on the .gov link and see for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the tipping point for me.</p>

<p>The reason I became hard core about non-compliance with the tribute system [Federal Income Tax] was because of this and related incidents. There&#39;s a more recent reference to this from back in 2011 when Anderson Cooper talked about a child porn ring in the Pentagon. That story was dropped right quick. They had to cover it up, but it still got time on a major network.</p>

<p>Just remember that you pay for these things by paying their taxes and using their money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.&quot; ~ Margaret Mead ~ US Anthropologist</p>

<p><em>In early 2002 the Boston Globe&#39;s Pulitzer Prize winning coverage of sexual abuse cases involving Catholic priests drew the attention, first of the United States and ultimately the world, to the problem.[27][28][29] Other victims began to come forward with their own allegations of abuse, resulting in more lawsuits and criminal cases.[10] Since then, the problem of clerical abuse of minors has received significantly more attention from the Church hierarchy, law enforcement agencies, government and the news media. ~ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases</a></em></p>

<p>The tenacity of Boston Globe journalists in uncovering the scandal of widespread sexual abuse by priests led to the crisis in the Catholic church.

    <div class="md"><p>She met and married a man twenty years older. He was, at one time licensed to practice law, an actor/writer/monied IMHO psychopath.</p>

<p>She gave birth twice, at home, alone. No birth certificates.</p>

<p>This is a <em>very brief</em>, <em>very sanitized version</em>. </p>

<p>My sister was panicked and she contacted certain people. Her claims seemed bizarre to certain others that she confided in and she fled with the girls. When through the grapevine, I received a call that she was seeking proof that her daughters had been, <em>not molested but filmed</em>, <em>raped</em> and <em>marketed</em> for child porn.</p>

<p>My sister never wavered in her claims. She was, as far as I and my SO were concerned running for their lives. </p>

<p>These, his family, were people of money and means.</p>

<p>We were not then and not now.</p>

<p>My nieces were taken into Mexico as toddlers by their biological father. I&#39;ve not heard from my sister since.</p>

<p>I was contacted a few years back by the American Consulate in Mexico where the eldest niece was trying to gain entry back into the US but she didn&#39;t have a birth certificate. It didn&#39;t matter what I told the Consulate... </p>

<p>Our family has never been connected or re-united with these two nieces.</p>

<p>My sister was a brilliant person, a peaceful, shy but gentle soul. She was a word smith, incredible poet. She seemed to absorb books like we breathe air. She had her pilots license before she could drive. She knew the Law as well. </p>

<p>The man she married was connected to Hollywood, Big Oil, Airlines, Legal entities.</p>

<p>It all seems bizarre for the casual observer. </p>

<p>When you&#39;re trying to move through it from my sisters POV, it must have been terrifying for her because it terrifies me to this day.</p>

<p>There are babies that are cute, adorable, squishy! My sisters babies were stunning. </p>

<p>It pains me to write that. It grieves my spirit. </p>

<p>Being shut out, shut down by the American Consulate in Mexico only meant my niece would never know how her mother fought for her and her sister.</p>

<p>The sad thing is that stories like that are far too common.  And one of the worst parts about it is that you can&#39;t even broach topics like this in everyday conversations - it&#39;s like people have this knee-jerk, almost automatic aversion to discussing it.  Like it&#39;s too reprehensible a thought to even consider possible.</p>
