        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been doing some investigations myself. Also, this is first go at something like this. Its late, I was bored so lets see how this goes. Thought I would retry this post at regular hours. Plus, I have been tired of all the posts that are just about the same. I figured I would add to discussion and throw this in the mix. </p>

<p><strong>Cartel influences Mexican Economy</strong></p>

<p>It will take 1.2 trillion dollars to get Mexico’s infrastructure to meet demands.
In 2010, Pemex claimed that cartels were stealing their natural gas. This was heavily influenced by US companies that buy and sell the oil, in the US. The pipelines that have been tapped by cartels have caused Mexico to lose over $300 million in profits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/06/02/37010.htm">“Pemex, Mexico&#39;s national oil company, claims that violent drug cartels are stealing as much as 40 percent of the natural gas condensate from the enormous Burgos oil field in Northeast Mexico, and that the massive thefts are &quot;encouraged and facilitated&quot; by U.S. oil and pipeline companies that buy the gas and sell it in the United States.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier this year(2014), BASF,a US oil company had its suit dismissed by the courts. This was a separate law suit, but the same judge is presiding over the court cases involving stolen natural gas in Mexico.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.worldoil.com/BASF-wins-dismissal-of-Pemex-stolen-gas-condensate-claims.html">“BASF won’t face trial on claims it unknowingly bought stolen natural-gas condensate from a smuggling ring that Mexico’s national oil company has had trouble stopping on its side of the border.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cartels have also been mining and shipping iron ore illegally. <a href="http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=2185668&amp;CategoryId=10718">The Knights Templar</a> has been mining in Michoacan. If authorities have seized over 300 million tons of iron ore, how much has been lost in total to cartels?</p>

<p>Much of the drilling areas in cartel territory have set up dangerous conditions. With Pemex due to become a private entity, no longer a national monopoly, companies will be demanding better security to protect profits. Some have hired cartel as security, since US intelligence reports of illegal tapping has increased to 1400 a year, as of 2012.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.gbtribune.com/section/58/article/75094/">“Security is a big concern, even bigger when the Mexican constitution prohibits you from carrying guns on Mexican soil,” said the U.S. security consultant, who spoke only on condition he not be further identified. “So what do you do? Hire a cartel to look after your interest.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>US-Mexico-Sinaloa Connection</strong></p>

<p>The DEA has cut deals with the Sinaloa Cartel. A high cartel member was extradited to US and was arraigned in Chicago. This member claimed that he was offered immunity along with Chapo Guzman and other high profile Sinaloa Cartel members. THE DEA would receive intel on the operations of other cartels (and money?) while allowing the Sinaloa to continue their drug smuggling into Chicago.</p>

<p>Journalists in Mexico have uncovered a Sinaloa connection with the Mexican presidency, which ties up the connections the DEA has created with Sinaloa. Government leaders have used soldiers and police to help out Sinaloa maintain their outfit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/mexico/140716/mexican-journalist-anabel-hernandez-drug-cartels-presidents">“In articles and books, she has alleged links between kingpins such as Joaquin “Chapo” Guzman and a series of Mexican presidents, including Vicente Fox, who ruled from 2000 to 2006, and Felipe Calderon, in power from 2006 to 2012.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a CIA <a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/10/15/inenglish/1381856701_704435.html">connection</a> dealing with Enrique Camarena, a DEA agent who was kidnapped, tortured and killed. Instead The Gudalajara Cartel were blamed for the death of Camarena. Regardless, a DEA agent was killed for finding out something he should have not known.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Former DEA agent Héctor Berrellez  explained that Camarena was kidnapped and murdered “because he came up with the idea that we needed to chase the money not the drugs.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_24343140/ex-dea-officials-make-bombshell-allegations-about-kiki">sources</a>, the Weed Farm he had discovered belonging to the Gudalajara cartel, was being monitored and funded in part by the CIA.This ranch belonged to Rafael Caro Quintero, the head of the organization. The ranch was use to fly drugs in and out of Central America. The profits were then to be used for arming the Contras in Nicaragua. </p>

<p>It is during this time that the conditions are being created for an immigration crisis to happen. Many of the immigrants coming today are from a region which was deeply affected by our governments dealing with cartels and rebel groups. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Celestino Castillo III,, who retired from the DEA, said all kinds of things went on during the Contra-Sandinista conflict. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_24343140/ex-dea-officials-make-bombshell-allegations-about-kiki">&quot;One of my assignments back then was to train death squads, who went on to kill many civilians during the dirty wars of Central America, including the Guatemalan Kaibiles (special forces unit),&quot; Castillo said</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The death of Camarena was interesting in that it helped launch the War on Drugs and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/redribbon/RedRibbon_history.shtml">Red Ribbon Week campaign.</a></p>

<p>In August 2013, the man who was complicit in Camarena’s murder was released from prison. A top anti-drug prosecutor noted how the US government has been pushing reforms for suspects. The US has their hand in this for a reason, and it could be tied to the discovery Camerena made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rafael-caro-quintero-infamous-mexican-drug-lord-released-after-28-years-in-prison/">The court threw out Caro Quintero&#39;s 40-year sentence for the murder of Enrique Camarena, ruling on Wednesday that he was improperly tried in a federal court for a crime that should have been treated as a state offense.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Mexican Civil Defense Groups</strong></p>

<p>Cartels have been operating training camps near the US-Mexico border since 2008. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1993854/posts">The camps near the Texas border and at other locations in Mexico are used to train cartel recruits – ranging from Mexican army deserters to American teenagers – who then carry out killings and other cartel assignments on both sides of the border, authorities say.
</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In less than a decade, vigilante or civil defense groups have risen against the violence that the US War on Drags has brought to their country. The Mexican Civil Defense groups are being formed for the failures of the Mexican governemnt to do anything about the narcotics trade. US agencies have also allowed these Cartels to grow to their current size. These vigilante groups have moved north in Mexico, reaching into Tamulipas. Towns are now feeling safe, all due to these civil defense groups responding to the failures of their governments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/mexicos-cartel-fighting-vigilantes-get-closer-texas-border-n151441">“This is the latest expression of a vigilante movement in Mexico that’s expanding from the southern mountains to areas near the United States border like Hidalgo, in Tamaulipas state.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Sinaloa Cartel is allied with the Knights Templar, which many Defense groups are fighting against. The Sinaloa Cartel has also hired other paramilitary groups to fight against the Knights Templar.</p>

<p>The Mexican Civil Defense Groups are fighting of a cartel which is allied to the Sinaloa Cartel. This cartel is protected by the DEA. I would say that the Defense Groups are defending themselves against groups that the US government has given immunity to.</p>

<p><strong>Recent Border Crisis</strong></p>

<p>For the past 2-3 months, the US has seen an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-illegal-immigration-unaccompanied-minors-20140724-story.html">influx</a> of illegal crossings along the Mexican border. Most of these people are children coming from <a href="http://www.latinopost.com/articles/7015/20140723/whats-really-driving-the-influx-of-children-from-central-america.htm">Central American</a> nations. This surge of people has caused the Border Patrol to run into clerical problems, which has led to fewer agents on the field.</p>

<p>This has prompted the state of Texas to increase patrols in the area. Texas Department of Public Safety has brought in over 100 troopers into the area. Gov. Rick Perry has also called in the Texas National Guard to support state troopers in their fight against cartel crime. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Texas-National-Guard-faces-limited-powers-on-the-5639527.php">&quot;If anybody thinks National Guard is going to be at the border with rifles they&#39;re wrong,&quot; said U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents the border region around Laredo. &quot;I can&#39;t speak for Governor Perry, but the authority the National Guard has is provide support service. They can provide intel support. They can be lookouts. But can they go out there and apprehend? Absolutely, under the law, they cannot do that</a>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is contrary to what Texas Governor Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed, said in regards to the guards legality to arrest or detain people.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Texas-National-Guard-faces-limited-powers-on-the-5639527.php">&quot;Criminals are taking advantage of the opportunity to ramp up their illicit activities,&quot; Nashed said. &quot;The Guard will be working seamlessly and side-by-side with law enforcement, who can detain individuals and refer them to the appropriate federal authorities.&quot;</a></p>

<p>His claims hurts the US war on drugs. All this fuss while Pemex is set to get sold off. These cartel wars are for control of land where oil and gas is to be found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about that. But I wouldn&#39;t be shocked. I am typically more of a skeptic than someone who believes many conspiracies. But I also know I live in a world where: </p>

<p>-- There was a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that Reagan conspired with the Ayatollah to keep the hostages until after Reagan was elected. Thanks to the hostage issue. </p>

<p>-- This &quot;theory&quot; was confirmed by Iran&#39;s former President from that time. </p>

<p>-- The former Iranian President also says 2 of his aids were murdered when they uncovered the plot. </p>

<p>-- And most damning of all, the hostages were released literally moments after Reagan was sworn in, and 11 months later Reagan sold weapons to Iran (for the 1st time). That&#39;s right, he sold weapons to the same nation that had just invaded our embassy (an act of war) and held our diplomatic staff hostage for over a year. </p>

<p>And we&#39;re supposed to believe there was no deal between Reagan and Iran. We know there was. And going behind the President&#39;s back and doing what Reagan did is defined as treason under our laws. Not only did he get away with it, he is considered one of our greatest Presidents today. </p>

<p>So yeah, I am a skeptic, but when it comes to our government I wouldn&#39;t be surprised by anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Born and raised on the Texas border (separate areas) and my dad is a retired Border Patrol agent.  There was an incident he told me about (about 5 years back or so) where the agents intercepted smugglers coming across on a boat with contraband.  Upon the interception the smugglers refused to land but also didn&#39;t backtrack to Mexico -- which is what they usually attempt to do.  </p>

<p>They stated to the agents that they had cartel snipers that would gun the agents down if they tried to stop them.  One of the agents began to negotiate with them but it was all a ruse on his part just to give another agent time to call in &quot;anti-sniper snipers&quot; as my dad called them.  After almost about 45-1hr of false negotiating (promising them a secure truck for a cut of the profits, etc). the counter-snipers did in fact spot two cartel snipers and took them out.  They radioed in to the agents that they were clear who then promptly arrested the smugglers.</p>

<p>Everyone interested in this kind of info should look into the &quot;Chip Tatum&quot; story. He recently came back to the U.S after many many years of the world thinking he was dead. Lots of interviews with him going back decades, as well as recent ones like Red Ice radio&#39;s interview with him.</p>
