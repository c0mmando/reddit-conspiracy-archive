        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">0</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-07-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AllIsI.html">AllIsI</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Please keep an open mind. I&#39;m trying to figure this shit out for myself because no one on the internet seems to be able to give me a satisfying answer. I&#39;m going to try to keep this as short as i can, so if i leave out some key details, please let me know, there&#39;s a lot to touch on.</p>

<p>Now, to start off, i am no novice in the spiritual field, i seem to have a decent amount of intuition (not trying to toot my own horn at all). I have experienced ego death a few times while meditating, soon after my second ego death experience is when it all started.</p>

<p>If i were to be bold, it seems to be that there are these bands, and these bands are communicating messages of &quot;enlightenment&quot; through their lyrics. These messages seemed to be synchronicity with my current situation, as if they were somehow communicating directly to me. I passed it off as coincidence for a few weeks, but there was just too much synchronicity to ignore. I started to meditate to a song, and something totally different happened. I started to experience sleep paralysis, slowly from my toes to my head. Once the sleep paralysis reached my head, i entered a completely dark, empty, void-like conscious space, and this freaked the fuck out of me so i stopped instantly.</p>

<p>I started analyzing lyrics of hundreds of bands, and i noticed parallels. Most of these songs i had heard before in my youth, and i thought i understood the meaning. What i have come to realize is that there are many layers of meanings between songs, and so i ask you to look past the surface, and through the shallow meanings. If you guys know anything about feminine/masculine mindsets, it seems as though the singer always have a masculine mindset while the person they are &quot;singing to&quot; has a feminine mindset. The singer is resonating while the listener is receiving. This is why the singer always refers to a &quot;she&quot; or a &quot;her&quot;, and will often use it interchangeably with &quot;you&quot;</p>

<p>I ask you to look at these songs as if the singer was speaking directly to you. You will notice a few things:</p>

<p>1) The singer will always want to show you something that you cannot yet comprehend, as if they were trying to light your spiritual path.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could show you</p>

<p>To the free field</p>

<p>Overcome and more</p>

<p>Will always be revealed</p>

<p>Not alone, I&#39;ll be there</p>

<p>Tell me when you want to go</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) The singer will speak of love, light, and being free, and all that new-agey stuff</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to reconcile the violence in your heart</p>

<p>I want to recognise your beauty&#39;s not just a mask</p>

<p>I want to exorcise the demons from your past</p>

<p>I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart</p>

<p>You trick your lovers</p>

<p>That you&#39;re wicked and divine</p>

<p>You may be a sinner</p>

<p>But your innocence is mine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3)The singer does not see themselves as separate from you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turn around and look at me</p>

<p>It&#39;s really really you ~ On Mercury - Red Hot Chili Peppers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4) Many of them say that they are aliens/angels</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&#39;t stop the gods from engineering</p>

<p>Feel no need for any interfering</p>

<p>Your image in the dictionary</p>

<p>This life is more than ordinary</p>

<p>Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these</p>

<p>Comin&#39; from space</p>

<p>To teach you of the Pleiades</p>

<p>Can&#39;t stop the spirits when they need you</p>

<p>This life is more than just a read-through  ~ Can&#39;t Stop - RHCP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After some research, many of these bands including MGMT, and RHCP claim to be channeling something. When they write music/songs they go into autopilot.</p>

<p>Okay so i&#39;m just going to cut to some examples and lyrics. No particular order. I can&#39;t really show you EXACTLY what i&#39;m talking about, you&#39;ll have to see it for yourself; but i can hold up the torch and perhaps shine some light upon it. The first few songs, you might not see much, but keep it up and you&#39;ll start to see the parallels. See these lyrics from the perspective of:</p>

<p>A)  The singer is speaking directly to me
B)  They claim to want to bring you closer to enlightenment
C   She/her/you = you directly</p>

<p>Drake Bell - Found a Way. Sounds a bit crazy, but i&#39;m going to let it speak for itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you open up your mind</p>

<p>See what&#39;s inside</p>

<p>It&#39;s gonna take some time, to re-align</p>

<p>But if you look inside, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find</p>

<p>Over your shoulder you know that, I told you</p>

<p>I&#39;ll always be pickin&#39; you up when you&#39;re down</p>

<p>So just turn around</p>

<p>Now that I know that anything&#39;s possible</p>

<p>I found a way, I found a way</p>

<p>No one can break what is so unbreakable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Muse - Guiding Light:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pure hearts stumble</p>

<p>In my hands, they crumble</p>

<p>Fragile and stripped to the core</p>

<p>I can&#39;t hurt you anymore</p>

<p>Loved by numbers</p>

<p>You&#39;re losing life&#39;s wonder</p>

<p>Touch like strangers detached</p>

<p>I can&#39;t feel you anymore</p>

<p>The sunshine trapped in our hearts</p>

<p>It could rise again</p>

<p>But I&#39;m lost, crushed, cold and confused</p>

<p>With no guiding light left inside</p>

<p>Oooo</p>

<p>You were my guiding light</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Muse - I belong to you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mmmh</p>

<p>When these pillars get pulled down</p>

<p>It will be you who wears the crown</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll owe everything to you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(reference to the veil of maya for those who didn&#39;t know)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Woooo, woooo</p>

<p>How much pain has cracked your soul?</p>

<p>How much love would make you whole?</p>

<p>You&#39;re my guiding lightning strike</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find the words to say</p>

<p>They&#39;re overdue</p>

<p>I&#39;ve traveled half the world to say</p>

<p>I belong to you</p>

<p>Woooo, woooo</p>

<p>Red hot chili peppers - The zephyr song</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you meet your fortune teller</p>

<p>Get it off with no propeller</p>

<p>Do it up it&#39;s always stellar</p>

<p>What a way to finally smell her</p>

<p>Pick it up it&#39;s not to strong - for you</p>

<p>Take a piece and pass it on</p>

<p>Fly away on my Zephyr</p>

<p>Red hot chili peppers - Warm Tape</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam</p>

<p>Settle for love you&#39;re never far from home</p>

<p>Carry me down into the waters of</p>

<p>Carry me down into the waters of love</p>

<p>Sleeping next to you and I&#39;m in your story</p>

<p>Shadow my free form</p>

<p>A woman that I could keep warm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are just a few examples, i don&#39;t want to keep this going for too long, but PM if you want some of the hundreds of other songs i&#39;ve looked through.</p>

<p>I hope you see what i&#39;m talking about. This isn&#39;t a super deep puzzle to solve, it&#39;s just a matter of looking at lyrics from the right angle. Once you see the lyrics from said angle, you will notice how direct these people are being. Now, don&#39;t these lyrics seem to be in positive and inspirational context? Yep. That&#39;s what i thought at first too. Then i started seeming some deception in their lyrics. Here are some examples.</p>

<p>Drake bell - I know</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All alone</p>

<p>Guess again</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been known</p>

<p>To take the hand of any man (keep the masculine/feminine in mind!)</p>

<p>Who will fill your fantasy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know and I know, and I know</p>

<p>It&#39;s always better when</p>

<p>You find out we&#39;ve been lying, cheating</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And found a way</p>

<p>To make them think that</p>

<p>You&#39;re a star</p>

<p>Silly girl</p>

<p>Only I can fool the world</p>

<p>It&#39;s plain to see</p>

<p>&#39;Cause you&#39;re just like me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Foster the people - Life on the Nickel (<strong>Hustling</strong>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I took the man and his horse</p>

<p>And ran before he looked up</p>

<p>I said the light&#39;s gonna change</p>

<p>But I&#39;m calm and feeling warm</p>

<p>And now I&#39;m sticking out my hands</p>

<p>And feeling weightless again</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that one scared the shit out of me lol</p>

<p>Muse - Hate this and I&#39;ll love you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh I am growing tired</p>

<p>Of allowing you to steal</p>

<p>Everything I have</p>

<p>You&#39;re making me feel</p>

<p>Like I was born to service you</p>

<p>But I am growing by the hour</p>

<p>You left us far behind</p>

<p>So we all discard our souls</p>

<p>And blaze through your skies</p>

<p>So unafraid to die</p>

<p>&#39;Cause I was born to destroy you</p>

<p>And I am growing by the hour</p>

<p>And I&#39;m getting strong in every way</p>

<p>Yeah, Yeah</p>

<p>You led me on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Red hot chili peppers - Even You Brutus?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well I guess I never told you some things</p>

<p>That I really, really wanted to say.</p>

<p>Did I do everything I could do,</p>

<p>Or did the mice just need to play?</p>

<p>Like I told you there&#39;s more than meets the eye.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MGMT - We don&#39;t care</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Step out of your skin, </p>

<p>Put it in a jar.</p>

<p>I thought they were my friends</p>

<p>But they were cannibals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whoa, have they experienced this form of deception before?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where should I begin?</p>

<p>Tell you what I am? </p>

<p>I&#39;m a normal alien.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Say it Ain&#39;t So - Weezer</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Say it ain&#39;t so</p>

<p>Your drug is a heartbreaker</p>

<p>Say it ain&#39;t so</p>

<p>My love is a life taker </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could it be possible that these entities somehow get a thrill from gaining one&#39;s trust (as they seem to try so hard to I hope you see what i mean.</p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s something to do with the color red. I can&#39;t figure this one out. It seems as though these people are killing people that are &quot;red&quot;, i think it&#39;s a reference to their aura/energy. </p>

<p>Red hot chili peppers - Otherside</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scarlet</strong> starlet and she&#39;s in my bed</p>

<p>A candidate for my soul mate bled</p>

<p><em>Push the trigger</em> and pull the thread</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got to take it on the otherside</p>

<p>Take it on the otherside</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sublime - Saw Red</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I saw red. I saw red.</strong></p>

<p><em>One more secret lover that I shot dead.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>MGMT - Future reflections</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a feeling the spirit was leaving</p>

<p><strong>Red like a marker</strong></p>

<p>So my tribe, with my knife</p>

<p><em>Cut the heart from a lonely life</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have come to many conclusions, but i don&#39;t want to give you guys too much of a bias so i&#39;ll say:<br/>
<strong>Pure speculation</strong>
These bands are emitting a frequency, when the listener matches that frequency, it allows for communication between the entity and the listener. I don&#39;t know wtf will happen afterwards, but the sleep paralysis left like the onset of a DMT trip, so perhaps these are the sentient entities that we hear of so much in DMT trips? Either way, i know for sure that these bands are adding a bit of deception into their lyrics, and no one should full on trust what they have to say, which makes me sad because i fucking love these bands. Tell me what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way for a band or movie to stay relevant is to tease a person with subliminal incomplete wisdoms. That is why some of the best selling movies are actually very old mythology or philosophical allegories.  Just redone over and over in different ways. The same patterns emerge when you research mainstream music. There is nothing new in this world. They have found what the human brain responds to and just keep using it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Music and movies, right brainers (or more balanced) have known the whole time what is going on. Typically the harsher the band the more truth they show, this is a cloaking technique to get the message out via poetry. This is a very SHORT list but you should really rethink who is good and who is bad. Pop is utter SHIT and will give you an earworm. You are correct there is hidden messages and they abound with the RIGHT mind you can pick up the messages. Anything popular or has ad placements is typically sold out and you ought to know to WHO.</p>

<p>MGMT - Time to pretend (about false reality)
NIN - Closer (About how fallen angels live off us)
NIN - Reptile (Speaks of the Queen bee as Lorde mentions in her Royals song too)
NIN - Happiness in Slavery (Basically how people live today)
Skinny Puppy - Assimilate (About giving into the societal norms)
Skinny Puppy - Killing Game (Starts off with fallen angels)
Red Hot Chili Peppers - Soul to Squeeze (The video is more revealing pay attention)
Marilyn Manson - Beautiful People (Who really rules us)
Marilyn Manson - Fight Song (Waking up and fighting the system)
System of a Down - BYOB ( About waking up to reality of war)
System of a Down - Chop Suey (Angels deserve to die)</p>

<p>I will end it with this &quot;Country&quot; song lyrics I cannot listen to country but even these dudes are waking up.</p>

<p>Sturgill Simpson Turtles all the way down:
I&#39;ve seen Jesus play with flames in a lake of fire that I was standing in 
Met the devil in Seattle and spent 9 months inside the lions den 
Met Buddha yet another time and he showed me a glowing light within
But I swear that God is there every time I glare in the eyes of my best friend 
Says my son it&#39;s all been done and someday yer gonna wake up old and gray 
So go and try to have some fun showing warmth to everyone 
You meet and greet and cheat along the way </p>

<p>There&#39;s a gateway in our mind that leads somewhere out there beyond this plane 
Where reptile aliens made of light cut you open and pull out all your pain 
Tell me how you make illegal something that we all make in our brain 
Some say you might go crazy but then again it might make you go sane </p>

<p>Every time I take a look inside inside that old and fabled book 
I&#39;m blinded and reminded of the pain caused by some old man in the sky 
Marijuana, LSD, psilocybin, and DMT they all changed the way I see 
But love&#39;s the only thing that ever saved my life </p>

<p>So don&#39;t waste your mind on nursery rhymes 
Or fairy tales of blood and wine 
It&#39;s turtles all the way down the line 
So to each their own til&#39; we go home 
To other realms our souls must roam 
To and through the myth that we all call space and time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright so you get it. This is a short list because i picked some of my favorite examples, but yeah, it&#39;s really all over the place.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see these as either good or bad, i can&#39;t put this into such a rigid box. There is a lot of valuable and neat information in these lyrics, and i guess i just have to use my intuition to weed out the lies and deception.</p>

<p>It seems to me that many of these bands do have egotistic intentions, but i&#39;m not really going to pay them much mind right now. I&#39;m not going to follow their information blindly, but i will still consider it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good to know people are waking up though. </p>

We are all here to work on ourselves and end the slavery on this planet. From the spiritual side Lucifer (Lucy in the sky with diamonds aka hologram tech) left the source due to his own power which was cutoff this is why they feed of our spiritual energies and also our blood. We are a mix of the Nephilim and source to experience what Lucifer&#39;s going through basically all the seven deadly &quot;sins&quot; . I&#39;m not religious and this goes much deeper but this is a taste from my own experience. The bible has a lot of truth if read properly it deals with an ET &quot;god&quot; and not the creator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been there, done that, rose above. Been meditating for 28 years. Used hemi-sync, binaural beats, brain machines, been out of body sober and on DMT. Ingesting DMT fumarate with an MAOI inhibitor is the absolute best method for a true astral/spiritual experience every other technique pales in comparison (Only did it once never need to do it again, wouldn&#39;t want to it was hard). Lots of people call it a drug and even use the term recreational, it is not I suggest watching DMT the Spirit molecule. It is found in a huge amount of plants and animals and is released at birth and death in large amounts. Funny thing is SPIDERS are one of the only animals that do not contain DMT. I also would like to add that post DMT ingestion, meditation is now done right and a constant awareness almost like waking meditation is within me. I can spot a lie from 100 miles away. The drawback is the information I have earned and gained does not make one a lot of friends. By that I mean telling people their entire idea of what they believe to be reality is a fraud will not make you the life of the party. So I awaken those who are already on the verge of their awakening and the naysayers, well they will get it eventually maybe as there will be some very embarrassing things coming to light soon. e.g 9/11 will be fully exposed with no room for doubt. The economy will collapse (this is a good thing the elite rule with money) Also what good is a bitcoin without electricity (if it comes to that)? The pedophile ring will make it over here to the US and Clinton and others will be exposed. The system will eat itself.</p>

<p>There was a clue in the movie Fear and Loathing about the Pineal gland which supposedly secretes DMT (they call it Adrenochrome in the film) listen to the guy on the public phone in the the hotel. Shortly thereafter when he starts tripping he sees reptiles everywhere. As Bill Hicks said TV is like black spray paint to your third eye, nothing could be closer to the truth than this statement. In order to bury the system it must be starved first. GO inward, spend time alone more than with others. READ, read and read some more meditate read and always always question. I have been fooled on my journey many many times as there is an opposition that puts out false shit as true. After awhile though you will see they almost throw the same pitch every time and the lies will be so glaringly obvious it almost stings when you hear it.</p>

<p>If everyone took 200mg of harmaline and 150 mg of DMT fumarate (alone and with intentions) just once I would guarantee an entire earth consciousness shift and an end to tyrannical government immediately. You do not get high (maybe in consciousness) but it aint a feel good thing it is therapy for the mind rape we have all been indoctrinated into by this false reality.</p>

<p>I can relate. You know that dude who claims to channel &quot;Bashar&quot;? Yeah, 80% truth mixed with a false foundation. That has probably fucked up so many people&#39;s spiritual knowledge, i&#39;m glad i started to notice some glaring contradictions in his advice. Spirituality is not being happy 24/7, that would be torture. What is happiness without it&#39;s opposition? Nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;m going to try not to write a big wall of text but I see you getting some very mixed messaged in these replies... I come from a scientifically grounded background, microbio/organic chem/calc/physics - typical left brain studies... but always felt a certain draw to spirituality and saw the beauty in the inner mechanisms of physiology that led me to light based quantum mechanics and buddhism and finally to a spiritual understand of my higher self and the reality thats been hidden/suppressed by those seeking power over others.... Please keep that in mind as you read, because I&#39;m not some hippy dippy flake but have been recently opened up to a lot of what you&#39;re currently experiencing.</p>

<p>Firstly, Synchronicity - the reason you&#39;re experiencing this music that you&#39;ve heard before as being particularily moving/inspiring/ or filled with intent/messages is because your higher self is calling your attention to these lyrics. It&#39;s like seeing number patterns everywhere you go - it&#39;s not because someone behind the scenes is orchestrating these events such that you might see them, but because youre higher self is aware of these things from outside of &quot;time&quot; -which is nonexistent outside of our third dimensional linear/limited experience it- and is calling your awareness to it. Use these moments of connection to your higher self to reinforce your understanding of being &quot;in the now&quot;. They are kind of like signposts, indicating to you that you&#39;re where you&#39;re supposed to be in that moment. You&#39;re always &quot;where you&#39;re supposed to be&quot; but now you&#39;re awareness is expanding to understand that, and we are going through a highly energetic transitional period where affirmation of your personal intuition will reinforce your &quot;knowing&quot; that what you&#39;re experiencing is significant.</p>

<p>Secondly, Sleep paralysis - this is something I&#39;ve struggled with my entire life. I lived through fourteen years worth of night terrors and waking up my family before I began to really understand what is happening. What you are experiencing during this tingly stage, is the physical sensation of your astral body &quot;stepping out&quot; of your physical body. There is no &quot;bad guy&quot; behind the scenes targeting you with black magic, this is something we all experience during dreamstate - but as we lower our frequency back to third dimensionality we tend to re-enter into forgetting because what we experience astrally doesn&#39;t fit into our linear left brain perceptions of time, so our brain filters out what it doesn&#39;t comprehend. What you should be doing is working to allign your chakric energies and cleansing/protecting yourself of/from negative energies/entities who might otherwise like to take advantage of you during this more vulnerable state. This is what I experienced during my night-terrors, because I lacked the understanding and naturally reverted to fear based mentalities, I allowed those entities to infiltrate my energetic space and interact with me in such a way that benefited them and terrorized me.... all a part of my learning process, unfortunately, but I do my best to share protection techniques with others. Try clearing/cleansing/allignment meditation techniques with amythest crystal - physical embodiment of &quot;the violet flame&quot;...</p>

<p>Thirdly, Ego-Death : the aware experience that the ego is a limited and non-permanent structure of your infinite soul. You are an eternal being, you are an individualized expression of the infinite, the all that is. You chose to experience a life in third dimensionality such that you might experience the idea of &quot;separation from source&quot;. This in itself allows you the experience of &quot;duality/polarity&quot;, the feeling that you are &quot;alone&quot;.. why? So that you might come to find your true self, and truly come to understand love/god/source/all-that-is/etc from the distinction of &quot;aloneness/separation&quot;.... In this way, you are &quot;god&quot; too - and I don&#39;t speak of some personified biblical entity that sits on clouds and casts judgement, I speak of the essential is-ness of Being. </p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t claim that all of these sources will resonate with you, an you must find your own truth... but posting on conspiracy is probably the last place to get feedback because the fear mentality on this website is overwhelming. Like any outlet, you must sift through the information, discard what seems like falsehoods or misunderstanding but following your self-proclaimed well-tuned intuition will lead you to truths that speak to your personal experience. Some good starter resources for you:
-google: &quot;tuning in- spirit channelers&quot;     well worth the watch as a groundswork for understanding and what personally opened me up to a lot of the ideas I would have otherwise judged as ridiculous hippy/dippy new age nonsense...
-goldenageofgaia.com    a bit new age, but often I come across channelled posts that really speak to the experiences you&#39;re describing - check out their library.. you can also search specifically for &quot;astral/lightbody/etheric body&quot; etc
-starseeds.net   access their forum. Although most on their are like yourself, new to these experiences and seeking understanding, they have a ton of interesting topic discussions on everything from conspiracy to astral projection to meditation techniques and everything in between.
-read: Martin Heidegger, you can start on &quot;intro to metaphysics&quot; and expand from there.. he&#39;s like intro philosophy, but when I read this is part of a bird course in Uni I took one meaning from it, and upon re-reading it recently, realized that I completely misunderstood him because I didn&#39;t have the awareness necessary to connect with his understanding. 
-read: Maurice blanchot, &quot;awaiting oblivion&quot;. First person perspective on entering into remembrance. This is what is referred to as the overarching experience that you are beginning to delve into - you had &quot;forgotten&quot; your true self, upon entering third dimensionality and now are entering into the remembrance of your true nature as a divine, infinite consciousness.</p>

<p>What speaks to you, whether it is music or art, math or physics, is irrelevant. Your understanding will blossom where you&#39;ve planted your seeds over the last few years/incarnations. When I meditate to Beethoven/Bach/Mozart I connect to that artists intentions and can physically &quot;see&quot; the music as a type of movement... very beautiful. Use whatever mediums you naturally connect with to begin to open yourself up to ideas that you would otherwise perceive as innane or irrational due to our indoctrinated egos. Let go of &quot;fear&quot;, truly you have nothing to fear except the limitation of fear itself - you are infinite, you are created of love, and within creation there are no mistakes - if you were not worthy, if you did not &quot;add&quot; to the &quot;all that is&quot; you would not exist. Therefor, you are inherently worthy and unconditionally loved. </p>

<p>Go forth and experience, Love and Light,
Namaste</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you are created of love</p>

<p>Why is it love? I&#39;ve never understood why creation is love, why is it positive? Would it not be the the synthesis of polarity? </p>

<p>Thanks man, i love you.</p>

<p>I used to fear a lot, but that&#39;s because i didn&#39;t understand what was going on. Not scared at all anymore. All is I. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes, one is asked a question in such a way that makes them question and process one&#39;s own understanding of that thing... You did exactly that, and although I&#39;m still defining my mastery of understanding of all of this, I&#39;ll attempt to address your question which did just that - make me think through my accepted/assumed belief in an attempt to explain it:</p>

<p>I suppose you could say that the frequency that underlies everything in existence can be experienced as &quot;Love&quot; -in our limited language/understanding- and the &quot;-Love&quot;, or what we would experience as fear which is symptomatic of separation from love... in this sense, it IS a frequency that can be experienced as a polarity. I suppose what we call it is irrelevant, it&#39;s not a logical thing that we can break down into simple human terms, it is what it is and the whole point of this process is to come into the remembrance of the knowing of all that is, reunite with Source. </p>

<p>Kind of like the energy spectrum of &quot;I/is-ness/being-ness&quot; and how it is interpreted as the duality of gender in this dimensionality - or in a broader sense: the Mother/Father/Spirit of Oneness energy.... You speak of this when you talk of the assertive male energy that gives, and the receptive female energy that accepts - then one must agree that there is a balance of that duality at a &quot;midpoint&quot; of this spectrum. This is the true &quot;trinity&quot;. Again, this is all viewing it from a linear perspective and certainly it&#39;s difficult to express these concepts within our limited verbal language.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s probably not the best explanation of my understanding of this idea.... let me meditate on the idea, maybe I&#39;ll be able to make better sense of it all :)</p>

<p>I love you as well, my keyboard compatriot - I&#39;m excited for you, as you embark upon this new journey of understanding. Keep positive, the world is changing and there are a lot more people asking the kind of questions you&#39;re asking, one step forward towards establishing peaceful coexistence and a better tomorrow for all of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you mean. Love is a word, and it&#39;s the closest thing that can come to describe this vibration in our language. Reminds me of a RHCP quote. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Simply put, I saw your love stream flow</p>

<p>Come on, baby, &#39;cause theres no name for</p>

<p>Give it up and I got what I came for&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s speaking of love.</p>

<p>if i were to speculate, let me try and pour my thoughts:</p>

<p>We were once one, and of course there was self love, or contentment, whatever you want to call it. When there is separation, the two that come from the one are still the same, but expressing as two, just as a mother and her child, but that self love never leaves, rather expresses as two, love for each other and the self. I think that makes sense, haha. That&#39;s just the way i&#39;ve thought of it, kind of hard/incomplete to explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your post. What you posted is important.  It&#39;s the first I&#39;ve seen like this. 
As a musician and part time artist, automatism is very important to me because the irrational is just as important as rational. If you listen to tomahawks new album &quot;oddfellows&quot; what you are hearing are trances. Not songs.  Patton uses sleep deprivation and caffeine in order to reach his sub conscious.  This is a flood of material.  I my self have several albums in my subconscious that play when I take certain chems. Loud as a raido. I write these down in a cuneiform fashion. Not English. My own inner language. It&#39;s a abstract drawing and when I go back to look at it while on the chess I hear the song again. Every part of it. Some as old as when I was three. 
  The thing is that the Bible teaches not to do this or to leave your mind open this way because it can be exploited by entity&#39;s.  It&#39;s like serving the net with no fire wall. 
 This is where a demon and exploit automatism.  If you don&#39;t believe in them, I don&#39;t blame you. The media.  All of it even music.... especially music is filled with nerolinguistic programing. Or nlp.  Really good therapists use this but so does stage hypnotist s.<br/>
  After experiencing ego death you realize we are all the same and what we imaging our self to be which is where information control comes to play. What&#39;s omitted? What&#39;s covered up? Why are history books in school different from real history books? It&#39;s because he that controls the past controls the present. That&#39;s it. 
  I feel so bad for out youth in school being bombarded with the mind control of this generation. In the music. In the action reaction response style of school and commercial telling then What&#39;s cool. 
 It&#39;s not true. Money of it is. There is a long running agenda and those aristocracy in music.... because they are all aristocrats....  are only part of it. 
 Look at Mac Miller combining religions in his music to reach a new age end. Great music.... drugs are awesome.  Let&#39;s not fool. But he coming from an aristocratic background from one of two schools. </p>

<p>School one is He&#39;s using drug&#39;s  to hear the music in his subconscious. 
The life He&#39;s lived with out any spiritual connection is evident in his music. This is good. He gets his trances on tape really well. </p>

<p>School two is He&#39;s using drugs and his automatism state is then guided by an entity who knows nlp. Is part of an organization that follows the works better than Jehovah&#39;s witnesses and they are pulling his strings. Which also sounds amazing and influences us on a neurological level. </p>

<p>Both are possibilities. I have experienced automatism that was of a demonic nature.  I&#39;ve since put in nlp blocks to flash a sigal incase there is any invasion of my person and the session ends. Or I think It&#39;s over and I&#39;ve not done anything really to protect myself and I&#39;m being pulled in a direction I shouldn&#39;t be if I were on my own. This is why the Bible shows these similar parallels so as to abstain for now..  we are not meant to play about the spiritual realm at this time. It&#39;s to easy to be influenced. See what I mean?
  Thanks for the post and know it will all work out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are experiencing a real thing, but be careful.</p>

<p>Basically, you have come to the attention of the Illuminati, probably because you attained ego death, and so you lit up their scanners.</p>

<p>The playlists you experiencing synchronizing with your real life are controlled by humans and computer programs.   These are part of an organization that is a faction within the Illuminati.</p>

<p>The sleepy sensation you feel is a problem.  That is the influence of adversarial magic putting you to sleep.  The dark place you are experiencing is called the &quot;unreality&quot; but it has many regions and the dark places rob you of energy.</p>

<p>Something similar happened to me.  About 3 years after they started messing with me, I crossed paths with a cat that I had known for a long time.  &quot;What happened?  You used to be so shiny.  They&#39;ve hurt your magic.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t know.  The main thing I would keep in mind is that the lyrics are probably being chosen by people familiar with your situation.  </p>

<p>Considering the lyrics you are quoting, they seem to be instructional about the bardo and meditation.  This implies that the Illuminati want you to spend more time in trance.</p>

<p>That, coupled with the fact that you feel sleepy before you experience the bardo, makes me think they are draining you the way vampires drain pray.  They &quot;teach&quot; you to enter the Bardo, subdue you when you do, and then drain you.</p>

<p>So I would look at the externally-controlled media as not your best source of information.  Whatever you have been studying up to this point is what they started to feel threatened by.  Keep doing that thing.</p>
