    <div class="md"><p>Israeli zionists are frantic. It is self-evident. Israel ios doing relatively absurd things, clearly with full support from the US. From that can be argued that the systemic world order that underlies the US, respectively all satellite states of the US, is coming under threat. Israel doesn&#39;t have much time left to realize its ambitions. Israel can only achieve a certain number of ambitions,  and clearly they have carte blanche to use whatever force to realize these ambitions.  What Israeli Zionists want is to get rid of the inconvenience of having a rapidly expanding (fast breeding) population of utterly economically useless and demographically impossible to integrate people in mostly hostile enclaves. Israel is now more or less applying whatever flimsy excuses and the full force of advanced military to make life so utterly uncomfortable for these native aliens, the end result can only be palestinians fleeing or dying. What is left will be very old, heavily traumatized, severely scarred, cripple Palestinians and those would not serve much of a &quot;processing problem&quot;, so to speak. For Israel to realize its ambitions of a defensible plot of land in the middle east, it must engineer one uninterrupted and solid border. Currently the security of Israel is compromized, in case certain geopolitical factors might quickly change, and as should be clear many geopolitical factors are a few months to a few years away from changing dramatically. A geopolitical storm is coming and Israel is weatherproofing itself, no holds barred.</p>

<p>My conjecture is that the US knows, and most US satellite peon nations (my own country included) are full aware the dollar status as international reserve currency is very close to collapse. Once that happens, the US will have no alternative than to renege large portions of its debt. There are ways to do that, but most these approaches lead to massive economic upheaval, worldwide bankruptcies and bank defaults. It would be hell for the US, analogue to the collapse of the soviet union, with the difference that the US itself has thoroughly &#39;weatherproofed&#39; itself against the most painful excesses of a plausibly imminent collapse transition. Look at the changed law enforcement paradigm in the US, which should be a glaringly obvious sign of things to come. Look at the frantic, almost hysterical mad scramble for remaining oil and gas resources inside and outside the US. It&#39;s all highly indicative of a fire sale scenario. </p>

<p>Israel will expunge the Gazans in to Egypt, Jordania, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia. Many of the US-supported regimes (or hostile) in respective countries already are aware of this and they simply don&#39;t care. The map of Israel will be redrawn without a gaza within mere years, at any cost. Current attacks on gaza are a precursor to far more sinister strategies and infrastructure of ethnic cleansing. Once the deteriorating situation in the US becomes untenable, the US itself phase shifts to a collapsing police state, Israel will head out full force in extermination mode. The Arab world will do absolutely nothing and will with great recalcitrance accept a few million refugees. Ten, fifteen years from now gaza will have been bulldozed, rebrandished and unrecognizable part of Israel. No road, no building, nothing will remind people Gaza existed. In the place of the current Palestinian hovels and ruins will stand a Manhattan-sized esplanade coursing with palm trees, hotels, shopping malls and condo&#39;s, for fresh Jewish immigrants, settlers and colonists. Twenty years from now this newly acquired land will shamelessly be a destination for tourists, who will be none the wiser as they soak in sapphire blue Hotel pools . </p>

<p>The world media has caught on, especially the internet. There will be massive protests, but there is no way to do anything left. People don&#39;t care, dulled by decades of anti-arab propaganda and cinema. For the typical westerner the typical Palestinian men, woman or child is as loathsome as a Mordor orc, and instinctively most modern, democratic, enlightened Caucasoid will block out the inconvenience of having to accept the realization these are in fact human beings. </p>

<p>We are at full Goebblian media control. We live in highly stratified, corporatized oligarchic societies, my own country included. The media is so dulled and fragmented it doesn&#39;t even understand the nature of its own castrate complicity. It just spasms along in a vegetative state of following instructions from respective head offices. Yes, quite a few people in the world look at the Gaza massacre and know with uncanny precision the full morbidity of what happens there, and they can do nothing, least of all if it exposes them to the potential embarrassment of arrest and imprisonment. </p>

<p>If in 1935 people had known in advance, and had cared enough, it would have been eminently clear what could be done to stave off the mass murder of millions of man, women and children. People back then by and large didn&#39;t know. But right now, most people know, and those in charge have learned in precise detail what to do and say to make counter-action effectively useless and impotent. We are surrounded in all western countries by a hazy cloud of our own overfed docility, or our seething racism, our cowardice, our confusion, our laziness, our gnawing fear, myself not excluded. </p>

<p>People like myself just see and understand and endlessly wait for that golden opportunity to do something of meaning. I write articles nobody will ever read, maintain some endlessly obsessive compulsive facebook group that doesn&#39;t even have a hundred members, like Pilate washing my hand of the shredded viscera and clotted blood of massacred children.</p>

<p>I loathe myself only marginally less than I loathe the castrated hordes of consumers out there, who insist soccer has moral priority over clearly visible and televised Genocide. There is nothing left to do, other realize damn precisely what kind of people are responsible for this nightmare we live in, and once we can after the collapse has arrived I will know full well what kind of charred, tortured corpses will be swinging from the lamp posts in my city. </p>

<p>But probably nothing will happen, and maybe twenty years from now I&#39;ll float in some very nice sapphire blue Israeli Riviera pool sipping a low calorie Margarita after I won some local supermarket prize. I won&#39;t even realize that the fine gravel of the beach next door will then be for 0.7% composed of fine human bone material.  </p>

<p>Fuck the human species. Bring on that giant asteroid, <em>please</em>. </p>
