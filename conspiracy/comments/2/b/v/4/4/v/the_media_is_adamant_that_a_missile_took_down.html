       When a plane is destroyed over a war zone, the first assumption is that it was taken down by a surface-to-air missile. In this instance the Russian-backed Ukrainian rebels were the "obvious" culprits. Case closed, right? Wait a minute...
      </p>
      <p>
       We learn that MH17 was deliberately put "in harm's way" by Ukrainian air-traffic control - taken over a war zone controlled by the enemy, at which point there was an explosion and it fell out of the sky. How convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't a (low probability event of a) remotely detonated explosion be ignored in favour of the obvious, but erroneous, assumption that the plane was shot down by the rebels? The answer is demonstrably, yes, it would.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So, has anyone got any hard evidence that MH17 was taken down by a missile?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       N.B. Hard evidence does not include fancy graphics of the BUK missile system or media speculation about the movements of BUK mobile missile launchers - we know that both Ukrainian troops and rebels have them. I want to see hard evidence that that a BUK took down MH17, and if none is forthcoming, I think we should reconsider some of our assumptions about this event.

       Interesting doublespeak you mean. He tries to sound sincere and passionate, but he's not. His face doesn't convey the emotion his words have. He's a fake and a liar, and he's only there to manipulate the public.

       and the Ukrainians had the SAMs in place near where the plane flew, the full SAM systems with personal to use them, the chances of the rebels having a full working system is slim, not to mention knowing how to use such an antique system.

       the pictures from the Ukraine of the colored and numbered wreckage are photoshop fakes.

       the main piece with the 9M-MRD number on it is a composite picture, the smudging around the edges of the wreckage is obvious.

       the pictures by the large piece of fuselage by the road, the hooded special forces soldiers have been photoshopped, look closely at the mittens and the tactic vest. the dude with the tripod on the left is wearing 1950s or soviet style clothing... (some photoshoppers idea of an injoke !)

       Bait and switch - false flag event to get UN into the Ukraine and on Russia's border. Probably hoping to affect BRICS in some negative fashion? We all know that starting WWIII would be quite profitable and would help at least decimate, if not annihilate world population.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I've actually seen any evidence that couldn't be tampered proving a ground-&gt;air missile, nor air-&gt;air. But there is significant evidence to point to the plane being guided to a place it wouldn't have been normally, under any circumstances.

       That's OK. Virtually everybody has been led to believe it was a missile, but when you drill down for the evidence it's not there.

       the globalresearch article goes into great detail on the very unlikely and impossible chance that it was the Ukrainian rebels that fired off the SAM at the airliner, they could only have seen it flying for 70 seconds, not enough time for the five minute warmup and targeting of a big SAM system.
      </p>
      <p>
       and of course who benefits from the claimed shoot-down, not the rebels, not the Russians, Ukraine maybe, NATO maybe if they can incite war between Russia and Ukraine. (cash strapped Ukraine would lose, no doubt on that)

       in the real world, everybody loses.

       the secret squirrels who planned and executed this abomination need their heads examined, then they need arrest and prosecution.

       as we saw from SHES, Boston, and the other hoaxes, theres an element in the secret squirrel club that seems to have absorbed the Hollywood coke-snorting culture, they live in this dream world where PR releases make reality.

       This is what the US military-industrial complex is hoping for, and actively working towards.

      <p>
       I am pretty sure the autopsy results (Netherlands) and the Black box analysis (AAIB/UK) are going to be withheld for as long as possible in the hope that a full scale conflict breaks out in Ukraine which NATO can get involved in.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the results are finally published (perhaps proving it wasn't a rebel missile) it will be too late.

       the Georgia/Russian conflict failed miserably a few years ago.

       the focus on this is likely the closing off of the Russian warm water port.

       If the system requires such a warm-up time, wouldn't it always be on? Fighter jets fly significantly faster and lower than airliners, which would give the targeting system even less time. However, SAM missiles don't run off of line-of-sight, they run off radar.
