<p>There are other ways of &#39;knowing&#39; that transcends &#39;reasoning&#39;, but scientists these days are too caught in their methodology. All the famous scientists and musicians of old days said they never came to conclusions and came up with ideas based on reason, the information was &#39;downloaded&#39; to them. While this only seems to lend to the idea of a common shared consciousness and not &#39;God&#39; itself, surely there must be a way of &#39;downloading&#39; the objective truth from the collective consciousness. </p>

<p>There are also many, if not all, cultures that talk about a god, or multiple gods. This is likely a stop gap interpretation of ideas and phenomena that they could not explain at their current level of intelligence/technology.</p>

<p>We know so much more now. We are so much smarter, and have much better tools. We are objectively better suited to try and understand current mysteries then people thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t offer much insight on your second paragraph, I don&#39;t completely understand it. Are you a Scientologist maybe? I&#39;ve heard of some similar themes there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not scientology, but Gnosticism. I would not say that we are better suited to understand the past, as many people are able to remember their past lives and dig into what is called the &#39;Akashic&#39; records of the earth and read exactly what happened back then. Atlantis was real. Lemuria was real. They had technology far more advanced than ours. Their civilization was so much further ahead than ours. Its getting late, so I cant delve into how I know this is true, but you have a very open mind, so keep this on the backburner. Send me a PM. I promise that the sources are 100% verifiable by yourself as well and not fanaticism, you just need to develop the spiritual resources in order to access the records yourself. Google gnostic teachings atlantis and there is tons of free info online. This is the real good stuff. No bullshit, test it out yourself spirituality. This is the real reason why there are so many lies. I hate to use the cliche, but this is the stuff they don&#39;t want you to know about. Not a cult either, youre free to believe or disbelieve.</p>

<p>Also for the last paragraph, I&#39;m talking about the collective consciousness as described by Carl Jung and referenced in Buddhism, Hinduism, Tao, and many many other ancient cultures. Nikola Tesla always said the ideas he got came to him in a flash or a dream... this is what he meant.</p>

<p>This is a bit hard to believe, as there have been many posts about supporting armed resistance of the government (pick whatever government you like). That seems like a war to me.</p>

<p>Also the relentless picking of sides, Ukraine/Russia and Israel/Gaza. It doesn&#39;t matter who you support if your message is to keep fighting. That&#39;s pro war.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty similar, unless you can tell me roughly how many Palestinians have been killed/gassed? If it&#39;s millions, you&#39;re right on track.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, I do get that you were going for hyperbole, but it isn&#39;t the best example on either side, mine included.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all serious my friend, I&#39;m very open to just about anything. Highly doubt the world is flat, although, despite your initial skepticism towards this, please look into it as I feel as though you have an open mind: the world might just be concave and we are living on the inside. Again, I know this sounds absolutely retarded, but there is actually some really good scientific studies thay have never been disproven that say so... of course this would mean that all the NASA photos ever shown have been a lie. Google wildheretic concave earth. Again, please look into it before calling me crazy, you may be surprised... :)</p>

<p>As for the moon being a hologram... who knows. Again, I&#39;m open to anything. Btw, the concave earth theory was the official belief of the NAZI regime... and then we took those scientists and formed NASA... but again,  that&#39;s just something to think about, not to make any conclusions from. Happy researching! Feel free to ask me any questions you may have.</p>

<p>P.S. I realize that anyone reading this will have many initial doubting questions. I promise that this isn&#39;t some half baked theory straight from LaLa conspiracy land. Even a NASA scientist was interviewed about the topic and came out speechless. Look into it as well as the Glass Sky theory (probably on the wild heretic site as well, if not on youtube) and it actually explains a ridiculous amount of currently unexplainable phenomena (such as megacryometoers as well as tectonite meteors and Libyan desert glass.)</p>

<p>Would you believe that I said I actually frequent the flat earth society website? In all honesty, I love it. I read up on the forums every week, and not in a sarcastic &quot;I&#39;m above this&quot; type of arrogance. I actually learn a lot from them.</p>

<p>Not much about flat/round earth theory, the science is pretty much settled there, but more about logic and how one should present an argument.</p>

<p>Their forums are littered by people posting &quot;OMG, you guys are so stupid, the earth is round, I&#39;VE SEEN IT!&quot;. </p>

<p>Not that they are wrong, but caps lock isn&#39;t proof by itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Btw, the concave earth theory was the official belief of the NAZI regime... and then we took those scientists and formed NASA...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might sound odd, but being a scientist does make you smart, it just makes you an expert <em>in your field</em>. I wouldn&#39;t ask a rocket scientist to explain the difference between the genus of two very similar insects.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you are responding to me honestly, and if I am wrong about everything, then talking (chatting?) with you has at the very least helped me understand another point of view.</p>

<p>You&#39;re one of the good ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry! I&#39;ve been out of town. It is a historical record more than anything. The brief opening explains the format. The doc declares, &quot;If they want peace, they will have to overcome the legacy of 1948.&quot; It&#39;s very much tit-for-tat. Palestinians are defined as refugees. I&#39;ve seen about 6-7 docs on it, and I find this one to be more informative, better sourced, and it leaves room for discourse. In my mind it seems obvious that peace will not exist unless Israel packs up and leaves the entire middle east. If Palestinians go, it would only infuriate already tense regional Islamic nations. It would also change the battlefield by removing the civilians. Then there is the temple mount. They are already teaching a new generation of temple priests how to perform all of the roles (according to law) in the new temple to come. They claim to have the ark and are waiting on the go ahead. If Palestine is expelled or annihilated, it WILL be built. I found the doc pro-Palestinian, but a Zionist ma find it pro-Israeli. It&#39;s like the any big atheism vs theology debate. Supporters on both sides always seem to find that they won. Let me know what you think!</p>

And the Jews are 100% to blame for everything (besides the British promising things they can&#39;t actually do) because they went to Palestine and were initially welcomed but then eventually outnumbered the Arabs and they started to force them out of their own country/land that they had been on for hundreds of years!  I mean, it is unfortunate that the Jews suffered so greatly at the hands of the Nazis but that does not justify them going to another country and essentially doing the same thing with help from the rest of the world because they felt guilty!  Holy crap all this did was make me angry.  I had no say on the matter at all because I truly didn&#39;t know but this, this is just sickening.  And the fact that we give these blood thirsty land stealing murders a shit ton of money to perpetuate this war sickens me even more.  </p>

<p>My question is what can Palestine do to either recover their land, or unite their people so they can build and become a successful state that lives next to Israel in peace? </p>

<p>And do you know what has happened so recently to set everything off again.  I understand that it &quot;never really stopped&quot; but obviously the past month has been hell for Palestine, why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears that Israel is destroying neighborhoods. I mean, its all just gone. Children almost seem targeted, but I&#39;ll reserve myself regarding a tactic of such vulgarity. It&#39;s always the same. Israel provokes Palestine during holidays, hurting/killing children, killing 10 Palestinians for every 1 Israeli, etc. Instead of leading your digging (thus minimize important genealogy), I suggest you look into just how far the bloodlines go. The Royal Family, Rothschilds (owns much of Israel), and Rockefellers (donated UNs land) all are part Jewish. Ethiopia and other African countries have Jewish blood. Many suggest that the seed of Ishmael is the Irish, and Stalin &amp; Lennon are Jews too! Also check out the common ancestor of every POTUS. Truth is, they aren&#39;t really all that Jewish. These guys a Zionists. Zionists fly a six point star which has its foundation in the occult. These guys in Israel ARE the UK and US. Its all the same entity, and its corporation driven. Two more things 1) &quot;Oded Yinon Plan&quot; from 1982 <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/greater-israel-the-zionist-plan-for-the-middle-east/5324815">http://www.globalresearch.ca/greater-israel-the-zionist-plan-for-the-middle-east/5324815</a> 2)End times prophecy actually has a whole lot to say about the Zionist <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2059&amp;amp;version=NIV">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2059&amp;amp;version=NIV</a> It also speaks of Palestinians as Judah, but they will be herded in another place because they turned on their tradition as well. But Zion/Israel get is big time. Funny how every church won&#39;t preach the word of their God. They have everyone thinking the Muslims will kill us all. Jeez. </p>

<p>“To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:</p>

<p>These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again. 9 I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the slander of <strong>those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</strong> 10 Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.</p>

<p>11 Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death.&quot; </p>

<p>Revelations 2:8-11. </p>

<p>Not to scare anyone, but ya know, things aren&#39;t looking to great in the world right now. And you can&#39;t do what Israel has done without being pure evil. I&#39;m not eating the fetus biscuits. This goyem will starve.</p>
