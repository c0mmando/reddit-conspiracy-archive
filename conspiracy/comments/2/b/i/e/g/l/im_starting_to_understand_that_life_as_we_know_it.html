This world is made for the majority right? Well the few who have woken up are the ones pulling the strings. People like us open the world for others. American dream? Keep on your path dont get caught up in the show and play your part that you had been given. The matter part honestly we see how much of the spectrum? The rest what doesn&#39;t exist because we cannot see it. Those elements that use a lot of energy and with shorter half life&#39;s are the normal thing there..

Though there is widespread acceptance of social reform and frustration with issues like the hobby lobby case and the NSA (thats kinda died off though...) I keep finding myself the bringer of doom and gloom when I tell them whats going on in the world. Even my hippy buddies havent got a clue.

<p>That is not to say we are nonexistent. I just dont run into anyone who knows about this shit at shows and parties, which is where the majority of my generation finds themself on the weekends. Turn down for hwat?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, I don&#39;t feel that way at all. Because that&#39;s not the way I operate.</p>

<p>I understand that is the social conformity that is pushed down peoples&#39; throats, especially in the West and most especially in the USA. But that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re required to live that way.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong - I work for a living (because I don&#39;t expect anyone to hand me the food, shelter, clothing, etc. that I and my family require), but I don&#39;t &quot;consume, conform, and obey&quot;.</p>

<p>I use my income to acquire the necessities and then whatever is left over, I use for its proper purpose. After you have all the money you need to survive, the only value it can offer is the happiness it can bring you and those you care about.</p>

<p>Sometimes that is &quot;stuff&quot; (it&#39;s fun to drive around with my wife in our convertible). Sometimes it&#39;s experiences (a week at Disney when our daughter was a pre-teen made many great memories, as have a lot of things we&#39;ve done). But it&#39;s never buying shit to buy shit.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just lucky that I can see through the consumerism and commercialism and therefore avoid being owned by it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is some pretty freaky and fascinating stuff and those four sentences barely scratch the surface. But ultimately we are here, we are alive, we experience things, and we can find happiness.</p>

<p>As fascinating as digging in to understand the mechanics of the universe is, in the end, we have a scant few dozen trips around our local star to experience happiness and help others do the same. We should look into the details because they&#39;re cool, but in so doing we should absolutely not forget what matters - that we have a tiny amount of time and need to use it wisely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin is easy to control/manipulate. Everyone focuses on the &quot;security&quot;, but no one looks at how you can exploit it inside its rules. </p>

<p>For example you could write persona software that managed numerous wallets. These wallets would all make small purchases of BTC via VPNs all over the world. One entity with enough cash could easily buy all/enough of the BTC to corner the market. </p>

<p>They could then use their persona software to start trading between themselves, giving the illusion of lots of volume/trading. The &quot;value&quot; of BTC goes up, it is percieved as viable, and the path to a centralized currency is set.</p>

<p>With 21 million BTC @ 500USD, you could corner the entire market for ~10 billion USD. In reality you&#39;d only need less to control the market. 10 billion isn&#39;t a drop in the bucket at the higher levels of the ponzi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are Senators trying to fix it, just a bit, from the face the banking system puts on public display so I don&#39;t know that society isn&#39;t doing anything about it.</p>

<p>The problem is that a lot of people are disenfranchised and don&#39;t vote, and a lot of people who do vote, vote against their own best interest for a wide variety of reasons. So those Senators trying to fix the system are going to be hard pressed to get enough votes to become President and actually fix the system. (I&#39;m thinking Warren here...)</p>

<p>But there are things you can do, yourself, about the banking system. Or at least to avoid its impact upon your life.  The single biggest one is to stay out of debt to the maximum extent possible.</p>

<p>Save your money, buy a car with cash. If you can&#39;t afford the one you want, save longer or buy a lesser car.</p>

<p>If you feel like you want to keep credit cards &quot;just in case&quot;, keep them but do not use them.</p>

<p>House... well... you&#39;re probably going into debt for that. But at least the interest is a tax deduction. Buy a lot less house than you can afford / buy only the amount of house you need, and pay it off early. It&#39;s amazing what putting an extra $100-$200 a month into your mortgage can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why don&#39;t you organize a movement yourself? Instead of blaming everyone else for not doing anything ask yourself what it is you are doing about it. But spare yourself the aggravation. I&#39;ll tell you what happens when people collectively organize and protest the fed. Occupy wall street. That&#39;s what happens.</p>

<p>Frankly I have better things to do than be a protesting hippie and get tossed in jail like provide for my family. I&#39;m a slave to debt I know this but I accept this as the way of things.</p>

<p>Protesting is for youth who are care free and lack responsibility or accountability .  The system keeps us working because at the end of the day weather or not you think money has any real value it does because it pays the bills. </p>

<p>What is value? Value is what one person can trade goods or services  to another for goods or services. Gold has no real value either if you think about it. It is pretty to look at but as far as practical applications it&#39;s worthless.  Yet for millenia societies place a value on it and trade it for goods or services. </p>

<p>Currency is necessary for any society to function. Would you honestly do the job you are paid now to do for free? I wouldnt. I&#39;d rather be fishing or at the beach. Who would build your house or your car? Who would refine the petroleum into gasoline? Who would flip burgers and cook fries for you ? The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Weather it&#39;s paper or gold coins or 1s  and 0s in cyberspace, currency and the system backing it are a necessary evil.</p>

<p>So spend less time being angry and remember the old saying about having strength to accept that which you cannot change. We all have to eat and the only way to get out of the system is to go live in the mountains and hunt your own food, farm your own land, make your own electric, say bye to reddit and the internet. Etc etc. People do it all the time. It&#39;s called off grid living.</p>

<p>And it requires a large initial money investment. Look it up.</p>

<p>What is it&#39;s proper purpose? It seems you are advocating &#39;do whatever you like/have fun&#39; with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it can offer is the happiness it can bring you and those you care about. Sometimes that is &quot;stuff&quot; (it&#39;s fun to drive around with my wife in our convertible). Sometimes it&#39;s experiences (a week at Disney when our daughter was a pre-teen made many great memories, as have a lot of things we&#39;ve done). But it&#39;s never buying shit to buy shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Experiences are no different consumption than material. You destroy resources for pleasure in both instances; material possessions give you pleasure until it is &quot;used up&quot; and experiences give you pleasure until you die. Either way, resources are expended/consumed for pleasure.</p>

<p>Now, I am not saying we can&#39;t ever have pleasure, but as long as you would rather be comfortable consuming while financing Disney and Car_Companys than producing, there is no way to end this cycle.</p>

<p>Your message of: keep spending and blindly pursue happiness right now reminds me of Bush after 9/11: &quot;Keep shopping or the terrorists win.&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>If money = power, why do we give it up for fleeting pleasures?</li>
<li>Disengage the thieves&#39; economy on all non-essential functions.</li>
<li>Deploy your capital today on solutions for tomorrow that require no dollar inputs.*</li>
<li>Spend timed with loved ones while pursuing goals.</li>
</ol>

<p>*A simple example: By spending a few dollars today and the labor to set up a garden/orchard, in the future you can generate fruit for no dollars. If enough people did this, Monsanto and friends are dead. I use gardens only as one simple example because everyone needs food.</p>

<p>Almost correct. Per quantum physics, matter exists in multiple states at any given time. But, once obesrved by and external entity, it must be either a particle or a wave. Einsteins equation, e=mc<sup>2,</sup> explains that all matter is also all energy. Quantum mechanics goes further to explain how a given matter is represented based on how it is observed. The duality here is the ability for any given particle to act as a wave or as a physical, observable particle. </p>

<p>Since youve been looking into quantum theory, have you heard about quantum entanglement? Pretty interesting shit right there. Also of not, is that the entire universe is made mostly of dark matter, and we only see a very small percentage of the matter in the universe. Only 4% of the universe is observable within the electromagnetic scale that we are able to detect. Just 4%. That means that 96% of the universe is not understood by current physics. </p>

<p>There was a fascinating article i read not too long ago that illustrated this very well. Ill try and find it. If i do, ill put it here...</p>

<p>Actually, you&#39;re not quite right. What quantum mechanics showed us is that matter an light can be both waves <em>and</em> particles (as opposed to only being particles or waves respectively). <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality">Here&#39;s a good explanation of Wave-Particle duality</a> (it&#39;s simple english wikipedia, because normal wikipedia sucks at explaining these kinds of complex concepts). </p>

<p>To think that life went through billion years of evolution just so earth could turn into one big shopping mall is ridiculous. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re putting the cart before the horse. &quot;Shopping malls&quot; are entirely human constructs &amp; concepts. &quot;Shopping malls&quot; are contingent on human activity, as a synthetic byproduct.</p>

<p>Life went through &quot;billions of years&quot; of evolution and accidentally ended up with Humans. (remember evolution isn&#39;t teleological, it doesn&#39;t move towards a fixed point). Those humans then went and built shopping malls.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is, it&#39;s much less absurd to think that Billions of years of evolution created the human species, <em>not</em> shopping malls. </p>

<p>Also you are assigning values to things, like &quot;Shopping Mall&quot;, and the &quot;Natural Universe&quot;. Since the Universe is of a higher order, you&#39;re arbitrarily assigning it a higher value than the shopping mall.</p>

<p>But these values you are imposing on the world are themselves not mind-independent. So it makes no sense to say that the Universe has behaved &quot;meaninglessly&quot;, as that presupposes the Universe <em>should</em> have behaved/exhibited some meaning in it&#39;s behavior. Which is Absurd, as the Absurdists would say, because the search for human values and meaning in an indifferent universe is absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system is set up so that the majority of human beings devote their entire lives to slaving for a small elite class that is obscenely wealthy. It&#39;s been this way for thousands of years. We are brainwashed that we need to buy and possess and display, and then society is arranged in such a way that in order to buy what we are told we want, we must work  40  hours or more per week, for the rest of our lives. Work is the central activity for us. To make sure we can never slip free of the noose, we are encouraged to go into debt to buy things we don&#39;t need, but are told we want, by a ceaseless barrage of advertising.</p>

<p>The small elite class aren&#39;t content with merely enslaving us and profiting from our labor, they want to control everything we do, say or think. There are laws and rules telling us where we can drive, where we can park, where we can walk, where we can stand or sit, and what we can do there (it isn&#39;t much, other than breathing). Senseless time-wasting regulations for everything that do nothing but waste our time, and bring home to us that we are slaves and they are the ones in control.</p>

<p>Look at income tax. There is no need for anyone to fill out income tax forms these days, yet we still have to do it (or hire someone else to do it). Why? Because it is a form of conditioning. We are being shown that we are slaves to the will of the elite.</p>

<p>Soon they will eliminate cash, and that coupled with their surveillence grid will give them total, absolute control over our lives. They will record everything we do or say, and hold it in reserve to use against us if they see a reason to punish us. They will know everything we buy or sell, everywhere we go, who we talk to, and what we say to them.</p>
