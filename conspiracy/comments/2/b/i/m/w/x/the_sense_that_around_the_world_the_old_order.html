<p>Had a good laugh.  Was reading the article because I was kind of disgusted that the president has to go to the west coast for 3 days in order to lock in donations.  That seems ridiculous to me at a time when the world is in such dire straits.  :/   It is what it is, but this quote  just reminded me of the H.W. quotes and the like and made me giggle.  We need to elect real people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How so?</p>

<p>He seems to play right into their schemes by passing their agendas through executive orders.</p>

<p>He still passes the same constitution violating NDAA as W.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how he&#39;s an obstacle by not only being part of the final destabilization efforts, but also paving the road for the NWO through increased adoption of new technologies and laws which enable them to be abused by the NWO.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like, if people don&#39;t take control right now with the open source technology revolution and pass legislation which supports it ( such as the right to 3D print guns ), then I feel it will be too late, probably already is seeing as how they already have crazy things like stealth cloaks and active body denial systems and long range acoustic devices and tazers and bullets which can change trajectory in air and 100 round fully automatic grenade round launching shotguns.</p>

<p>It&#39;s insane how ridiculously advance the weapons technology is, yet world poverty is still an issue.</p>

<p>Should I add that he&#39;s still beholden to the money masters at the Fed and those associated with them?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll add nothing more so it doesn&#39;t appear I&#39;m focusing on him, because it isn&#39;t him, he&#39;s a puppet.</p>

<p>Zbignew Breizinski is way above him, and there are other players more powerful than he.</p>

<p>The true power lies within he who none can see, in the shadows forever concealed through the minions that do his bidding.</p>

<p>We can never stop him because people are always ripe for the picking to carry out his plans.</p>

<p>ACLU Executive Director Anthony Rmero said, &quot;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/31/obama-defense-bill_n_1177836.html">President Obama&#39;s action … is a blight on his legacy because he will forever be known as the president who signed indefinite detention without charge or trial into law</a>.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Obama signed it into law</strong>.  He said he would veto it, admitting he had &quot;reservations,&quot; but didn&#39;t.  According to Senator Carl Levin (D) -Obama&#39;s administration requested this language, adding provisions to the NDAA 2012, affirming the AUMF, to allow for indefinite detention of citizens without charge or trial.  <strong>That is the point</strong>.  And guess what, the lawyers agree.  The journalists agree.  And I don&#39;t care what you think my political affiliation is, these are the facts.</p>

<p>The change demanded by obama was a few years back and was because the NDAA had been written to allow the Defense Department to do the detaining, (the miliatry) 2010 I think, Obama had it changed to Presidential authorization.  If you can&#39;t see why an office directly elected is a better choice than some general you are making a poor choice.  </p>

<p>My entire point is  you have no idea what NDAA is or when it originated, nor will you bother to look, and the conservative propagandists, know they can make up anything and  you will believe it,------------ because, Obama is a devil, yes indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Now to show a change you have to show one from a Bush era signing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I most certainly do not.  Bush signed the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/pdf/PLAW-107publ40.pdf">AUMF</a>.  He&#39;s got blood on his hands.  </p>

<p>What you need to do is admit you were wrong.  I provided many sources to which you now conveniently don&#39;t mention, PROVING Obama has blood on his hands too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The change demanded by Obama was a few years back and was because the NDAA had been written to allow the Defense Department to do the detaining, (the miliatry) 2010 I think, Obama had it changed to Presidential authorization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck does this have to do with anything?  It doesn&#39;t change the fact that Obama signed the NDAA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you can&#39;t see why an office directly elected is a better choice than some general you are making a poor choice. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, what the fuck does this have anything to do with Obama signing the NDAA?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My entire point is you have no idea what NDAA is or when it originated...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know a hell of a lot more than you apparently.  Where are your sources?</p>

<p>Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about?  You never made this claim at all and it has no relevance for what we are debating.</p>

<p>You see nothing.  You&#39;re blind, delusional, ignorant and wrong.  Period.</p>

<p>Look at the last point of your link entitled &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDAA#Notable_or_controversial_NDAA_legislation">Notable or controversial NDAA legislation</a>.  It says:</p>

<p><em>This NDAA contains several controversial sections (see article), the chief being §§ 1021-1022, which affirm provisions</em> <strong>authorizing the indefinite military detention of civilians, including U.S. citizens, without habeas corpus or due process</strong>, <em>contained in the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if <em>you</em> think Wikipedia has a Libertarian bias, despite the fact you have NO evidence to suggest that, it has nothing to do with the facts:</p>

<p>Obama signed the NDAA 2012, codifying the AUMF to allow for indefinite detention of citizens without charge or trial.  Look at the sections 1021 and 1022 as per the PDF I provided.</p>

<p>These provisions are unconstitutional to the American Civil Liberties Uion and the National Lawyers Guild as per the links I provided.</p>

<p>Pulitzer prize winning Journalist Chris Hedges is suing the Obama administration because of these provisions.  He&#39;s also got the support of Noam Chomsky and Daniel Ellsberg to boot.  If you think Noam Chomsky is a Libertarian, you&#39;re crazier than I thought.  </p>

<p>You have provided no evidence that Obama did not sign the NDAA into law, or that these provisions don&#39;t do as many lawyers, civil liberties activists and journalists claim they do.</p>
