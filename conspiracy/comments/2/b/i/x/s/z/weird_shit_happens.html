        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been debating whether or not I should publish this, not really in fear of the government or my life (I don&#39;t think I am that important), but more for fear of reprisal from my fellow man.  I guess I am just looking to find others with similar stories.</p>

<p>I would like to talk about strange occurrences I, or any of you, have faced since &#39;awakening&#39;. </p>

<p>My story is long and often boring, so I well spare the details.  I &#39;woke up&#39; in 06-07 and became as active as I could.  Getting involved with We Are Change AZ was awesome, and a great outlet.  I got to meet and hang out with very interesting people.  It was a blast!  Yet, this is when things took a strange turn in my life.</p>

<p>My first encounter occurred on my second WRC brainstorming meeting.  I was a n00b, and suspicious of almost everyone at the time.  That being said, I still was eager to learn and help.  We were working on a speaking engagement with Jesse Ventura.  It was a logistical meeting dealing with the how many and how much.  Nothing too exciting.  </p>

<p>Except there were these two men, one fat and short with glasses (kinda looked like Newman from Seinfeld), and the other tall and slender.  Newman (for lack of name), did all the talking, his partner was simply there.  He brought with him a white 3 inch, 3 ring binder filled with pages of &#39;supposed evidence&#39; of CIA front companies in the textile industry funneling drugs, weapons, and money to criminal interests.  </p>

<p>He wanted to show Jesse this evidence, for whatever BS reason (I forgot).  Newman attempted many times to divert the brainstorming session, asking when Jesse will arrive, where will he be staying, and repeatedly asking if he could have a moment with him.  Feigning interest, we told him that we would do what we can.  </p>

<p>After the meeting closed I asked to see Newman&#39;s evidence.  He flipped through page after page of what looked like walls of text with &#39;official&#39; looking seals on them.  While examining the documents, I notices out of the corner of my eye, his partner (tall, slender, quiet guy) wave his hand over an empty plate and my buddy&#39;s (only dude I trusted at the time) driver&#39;s license drop out of his sleeve.  </p>

<p>It was totally fucking unreal.  I remember thinking, holy shit!  Did I really just see that!  Confronting the guy, he denied it and said he bumped it with his hand, but that ID had been there the whole time.  I grabbed the ID, called my buddy (he already left), and retold the story to him.  Just as I was getting in my car to leave, Newman and his partner hustled over to my car and wrote down my plate.</p>

<p>Shortly after getting involved with WRC AZ, I hooked up with the FreedomsPhoenix.com crew.  It was a pretty natural transition since it&#39;s all the same people.  We had a studio for burning dvds, recording podcasts or live radio, and a stage for shooting news pieces.  Ernest Hancock and his wife provided access to everything provided you were spreading truth, and bought your own supplies.  I spent much of my free time there.  </p>

<p>A few months in I noticed one particular speed camera would flash as I passed it on my way to the studio.  The first time it happened, I thought I was speeding and slowed down.  I didn&#39;t think anything of it, and awaited my ticket in the mail.  The second time it happened, I knew I wasn&#39;t speeding, as I was still anticipating a ticket from the first.  I remember thinking, “Oh come on!  That&#39;s bullshit!  I wasn&#39;t speeding.”  The third time it happened I became suspicious.  It had been over a month and I had yet to receive any ticket.  I also noticed it only happened after using my phone to inform someone I was on my way to the studio.  </p>

<p>The forth and final time it happened I tested the theory with a witness, and my wife.  I called one of the guys at the studio and let him know that I was on my way, and was looking forward to getting my picture taken.  My wife rode with me as I passed the camera.  I pointed out the camera about a mile before passing it.  We watched people speed pass the camera without getting flashed.  Yet, driving the speed limit on cruise control, it snapped a shot as I passed it.  This time I had a witness and video of it.  After showing a few of the guys at the studio, it never happened again.  I still have never received a ticket some six year later.</p>

<p>Then there is the Jackalope.  I distanced myself a bit focusing on family first.  Still wanting that connection with like minded people, keep friendships alive, and practice bugging out we would go camping every year with others from the liberty movement in AZ.  This camping trip morphed into what is now the Jackalope Freedom Festival.</p>

<p>The first year was a blast, and we were pretty much left alone.  Only a few people wandered into our camp asking questions, and some new guy, nobody knew, walking around taking pictures of people claiming it&#39;s for his website.  Never saw the pics, the guy again, or his site.  I hope they got my good side.</p>

<p>Last year it was over the fucking top.  My wife and I got there late in the evening, and had to setup camp in the dark.  As soon as we finished we joined the campfire as the conversation turned to our observers.  Apparently, I had just missed the drop off of agents that scattered into the surrounding forest.  Multiple witnesses, many I trust greatly, said they witnessed three black SUVs pull up to the edge of the clearing, behind the trees, and people, clad in black, move into the forest as the vehicles sped off.  Once again, I did not witness this, but I do trust the people who did.</p>

<p>As the festival progressed more people wandered in from surrounding camps asking questions, taking pictures, and listening but not necessarily contributing to conversations.  Some were obvious feds.  Once again a new guy, no one knew, walked around taking pictures for some website that never surfaces.  </p>

<p>I say it was over the top because of our rude, early morning, last day alarm bell.  Laying in my tent, Sunday morning, I awaken to the sound of a heavy thumping sound growing louder and louder.  It&#39;s about 5 am, and the previous night was a late one.  Still groggy, I unzipped the tent flap to a deafening sound and sight of a black, unmarked helicopter flying low and slow over the campsite.  It looked like a blackhawk helicopter to me, and I didn&#39;t see any weapons mounted on it.  Probably picking up those agent.  Who knows?  It was very obvious they were sending a message.  They wanted us to know they were there.  </p>

<p>Six months after that incident/ago, our local power company installed a surveillance camera on our residential street.  The truth behind the camera has never been revealed, as even the ACLU won&#39;t touch it.  We got it removed, but never the truth.  It&#39;s a long story, ask if you want to know more.</p>

<p>Recently, a few days ago to be precise, my wife and I were on a family vacation through New Mexico.  One of our stops was Roswell.  Walking the little strip there, we attended the UFO Museum.  As a witness myself to a few things I could not ID, and studying ufology since I was a child, I learned a few new things, but noticed that a lot was missing.  I started pointing out the stories left out at the museum and deeper points that I understood to my children.  While doing so, I noticed a man holding a camera edge a bit closer to hear me talk.  He was alone and appeared to be more interested in the people at the museum than any of the exhibits.  I kept a sharp eye on him, more for the protection of my family than anything else.  </p>

<p>Moving along the exhibits, my eldest made a comment about a sighting I had previously explained to him.  His comment was that he did not see a single picture depicting what I had described to him, and he asked for another description.  As soon as I told my eldest what I saw, it looked like a giant doughnut with a bite taken out of it, the man with the camera swooped over, raised his camera, and snapped a shot of my profile.  I turned to look dead at the guy as he averted his eyes and made his way down an aisle.  My wife, a few aisle ahead, noticed it as I mouthed, “did you see that?”  Nodding her head the man with the camera walked right past her, as he headed for the door.  And just like that he was gone.  Poof.  My wife said she looked right in his eyes and he had that Oh Shit look. </p>

<p>This bring me to today.  The Jackalope starts August 1st, and I wouldn&#39;t miss it for the world.  I am sure something odd is bound to happen.</p>

<p>Has anyone else witnessed similar events, and if so what do you make of it?</p>

<p>TL;DR Weird shit happens when you wake up and get active.  Here are some things that have happened to me.  What have you witnessed?</p>

<p>Edit:  Here is the email content:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My apologies, I’ve been swamped.  The City of Phx replied denying that they had any records that fit our request.  They basically stated the APS light pole was approved by mistake, via phone call, and no other cameras had been approved before or since.  We are looking to see if there is any more information we can uncover, but for right now, there doesn’t appear to be more we can do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone takes a picture of you without asking, ask to take a picture of them.  Regardless of what they say, take their photo.  I just suspect they will not want their photo taken if they are part of hired surveillance.</p>

<p>I wonder how they feel knowing you took their picture, when it was their job to photograph you.</p>

<p>The next thing I&#39;d do is try and spark a conversation, and get intimate details about their &quot;cover&quot; story.</p>

<p>If this happens a lot, I am sure there will be a pattern of similar cover stories... like photos for a &quot;website&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me be the first to say I am a skeptic about most things. As I read this I started going back to my &quot;waking period&quot; which was about January of this year. Literally within days of watching Zeitgeist and subbing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I had a homeless guy appearing on my street. To give you an idea, the town I lived in for about 10 years had one homeless man nicknamed &quot;bicycle bob&quot; because he rode a bicycle and was the only homeless man around.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the guy came by and looked at construction equipment (across the street) for a while and would leave after 10 minutes. I noticed that he started showing up when I would leave because I would go to the 7-11 for a drink, come back and he was there. So one day I tested the theory and left my house turning down the next street. After a minute I came out on the next street over and there he was, coming down the street. Now I wanted to let this guy know I saw him so I stopped and got out on the other side of the street. When he noticed me, he stopped and walked back up the street. After driving by my house and looking down the next few streets he was nowhere to be found.  </p>

<p>I told my neighbors about this and after maybe 4 sightings, he never showed up again for the remaining 8 months we lived there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but the chance of this person to be in the dead center of an upper-class town is rare. It wasn&#39;t just the fact that he was homeless, the timing and getaway factor made me think it was significant.  </p>

<p>Also, if he were desperate he wouldn&#39;t have spent about a week casing a home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it sounds like you hadn&#39;t engaged in anything that might have drawn additional attention. You watched a youtube clip and subscribed to a subreddit.</p>

<p>Even assuming the most nefarious and conspiratorial intentions, wouldn&#39;t you assume that the bar for manned surveillance is slightly higher than that?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t say this to undermine you or your experience, but rather with the hope that more folks will check their paranoia. Perhaps he was there to watch you, but I would be willing to wager that most folks experiencing a similar situation have literally nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>If there is truth to be found out there, it is -- right now -- being drowned in a sea of disinformation and paranoia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact of the matter is, we can&#39;t...really, trust anybody we don&#39;t know personally. We have no way of knowing how far the government is willing to go to suppress activism. They obviously can&#39;t outright do it, which is why Occupy was plagued with simple infiltration and legal restrictions. How hard would it be to silence, or just scare someone on the internet?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give my own example. Where I live, from the front of my house, you can see the side of a neighboring road, and where the minimall ends. For a few years, every day and night, though not all day and night, a cop car would be parked there. Nothing of it, right? Except my dad tells me he thinks cops have been following him around here. Paranoia, right? Except the same year I started noticing that cop was the same year my parents divorced. My mom was a local, and she was friendly with important people in the area. She absolutely destroyed my dad with legal fees and bullshit. When he finally got it ended for good, and paid everything off finally, he gets arrested for drunk driving (which he would never do, because the one time he did, he was in a car accident that killed his best friends). Furthermore, once this happened, that cop was no longer seen. Two years and some months later, that cop is back. And why do I suspect this? Because a week or two ago, I started flyposting on telephone poles around my town (general political awareness, save palestine, nothing inflammatory) and posted about it on here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it <em>is</em> because of those things, because I will likely never know the true details. But it sure is a weird set of coincidences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just had a interesting experience about two weeks ago in L&#39;viv, Ukraine.  Long story short we were partying at a club and I decided that I was smoking far too much hookah and drinking far too much vodka so I took a breather outside to stroll around for a few minutes.  I didn&#39;t realize it but we were close to an airport (that I never saw) and although I didn&#39;t see anyone I had an incredibly eery feeling that I was being watched ten ways to Sunday.  I ended up just stopping in the middle of a street and waving hello to buildings around me.  I think that we can feel when we are being watched.  I can at least.  Then I walk back and there is a military cop guarding a building and being very interested in me and he wasn&#39;t there before.  I just innocently strolled into a security grid and I felt it and knew it.  I don&#39;t need to be validated on CNN to believe in myself.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So that is where she went wrong.  Very wrong.  If I was doing that heavy shit like that I would check into a hostel and I would ditch the toiletry kit.  I would hang out at the hostel for some hours in a location that I could see lots of people and I would communicate redundant banter with other travelers about travel stories and I would watch for other people checking in and then I would just pick up and leave to another hostel.  It would put a lot of pressure on an assassin or just a tail to further show themselves.  Actually I&#39;d be a hell of a lot more meticulous than that.  Private hotel room.  Ha!  That shit is entirely unnecessary.</p>

<p>That is if I was doing something heavy like that.  Otherwise I just completely avoid anything heavy.  People over here in L&#39;viv, Ukraine have tried to introduce me to supposedly important connected people and I always decline.  I have nothing to gain from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened a little less than a year ago. </p>

<p>I was walking down this stretch of street that is surrounded on both sides by thick forest. There aren&#39;t any lights, besides the ends of the roads, so it&#39;s pitch black for the ten minutes it takes to walk. I was half way down when I thought I heard something moving, so I looked behind me and I saw a shadowy outline of a vehicle. It continued following me for another ten-twenty seconds before turning it&#39;s headlights on while I looked at it. It then turned around and drove off. </p>

<p>I booked it to the other end of road after that, sufficiently spooked. I still have no explanation. From what I saw, after it had headlights on and left, it was a white well kept van with likely ample space in the back. Can&#39;t say what happened there. It seemed more like a warning than anything else. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember what, but I remember being very vocal about something and halfheartedly thinking to myself that I could be taken interest in. Then this happened, and I thought it was an odd coincidence. I&#39;ve been walking down that road for a long time now, and nothing like that has ever happened. Could have been anything, but it was weird shit nevertheless. </p>

The road out there goes by the river and there are combinations of forests and vineyards all through there.  They were doing massive sweeps through there and I was routinely driving it late at night.  My friend first started getting paranoid about it and then I started really paying attention to what was happening with the cars.  Basically for a period of time the long winding River Road was surveillance central.  Maybe they were trying to clear Central Americans out of there.  Not sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting story.   Be careful buddy.   It&#39;s awesome to hear that there are a lot of people out there getting involved to fight for true liberty.   But seriously be careful.   If things start getting really hairy, have an exit plan.   And remain vigilant.<br/>
Personally I keep everything quite private.   I guess I am a bit paranoid.   I keep everything out of public light or, like on reddit, anonymous.   If and when shit hits the fan, I wouldn&#39;t want anything connecting me to anything that would get me in trouble.   You can&#39;t fight if you are locked up.     It also helps to keep appearances up.   Maintain hygiene, nice clothing, no shitty attitude, I do debate politics but never let my real feelings or knowledge slip in the pubs.    I am also a very involved member of my community and city and a young professional.   I am a perfectly invisible citizen.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying everyone should do as I do.   It&#39;s just an example of what I do to fly under the radar.    Yes it is very difficult to not speak my mind sometimes.   But I believe people like us are very valuable and need to stay on the right side of the ground and right side of the fence.   </p>

<p>Sometimes for those that do, it feels like pissing in the wind.  There are those moments that make it all worth while, but one must struggle to achieve or even find those moments.

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t even talk publicly about most of the weird stuff that happens to me.  But here&#39;s one that&#39;s pretty tame, yet still inexplicable.</p>

<p>In 2009, I was photographed by some kind of camera on a pole while going down I-40, in Arizona I think.  Doesn&#39;t sound so odd, I know.  But it was at night, or close to it.  I noticed this pole thing off the side of the road.  It looked like the kind of temporary construction equipment that is all over the place.  Then I saw a really bright flash.  It wasn&#39;t a license plate reader, because it was aimed at the front of my car.  I wasn&#39;t speeding.  There was no reason to target my car, that I can think of.  I didn&#39;t see it taking pictures of any other cars.  I&#39;ve never heard of anything like this before or since.  I can&#39;t imagine this is standard practice, just for the sheer dangerousness of using a bright flash to blind oncoming cars.  So, as far as I can tell, it was either targeting me for some reason, or just a complete anomaly.  No telling.</p>

<p>This isnt to uncommon either, but the people who are stalked usually say is that  the stalkers are just trying trying to annoy them and frustrate them to get a reaction, some people go into depth as to how they do it. </p>
