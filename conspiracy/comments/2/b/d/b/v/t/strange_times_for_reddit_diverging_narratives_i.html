        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was shocked to see a short anti-Israel comment of mine get hundreds of upvotes, in a time when the propaganda machine seems more active than ever. Whole threads will be dominated with pro-Israel sentiment but this divergent narrative is still erupting out of the noise on an increasingly regular basis. Similar thing happening with the Ukraine situation, the US narrative dominates the front page, but not everyone is convinced, and you see these voices of skepticism and caution against war-mongering gaining traction.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re starting to see why the JTRIG story was so heavily suppressed. What happens when people become distrustful of the motives of online comments? We see the word shill being thrown around all over the place like never before. Maybe the tactic backfires when revealed, anyone anonymously voicing support for powerful interests becomes immediately suspect. So even honest arguments from useful idiots lose value when these programs are revealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t the fact that other people have mistakenly branded you a shill when you clearly aren&#39;t say something important about what happens when paranoid individuals start judging anonymous redditors as paid shills on the basis of a few random posts they disagree with? If we&#39;re judging shills as people who &quot;can&#39;t back up their claims&quot; and &quot;repeat and insult&quot; then it seems 90% of the internet is in on this conspiracy.</p>

<p>You think a professional agent is paid by a third party, possibly the government, just to make baseless claims and insult you on the internet. Even if we are to accept that the government is involved in influencing online discourse, why would this be an effective strategy? </p>

<p>Some people on the internet will disagree with you. A lot of them will also act like massive dicks while they communicate their disagreements. You&#39;re being trolled, not shilled.</p>

<p>An ad hominem (Latin for &quot;to the man&quot; or &quot;to the person&quot;), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a general category of fallacies in which a claim or argument is rejected on the basis of some irrelevant fact about the author of or the person presenting the claim or argument. Fallacious Ad hominem reasoning is normally categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance. Ad hominem reasoning is not always fallacious, for example, when it relates to the credibility of statements of fact.</p>

<p>Ad hominem arguments are the converse of appeals to authority, and may be used in response to such appeals.</p>

<p>You know they are not bottle rockets and the only way you refer to them that way is to mislead others. They are real rockets and they are dangerous.

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t making a comment on the ethics themselves, just that opinion is not black and white. Just because people support Israel&#39;s decision to bomb Gaza it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s propaganda. It just means they have a different opinion to you. You have every right to be angry at their stance or mentality and it&#39;s good to see people getting passionate about the debate. I just find it amazing that OP essentially presents this plurality of opinions as &quot;establishment propaganda&quot; vs. &quot;anti-establishment sentiment&quot; instead of just a bunch of people with different viewpoints on a historically complex conflict.</p>

<p>Hamas still openly store the weapons they&#39;re fire into Israeli territory amongst the civilian population. This is why some people think the Israeli offensive is justified. To them, the death is unfortunate collateral in a war against a stubborn enemy. To them, it doesn&#39;t matter that Israel has a superior military force or that there are so many more Palestinian deaths than Israeli because Hamas is still attacking Israel and Israel - as any country - has a right to retaliate to military aggression, even if the aggressors are militarily inferior. If their enemy is going to hide amongst civilians what are they to do, just let the enemy attack them without reprimand? </p>

<p>To others this offensive is an entirely unjustified, one-sided slaughter of civilians. To them the entire premise of Israel having a right to the land is unjustified and they are nothing but oppressors. Hamas fire rockets into Israel because Israel have taken their homeland and subjugated their people and any aggressive Israeli response is inherently unjustified.</p>

<p>See how normal people could support different points of view? Welcome to the real world, where everyday people have different opinions on difficult issues and not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill or part of the propaganda machine.</p>
