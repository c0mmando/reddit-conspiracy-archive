       I was shocked to see a short anti-Israel comment of mine get hundreds of upvotes, in a time when the propaganda machine seems more active than ever. Whole threads will be dominated with pro-Israel sentiment but this divergent narrative is still erupting out of the noise on an increasingly regular basis. Similar thing happening with the Ukraine situation, the US narrative dominates the front page, but not everyone is convinced, and you see these voices of skepticism and caution against war-mongering gaining traction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we're starting to see why the JTRIG story was so heavily suppressed. What happens when people become distrustful of the motives of online comments? We see the word shill being thrown around all over the place like never before. Maybe the tactic backfires when revealed, anyone anonymously voicing support for powerful interests becomes immediately suspect. So even honest arguments from useful idiots lose value when these programs are revealed.

       great post. i've noticed that Reddit has been completely taken over by propaganda machines from various entities. it makes me wonder if this is the nail in the coffin for reddit.

       I'm definitely see the propaganda everywhere. Over the past couple of days I've gone comment-to-comment with several shills, in this sub and others. I know that they are shills because they can never, ever back up their claims. They only repeat and insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even got called a shill the other day as well. It's like a badge of honor, like being made fun of in

       Doesn't the fact that other people have mistakenly branded you a shill when you clearly aren't say something important about what happens when paranoid individuals start judging anonymous redditors as paid shills on the basis of a few random posts they disagree with? If we're judging shills as people who "can't back up their claims" and "repeat and insult" then it seems 90% of the internet is in on this conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think a professional agent is paid by a third party, possibly the government, just to make baseless claims and insult you on the internet. Even if we are to accept that the government is involved in influencing online discourse, why would this be an effective strategy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people on the internet will disagree with you. A lot of them will also act like massive dicks while they communicate their disagreements. You're being trolled, not shilled.

       There used to be a good document on shill tactics circulating.  It laid out the sort of arguments and tactics shill use to piss you off, distract you, and make you look dumb.

       Trying to incite violence and dissent as if everyone on Reddit is a rabid Florida Man. When the term "hive mind" started circulating while there was always clearly many, many differing opinions and points. It is a sad time we are in, Reddit is officially DEAD.

       I've always thought "what if." "What if" we could get 3-5k like minded people then we can shill the shills. If that was somehow possible we can push back against them.

       I hate to be the one copypasting, but:
      </p>
      <p>
       An ad hominem (Latin for "to the man" or "to the person"), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a general category of fallacies in which a claim or argument is rejected on the basis of some irrelevant fact about the author of or the person presenting the claim or argument. Fallacious Ad hominem reasoning is normally categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance. Ad hominem reasoning is not always fallacious, for example, when it relates to the credibility of statements of fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ad hominem arguments are the converse of appeals to authority, and may be used in response to such appeals.

       The Israel/Palestine conflict is complicated. As with most war it isn't a case of one side being objectively right and the other being wrong so there are naturally arguments supporting both sides.

       Which part of Israel bombarding the shit out of innocent Palestinians is ethically complicated again? Oh right, the part where they supposedly fired some bottle rockets over their cage in response to DECADES of encroachment and oppression.

       You know they are not bottle rockets and the only way you refer to them that way is to mislead others. They are real rockets and they are dangerous. If what Israel is doing is so terrible then why are you afraid to tell the truth about the rockets? Maybe because the truth about the rockets does make it ethically complicated.

       I wasn't making a comment on the ethics themselves, just that opinion is not black and white. Just because people support Israel's decision to bomb Gaza it doesn't mean that it's propaganda. It just means they have a different opinion to you. You have every right to be angry at their stance or mentality and it's good to see people getting passionate about the debate. I just find it amazing that OP essentially presents this plurality of opinions as "establishment propaganda" vs. "anti-establishment sentiment" instead of just a bunch of people with different viewpoints on a historically complex conflict.
      </p>

       Hamas still openly store the weapons they're fire into Israeli territory amongst the civilian population. This is why some people think the Israeli offensive is justified. To them, the death is unfortunate collateral in a war against a stubborn enemy. To them, it doesn't matter that Israel has a superior military force or that there are so many more Palestinian deaths than Israeli because Hamas is still attacking Israel and Israel - as any country - has a right to retaliate to military aggression, even if the aggressors are militarily inferior. If their enemy is going to hide amongst civilians what are they to do, just let the enemy attack them without reprimand?
      </p>
      <p>
       To others this offensive is an entirely unjustified, one-sided slaughter of civilians. To them the entire premise of Israel having a right to the land is unjustified and they are nothing but oppressors. Hamas fire rockets into Israel because Israel have taken their homeland and subjugated their people and any aggressive Israeli response is inherently unjustified.
      </p>
      <p>
       See how normal people could support different points of view? Welcome to the real world, where everyday people have different opinions on difficult issues and not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill or part of the propaganda machine.
