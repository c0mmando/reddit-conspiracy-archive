    <div class="md"><p>I know this was meant to mock, but its exceedingly easy to see.  Just watch a movie.  In the matrix, the controlling computers realized that there was a certain sub set of people who would never submit.  So they created Zion and populated it with people who where unplugged from the matrix.  </p>

<p>Any system of control has to have an acceptable outlet for those who would resist.  Without it, tensions boil over.  The fact is, your mocking is also a form of control, over you.  As well, the longer we bitch on this forum, the less likely we are to act, making it safer to keep us all here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>... that&#39;s not true at all. People aren&#39;t a tea kettle. Using the matrix analogy, the matrix would function better if Zion didn&#39;t exist. If you have limitless power, you don&#39;t need to allow a few people to know the truth, you can just control everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, see in the matrix, that very thing kept happening.  The first world created was perfect.  But humans kept rejecting it.  In the current version, they created it with turmoil and imperfection.  Yet, continually there was an anomaly that threatened the system, that kept waking people up to the truth.  The way to fix that was to allow the creation of zion as the outlet and when things started to reach a turning point, destroy zion, use the code of &quot;the one&quot; to reload the matrix and start over.  </p>

<p>Zion was the outlet for the need to resist, the need to fight the systems of control that kept plaguing the system.  They tried just &quot;controlling everything&quot; and it didn&#39;t work.  In every situation it failed except the final solution of &quot;the one&quot; and the creation/destruction cycle of zion.  </p>

<p>Reality is the same way.  Consider what we do here.  How would the world function better if there was no way for us to complain? The end result is people just snapping and killing others.  By shutting down places like this, they create an isolation for a specific group of people to ultimately meet in secret and such things lead to bad things for the establish control.  Better to keep dissidents gathered in one place with a controllable outlet for that need to resist.  </p>

<p>This has a basis in psychology as well.  If you ever took psychology in college you will remember that many of the &quot;deranged&quot; and &quot;psychotic&quot; were those that end up isolated or feeling isolated.  Its not so crazy.  </p>

<p>Of course its also just a forum, you can&#39;t just shut down everything :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well since most people think conspiracy people are nutbags. What stops us from snapping and killing people? If I were the illuminati, I&#39;d let you snap, and then use that as an excuse to phase your kind out of existence and have the rest of the population thank me for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Letting an individual snap is not a problem.  The problem would be like minded dissidents gathering in secret to plot their own conspiracy. Most revolutionary tactics start, not in public, but in the dark shadows away from the public eye.  People don&#39;t plan in public.  Keeping people content with bitching on a public forum ensures the outlet and the indirect consent to maintain the status quo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly? We&#39;d probably just find some place else. The day I took to public forums was at the end of my days of protests and trying to be a &quot;wrench in the machien&quot;.  Not saying it will be that way for everyone, but for the most part it rings true.  Once people have an outlet, little actual work for change gets done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus, who&#39;s going to believe the few people on this subreddit discussing their potential influence?</p>

<p>When I question the mainstream news to people around me they already find me a bit of a conspiracy theorist, I couldn&#39;t even tell them about this... People on this sub are rare and the majority doesn&#39;t pay attention to us, they think we&#39;re bonkers.</p>

<p>So for them (Illuminati), this is a perfect situation. They can keep an eye on our activities and &#39;thoughts&#39;, as long as we&#39;re not influencing the masses too much they will leave this be... I think.</p>

<p>Do I sound paranoid? :-|</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t actually believe in the myth of the illuminati, although I do think there&#39;s a truth to the concept of it. </p>

<p>Is it weird to think that there are people subtly controlling the financial markets for their benefit? We do it on smaller scales like stock market insider trading, abuse of power within and with powerful companies and industries. I don&#39;t think it weird to assume that there is a bigger scheme going on. </p>

<p>So, not entirely believing in the illuminati, but more like being open to the idea that it just might be possible... Maybe not probable, but definitely possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deleting, or openly suppressing information in this way would help confirm their existence. The best way to operate is in the shadows. Having most people unaware, or believing that you don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>A good example of this is the NSA or Area 51. Up until a few years ago, most people didn&#39;t know they existed. I&#39;ve heard that back in the day, the government either denied that the NSA existed, or just refused to answer questions about the subject. Same thing with Area 51.</p>
