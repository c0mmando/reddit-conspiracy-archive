<p>It seems as though every story about border security, cartel violence, or the ongoing crisis is either pushed to the back burner or swept under the rug altogether.  I realize that sort of thing might be omitted or downplayed by the media in order to avoid a potentially disruptive public dialog on larger issues (race relations, national security, etc.), but I have a feeling there&#39;s quite a bit more to it. This seemed like the perfect place to ask the question and I&#39;m really interested in what you guys think.  </p>

<p>The US has gone to war over much less than this, so what gives?  </p>

<p>Why does the US allow this to happen year after year and never say or do anything about it?    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From an economic standpoint, we can see that large power structures benefit from this apparent moral inconsistency.</p>

<p>Banks benefit from wars, and they make profits from the drug trade.</p>

<p>The Military Industrial Complex loves having endless war, hence the full scale invasions against &#39;phantom&#39; threats.</p>

<p>The DEA benefits from drug cartels by getting bigger budgets each year. They have zero incentive to actually end the drug war.</p>

<p>The FBI benefits from terrorism and drug cartels by expanding their power and budget each year. </p>

<p>Politicians benefit from war by looking patriotic to voters, and many of them are corrupted by the organized drug trade.</p>

<p>Its all quite logical. The goal is to never actually solve problems, but to increase power and wealth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe (im speculating here) because control of the information is only in respect to our own populace. The plausibility would be more useful for the world political theatre than the domestic political theatre. You have to remember other countries have their own media outlets and propaganda mediums. So any overtly illegal actions would be picked up on by some foreign news outlet or something, and as you said, due to the information age, we the people would eventually learn about it. </p>

<p>Having plausible deniability, our government can then just straight up call the other outlets &quot;liars&quot; or &quot;uninformed&quot; or something. Plausible deniability allows this. Overt operations do not.</p>

<p>This <em>could</em> explain it, i think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think his motive for activating the NG is to assist in processing the massive influx of &quot;migrant children&quot; and &quot;refugees&quot; at the border right now.  The fact is, brutal cartel-style executions were occurring with Arizona, California, Texas, &amp; New Mexico long before the current crisis, so Rick Perry&#39;s NG move is a day late and a dollar short.  His action isn&#39;t about protecting US citizens, it&#39;s about whatever facilitating whatever endgame the White House has planned.</p>

Maybe to call martial law or something?

They are intentionally ignoring these issues. Some signs point to martial law. </p>
