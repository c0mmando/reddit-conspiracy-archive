<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not 100% certain. I would guess one or more of the links was was added to either the site-wide or sub-wide filter, for one reason or another. Hopefully another mod can answer that for you in more detail.</p>

<p>People say, &quot;What’s the purpose of it?&quot; My best guess is that the purpose of it is that they want an army of Manchurian Candidates, ten of thousands of mental robots who will do prostitution, do child pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do snuff films, all sorts of very lucrative things and do their bidding and eventually the megalomaniacs at the top believe they’ll create a Satanic Order that will rule the world.</p>

<p>How many people knew Jimmy Savile was a child raping predator?  Hundreds?  Thousands?  And they all just looked the other way.  &quot;Not my problem,&quot; they probably told themselves, as thousands of children were brutally tortured and raped.</p>

<p>Most of the people in the BBC, for example, were not at all in any position to do anything about it, and if they did say anything (which more people did than you&#39;re giving credit for, but still very very few), who would they say it to and what would they do about it?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get what you&#39;re advocating for.  Say nothing because nothing will probably be done about it anyway?  Is that really the attitude you would have if you worked for a company that employed a known pedophile and surrounded him with as many children as he could ever want?</p>

<p>You realize that attitudes like that are the main reason that global, protected pedophile and child torture rings exist right?  Because people would rather &quot;go with the flow&quot; than take a stand.</p>

<p>&quot;And besides,&quot; they convince themselves to be absolved of any sense of responsibility, &quot;nothing would probably be done about it anyway, so why should I even bother?

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like more excuses to me.</p>

<p>If everyone in the company spoke out and told their friends and family, got online and talked about how Jimmy Savile (ya know, the household name) was very, <em>very</em> likely a prolific serial pedophile who was being protected by both the BBC and law enforcement, then maybe something would&#39;ve changed.  Maybe nothing would&#39;ve changed too, but is it not even worth trying?</p>

<p>And yes, many in the BBC were directly complicit.  And yes, if it&#39;s being characterized as an &quot;open secret&quot;, and yet nobody does anything or tells anyone or makes any attempt to put a stop to it, then they&#39;re <em>also</em> complicit in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there are a number of weak points in the deck of cards, and they must not be mentioned. Jimmy Savile was at the heart of organised/ritual child abuse in the UK, and his death closed off many potential avenues of investigation. His chauffeur and collaborator died mysteriously on the day he was due in court to face charges of child abuse, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just a coincidence.</p>

<p>So, here are some random names that people might wish to google. They have never been linked in the mainstream media with child abuse, so I must stress, they are completely random! Pulled out of my raw, red ass, so to speak.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sir Edward Heath (former British Prime Minister, pedophile and child murderer)</li>
<li>Lord Brittan (former Home Secretary and prolific child rapist)</li>
<li>Lord Robertson (former Cabinet Minister and EU Commissioner)</li>
<li>Lord Mandelson (former Cabinet Minister and EU Commissioner)</li>
<li>Derek Laud (&quot;Oops, I think this child&#39;s anus is going to need some stitches&quot;)</li>
<li>Lord Janner </li>
<li>Cliff Richard (Kitty, Elm Guest House, Super Injunction)</li>
<li>Edwina Curry (former Cabinet Minister)</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I heard something about this too. Our PM stood up in Parliament and made an apology for the abuse; however, the missing children issue is still a giant &quot;elephant in the room&quot;.

<p>You don&#39;t quite understand.  The powers involved in these activities <em>own</em> governments, and the MSM.  There&#39;s no one to write <em>to</em>.  Public activity must go quite a bit deeper than that in order to hope to have any sort of effect.</p>

<p>Rumour has it that he developed a reputation for &quot;that sort of thing&quot; quite early on, and that it actually ended his wrestling career.  Some other top talent at the BBC refused to work with him because of this &quot;reputation&quot; and it even got him banned from BBC&#39;s flagship Children In Need (the exact sort of thing you&#39;d expect highly visible talent like Savile to take part in)... again, it was very widely known and an open secret.</p>

<p>If he had just been a random &quot;James Savile from Leeds&quot; rather than a well connected household name, he would probably have been caught much nearer the beginning (via Life on Mars style policing) and his victims would speak out.  There was no Sex Offenders&#39; Register before 1998, but he would still have a criminal record and everyone would know who he was.</p>

<p>Cyril Smith</p>

<p>The police had suspicions about him as far back as 40 years ago, and there are documents proving it.  It was swept under the rug due to his position and popular standing within the community.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that his home town and constituency (Rochdale), even to this day has a serious problem with sexual assault on minors.  There are Asian gangs who have been caught basically pimping underage white girls.</p>

<p>Also, remember Lesley Molseed from 1975?  That was also Rochdale, although they nailed known violent sex offender Ronald Castree back in 2007.  Many people believe Castree is innocent and that the Yorkshire Ripper may be the <em>real</em> culprit.</p>

<p>Rochdale is a serious shithole for a number of reasons and has been independently voted the worst place in the UK several times now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you think he and Prince Charles were friends. They appear to have met only when Charles was due to knight him and in events around that and the golden jubilee (which Clarke naturally also attended due to his status in Sri Lanka) - they hardly appear to have been friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freakin&#39; <em>definitely</em> Heinlein.  I really enjoy a couple of his books, but his later ones are...uh...yeah.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall which book, exactly -- Time Enough for Love?  maybe?  -- but there&#39;s one where young, teenage girls are <em>pleading</em> to be impregnated by the main character.  They also happen to be his clone/&quot;daughters&quot;.  That main character, Lazarus Long, is so obviously Heinlein&#39;s fantasy version of himself that it&#39;s sickening.  I couldn&#39;t bring myself to finish the book.  People try to explain it away by pointing out his progressive attitude towards sex -- and there&#39;s a lot of merit to that -- but he went too far.</p>

<p>Anyhow, yeah, Arthur C. Clarke was involved with young boys in Sri Lanka, or so I&#39;ve read.  Might not be true, but that&#39;s the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gordon Brown back in the 90&#39;s when he was Tonys right hand man got done for &#39;allegedly&#39; liking rent boys so they lowered the consent for gay sex instead of uping hetrosexual consent so he wouldn&#39;t get done in a court of law for statutory rape.</p>

<p>Tony and Brown are apparently two of the very many politicians that were actually groomed for the job in more then one way. They all come from the same place eton college, so even if it isn&#39;t that, somethings not right there.</p>

<p>Also another rumour I found a while ago while looking up the Ian watkins case was that he was in a certain welsh care home for a while but that one I can&#39;t be definite on and could just be hearsay.</p>

<p>Harriet Harman was all for underage sex and sex between relations back in the 70&#39;s but that seems to have been covered up. Also the Hamiltons seem to be a recurring couple mentioned in liking rough sex (not sure about paedophilia) but not so nice sex definitely. </p>

<p>This could all be absolute rubbish but now I&#39;m not so sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect there is a connection between the mainstream promotion of homosexuality and these subterranean pedophile activities--one must recall that traditionally the two were indissoluble in the eyes of the British aristocratic, intellectual, and political elite, who adopted the erotic ideals of Greco-Roman art, specifically the ephebic and hairless representation of bodies, and especially male bodies, which supposedly embodied, at that stage, a &quot;perfect&quot; sexual harmony of both the male and female physical and psychological natures. If this sounds like alchemy the reason is that it is--the alchemy of pagan &quot;magical&quot; sexual practices and mysteries...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, probably not, considering that a lot of these abuses happened at a time when homosexuality in the UK was still illegal or just legalised. The Thatcher government that is central to a lot of these claims passed a law known as &quot;Section 28&quot; which expressly prohibited the &quot;promotion or education of homosexuality&quot;.</p>

<p>Truth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The information below is intended to convey the reality of the fact that, criminal networks exist and provide access to children for the purposes of sexual exploitation and child pornography to elite clientele in the political and business worlds. These networks often target the most vulnerable populations of children, especially those in state institutions. Oftentimes, these networks are protected by security forces and the legal system because they are a valuable source of blackmail/intelligence, and because the revelation of their clients would be politically problematic. When they are exposed, the full story is almost never told. </p>
