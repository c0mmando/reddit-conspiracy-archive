       When a new "conspiracy theory" is introduced the first thing you should do is try to disprove it.  If you can disprove it then don't accept it as a good theory.  A lot of people seem to call me a shill or downvote people if they offer an explanation for a theory that goes against the "conspiracy theory."  You need to try to disprove every theory or else you end up with a bunch of shit theories that are easily debunked and damage the reputation of any possible legitimate theories.

       I think there is still a lot of shit pointing towards the JFK assassination being part of a bigger plot.  The attack on the USS Liberty seems like it was intentional.  I would say that the Bush administration was either criminally negligent or complicit in the attacks on 9-11.  The 2 party system in the US is a sham (both sides are bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs).

       Right, I only mentioned them because they are consistently the number 1 contributor to both the Dem and Rep candidates for President every election.  I often just say Goldman Sachs as a "catch-all" for all giant corporate money.

       Yeah those are the ones that instantly come to mind for me as well, I'd also add the Gulf of Tonkin non-event, and only because I've witnessed enough of it first-hand; a UFO cover-up related to ET life.  Oh, and possibly a cover-up of LENR/cold fusion energy.

       The Gulf of Tonkin I didn't mention because that is openly admitted now.  Just like the CIA and Contras bringing cocaine into the US.  I didn't mention that one either because that is also openly admitted.  UFO stuff I can't possibly disprove so I am neutral on that because I never personally experienced anything like that but there are enough people who have claims that I can't disregard that stuff.

       The Ponds and Fleishman experiment reproduction attempts led by the same Dr. Steven E. Jones that's now a 9/11 whistler blower oddly(?) enough, didn't use enough heavy water.  In other words, the 'evidence' debunking the initial experiment was cooked.  Plus NASA just did a symposium earlier this year looking into the possibility of LENR for future space craft.  There are over 30 companies right now that have already filed patents and working on the last stages of commercializing the reactors, they can't all be conmen and their inventions can't all be suppressed from the public, especially if the designs are open sourced and spread over encrypted internet protocols.

       The issue is that physicists can't even agree on a working model of how cold fusion works. If that can't happen, how in the hell is anyone going to engineer a reactor that can achieve it? That doesn't make any sense.

       This is more what I was talking about. Cold fusion itself may be possible (and it may even show itself capable of harnessing for space travel in the future) but our glorious lack of understanding right now isn't a good sign.

       The US 2 party system is a total sham. What I believe has happened is a mix of 1) Patriotism (which in US, more often than not, reduces to "I'm right, you are wrong regardless of evidence") and 2)The incessant of coverage of Republican and Democrat parties, to the exclusion of other parties, such as Independent, Green, Libertarian, etc. Because if people don't know it's there, effectively, it doesn't exist. Hopefully that made sense. Reply if it doesn't, and I'll do my best to clarify.

       I agree with what you're saying. 
To use an example, if I wake up and my car is totalled on the driveway, everyone can have a different theory. Jane could say she say Bob use the car at 10pm last night, he must have done it. John can say he's been having trouble with the neighbours, he thinks they did it. I can say little green men must have trashed it. I can say, feel, and think whatever I want, but if I'm gonna try to sell this theory to someone, I better have seen something, have others who saw lights in the sky, have caught a video of the green men themselves. 
If you're gonna present a theory, you need to be able to support it in some way. It doesn't mean you will always be right, even if you have valid evidence. But it should be more than "it must be" with no reason why, and you should be prepared to hear opinions from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing with this sub, in my opinion, is the freedom to express you're opinion without being ridiculed. I have no right to pop in and post "You're a fucking retard if you think that!" And off I go. But I do have a right to start a discussion if I don't agree with your theory. I can present my evidence disproving your theory, and you can counter.
      </p>
      <p>
       But screaming "Shill!" is just as bad as someone calling bullshit because they decide something is just stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone doesn't want to hear opposite opinions, they're not gonna have a very good time on the internet

       I agree with ya.  I don't know how many times I've been on a thread pertaining to Sandy Hook in this sub, but pretty much every time I'm called a "shill" because I don't agree with the prevailing theory of the thread.

       what 600 people, the SHES school was not a school in 2012. the cops own forensic evidence photos which show mold in the school prove that, that and the broken stair railings and other illegal problems for a school building.
      </p>

       they claim 480 students for the K4 grades, and that is a claim.

       the peoples/town of Newtown got $100 million from various sources, quite a lucrative day for that failing govt spook town.

       OK so every person who lives around that school and knows that the school wasn't operational has to be silenced or paid off?  None of the people who actually went to school or claimed to have kids who went there are real?  Wouldn't it be easier for a government to just carry out an actual shooting and blame it on someone than silence an entire town?

       add to that the very clever and skillful 'acting head custodian' who manged to do two jobs in 2010 and 2011 simultaneously two hundred miles apart.

      <p>
       he credited at SHES for the school year 2010/11 but got made redundant (mentioned in MSM and union news) mid 2011 from his other job two hundred miles away.

       This is exactly why I tend to research money trails and ownership relationships. Following stones in the moonlight is better than imagining monsters in the dark. Unfortunately, people just say "that makes sense, I'll buy it" instead of looking into things for themselves. Or just linking to a youtube video that oftentimes is made by someone with obvious schizophrenic symptoms. That's the worst.

       I don't know why the word theory is even used. In specific situations it does work when talking about one that has actually occurred or is on-going. But when speculating it would be a conspiracy hypothesis. English is the best language for doublespeak.

       Give me one example.  When I say that Sandy Hook wasn't a staged event I don't say it because that would be a harsh truth.  I say it because it doesn't make a single bit of sense and there is no evidence supporting that idea.  On the contrary, there is a lot that says that it wasn't staged.  Just because you can dream up a conspiracy doesn't mean it is worth believing.  People here are critical of every official story but once someone intruduces an equally ridiculous conspiracy everyone stops being critical and jumps right on board.  How is that "truth-seeking?"

       The person making the claim has the burden of proof.  For example, I don't for a second believe that Sandy Hook was a staged event.  I've read pretty much everything there is to read and I've seen a dozen "100% proof Sandy Hook was hoax" videos.  (I also have the benefit of knowing someone who was/is friends with one of the mothers who lost a kid there).  However, here is why I never believed that theory even before I realize my aunt was friends with one of the mother's.  It doesn't make sense.  Nobody can explain to me how in a school that had 600 kids enrolled not a single parent or student came forward and said "hey those people on TV saying they lost a child in the shooting.. we don't know who they are!  They must be actors!"  Nobody (not a single person) has come forward and said that.  This S.H. was a staged event theory presupposes that there are only 2 options: either it's the official version OR if there is any inconsistencies between the official version and the evidence it was 100% staged.  That in and of itself is a false assumption.

       very hard to know exactly what sandy hook was except that we certainly are not being told the truth on numerous fronts. hoax//fake/falseflag are all powerful emotive words used in place of "bullshit" with regard to sandy hook.

       its a whole mountain of questions with very few answers, due completely to the government and law enforcement total lockdown on useful information.

       OK I'll grant you that.  What the main point of my post is, is that just because you aren't fully satisfied that an "official story" of an event has been proven doesn't mean that the only other explanation is automatically the most popular conspiracy theory online.  Evidence that contradicts the official Sandy Hook story isn't evidence of a Hoax.  It is just as easily evidence of terrible journalism or multiple shooters or a space alien invasion.

       As I said, I know that people really did die there because I happen to know people who had friends involved.  Ignore that because it doesn't matter.  Why would anything you said lead you to believe that the event was staged?  Why wouldn't you think that maybe the government decided to storm this school and shoot the place up and blame it on one troubled kid?  What are the 600 kids and their families who were enlisted in that school doing?  Just ignoring the fact that actors said they had kids die in a school shooting?

       20 dead ones, and 30 live ones to be evacuated for the drill and photo op. (two classes of 15 which ties in with the ONLY known TWO evacuation pictures)

       the kids being evacuated did rather look like special ed students, kids that are not particular valued by society. some heartless DHS types might considered them disposable assets to be sacrificed for propaganda and maybe even ritual.

       Do you understand that I'm being hyperbolic?  I know there were over 600 kids there.  I'm granting you the ability to try to explain how even as little a number of 50 kids and their parents were kept silent.  Explain that to me.  This wasn't a school in some town where nobody knows it exists.  There was a town around it.  If this school wasn't functional (as you seem to be suggesting with no evidence other than trying to support your idea) everybody who lived around this school would know that it wasn't operational.  How are they all kept quiet?  Why is this idea reasonable to you?

       its rather simple, an event at a closed down school.
      </p>
      <p>
       the official website for SHES ceases activity around 2007 or so with the latter portions unavailable for 2008. ie the sad closing down last trimester bits.

      <p>
       2008 to 2011/12 the school website was dormant, then it suddenly got reactivated for late 2012.

       So nobody who lives near the school exists either?  The people who worked at the school?  They didn't exist?  The entire town of Newtown was just made up?  I live in a small town and my house is about 6 miles from the local school (many houses are much closer).  If that school wasn't open to students every single person in the area would know about it and if there was a "shooting" there we would all be aware.  How is this problem contained in your scenario?

       I'm not gonna give out the kids or mother's name on here.  I do know their names from my aunt.  I'm not shrieking anything.  You are just interpreting it that way because it's probably frustrating that you don't have a good answer to those questions.  And I don't blame you... not 1 person is able to offer a reasonable answer to any of those questions.  If somebody could then at least I could almost understand how you could entertain the idea that it was staged.

       My aunt lives in Maryland but she went to college with this lady and has remained friends with her.  In your example of the government coming to people to pay them off or scare them they would have to do this to 500+ families (if you are talking about kids enrolled in the school and their families) and the surrounding area.  Anybody who lived near the school would have to be paid off also.  What are the odds that every single person would agree to be paid off and get their identity changed?  Also, These people surely have friends and family who would wonder "hey where do my sister from Newtown and her daughter go?"  People can't just disappear.  That's easy enough to do with a single person who doesn't have any family.  Trying to pull that off with hundreds of people at the same time and nobody asking any questions or giving any resistance?  That is pretty much impossible.

       So you are saying that the government hired shitty actors to pretend to be grieving parents?  That sounds more reasonable than the idea that grieving parents are sometimes given xanax to help them get thru a rough patch?  This idea that "these people don't seem as sad as I think they should" is not evidence of a staged event.  Also the idea that the entire town was a government bought sound stage just in case one day they want to fake shoot up a school is also pretty far-fetched.  How does any of that sound more plausible than the official story?  People seem to be so committed to the idea that this was a staged event that they are willing to bend any piece of information they get with the intention of proving their already determined conclusion.  You can't work backwards from a conclusion to make the facts fit.  That's not any way to find the truth.

       How about this go get the name of the child and a picture and then cross reference that picture to one of the victims.

       I know but I'm not saying that to try to convince you.  I'm saying that because to me that is proof that people died there.  I don't expect people on here to take my word for it.  However, to your point, I would expect that some people would be coming forward with claims that they know the school was empty for years if it actually was empty for years.

       But this sub is for conspiracies, no matter how absurd or fantastic they are. If the aim was to be skeptical, the discussion would be over in r/skeptic. If the aim was to prove it to be an actual conspiracy, we'd take it over to r/actualconspiracies. This sub is to discuss a conspiracy, not to debunk it, or disprove it or even to find the truth. Just conspiracies.

       Ok.  So you don't have enough evidence of the official story.. that doesn't mean that the prevailing conspiracy story is the only other option.  You don't want to believe the official Sandy Hook story? Fine.  If you think that because you find inconsistencies in the official story that makes the "Staged Event" theory correct, you are being stupid.

       is a limited hangout shillfest. Their deluded premise is to deny that conspiracies exists until the government and the mainstream media say it does, and that at point the fully-formed conspiracy pops into existence.

       He hasn't committed any fallacies.  Those that post things to this sub are essentially making an assertion.  The assertion is made.  What he is saying is: challenge the assertion.  There is nothing wrong with that.  If the assertion doesn't hold up to scrutiny, than it should be scrapped.  He is correct.

       I don't get what you are trying to say.  I understand every word that you used but I don't understand how this applies to what I said.  People making a claim should be able to prove it.  If they can't prove it or if you can disprove it you should disregard the claim.  That's all I am saying.

       Prove to me your parents loved you. You cannot. Instead of being all left brained and trying to disprove consider things in your mind and find what resonates with you. At one time you blindly put your hand on your heart and said I pledge....

       There is no prevailing theory with actual facts or documents that says my parents don't love me.  I can look at 2 sides of the 9-11 story or the Moon landing and see the evidence on both sides and determine what seems true.  There is tangible evidence and documentation.  Proving someone loves you is nothing like that.

       the various publicized forensic technicians that have been caught lying with their evidence are examples of the nightmare that dishonesty causes in the law/court and science fields.

       ten years plus ago the normal journalistic standard was that anybody caught plagiarizing or making up stories was instantly fired. ten years or so ago things changed, lying and making things up became the norm.

       You've committed what's called a "burden of proof" fallacy.  You act as though your assertion is true unless disproved by OP.  There is no evidence his parents didn't love him.  In fact, in his response he seems to imply that he feels they do love him.  So your comment is pointless and fallacious.

       I agree with ya.  I don't know how many times I've been on a thread pertaining to Sandy Hook in this sub, but pretty much every time I'm called a "shill" because I don't agree with the prevailing theory of the thread.

       OK so 480. I'll take your number.  That changes nothing.  The number I'm looking at says 626 but I'll take 480.  How are 480 kids and their families kept quiet?
