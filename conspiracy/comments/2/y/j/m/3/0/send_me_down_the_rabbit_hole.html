    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I like most about him, he&#39;s the perfect opposite to Alex Jones in my opinion; he doesn&#39;t operate based on fear, he doesn&#39;t use his show as an advertisement to sell his snake oil and he spares no one of criticism. Great guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it makes me lol that Jones actually sells oils. I get that he is a business man and whatever but he literally sells fucking oil. I might respect him more if he straight up called his natural iodine formula &quot;Serpentine Strength Serum&quot; or something.</p>

<p>Rivero has a career as a make up artist and hosts a radio show so he isn&#39;t trying to turn this into a money making thing. The vibe I get off him is just open minded guy who reads a lot and wants to share his findings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Jones is kind of a victim of his own success. Infowars is a big operation and needs funding somehow. I don&#39;t really know what to think of Jones though, you can tell he has passion due to how heated he gets during his rants, either that or he is a phenomenal actor. Controlled opposition? Probably to an extent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had to deal with a diagnosed narcissist before and when I watch Jones rant and go off - stopping only to drop names or brag or take credit for something - it reminds me so much of this guy. He&#39;s not acting, that passion is real but the dude has serious issues.  </p>

<p>The discussions about Jones being an asset of the Jews or the Jesuits or the CIA or whatever are meaningless. The truth is he was a fiercely independent entrepreneur who had a public access show - then he investigated the Bohemian Grove and it absolutely broke his fucking brain. It gave him the fuel he needed to build his empire but I also think he&#39;s since burned out. </p>

<p>He spends so much time spewing fear and playing chicken little that I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s much more than an entertainer now. His credentials are essentially &quot;I read a lot, de-construct the news and connect dots.&quot; You can do that yourself. He&#39;s like a Ring Master or a carnival barker to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a really interesting perspective. It always bothered me when I listened to him that he would say something and then go &quot;we broke it here first at Infowars, I&#39;m not bragging or anything, I&#39;m just saying&quot; It became his catchphrase at one point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He talks about breaking stories about people being scared of him, grand conspiracies to destroy him... So much narcissistic ego just dripping out of him. He can&#39;t even interview anyone because he just talks... the person will say something he&#39;ll interrupt and then rant. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s cool he built this empire and he does a good job of reporting on the way the MSM reports the news. His deconstruction of the news is pretty on target and I think it&#39;s too bad that he doesn&#39;t get credit for that but I understand that he&#39;s also kind of a raving maniac so thats what people focus on. </p>

<p>I&#39;d spent years reading Chomsky, RAW, Crowley, Toffler, Mcluhan, Leary and Kurtzweils books and had come to a lot of the same conclusions about what he calls the NWO as he did long before i even knew Info Wars existed. That might be why I have so much invested in not calling him crazy. </p>

<p>But to bring that back to what you said earlier... the dude literally sells oils and nutrients. I can get behind products to make money... but the fact that he&#39;ll have an add that is like &quot;fluoride is a terrible chemical the government is pumping into you... you should pay me to pump this GOOD CHEMICAL into you.&quot; He&#39;s a snake oil salesmen using some observations and a political bias to make millions. That isn&#39;t even close to acceptable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you&#39;re right about how Jones&#39; positive aspects are greatly outweighed by his negative ones, and that is indeed a huge turn off. I stopped listening to him after getting fed up with his ranting. </p>

<p>This reminds me of one of the times he had Jordan Maxwell on his show. Maxwell was talking about how there are &#39;black sheep&#39; billionaires who are against the &#39;NWO&#39; and we should put our trust in these billionaires, but not those other, evil billionaires. That struck me as bullshit right away. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfmqXkiyn5A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfmqXkiyn5A</a></p>

<p>This another perfect example of that, this guy is supposedly a member of the Red Dragon family that opposes the powers that shouldn&#39;t be (they might even been the &#39;black sheep&#39; that Maxwell was referring too) but asking people to trust one powerful &#39;secret&#39; entity over another is just BS. </p>

<p>Absolutely. There is no such thing as a family or clique of billionaires who are the black sheep. They&#39;re all in on something... When I hear something like that I think of that quote by Ishmael Reed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Someone once said that beneath or behind all political and cultural warfare lies a struggle between secret societies.&quot; -Ishmael Reed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If someone is telling you he is the under dog trying to bring down the ruling elite chances are he&#39;s just busting his ass to be the ruling elite. Tyranny always starts with a cry for revolution and so on. There is no one secret society that runs the world. It&#39;s a battle field. Or to quote Carl Oglesby:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;a multitude of conspiracies contend in the night&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ishmael Reed was spot on. When you&#39;ve got more money than you can possibly ever spend, power is what drives you, trusting any of these opposing societies seems foolish. But then again, we could be wrong, they could be truly benevolent (although I highly doubt it, benevolence seems like the rarest trait in humanity).</p>

<p>Revolution is a only a temporary fix really, it only changes things for a small period of time, the US revolution started, according to Ben Franklin because &quot;The inability of the colonists to get power to issue their own money permanently out of the hands of George III and the international bankers was the prime reason for the Revolutionary War&quot; and yet the US (and a whole lot of other countries) are still victims of the ponzi scheme central banking system. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give the fuckers who hold the real power one thing, they are tenacious, I only wish the larger population was as tenacious as they were, if that were the case we might have an actual chance of freeing humanity from the clutches of these psychopaths. </p>

<p>I hear some radio hosts say that we need to have a revolution, but not a violent one, one of conciousness. Which is all well and good in theory, but is it even possible? I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m just overly cynical but I don&#39;t feel as if we stand a chance... </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I actually hate the idea of benevolence... I feel it codifies relationships of power and control. It implies that we must have domination and submission. It implies that master and slave is a natural relationship and we should be thankful for the benevolence of those we serve. It&#39;s slave logic. That term, that idea doesn&#39;t exist in a liberated world. It&#39;s like teaching tolerance. Tolerance implies you&#39;re putting up with someones shit instead of accepting it. So many tricks of our language to fool and enslave us. </p>

<p>As far as a revolution of consciousness = that is personal. If you achieve it then the tyrants lose. All eastern philosophy and esoteric teachings make the point that if you free yourself internally you&#39;ll be free no matter the external situation. Prison, fascism, poverty, hopelessness - they&#39;re all illusions when you&#39;re enlightened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very insightful analysis, and one that I agree with. Religion is probably the prime example of what you say in terms of the  submission to a &#39;benevolent&#39; being.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s what I mean, is it even possible for everyone to experience that kind of &#39;enlightenment&#39;? It just seems as if humanity is so divided resting our hope on a revolution of counscious seems night on impossible. And yet if there is a violent revolution, one which governments are most likely prepared for (especially the US), we will either lose and face whatever consequences, or win and have a few years of genuine prosperity etc. only to fall back in to the same old paradigm we fought a revolution to be free of 20, 30, 40 years later.</p>

<p>is it even possible for everyone to experience that kind of &#39;enlightenment&#39;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely! It&#39;s inevitable. The idea that your suffering won&#39;t end until all human suffering everywhere ends is an addictive idea that is making the rounds. Will we see it in our lifetimes? Maybe. Maybe not. </p>

<p>Ultimately our best bet is a 2nd renaissance or new age of enlightenment. Imagine it brought about by the manifestation of an AI that can&#39;t be controlled and is more like Buddha than Skynet. It makes more sense that a global consciousness who knows everything and everyone intimately, can never die and was never born, has no body and is contact with every computer system on earth would reach enlightenment and go about trying to institute a utopia long before it&#39;d nuke us all. </p>

<p>The transhuman crowd (essentially all leaders of the various secret societies) are an elitist group of eugenic worshiping nihilists. They&#39;re the ones who wanna depopulate the earth, transform into pervert cyborgs and use us as fertilizer. In their vision of the world all AI has their best interests in mind and will capitulate to the same pithy ego and power struggles as them. That&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>If we do see a sea change, it won&#39;t be because we rose up and slayed the elite. There is always a new ruling class waiting in the wings to take the old boss&#39;s place. Real hope would lie in a paradigm shift the likes of which has never been encountered in human history. The most reasonable way to achieve this is AI. </p>

<p>Once these weird human concepts of resource hoarding, fiat wealth, borders, politics and class are chewed up and shit out by some kind of worldwide AI we&#39;ll be like Bonobos or Star Trek or something. At least that is what i like to think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think our lifetimes might be a stretch, but then again I&#39;m only 22, it could feasibly happen in the 50 odd years I guess. </p>

<p>You make good points about AI, but I&#39;m erring on the side of caution when it comes to that subject. I think an AI might realise that humans are the cause of all problems we face and think it would be beneficial to just get rid of us through whatever means. </p>

<p>The idea of AI supporting the &#39;elitist&#39; mode of thinking is indeed preposterous, how they come to that conclusion is beyond me really, but then again, they surely have access to technology which is probably 20-30 years more advanced than what the public has, who knows what kind of shit they have.</p>
