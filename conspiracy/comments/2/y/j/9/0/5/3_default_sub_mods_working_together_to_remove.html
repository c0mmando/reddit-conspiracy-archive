       I first got banned from
       <a href="/r/WTF">
        /r/WTF
       </a>
       for posting a picture of a baby being born that looked like a demon (real photo). All of my posts after that in
       <a href="/r/creepy">
        /r/creepy
       </a>
       were removed and when questioned the mod in charge only replied with "?"
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/WTF">
        /r/WTF
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/creepy">
        /r/creepy
       </a>
       had 3 mods in common, 2 of them blacklisted me and pretty much told the rest to do the same (i have proof of all this, which I removed for them in good faith expecting them to unban me).
      </p>
      <p>
       I messaged **** (will unveil if this gets attention) in a joking / serious manner thinking he'd be the man to talk to since he
       <del>
        molded
       </del>
       modded so many subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where he turns into a full blown liar or a completely useless mod when making decisions because he just repeated the same things the other mods had said without checking for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       After about 4 of my
       <a href="/r/gifs">
        /r/gifs
       </a>
       posts were removed in error in a week I kept getting the runaround. When **** chimed in and started to become unprofessional I showed the mods a few screenshots of the history he has with me and politely asked them to consider that before they allow my posts to continue being removed without justifiable cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       He banned me for that single request.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       If this gets a lot of attention and i am not unbanned from the subs when I get back to my computer tomorrow I'll re-upload all of the pics in png format for whoever is interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW they monitor this sub religiously and will send trolls in / down vote spam this so it's up to you guys to get this on the front page if they refuse to own up to their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       These trolls will show you some of the pictures taken out of context, so if you're interested in how corrupt these people are don't let them keep this at 0 votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will take a while to upload all of the images again so if I'm going to do it I want to know it will make a difference.

       You need to remember, Reddit is a "huge and powerful marketing business" now that needs to protect its product. This is done by controlling what is posted and discussed. Power Mods and Admins get paid to do just that.

       If they cant get around fact or truth... if you cant win, cheat.  You cant cheat, pick a fight with them. Or ban them in your case.  Luckly they are only reddit mods.  Imagine if the had positions in power that matter.   could you imagine if they were like a cop, or mayor or somthing?
      </p>
      <p>
       its not like every one doest have 10 different accounts they post under any way.  But it does piss you off though.  when you are within rules, and the "culture of free speech" their wiki page says they have.  turns out to be based on what your definition of free speech is.  Or what false advertising is.

       It's worthless to make petty little threats as if you want to intimidate anyone.

       Just post your shit and don't act like a teenager with idle threats. It only makes you look as if you are full of shit, and there's no gain from it.

       I was banned from r/NBA for making fun of LeBron James, last year during the playoffs, many mods were LeBron and Miami Heat fans. It was a bunch of back and forth banter with other Heat fans, nothing crazy, just the stupid my team is better than your team stupid sports stuff and one mod said my ban was because I was trolling Heat fans, inciting a riot, crazy stuff about a game where they run around in shorts dribbling a basketball.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was banned from talking about LeBron James because as one mod said, "Calling him LeGod James is inciting hate..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you go on their past posts, I caught many of them doing FAR worse things than they accuse you of.
      </p>
      <p>
       One mod told me he didn't agree with my ban, I wonder if he knew the internal discussions that went on, it was probably a complete witch hunt by passive aggressive mods with personal team agendas at the time. Perhaps many mods there answer to NBA marketing brass and have to follow NBA orders, who knows, who freaking cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be banned from an NBA discussion site, that is just ridiculous, who bans someone for talking sports?
      </p>
      <p>
       Early on there, I had an issue with them putting on r/NBA's front page about the Israeli National Team winning some euro basketball cup, and they got after me quick for dare criticizing that Israeli basketball has nothing to do with r/NBA (no NBA players were playing with Israel and it's just stupid to put Israeli basketball in the front page, when they know they wouldn't put some non Israeli country in the front of r/NBA if they won.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever, I really got a good lesson on how censored SOME Reddit subs are if you run into passive aggressive controlling mods who do this for a living instead of going outside and playing basketball with other humans. It's quite unhealthy to live with such mentality that banning another human is progress to a meaningless area of Reddit like basketball.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day, I believe my ban cursed the Heat as it happened right before the Finals and the Heat and LeGod James were beat easily. haha
