<p>Hitler&#39;s face was proudly displayed on the sidebar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adolf Hitler was featured on the front page of Time magazine when his beliefs were well-known. There are numerous documentaries specifically <em>about</em> Hitler featured on the History/Military channel, yet both of these media maintain their prestige.</p>

<p>That particular &#39;Documentary of the Month&#39; vote <a href="http://4archive.org/pol/thread/36305922">was brigaded by 4chan</a>. The mods have traditionally <em>featured the winning movies cover</em> on the sidebar, a policy that was in place <em>long before</em> TGSNT was voted on. There was significant outcry (suspected brigade) among the community, and the mods eventually found &#39;compromise&#39; and chose a different picture from the film cover, <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/2011/07/28/noma-bar-guess-who/">despite it being an original piece by an Israeli-Jewish artist</a>.</p>

<p>There are T-shirts with a print of Che Guevara&#39;s face sold and worn worldwide, despite the fact that he was (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara#Legacy">contested as</a>) a mass murderer. Few individuals regard figures such as Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar as &quot;respectable&quot;, despite one being known for a genocide of 10% of the human population, and the other for almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars#Consolidation_and_Gallic_offensives">ethnically cleansing the Gauls</a>. Such people are not regarded as scum for believing so in today&#39;s day and age.</p>

<p>Some people idolize historical figures simply due to their influence on the world, be it subjective or objective. Beliefs don&#39;t make a person &#39;bad&#39;. Actions do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing that highly upvoted user said in response to the top comment seemed untrue.</p>

<p>Really? Take a look at our front page, The &quot;highly upvoted user&quot; made a blanket statement about this sub, I don&#39;t happen to see any such &quot;highly upvoted&quot; posts corroborating their claim. Especially not on a daily mean.</p>

<p>&#39;Conspiracy theorists&#39; have become a punching bag of society, a crutch for people to ridicule knowing that there is little recourse in their defense. The madness of crowds and desire to scapegoat is far more alluring than maintaining a patience and scanning through a community like this to find like-minded individuals and insightful dialogue. That is the problem with Reddit.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;d say the majority of people today do not have an absolute trust in their Governmental system, but are often quick to label specific criticism of that &#39;system&#39; as &quot;conspiracy bullshit&quot; simply so they can shield themselves from the same treatment while feeling confident of the former.</p>

<p>The link you provided clearly occurred after the documentary was selected, not sure why you sourced it.</p>

<p>The film, and plenty of other posts on this subreddit don&#39;t just discuss positive aspects of the Nazi regime or discuss certain achievements, they actively look to make excuses for Hitler&#39;s actions (blaming the Jews for their own suffering in the Holocaust no less) or try to downplay the significance of the Holocaust as much as they can. Also, who in the hell idolizes Genghis Khan?</p>

<p>This is what I found when I searched &quot;Holocaust&quot; in this sub. Plenty of upvoted denier posts, including an AMA from a Holocaust Denier (Yes, I know that guy is Jewish).</p>

<p>To be honest, a large portion of conspiracy theorists believe really silly things. When Alex Jones, David Icke and Mike Adams are as popular as they are, do you really expect the general public not to have a negative idea regarding theorists (right or wrong)?</p>

<p>I would agree that most people are skeptical of the government. Personally, I think that they label specific criticisms as &quot;conspiracy bullshit&quot; because they believe that those specific criticisms are not relevant.</p>

<p>This is patently false. The brigade in fact happened <em>before</em> the voting thread. It wasn&#39;t the last time they tried it either. Ask the mods for details.</p>

<p>Show me the sources for this if it occurs in such a sheer magnitude. Again, look at our current front page.</p>

<p>People who respect military history?</p>

<p>He also doesn&#39;t deny that the Holocaust happened. Just that certain aspects of it were exaggerated.</p>

<p>This subreddit brings a wide-variety of users with differing worldviews. So I fail to see the point of highlighting what the Reddit hive-mind holds in contempt as the worst.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t expect anything. I <em>wish</em> people had the sense to otherwise ignore ideas they find &quot;silly&quot; if they are incapable of contemplating the impossible without accepting it as their own beliefs. I wish that people could collectively determine what it is that ails society, and remedy it. I wish for a pipe-dream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they believe that those specific criticisms are not relevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was vague for a reason. Without context you could assume I was referring to something <em>regarded as</em> outlandish such as &quot;reptilian humanoids&quot; etc., whereas I could have been referring to anything along the lines of nefarious programs like MK Ultra, Op Mockingbird or even the recent NSA/Five Eyes leaks. </p>

<p>The counter-claim to that last part is taht it was common knowledge beforehand, but I don&#39;t see how considering the sheer volume of Intel being released that corroborates what IIRC used to fall under paranoia.</p>

<p>Social media has changed significantly since the Bush-era wiretapping that was declassified under The PATRIOT Act.</p>

<p>I lurk here every day. The regulars can assure you they know me. Like I said, what you&#39;re suggesting is hyperbole. </p>

<p>Contextually when <em>you say</em> &quot;the Jews&quot;, Devils advocate: I think they&#39;re typically referring to what <em>they believe</em> is a modern-day Power structure that is equivalent to the Roman Catholic Papal states or the Islamic Caliphate of the Abbasid Empire. Only one of &#39;Judaic&#39; origins.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they honestly believe every average to poor Jewish person on the street is &quot;responsible for the worlds problems&quot;. It&#39;s a taboo conspiracy theory of epic proportions, and we simply don&#39;t censor it for that.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t ask me if I believe this because I haven&#39;t got a fucking clue how the world truly operates in it&#39;s entirety or if it even does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never said they were a majority, a just said there was a significant number of them.</p>

<p>Then what is the purpose of showcasing them? The mods do enforce rule 1, so given what I&#39;ve highlighted above, I don&#39;t see why people get so outraged by what we allow here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s also evidence that there was enough support here to justify using this as a recruiting ground.</p>

<p>I think you mistake support for what could easily be a philosophical interest on a variety of taboo subjects. Not the <del>entrancement</del> embracement* of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m well aware that you guys like to try and frame what you are doing as revisionism, pretending like you have some noble goal to get the historical record straight. It&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<p>I am aware that you don&#39;t deny every aspect of the holocaust, just the parts you think you might be able to get away with. Have you ever picked up an actual history book? Or read some literature that wasn&#39;t written by a Neo-Nazi? Have you ever fact-checked those claims or discussed the issues with anyone actually qualified? Or did you find these sites and accept them because they allowed you to hold a position that was opposite the norm and allowed you keep your bigoted views guilt free? After all, all actual historical record of the Holocaust is a Jewish lie right? Isn&#39;t that what they told you? And of course, like a good little Nazi, I&#39;m sure you believed everything they told you.</p>

<p>Your Hitler loving educators failed you. They are wrong, and they always will be wrong. Sorry. Go learn how the historical consensus on the Holocaust was reached. Go read the thousands of primary sources that Stormfront didn&#39;t link you. </p>

<p>&#39;Conspiracy theorists&#39; have become a punching bag of society, a crutch for people to ridicule knowing that there is little recourse in their defense. The madness of crowds and desire to scapegoat is far more alluring than maintaining a patience and scanning through a community like this to find like-minded individuals and insightful duologue. That is the problem with Reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reframe. The sheeple are cheering the conspiratards on (oh, how I wish I could simply have said &quot;they&quot; and &quot;us&quot;, but it is not so) to finally <em>do</em> something, get their evidence together and present it in an undebunkable manner. What may sound like mockery is essentially a cry for help in a world too complex, insane and shizoid to comprehend if you simply don&#39;t have the time, background or opportunity to delve into the tiresome process of fact-checking and <em>actual thinking</em>. These sheeple will be the first to baa they always knew something was wrong with the official story once it becomes common knowledge that indeed, we&#39;ve been lied to; and still will mock the conspiratards who then proceed - instead of going all toldyaso over them - to dismantle the next historical Potemkin village. </p>

<p>I&#39;m young, yet I remember how it was an outrageous, silly, stupid, tinfoil crackpot nutjob conspiracy theory in the 90ies that the manufacturers of light bulbs artificially shorten the life span of their products so they can sell more of their stuff. Today, there is a Wikipedia article on their cartel; it is not out of the question that in a few years, there will be a 9/11_False_Flag or Moon_Hoax article or that the article on the Shoah more accurately represents what really happened and why; but I doubt any of these users will send a PM apologizing for their stupid insults. </p>

<p>It&#39;s what we choose to do, gotta live with it, and make the best of it - less complainin&#39;, more troofin&#39; :-)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, I&#39;d say the majority of people today do not have an absolute trust in their Governmental system, but are often quick to label specific criticism of that &#39;system&#39; as &quot;conspiracy bullshit&quot; simply so they can shield themselves from the same treatment while feeling confident of the former.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s why. Do you still remember how that diffuse feeling something is wrong (&quot;the splinter in your head driving you mad&quot;) changed and became a certainty? They feel the splinter, you touch it, it hurts them, of course they lash out - against you, not the splinter. It hurts to have it drawn. Can&#39;t fault them for being afraid. </p>

<p>//edit: out of interest, not because I care for karma: why is this being downvoted?</p>

<p>Sadly, I fear they will (subconsciously) teach their children to behave in the same manner as reaction to future cataclysms. I tend to agree that it is a cycle that is bound to repeat, or a &#39;chemical reaction&#39; that is difficult to undue.</p>

<p>This shit right here is why I have such a problem with all this hatred of anyone construed as &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39;. There are bigger problems, corruption of power and endless greed, yet it seems to me like the &#39;theorists&#39; take more flak.</p>

<p>Fear goes hand in hand with denial. I take solace in that it is a growing movement parallel to the expanding powers of Government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a theory that somehow developed organically in a discussion with a fellow redditor over at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/2ub5mf/captain_obvious_here_but_the_ny_times_just_ran/co75z32">/r/skeptic</a>. It still waits to be formulated in a nice manner, but the tl;dr is that actually, conspiratards and sheeple both serve a valuable purpose in the grand scheme of things. There will always be those who unquestioningly follow every stupid trend and couldn&#39;t actually care less whether our planet is flat, a sphere or a potato as long as they have easy answers to a complicated question, and those who wrap themselves in several layers of tinfoil armor to protect their independent and uncomfortable thinking. It&#39;s a naturally evolved system of checks and balances. </p>

<p>This is not to say, of course, that it would not be preferable - for both sides of the argument - if the discussions were a little more respectful and honest and a little less filled with intentional disinfo, outright lies and personal insults, but alas, it&#39;s the internet, what&#39;s one to expect.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people would flip the question around and ask why is the holocaust uniquely <em>in</em> suspicion. There have been numerous mass killings and genocides that have occurred during the 20th century. The Rwandan genocide, the Holodomor, the killing fields of Cambodia, hell even the other ~5 million non-Jews that are also claimed to have been killed by the Nazis. What about the Holocaust makes people question its veracity more than the others?</p>

<p>The holocaust has indirectly shaped the entire world from the 20th century onwards.  Israel would not exist without it, the middle east would look entirely different today, and the global political situation would not exist as it does right now.</p>

<p>Much like 9/11 (which, most likely, also wouldn&#39;t have happened if a post-1945 &quot;safe haven&quot; hadn&#39;t been established), it&#39;s all about the impact, and not so much about the event or the death toll itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but young people have been drinking long before alcohol has been in law. Thats why they made a law. While the allure of the illegal make explain a little bit of alcohol&#39;s popularity among young people, the vast majority of its popularity must be attributable to other reasons.</p>

<p>In the same vein, holocaust denial was in full swing long before the laws were in place. Its also popular in America where there are no laws against it. These laws were put in place in the early 90&#39;s. Well after the holocaust denial movement had started. The laws, right or wrong, were intended to stem this tide. It didn&#39;t create it.</p>

<p>Your argument is circular in that it says holocaust denial is prevalent because of laws and attitudes that were formed because holocaust denial is so prevalent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its seems like you what you&#39;re stating is largely based on intituition and isn&#39;t really backed up by facts. Even the alcohol part. Is there anything you can point to and say &quot;see this backs up what I&#39;m saying&quot;.  Here&#39;s why I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re saying is right:</p>

<p>A) Holocaust denialism (or revisionism or whatever you want to call it) was gaining popularity before the laws and continued to do so after the laws were put in place. They continued to grow in popular with no dramatic change compared to before the laws were put in place and compared to other countries (such as the America, UK, Greece, Iran) where no such laws exist. In other words, its hard to see any effect of these laws. I know that you said that the laws just explain <em>part</em> of holocaust denial&#39;s popularity but I would contend that even is unsupported.</p>

<p>B) The idea of &quot;the allure of the illegal&quot; is an attractive idea, but isn&#39;t really substantiated by facts. Alcohol consumption did indeed go down during prohibition and all signs point to a small uptick in marijuana usage since legalization. It turns out that the idea you&#39;re speaking of is called the Forbidden Fruit Theory and it isn&#39;t well supported by the evidence. From a cursory reading about it, what people find is that prohibiting something causes people to report that they want something more but it doesn&#39;t actually change behavior.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I&#39;m not advocating any prohibition on anything. I&#39;m pretty big on personal liberties especially free speech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your original question included &quot;more than others&quot;. Rephrasing my response without that specification is, in addition to being very tacky, somewhat manipulative and underhanded.  It&#39;s not as if all human slaughters happened simultaneously and this one magically emerged because of the condition I stated in my comment. Quite the contrary... &quot;the holocaust&quot; has a life of its own and most people commenting on/about it or otherwise inquiring into the topic are doing so well after the event, well after an official narrative has been created, and well after a legitimized hate epithet has been created surrounding it. &lt;-- My assertion is that for this reason it is <strong>now</strong> more questioned than the others you mentioned.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave my earlier comment as I wrote it and ask you not to revise your inquiries in future interactions with me, scumbag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that but I think we can agree that at least it involves questioning the &quot;official narrative&quot; which seems so to be unique to the Holocaust among other genocides. Also there exists a subset  that make much stronger claims than the ones you listed. The person I replied to claimed elsewhere that only 6 thousand Jews were killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get confused into thinking that it has to do with people in this sub specifically.  There are simply dumb, unthinking, uncritical humans in EVERY area and every walk of life...So why single out the idiots in this subreddit when there are just as many idiots outside of it?  It&#39;s a moot point really and is a sign of people looking for things to castigate critical thinking on.</p>

<p>Yeah, some in &quot;conspiracy&quot; circles do make untenable claims.  Some of those claims - as Ambiguously_Ironic correctly states - are made by people purposely muddying and soiling the waters.  Others make untenable claims simply because they&#39;re idiots.</p>

<p>Those types exist <em>outside</em> of conspiracy circles as well, so it is entirely erroneous to somehow claim that since conspiracy circles have these types in them too, that conspiracy circles are &quot;fully delusional&quot; or whatever detractors try to claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude it&#39;s fucking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, of course there are going to be crazy conspiracy theorists here.</p>

<p>There is also going to be <strong>sane</strong> conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>This is the problem with reddit, the hivemind is so black &amp; white on every issue.</p>

<p>HEY GUYS THIS ONE GUY THINKS MOLE PEOPLE RULE THE WORLD, THEREFORE EVERYONE ON /R/CONSPIRACY MUST BELIEVE THIS.</p>

<p>Also, why is it assumed that anyone who questions the holocaust must also be an anti-Semite?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a theory that somehow developed organically in a discussion with a fellow redditor over at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/2ub5mf/captain_obvious_here_but_the_ny_times_just_ran/co75z32">/r/skeptic</a>. It still waits to be formulated in a nice manner, but the tl;dr is that actually, conspiratards and sheeple both serve a valuable purpose in the grand scheme of things. There will always be those who unquestioningly follow every stupid trend and couldn&#39;t actually care less whether our planet is flat, a sphere or a potato as long as they have easy answers to a complicated question, and those who wrap themselves in several layers of tinfoil armor to protect their independent and uncomfortable thinking. It&#39;s a naturally evolved system of checks and balances. </p>

<p>This is not to say, of course, that it would not be preferable - for both sides of the argument - if the discussions were a little more respectful and honest and a little less filled with intentional disinfo, outright lies and personal insults, but alas, it&#39;s the internet, what&#39;s one to expect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, AATA linked an archived 4chan post after the brigade occurred, but the responses below the comment you&#39;re referring to pre-date the documentary voting results thread. You can corroborate all of this with him or <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&#39;t include things like all the instances where Jews were blamed for just about everything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That uh, wouldn&#39;t be because you couldn&#39;t find any, or? If ever someone has said it, I doubt it would be a fair consensus. It&#39;s a tad hyperbolic IMHO.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say who those users are to a certainty IRL, they could be trolls, or legit. I don&#39;t think it matters either way because people are people and I like hearing insight on topics with which I may or may not agree. Burn me with em&#39; for that if you must, I just refuse to pretend they&#39;re a majority.</p>

<p>Secondly, this Daily Stormer situation technically demonstrates (to me at least) that this subreddit is the target of <em>many</em> a brigade.</p>
