       Didn't someone here point out that every other week (or something like that) there is a post that makes it to the front page about the holocaust and/or vaccines?
      </p>
      <p>
       On the front page of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       two of the top ten links are:
      </p>
      <p>
       TIL that when a Holocaust denial group offered $50,000 dollars to "prove that Jews were gassed at Auschwitz," a camp survivor, Mel Mermelstein sent them definitive proof. When they refused to pay, he sued them and was given $90,000 when the court noted, "It is simply a fact.”
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       German anti-vaccer wagers € 100,000 to anyone proving the existance of the measles virus. Researcher sends him articles proving the virus' existance and takes him to court where he's ordered to pay the full amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       So has anyone here really tracked these topics and how often they make it to the front page?  It does seem to happen in  predictable cycles.

       I think it's most often used by black propagandists to paint anyone who looks into alternative viewpoints of WWII/the Holocaust/etc. as "anti-semites" and belligerent morons.  By the look of it it's pretty effective.

       Why is a discussion of Jewish crimes and wrong-doings and excesses and insanities an "unhealthy obsession" with Jews? Aren't Jews as valid a topic of debate as any other topic under the sun? And if you think they are not, then why would you think that?

       crimes, wrong-doings, excesses and insanity are unfortunately a trait that are perpetuated by groups and individuals in all human societies.

       focusing on one of these groups repeatedly is a trait of this sub that is an example of one of these unfortunate excesses.

       It has been proven that this subreddit has been raided by white supremacist groups such as stormfront.  Also many shills here upvote anything remotely antisemitic simply to make the sub look bad.

       While I do believe zionism and the Israel-Palestine conflict are definitely conspiracy-worthy topics, the jew obsession you speak of doesn't really reflect the average user here.

       When one group is as responsible for the world's problems today as much as the Jews are, talking about them is not an
       <em>
        unhealthy obsession
       </em>
       . They're fucking parasites. It'd be great if the Holocaust
       <em>
        had

       actually happened instead of just being a hoax. They aren't even actual Jews. All of the Ashkenazi are imposters

       The Jews are not a race. They are a group that holds way more influence in the world than their numbers merit. It doesn't matter what people think, the majority of them are raised on Jew-approved propaganda anyway, so it's easy to guess how they would feel about opinions that challenge their prescribed worldview.

       the term "holohoax" comes from 4chan's /pol/ board, along with ben garrison cartoon edits. If you need proof, check the external 4chan archives and search /pol/'s archive for "holohoax". You'll get thousands of hits.

       Don't forget that if you even mention Holocaust denial of any sort in

       they will ban you and delete your comment.

       What bothers me the most about these posts that make it to the front page is lack of discussion. On this thread you mention specifically, there is no discourse to be found, only mindless agreement with (what appears to be) the topic of the subject at hand.

       In the comments there are usually pot-shots taken at r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issues usually have to do with the holocaust, Israel, 9/11, criticism of foreign policy, and current controversial topics like GMOs and vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonsensical comments like "jet fuel doesn't melt vaccines" gets hundreds of upvotes.
      </p>

       There's consensus against r/conspiracy through mockery of deliberately stupid articles posted here.

       It's ironic that there's a conspiracy against r/conspiracy.

       Did that "anti-vaccer" really deny that the virus doesn't even exist?

       Makes me wonder if they're paying people to act like nutty anti-vaccers which was originally about criticism of one vaccine.

       Social stigmatization of dissent will be the top method of control thanks to social media.  Facebook seems to have made people feel like celebrities so they'll do anything to not look bad in the public eye.

       Many genocides have happened before and after the holocaust, often on a larger scale than the holocaust. I never see any of them being regurgitated. The holocaust is about the Jewish plight and noone else's. I've never met anyone who cared about it. This one's as common sense as common sense goes.

       Obviously people care about the holocaust, your anecdotal evidence means very little. The fact that it gets more publicity than others is not down entirely to the involvement of the Jews, it was also perpetrated by Nazi Germany, an iconic "bad guy" group, and it has a catchy name attached to it. If nobody cares about the holocaust, how are all of us aware of it in greater detail than most of the other genocides that you ambiguously mentioned?

       Because some people like you keep repeatedly telling everyone about it. The only point of the holocaust is that it backs a political agenda. There are way worse genocides on a much larger scale that have happened.

       There are a handful of "users" who flood our board.  Even without any votes, their posts magically show up on the front page regularly.  No other users see this benefit.  And as far as I can tell, the admins and mods have done nothing to stop this.
      </p>
      <p>
       To keep content fresh and truly user generated, I propose that there be sub rules set to limit the total number of submissions a single user can do in a reasonable amount of time.  So far this has fallen flat with little secondary support.
      </p>
      <p>
       To identify these disruptors, view the /New queue regularly.  Don't allow them to dilute our sub with garbage.

       Not limiting comments, friend.  Strictly limiting the total number of posts.  Browse /New and see the massive amounts of garbage being posted to flood our board with junk and to hide the valuable posts.

       Account age and "reliability" could also he calculated into the total number of posts allowed.  My proposal doesn't advocate censorship.  It's a means to stop the attack on /New.

       "what happened to that place? its all 911 and holocaust deniers" was one of the comments and it has so many updates. (that's not an exact quote I'm on my phone atm...) but it's ridiculous.

       Your question cannot be answered with a "yes" or a "no". The reality is more complex. The Holocaust, as we understand it today, is a myth. That is to say, it is a fictional narrative that has evolved from a number of actual, real events that have been magnified, distorted, misrepresented, or outright falsified. The Holocaust began with stories traded by Jews inside the concentration camps. It was carried forward by the Allied propaganda  designed to depict the Nazis as inhuman monsters. It was further magnified when Jews realized that it could be used as a weapon to extract money from Germany and other nations, to quell criticism of Jewish behavior, and to insulate Israel from public criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a case of "did the Holocaust happen or not?" That question is meaningless. Some of the events that gave rise to the Holocaust mythology did occur. Some did not occur. Some were distorted by hysteria, or deliberately lied about for reasons of personal advantage.

       Depends on how you define it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you define it by the common definition today of intentional extermination of 6 millions jews. Then no, it didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people were put into slave labor camps, and many died towards the end of the war due to starvation and typhus, but there was never an intentional program of extermination. The actual facts support this conclusion.

       because it's dangerous for people to think things like the holocaust didn't happen. He won't change his mind but he might convince someone not posting and you challenging him could stop that. I don't mean to make it sound all noble but still.

       Obviously people care about the holocaust, your anecdotal evidence means very little. The fact that it gets more publicity than others is not down entirely to the involvement of the Jews, it was also perpetrated by Nazi Germany, an iconic "bad guy" group, and it has a catchy name attached to it. If nobody cares about the holocaust, how are all of us aware of it in greater detail than most of the other genocides that you ambiguously mentioned?
