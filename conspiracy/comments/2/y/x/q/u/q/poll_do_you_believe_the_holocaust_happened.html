<p>There is not a shred of hard evidence that any homicidal gas chamber existed in any of the camps. (Feel free to challenge me on that, but I don&#39;t make that claim lightly.) No mass graves have been found. No Nazi documents exist that mention a plan to gas people. If that constitutes a total denial to you, then I guess I must be nobody. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I think actually happened...</p>

<p>The Rothschilds (self-proclaimed Jews at the time) were funding both sides of the war. Hitler didn&#39;t trust them. So, believing (wrongly) that the Rothschilds had some sympathetic loyalty to Jews everywhere, Hitler started taking the wealthy Jews hostage. When the Rothschilds began negotiations which could potentially end the funding to Germany (the Balfour Declaration), Hitler upped the stakes and started killing the Jews he had taken hostage - assuming the Rothschilds would buckle under pressure and continue funding his war machine. </p>

<p>Little did he know that the Rothschilds are just bloodthirsty war profiteers who don&#39;t give a shit about anything but the bottom dollar.</p>

<p>The Rothschilds eventually won on all fronts: Hitler eliminated any internal Jewish opposition to Rothschild dominance, the Rothschilds profited immensely from the war, and the Rothschilds got Israel... perpetual thorn in the side of the Middle East for infinite war profiteering to come.</p>

<p>Yeah, I figure Hitler&#39;s Nazis hated and killed Jews, probably a lot of very significant and wealthy Jews. But, not 6 million. Probably about 6 thousand or so of the most wealthy and influential ones. Everything written since is just media spin (the Rothschild extended family controls the media - and the winners write the history).</p>

<p>Do you think we got honest body counts of Islamic peoples slaughtered during Gulf Storm (1 and 2)? Or, since the media is Jewish owned, do you think those numbers might have been fudged on the conservative side to keep them below a million?</p>

<p>Could you clarify this a bit?  As I recall, the population of Europe in 1940 was approximately 440 million, of which around 9.5M were Jewish.   So far as I know this is undisputed. </p>

<p>EDIT : Fixed a number. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I find most curious is the constant pressure to force everyone to accept this &quot;6 million Jews sent to the gas chambers&quot; official narrative. It&#39;s no different than the 9/11 official narrative. Official narratives are not to be trusted. Why is it so important for you to &quot;convince me&quot; into &quot;believing it&quot;? Why is it so important to put a label on anyone who doesn&#39;t want to swallow that? To me, the pressure to accept it and the hate epithet applied to those who don&#39;t, &lt;-- those are the most suspicious and damning aspects of the whole thing. And, primarily, the reason I refuse to accept it. The condemnation of those who refuse to accept the story, as told by the victors (the Jewish Rothschild family), is the precise reason I hold that story suspect and in doubt. They are notoriously bloodthirsty liars.</p>

<p>in the face of overwhelming evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>overwhelming documentation written by the victors (the Rothschild extended family ownership of most media outlets and publishing houses), not necessarily &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>Ya see, when I was in school I was forced to watched these movies about &quot;the holocaust&quot; which showed mass graves (several shots of the same hundred or so bodies from different angles as if they were all different graves) - with no proof of the ethnicity of the bodies in them - claiming they were all Jews who had been gassed in the chambers, yada yada yada.</p>

<p>And when I became a man, I realized I had been duped, at least by those movies, if not by the entire Rothschild narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but also from a psychological perspective</p>
</blockquote>

<p>meaning, if I don&#39;t accept what you tell me I should accept as &quot;truth&quot; then I&#39;m obviously &quot;nutty&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ll notice that just about everything I&#39;ve said so far has been a <em>loaded</em> question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FTFY</p>

<p>It&#39;s apparent that we will never resolve this because you are commited to the narrative, as written by the victors, not necessarily to discovering the truth about anything. So, I think we&#39;re done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb and speculate that you haven&#39;t actually looked at any evidence whatsoever.  You&#39;ve probably never been to Germany, in fact. You&#39;ve either heard or read the narrative and you accept it, agree with it, and feel compelled to enforce it against those who don&#39;t want to accept it or agree with it. Just like you&#39;re doing here, with me. Playing your subtle twists of language to make me seem like I&#39;m not thinking clearly when I say that I distrust the Rothschild extended family and everything they stand for.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t care who I am. You don&#39;t care how educated I am. You don&#39;t care how proven my rational mind is. You just want to badger me for not &quot;believing in the holocaust&quot;. And by behaving in such a manner, you appear no better than Christians who want to try to convince atheists to believe in their concept of God.</p>

<p>Believe whatever you want. Because that&#39;s what it boils down to. You&#39;ve chosen to believe the story as told and retold (and revised) over the years. Here... educate yourself and read this...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are legitimate issues with using &#39;eyewitness accounts&#39; as evidence. </p>

<p>Here are some articles about this from mainstream sites. (There is of course, much more in depth literature on this topic, but I just want to get across the fact that my claim here is not in the least bit controversial. Eyewitness Testimony is NOT good evidence. It certainly has some value, but it is rife with problems if you&#39;re trying to get to truth.)</p>

<p>&quot;Why science tells us not to rely on Eyewitness Accounts&quot; <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Why are eyewitnesses unreliable?&quot; <a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/eyewitnesses-unreliable.htm">http://people.howstuffworks.com/eyewitnesses-unreliable.htm</a></p>

<p>Note the prevalence of false memories, also. Far more common that many might assume. </p>

<p>Next we get on to the actual accounts themselves:</p>

<p>&#39;Eyewitnesses&#39; like Rudolf Vrba, who wrote a book in which he later admits uses &quot;Poetic License&quot;. Here&#39;s a transcript from the Zundel case.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christie: I would like to ask you, if you actually saw him arrive in January 1943, or is this only a.....</p>

<p>Vrba: In September 1943 or in January?</p>

<p>Christie: In your book it says January 1943.</p>

<p>Vrba: No, I saw him in July 1943 and then in 1943....</p>

<p>Christie: But here it says January 1943.</p>

<p>Vrba: That must be a mistake.</p>

<p>Christie: A mistake?</p>

<p>Vrba: Yes.</p>

<p>Christie: Well, well. But on this occasion you saw him arrive?</p>

<p>Vrba: The first time, I saw him arrive because he was as close to me as you are now. […] Out of courtesy he came a step closer.</p>

<p>Christie: Well, well.</p>

<p>Vrba: The second time I saw him in a car, the same one as in the first time.[…] Maybe it was him, maybe it was only his deputy, I don&#39;t think it matters. […]</p>

<p>Christie: You are telling this court, you really saw Heinrich Himmler looking through a peephole into a gas chamber?</p>

<p>Vrba: No, I never claimed I was present when he looked into the gas chamber, only that I put a story together which I have heard many times from numerous people who were present and told me everything. […]</p>

<p>Christie: But in your book you write, YOU saw everything and you don&#39;t mention that you are writing hearsay.</p>

<p>Vrba: In this case, I wrote hearsay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then of course there is the testimony of those who are incredulous that they managed to survive. &quot;By Some Miracle, Water Came Down, Instead of the Gas&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLkKCZ_x-9Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLkKCZ_x-9Y</a></p>

<p>And all the ridiculously absurd claims that have been made. Here are a couple (of very many) .</p>

<p>Moshe Peer, claims that (at 11 years old) he &quot;was sent to the camp gas chamber at least six times...maybe children resist better, I don&#39;t know.&quot; </p>

<p>Morris Hubert was quoted as saying: &quot;In the camp there was a cage with a bear and an eagle. Every day, they would throw a Jew in there. The bear would tear him apart and the eagle would pick at his bones.&quot;</p>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, I could go on for hours but I won&#39;t subject you to a huge wall of text. I think my main points are pretty clear. Find me some REAL evidence because the majority of the mountains of claims out there are dubious at best. Testimony? Pah! The Salem witch trials had plenty of that and I bet you don&#39;t take that seriously!</p>

<p><em>edit</em> If 6 million really died, surely it should be trivial to find some physical evidence of it happening right? Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>Are you for real? You clearly haven&#39;t done any real research into the holocaust, otherwise you&#39;d know that the corpses in the videos (I assume you&#39;ve seen the one with the bulldozer pushing them into pits? It takes place after the liberation of that camp and the driver is a British soldier in case you didn&#39;t know.) died of starvation and disease. They were not deliberately killed. The allies bombed supply lines near the end of the war and some of the camps were unable to obtain food supplies. This coupled with a typhus epidemic and the fact that much of the camps population was densely packed into barracks meant that many, many people died. That is a tragedy of the war, but it has nothing to do with the alleged holocaust. Not all the corpses were dead inmates either, because other local deaths were trucked in to be dealt with along with those from the camp itself.
Wikipedia claims that after the liberation of Bergen Belsen (the Nazis turned the camp over to the British) a total of 13,994 people died despite the best efforts of the British and their copious supplies. Make no mistake, all that death you saw in the videos was very real indeed. But the reason they are malnourished is precisely due to supply shortages. They are clearly not gas victims. Besides, most of the footage you refer to comes from Bergen Belsen which even Wikipedia admits was not an &#39;extermination camp&#39;. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen-Belsen_concentration_camp">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen-Belsen_concentration_camp</a> Even those who fully believe that 6 million were gassed do not claim that Bergen Belsen was anything more than a concentration camp.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the soldiers who saw the camps with their prisoners inside?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course there were concentration camps that held prisoners inside them, because, you know, that&#39;s what a concentration camp is for... Literally no one disputes that. You&#39;re arguing a complete straw-man here. We are talking about the holocaust specifically. That&#39;s what I&#39;m denying. I am not and have never denied that there were concentration camps. Nor do I deny that many people, (including many Jewish people) died in those camps. No doubt some of them were even killed deliberately. But it is the deliberate extermination of an entire race of people that the word &#39;holocaust&#39; represents and it is that which we are discussing. </p>

<p>Seriously, I suggest you do some actual research before deciding what actually happened, because you obviously don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Who were found to crack fairly quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you referring to the Nuremberg trials? Are you not aware that (among others) Rudolf Höss was tortured and threats were made to the lives of his family in order to get him to sign a &#39;confession&#39;? His so called confession talks of how 3,000,000 died at Auschwitz and how a single gas chamber could hold 2000 people at a time, which is blatantly false. </p>

<p>Rudolf Höss said this: &quot;During the first interrogation they beat me to obtain evidence. I do not know what was in the transcript, or what I said, even though I signed it, because they gave me liquor and beat me with a whip. It was too much even for me to bear. The whip was my own. By chance it had found its way into my wife&#39;s luggage. My horse had hardly ever been touched by it, much less the prisoners. Somehow one of the interrogators probably thought that I had used it to constantly whip the prisoners.&quot;  </p>

<p>Another prisoner said &quot;The prisoner(Höss) was torn from the top bunk, the pyjamas ripped from his body. He was then dragged naked to one of the slaughter tables, where it seemed to Clarke the blows and screams were endless. Eventually, the Medical Officer urged the Captain: &#39;Call them off, unless you want to take back a corpse.&quot;</p>

<p>Pictures of Rudolf Höss, scroll down to see him with a bloody nose. <a href="http://winstonsmithministryoftruth.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/the-british-catholic-who-tortured-hoess.html?zx=f033dba5e06d0e91">Rudolf Höss</a></p>

<p>American judge, van Roden said: &quot;Statements admitted as evidence were obtained from men who had first been kept in solitary confinement for three, four and five months..The investigators would put a black hood over the accused&#39;s head, punch him in the face with brass knuckles, kick him and beat him with rubber hoses&quot;</p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmedy_massacre_trial">wikipedia</a> &quot;to extort confessions, U.S. prosecution teams &#39;had kept the German defendants in dark, solitary confinement at near starvation rations up to six months; had applied various forms of torture, including the driving of burning matches under the prisoners&#39; fingernails; had administered beatings which resulted in broken jaws and arms and permanently injured testicles&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, I could go on, but I&#39;m sure you get the point by now.</p>

<p>Also, if you look at the plaques at Auschwitz <a href="http://12bytes.org/wp-content/uploads/auschwitz-plaque-killed-comparison.gif">http://12bytes.org/wp-content/uploads/auschwitz-plaque-killed-comparison.gif</a> , you will see how the number has changed over time. They pulled the original figure out of their arse and when they failed to later justify it, they were forced to significantly lower it. That&#39;s a 2.5 million decrease. If they were out by well over 60% before, why would you believe them now? Take any figures you see with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>The World Almanac stated that the population of Jewish people in Europe was as follows: &quot;1929 (p. 727): 15,630,000&quot; &quot;1938 (p. 510): 15,748,091&quot; &quot;1947: (p. 748): 15,688,259&quot; </p>

<p>No missing 6 million there. Also, after the war another 1,500,000 Jews emigrated from Europe to go to Israel, USA, etc. </p>

<p>As for shootings, there are many places where the Einsatzgruppen allegedly killed large numbers, with many eyewitnesses claiming to know precise locations, but no mass graves have ever been found...</p>

<p>Do you know about the Katyn Forest massacre? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre</a></p>

<p>&quot;The number of victims is estimated at about 22,000.&quot; </p>

<p>This was carried out by the soviet secret police during WWII and blamed on the Nazis. </p>

<p>&quot;The Soviet Union claimed the victims had been murdered by the Nazis in 1941, and continued to deny responsibility for the massacres until 1990, when it officially acknowledged and condemned the perpetration of the killings by the NKVD, as well as the subsequent cover-up by the Soviet government.</p>

<p>An investigation conducted by the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office of the Soviet Union (1990–1991) and the Russian Federation (1991–2004) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres, but refused to classify this action as a war crime or an act of genocide.&quot;</p>

<p>Now go do some of your own damn research if you still aren&#39;t convinced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again we get back to eyewitness accounts rather than any physical evidence. Once again I point out that no mass graves have been found to prove these mass shootings. Furthermore, you&#39;ve yet to cite or link to a single source so far in this entire discourse.<br/>
I&#39;m not going to sit here and carefully research all of your vague, unsubstantiated claims, because you haven&#39;t demonstrated any willingness to research my claims.</p>

<p>Just look at a lot of the alleged mass grave sites, such as at Treblinka or Bikernieki forest, which are all concreted over and littered with chunks of rock as some crude monument. More likely, it is to impede any potential excavations and forensic investigations, which have so far never been allowed to take place. <a href="http://www.eol-reisen.de/images/19_bikernieki_bruchhaus_l.jpg">photo</a></p>

<p>In addition, the Einsatzgruppen absolutely did kill thousands (not the oft claimed 2 million) of Jewish people (so you doubtless will be able to find <em>some</em> legitimate eyewitness testimony of shootings), but there is no evidence that this was an attempt to wipe out an entire race. The reasons for the shootings were to remove the legitimate threat of guerrilla partisan attacks utilizing illegal methods of warfare coming from the Jewish population who routinely sided with guerrillas and in fact, I would suggest that the Einsatzgruppen took their action too far, but despite that, it is no holocaust.</p>

<p>So many of the lies come from wartime propaganda, </p>

<p>&quot;Those were special chambers where the hammer fell from the ceiling and by means of a special installation victims found death under air pressure.&quot; - April 1943 Polish Underground report on Auschwitz</p>

<p>No one believes that any more, for example. Now written off as nonsense. Though plenty of new lies came after the war too.</p>

<p>&quot;Later, I learn from a witness that, for month after month, the ground never stopped trembling; and that, from time to time, geysers of blood spurted from it.&quot; - Elie Wiesel (one of the most famous holocaust &#39;eyewitnesses&#39; who in his autobiography, makes no mention of gas chambers. Instead he talks of 10,000 people being burned alive each day, which no historian today believes.)</p>
