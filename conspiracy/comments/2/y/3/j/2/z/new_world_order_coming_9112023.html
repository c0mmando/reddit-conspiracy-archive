        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>9/11/1990
President George H. W. Bush address before a joint session of Congress:
&quot;Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective, a new world order, can emerge.&quot;</p>

<p>Exactly 11 years later...</p>

<p>9/11/2001
19 members of the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda hijacked four commercial passenger jet airliners, intentionally crashing two into the World Trade Center in New York, which eventually collapsed. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon. The fourth plane crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 victims and the 19 hijackers died in the attacks.</p>

<p>Exactly 11 years after that and 22 years after the George Bush NWO speech...</p>

<p>9/11/2012
Islamic militants attacked the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, killing two governmental American workers.</p>

<p>Exactly 11 years after that and 33 years after the George Bush NWO speech...</p>

<p>9/11/2023
Now, let me explain here. In Spiritual Numerology, the numbers 11, 22, and 33 are the three ‘Master Numbers’, the highest being 33. Also, in the Masonic fraternity, an organization that supposedly worships Lucifer, the highest rank you can get is the 33rd degree. This is an honorary degree, and 33rd degree Freemasons are supposedly the ones chosen to join and are let in on the secrets of the organization. Many significant things also happen along or near the 33rd parallel, which is 33° north latitude, including the assassination of John F. Kennedy and Roswell, New Mexico. Lots of other interesting world events are related to the number 33, which is why many people think it is a number with Luciferian links to the Illuminati.</p>

<p>Illuminati/NWO confirmed?</p>

<p>9/11/2023 - You better watch the fuck out, shit&#39;s gonna go down</p>

<p>Edit 1: I&#39;m half joking here guys, don&#39;t take this too seriously, just something interesting I discovered and thought I&#39;d share. I&#39;ll still defend my theory as good as I can though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It serves the point exactly, assuming that you believe 9/11, Benghazi, and similar events such as the 2001 Moscow Theatre Siege, the 2003 Istanbul bombings, the Madrid train bombings, the Beslan school hostage crisis, the 2005 London bombings, the October 2005 New Delhi bombings, the 2008 Mumbai Hotel Siege, the 2011 Norway attacks,
the threat of ISIS/ISIL, beheadings of Americans posted on YouTube, etc, are all planned by the Illuminati/New World Order government. All of these events are weakening the powerful countries of the world, so they can more easily succumb to the power of the New World Order/Illuminati. It is all building up to whatever is planned for 9/11/2023</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right, but when most people think about or talk about the &quot;New World Order&quot;, they mean one centralized power ruling the entire world, the whole world working toward one common goal. Nothing like that has ever happened in the history of the world.</p>

<p>I know, but they really should not use that term because it is not what it means.  Using the term like that allows people to manipulate others that don&#39;t know what the term actually means.  When Bush said &quot; we can see a new world coming into view, a new world order&quot; he is not talking about one world government.  He is talking about the world shifting from old ways of governing ( monarchies and dictatorships etc.) dying off and America gain more political pull in the world. </p>

All of these events were planned by the New World Order/Illuminati, to weaken all the world&#39;s powerful nations, and make room for a takeover of the world.

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re suggesting that the cadence of attacks being every 11 years demonstrates and predicts the actions of a global cabal, but there are lots of other significant events too, which don&#39;t fall into the same cadence... how do you determine which events are significant to your prediction of future events?</p>

<p>Also, does the fact that Bush had made essentially the same statement in January of 1990 (&quot;cause you any problems in evaluating this timeline?</p>

<p>Also, does it complicate your premise that every time Bush used the term &quot;New World Order,&quot; it was in reference to his negotiations with then President of the USSR, Mikhail Gorbachev over improved relations between the US and USSR, and not to creating a global government?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like GTA games - there&#39;s a main story mission and a bunch of smaller side missions. The events occurring on 9/11 every eleven years are the biggest and most thought out and complicated to plan for the Illuminati/NWO. That&#39;s why they occur on 9/11.All the other events are less major within the organization, but still help the main goal of the group.</p>

<p>As for Bush, within the context of the situation at the time, sure it made sense, but when taken out of context, as intended by the NWO/Illuminati, it can be interpreted as &quot;totalitarian one world government&quot;, according to Google. The Illuminati hides these messages in everything. They make you think they&#39;re talking about one thing, but in reality, it&#39;s something much more sinister. It&#39;s messages like these that people tend to overlook, but if you&#39;re a real conspiracy theorist, how can you trust what anyone says? You gotta look at everything from as many angles as possible to fully understand it.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, there&#39;s no such thing as a coincidence.</p>
