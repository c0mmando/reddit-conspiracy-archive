       But we're discussing unpaid shills. Unpaid would clearly suggest that they do not profit monetarily. If the word vested implies monetary profit, then your original definition is flawed. I then will ask you, what in your own words is an unpaid shill?

       You and I both know that when "paid shills" are discussed, it is referring to people that are being paid a wage by the month, hour or even by the comment. Having the motive of a
       <em>
        possible

       future profit is not the same as being "paid".

       So let me get this straight, an "unpaid shill" is someone who shills with the hope of future payment. Like an intern perhaps? A shill that hopes to shill well enough to one day be hired on as a full-time shill? Am I right in this understanding?

      </p>
      <p>
       Example: A missionary goes around a country "shilling" for his/her religion with the hopes that eventually the converts will donate their hard earned money to the church which may eventually result in the missionary's rise in the church's ranks.
      </p>

       Example: A military arms contractor "shilling" for war with the hopes that increased military spending will find it's way to his company.

       Okay so an "unpaid shill" in your words would be someone who endorses something with the hope of future benefits? I feel like that definition fits your examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have one question though, would the people in these examples have good reason to support their endorsement other than personal gain? Like what if the missionary's religion was in fact the correct one, would it still be shilling? I guess I'm just asking if shilling is always at the expense of the truth in your definition, or could a shill make a genuinely valid endorsement while still acquiring the benefits?

       That's because your definition of shill is your own and not the actual. Shill is negatively associated with selling a dupe a bad bill of goods.

       From Oxford English dictionary: "An accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: "A person who pretends to give an impartial endorsement of something in which they themselves have an interest"
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the second definition, interest specifically refers to a monetary or financial interest as shown by the example sentence.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       With either definition, you would have to show evidence that the accused shill has a financial interest behind their endorsement or that they are working directly as an accomplice in order to do their shilling. These things are hard to provide evidence for over the internet. Most accusations of shilling on this sub are without evidence and are used as ad hominem attacks against people who disagree with the prevailing opinions of this sub.

        Since people can convince themselves of anything that is to their benefit or is in their interest, this is not surprising.

       Only if you call someone a shill. Calling someone a "shill" in this sub is against the rules. I don't call people shills. The other mods and I have removed countless comments for violating that rule.

       I feel I can speak for everyone in this thread and say that no one here considers themselves a shill. I've seen plenty of people that have been accused of being shills simply for having different opinions. I'm glad you ban for that though. Keep it up.

       But they aren't opinions are they? If it's an opinion it lacks factual basis. If you're arguing opinions you're arguing about varying degrees of understanding.

      <p>
       A shill isn't offering an opinion, he's bringing into question the factual basis of your understanding and substituting the opposite, in the form of contrary fact.

       One of those counts as someone who just cares. People don't become missionaries for profit, they become missionaries because they want to spread their religion. They may spread something hateful, or do a bad job, but it's not like they make loads of money from converting people.

       What is it with shills, is it that you cannot fathom the fact that some people will disagree with you? I suspect not. Or is the fact that people frequent this subreddit with a world view that is totally at odds with yours, and is it that which you find suspicious?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you accept that its possible, for all intents and purposes, not to be a conspiracy theorist yet still have a strong interest in conspiracy theories, because they are fascinating?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it surprise you that some people are vehemently pro-Israel and wish to make their voice heard, simply because that's their view and nothing more?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like it or not, most theories promoted on this subreddit are unpopular in the mainstream (although I suspect that in itself is considered a conspiracy theory), so one cannot be surprised with the amount of anti-conspiracy voices on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because someone isn't by your definition a conspiracy theorist does not automatically mean that they shouldn't be interested in debating conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said all that, I understand that it seems with recent leaked official documents that shills are in operation online. But my god, apart from suspicions about the age of a Reddit account, there really is no more evidence short of your interpretation of certain comments, I.e., they hold an opposing view.
      </p>
      <p>
       IDK, it's the level of certainty in which people on this subreddit proclame that this forum is plagued with paid agents of the state that baffles me. Just admit that it's just a suspicion of yours, I'd understand that.

       Yeah, you're right, there is a lot of information out there to suggest it happens, particularly on mainstream platforms that can have a real world effect on politics, platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Reddit of course, what with it being considered the front page of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? Come on. Ignoring the fact that the only evidence one has for their existence here is yours and others (because no, you're not alone in this at all) interpretation of anti-conspriacy comments and the age of accounts, why on earth would governments and corporations waste time and money on this subreddit anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't aware that
       <a href="/r/consrpiacy">
        /r/consrpiacy
       </a>
       had any influence on the rest of Reddit, let alone the rest of the web and in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe, just maybe this subreddit might have been visited by pro-Monsanto users, possibly even Monsanto employees. And that's just a maybe given the fact that whether you like it or not, some people out there (not me) genuinely believe that Monsanto is not the evil company they are made out to be on this forum. That reality will of course make it difficult to distinguish between paid agents of the state and honest users, and that's true for virtually all subjects discussed here.

       Why can't the users of this sub accept that some people just want to fuck with others in here cause they find it amusing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why degrade yourself with as labeling them a troll or a shill? Its no better then them labeling you. They know most will defend their view in here and do so with force cause most in here see all the shit happening around them and are frustrated so much they want to lash out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a cycle on social media. It won't end and making posts like this doesn't help matters. They just link it and laugh at you and everyone else that is making spiteful comments.

       But they aren't opinions are they? If it's an opinion it lacks factual basis. If you're arguing opinions you're arguing about varying degrees of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       A shill isn't offering an opinion, he's bringing into question the factual basis of your understanding and substituting the opposite, in the form of contrary fact.

       Only if you call someone a shill. Calling someone a "shill" in this sub is against the rules. I don't call people shills. The other mods and I have removed countless comments for violating that rule.

       It's interesting to note all of the people that have responded to OP's post obviously consider themselves "shills, trolls and other guests who come here to downvote and insult..." then say "but we just disagree".

       I feel I can speak for everyone in this thread and say that no one here considers themselves a shill. I've seen plenty of people that have been accused of being shills simply for having different opinions. I'm glad you ban for that though. Keep it up.

       Better question how do you become a paid shill? I feel like I could easily do that job. I would gladly get paid to argue with strangers on the internet I do that anyway. At least then it would make what all these folks say about me true.
