       What man? Also - probably not. The trial opened with the defense saying "He did it." Essentially this isn't a trial to prove him guilty or innocent but rather to decide whether he lives or dies.

       Yeah this is Kangaroo justice. I got called out by all my in-laws last night because they want him to fry and I had the audacity to be of the opinion that they should release the video to the public
       <em>
        proving
       </em>
       he did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most of them can't get past the Psyop part of it, and the mere thought of
       <em>
        questioning
       </em>
       everything/anything was looked down upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really going to be an uphill battle to. Wake everyone up in time if I can't get a word I'm edgewise with my family.

       They did. The video released shows without a doubt that the younger brother walked into the crowd - put his back pack down and as soon as the other bomb went off he high tailed it out of there while everyone else was staring in confusion then BOOM.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all one long uninterrupted shot. Frankly it IS pretty damning. You can try and argue that he didn't know there was a bomb, he didn't know his bomb was live, that it was a drill and everyone had these bombs whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact of the matter is he absolutely put the bomb down and bolted.

       People keep saying this video proves conclusively that he did it. I see absolutely nothing conclusive about it. This sub as a whole seems to be forgetting the absolute shit show following the bombing, and the fairytale that led to this kid's arrest.

       I agree. But, think for a second of the mind of most Americans at this point. They remember the
       <em>
        coverage
       </em>
       of it, they remember the survivors and the testimonials and the guy at the Bruins game and the guy at the Red Sox game and the Boston Strong stickers that are on 1/10 bumpers I see day-to-day.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most haven't gone back and watched the live coverage again, analyzed it a bit, and found some really silly strange innacuracies of the official reports, the coverage, how they don't match, how there were bomb drills that day, etc, you're just coming at them
       <em>
        out of fucking nowhere
       </em>
       saying it kinda
       <strong>
        didn't happen
       </strong>
       , or at least as how it was reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's an incredibly tough barrier of propaganda to fight through, and they are nowhere prepared to fight that battle intellecutually, and resort to emotion and name-calling (...and now you can see how my night last night went).

       Totally agree. I personally have never bought into the 'smoke bomb' theory, or the 'crisis actor' theory (though I can't explain how Jeff Bauman didn't bleed out). Real bombs went off, and real people were injured. But I am absolutely certain that what we have been told and what actually happened are two totally different stories. There were Craft International operatives on site, plain as day; that tells me that this event was an 'op' without  needing any further evidence. I'm really surprised that so many people here are basically saying, "Case closed." Remember, CNN announced that an arrest had been made, and later retracted the announcement. Look, the FBI likely had every surveillance video within a mile radius in their possession within the hour. They've had two years to construct their narrative. Two years to sell this kid as the culprit. The kid's lawyer even said he did it (the logic behind this is so ridiculous it merits its own discussion). At this point, all they had to do was put this kid within a block of the explosion and he's guilty. The video
       <em>
        does not
       </em>
       show him dropping the backpack, as everyone is claiming. The video
       <em>
        does not
       </em>
       show the explosion go off right where the kid was standing, as everyone is claiming. If you watch the video a few times, the flash clearly comes from the left of the screen, out of frame. Ask yourself this question: If you have just planted a bomb, are you going to remain standing within 5 five feet of it up until 5 seconds of it detonating? Fuck no, you're going to drop that bag and get the fuck out of Dodge. Also, note that the video stops just as the blast goes off, obfuscating the precise spot in which it detonated. If that video ran another 10 seconds it would be plain as day that the explosion happened out of frame. Watch the video again, and then mentally edit out the circles that highlight the 'suspects'. In that context, all you have is a kid watching a race. As soon as you circle them, everything they do becomes suspect; people's minds are primed to accept that, 'THIS IS THE GUY'. There are too many inconsistencies in the story for these kids to be anything other than patsies.

In-laws:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hey Jim, did you see the video about the bombing. Shows the video you keep bitching about. He's guilty as fuck.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Me:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oh yeah? Great. I can't wait to check it out
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>
        watches video
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Me:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Meh, it shows him with a backpack that doesn't match the descriptions and images of the exploded backpack, in the vicinity of the blasts. We all knew he was here. You don't see him drop his bag, it actually cuts a few times, and after the first explosion there are a few people around him who start to slowly GTFO just like him, because they're not idiots like 4/5 if the other humans in the video. Then the explosion goes down away from frame, and we cut to him (and everyone else) running.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Them:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oh, Jim, you're such a
        <em>
         conspiracy theorist
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then I cracked another beer, and watched the kids play. Because they're far more sleepy than I thought.

       It's been linked in its entirety several times in this sub the last few days. You should have no problem finding it on your own. Whatever you might think about him deserving to die for what happened or whether he knew there was a live bomb are secondary to what the video shows.

       I saw an uncut video of him walking into the crowd, putting his bag down and waiting a few minutes. THe first explosion happens off screen and everyone around him stares at it while he runs away. 9 seconds later there is a massive explosion coming from where he was standing. Have you not seen this video?

       I started it right when the 1st went off, watch it. Right after the explosion, it fade to black and transitions to another camera. I'm saying we need to see the damage feed after the "fade to black". Then we can see what happened in the after math. Get it?

       No, I don't think they were ALL I think some of them were, like those who helped the wheelchair guy WERE in on it. Plus the normal people there don't have to be in on it. The shock of the event and seeing "blood" would make most people not think it was a set up.

       I'm more interested on WHO planted the actual device. That is why I said release the whole video uncut after the blast. I'd like to see if Dzhokar's bag is still there. Because if it is, then the explosion was from a different device. And if it was a different device, who planted that one (I think the gov). Just my opinion.

       edit: By another device I mean this one:

       They needed fake ones to parade around to continue the psy-op. IE, the guy in the wheelchair made his rounds at sporting events, interviews, etc etc. It was a "hero" or a "poster" boy of the "event". So did the guy in the cowboy hat. It's like reality TV, it's "real" but "scripted". It creates a narrative of good guys, bad guys and survivors. Reminds me of a hollywood script. Gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelet.

        What exactly about his injury looks fake

      <p>
       If he really had his legs blown off there would be a massive trail of blood. Look on the ground under, and behind him not a speck. The only blood is on his body and on the other guys hands. Impossible for this injury. The guy next to him would have blood all over him. That kinda of trauma would spurt blood out at high pressure.
      </p>

       He probably was an amputee prior to the event, which made him a good candidate. Plus he was ex military.

       Like I said, if you see this in real life right after 2 explosions, you wouldn't be looking at a dudes "blown off" leg and saying, wait a tick, that don't look right. Your mind is already stressed out, the last thing you are doing is thinking rationally. That's why we have to look back, after the event, isolated from it and investigated.

       You clearly haven't seen all the evidence. If you did, you would not think the official story is legit or would at least question things of that day. What about WTC 7? How do you explain that buildings collapse? What about the pentagon? Reports of explosion INSIDE of the building prior to the official time of the "plane" hitting it. Also, it was impossible for that size plane to fly that low and that fast into the building. As explain by pilots both military and commercial. If there were explosions inside the pentagon, which have been reported by first hand witnesses, that couldn't be a rag tag group of radicals, that would require inside access, ie. inside job.

       Agent provocateurs, happened in the Maiden riots of Ukraine. They did it to justify their actions. Not saying I BELIEVE that is the only explanation, could've been a random protestor. But we've seen this type of action before. So we must entertain the idea.

       Have you ever seen a real gunshot wound the head at point blank? You can find videos on liveleak and trust me they are NSFL. Look at some of those, and compare to the Hebdo shooting of that officer.

       They sure don't, once again go to liveleak or other places and see what a real saudi or AQ beheadings looks like. Then watch the IS films, yes I said films. They are propaganda videos released by one intelligence agency SITE. The father of the CEO of SITE (Rita Katz) was a spy for the Mossad.

       I'm not saying there aren't radicals over there killing people, there sure are. But the IS films released by SITE are propaganda. If they are these really evil people and barbarians, they wouldn't censor the deed. Like I said you can go watch some videos of REAL AQ or saudi beheadings. I warn you, it's not for the faint of heart, but you will see the difference.

       I really do not think you have really looked into conspiracy theories. I think you may have just watched a few youtube videos, which most are bullshit. I suggest you look a little deeper into history of the government, the CIA, the NSA, the military industrial complex, the petro dollar, PNAC and the new pearl harbor. Most of us here are already well versed in it. You seem to have nooo idea. Gotta start some where though.

       Seems like that is the shit they like to hide behind these days. You see worse shit on the walking dead. I think their is a reason IS videos fade to black and now this video comes out and it fades to black. They preconditioned people into thinking "Fade to black, because too gruesome of a site, can't watch it, they think its bad so I think it's bad too".

       I'd like to see it released as well but I would think that would come out publically after the trial was over.  But I don't know they have shown the firs part aleady so they may as well have shown the whole thing.

       You're referencing the theory that Alex Jones put forward months ago. You'll notice that he hasn't said ANYTHING about the boston bombing trial or video in the last few days. This is because everything he said, all of his theories have been completely atomized by the release of the security footage.

       I've heard this theory. Alex Jones spent the last year and a half promoting it. It's a great theory up until you see the video of the younger brother putting the bag down and running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever you want to believe it has to include the fact that the younger brother absolutely wandered into the crowd, put his bag down, left it when the first explosion hit and then it exploded. Those things happened in that order. Does that mean he had the detonator? Does that mean he knew there was a bomb in the bag does that mean he knew what was going on? No. But I can't hear any theories that don't accept what the video shows us.

       Yeah, those individuals were there and yeah they were running a drill. I listened to an episode of This American Life that investigated the shooting of their friend after wards. They made it pretty clear that the older brother was muscle for hire in the local under ground. A leg breaker who was a suspect for murder but never arrested or questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you combine that with what Russian intel said about him... I think it is HIGHLY REASONABLE to assume that he was working at the behest of someone else. Essentially the CIA hires him outright or through a front agency. Either way - pointing out that his brother put the bomb down himself doesn't discount the theory that the CIA was behind it. Or that those craft dudes were involved. In fact if the younger guy set the bomb off himself he sure cut it close.

       There is still a ton wrong with this case. The bullet riddled boat that he survived and wrote that epic note on? WTF who is buying that? The naked man, hearing that he was shot in the throat then seeing him fine... the fact that the older brother was a suspect in murder and had met with the FBI and had russian intel pinging the CIA about him? Like I still think A LOT of this case stinks but... the video to me shows the kid putting the bomb down and taking off.

       To quote his defense "He did it". Why? How? Did he know what he was doing? These are the real questions.

       I guess I believe that it is more reasonable that one way or another he is a patsy, as was his brother. I mentioned it elsewhere in this forum but the episode of 'This American Life' made it pretty clear to me that the older brother wasn't that smart and was a hired goon. A legbreaker with ties to both foreign and domestic intel. Not a big leap to say he was hired to do this or that he was in on the drill and to his surprise it went live.

       Agreed, but that doesn't automatically make it a detonator.

       No I agree completely im just syaing you don't usually see people walking around with big bulky devices like that these days but if what the other user said it is more of a trial if he lives and dies then it doesn't even matter really I was just wondering if they got brought up is all.

       Well i never saw that man with a backpack after the bombs that definitely clears that up for me with the video where he is clearly running with a backpack. But I am still pretty skeptical about people there. There is a video of the same guy going into to help people and all of sudden he ends up in a wheel chair with white bandaging around his leg? There definely is some inconsistencies.

       This is how my night went:
In-laws:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hey Jim, did you see the video about the bombing. Shows the video you keep bitching about. He's guilty as fuck.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Me:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oh yeah? Great. I can't wait to check it out
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>
        watches video
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Me:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Meh, it shows him with a backpack that doesn't match the descriptions and images of the exploded backpack, in the vicinity of the blasts. We all knew he was here. You don't see him drop his bag, it actually cuts a few times, and after the first explosion there are a few people around him who start to slowly GTFO just like him, because they're not idiots like 4/5 if the other humans in the video. Then the explosion goes down away from frame, and we cut to him (and everyone else) running.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Them:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oh, Jim, you're such a
        <em>
         conspiracy theorist
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then I cracked another beer, and watched the kids play. Because they're far more sleepy than I thought.

        serious question. you don't believe people were actually hurt? do you think everyone was faking their injuries? i'm actually curious.

      <p>
       I think there were some real injuries and some fake ones, like that dude in the wheel chair who had both legs blown off. He should've died within minutes. I think him, and the cowboy hat guy were crisis actors.

       I've already seen that and most, if not all the other videos.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        do you think all those first responders and regular people there are all in on it? wouldn't they notice the injuries were fake? how are they all keeping quite? how has no one talked?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, I don't think they were ALL I think some of them were, like those who helped the wheelchair guy WERE in on it. Plus the normal people there don't have to be in on it. The shock of the event and seeing "blood" would make most people not think it was a set up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more interested on WHO planted the actual device. That is why I said release the whole video uncut after the blast. I'd like to see if Dzhokar's bag is still there. Because if it is, then the explosion was from a different device. And if it was a different device, who planted that one (I think the gov). Just my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: By another device I mean this one:
