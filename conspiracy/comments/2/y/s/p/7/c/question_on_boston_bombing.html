<p>They did. The video released shows without a doubt that the younger brother walked into the crowd - put his back pack down and as soon as the other bomb went off he high tailed it out of there while everyone else was staring in confusion then BOOM. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all one long uninterrupted shot. Frankly it IS pretty damning. You can try and argue that he didn&#39;t know there was a bomb, he didn&#39;t know his bomb was live, that it was a drill and everyone had these bombs whatever. </p>

<p>Fact of the matter is he absolutely put the bomb down and bolted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But, think for a second of the mind of most Americans at this point. They remember the <em>coverage</em> of it, they remember the survivors and the testimonials and the guy at the Bruins game and the guy at the Red Sox game and the Boston Strong stickers that are on 1/10 bumpers I see day-to-day.</p>

<p>But most haven&#39;t gone back and watched the live coverage again, analyzed it a bit, and found some really silly strange innacuracies of the official reports, the coverage, how they don&#39;t match, how there were bomb drills that day, etc, you&#39;re just coming at them <em>out of fucking nowhere</em> saying it kinda <strong>didn&#39;t happen</strong>, or at least as how it was reported.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an incredibly tough barrier of propaganda to fight through, and they are nowhere prepared to fight that battle intellecutually, and resort to emotion and name-calling (...and now you can see how my night last night went).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. I personally have never bought into the &#39;smoke bomb&#39; theory, or the &#39;crisis actor&#39; theory (though I can&#39;t explain how Jeff Bauman didn&#39;t bleed out). Real bombs went off, and real people were injured. But I am absolutely certain that what we have been told and what actually happened are two totally different stories. There were Craft International operatives on site, plain as day; that tells me that this event was an &#39;op&#39; without  needing any further evidence. I&#39;m really surprised that so many people here are basically saying, &quot;Case closed.&quot; Remember, CNN announced that an arrest had been made, and later retracted the announcement. Look, the FBI likely had every surveillance video within a mile radius in their possession within the hour. They&#39;ve had two years to construct their narrative. Two years to sell this kid as the culprit. The kid&#39;s lawyer even said he did it (the logic behind this is so ridiculous it merits its own discussion). At this point, all they had to do was put this kid within a block of the explosion and he&#39;s guilty. The video <em>does not</em> show him dropping the backpack, as everyone is claiming. The video <em>does not</em> show the explosion go off right where the kid was standing, as everyone is claiming. If you watch the video a few times, the flash clearly comes from the left of the screen, out of frame. Ask yourself this question: If you have just planted a bomb, are you going to remain standing within 5 five feet of it up until 5 seconds of it detonating? Fuck no, you&#39;re going to drop that bag and get the fuck out of Dodge. Also, note that the video stops just as the blast goes off, obfuscating the precise spot in which it detonated. If that video ran another 10 seconds it would be plain as day that the explosion happened out of frame. Watch the video again, and then mentally edit out the circles that highlight the &#39;suspects&#39;. In that context, all you have is a kid watching a race. As soon as you circle them, everything they do becomes suspect; people&#39;s minds are primed to accept that, &#39;THIS IS THE GUY&#39;. There are too many inconsistencies in the story for these kids to be anything other than patsies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, man. And bravo.</p>

<p>What you are seeing the actual, live-action embodiment of them construction reality right in front of your face, except you no longer have their Matrix filter on and you can <em>see</em>.</p>

<p>This is how my night went:
In-laws:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Jim, did you see the video about the bombing. Shows the video you keep bitching about. He&#39;s guilty as fuck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah? Great. I can&#39;t wait to check it out</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>watches video</em></p>

<p>Me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meh, it shows him with a backpack that doesn&#39;t match the descriptions and images of the exploded backpack, in the vicinity of the blasts. We all knew he was here. You don&#39;t see him drop his bag, it actually cuts a few times, and after the first explosion there are a few people around him who start to slowly GTFO just like him, because they&#39;re not idiots like 4/5 if the other humans in the video. Then the explosion goes down away from frame, and we cut to him (and everyone else) running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, Jim, you&#39;re such a <em>conspiracy theorist</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I cracked another beer, and watched the kids play. Because they&#39;re far more sleepy than I thought.</p>

<p>Not true, we do not know that for <strong>sure</strong>. They need to release the entire video so we can see the damage after the explosion. Then and only than can we make a reasonable decision. If it wasn&#39;t his bag, it would still be there, which means it didn&#39;t blow up. Which would open an awkward/damning can of worms for the government. </p>

<p>serious question. you don&#39;t believe people were actually hurt? do you think everyone was faking their injuries? i&#39;m actually curious.</p>

<p>I think there were some real injuries and some fake ones, like that dude in the wheel chair who had both legs blown off. He should&#39;ve died within minutes. I think him, and the cowboy hat guy were crisis actors.</p>

<p>this video is less than a minute, take a look. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWAD8VrQxms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWAD8VrQxms</a> </p>

<p>I&#39;ve already seen that and most, if not all the other videos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you think all those first responders and regular people there are all in on it? wouldn&#39;t they notice the injuries were fake? how are they all keeping quite? how has no one talked?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I don&#39;t think they were ALL I think some of them were, like those who helped the wheelchair guy WERE in on it. Plus the normal people there don&#39;t have to be in on it. The shock of the event and seeing &quot;blood&quot; would make most people not think it was a set up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more interested on WHO planted the actual device. That is why I said release the whole video uncut after the blast. I&#39;d like to see if Dzhokar&#39;s bag is still there. Because if it is, then the explosion was from a different device. And if it was a different device, who planted that one (I think the gov). Just my opinion.</p>

<p>edit: By another device I mean this one: <a href="http://www.tidalwave23.com/uploads/3/0/7/6/3076800/4973213_orig.jpg">http://www.tidalwave23.com/uploads/3/0/7/6/3076800/4973213_orig.jpg</a> look in front of the gate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They needed fake ones to parade around to continue the psy-op. IE, the guy in the wheelchair made his rounds at sporting events, interviews, etc etc. It was a &quot;hero&quot; or a &quot;poster&quot; boy of the &quot;event&quot;. So did the guy in the cowboy hat. It&#39;s like reality TV, it&#39;s &quot;real&quot; but &quot;scripted&quot;. It creates a narrative of good guys, bad guys and survivors.

<p>What exactly about his injury looks fake </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he really had his legs blown off there would be a massive trail of blood. Look on the ground under, and behind him not a speck. The only blood is on his body and on the other guys hands. Impossible for this injury. The guy next to him would have blood all over him. That kinda of trauma would spurt blood out at high pressure.</p>

<p>He probably was an amputee prior to the event, which made him a good candidate. Plus he was ex military.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If what you&#39;re saying is true, then all his friends, family, the nurses, and doctors, the physical therapists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes you think those are his &quot;friends&quot; and not other actors or agents. Family? We know very little about this guy. Doctors, nurses, or physical therapists could be in on it, what hospital did he go to?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>other pedestrians who were in Boston during the bombing</p>

<p>Like I said, if you see this in real life right after 2 explosions, you wouldn&#39;t be looking at a dudes &quot;blown off&quot; leg and saying, wait a tick, that don&#39;t look right. Your mind is already stressed out, the last thing you are doing is thinking rationally. That&#39;s why we have to look back, after the event, isolated from it and investigated.</p>

<p>Use your eyes, there is clearly no blood on the ground/path he took. He should be gushing it and frankly at this point he should be dead. I&#39;ll try to find you a link to what a EMT said about this injury, which is where I got my info.</p>

<p>But, anyway, why do you think you and a relatively tiny amount of people online have been able to figure this out</p>

<p>First an foremost, we haven&#39;t figured anything out. We are just questioning things. You should always question things, it&#39;s healthy for the brain. It&#39;s not a relatively small amount of people. There are many people all over the internet calling this shit out. We&#39;ve learn about false flags and we know our government is corrupt and willing to crack a few eggs. The ends justify the means to them. Add in skepticism, critical thinking, and logical thought, you get a stance of, I&#39;m not completely buying it. MSM is propaganda, many people in the alt crowd do not watch it.</p>

<p>You can silence people by many means. Death threats, intimidation, money, suiciding, you name it. If YOU think of it, the spooks can do it.</p>

<p>As I said, I do not believe any theory about it, I&#39;m just questioning things until more evidence is made available, which I doubt it will.</p>

<p>You must be new here, this isn&#39;t a community like &quot;youtube conspiracy theorist&quot;. That is not what we do. We don&#39;t just go against the news of the day. We think about events rather than blindly accepting them. I can&#39;t talk for all, but I&#39;ve been here for a while and many people share the same sentiment as me in this regard.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t just stop there. You should always be seeking the truth whether 5, 10, 15, 100 years later. The Free Masons, ancient technology, the FED, JFK, aliens, etc etc. The truth always outs. And there are plenty examples of declassified &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.</p>

<p>You do realize the gov knew about the older brother, the Russians told the US about the older brother, and yet they carried this out? Either they were patsy or the gov allowed it, either way, that&#39;s a CONSPIRACY. Think about that for a second, especially in regards the NSA.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t believe 9/11 was an inside job. not because i can&#39;t handle it, or I&#39;m not a critical thinker, or other reasons that 9/11 truthers like to believe. its just that i don&#39;t think its reasonable. it makes much more sense to me that some religious radicals did it than an enormous government conspiracy that i believe would be impossible to keep a secret. And I promise, I&#39;ve seen every piece of &quot;evidence&quot; that the community has to offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You clearly haven&#39;t seen all the evidence. If you did, you would not think the official story is legit or would at least question things of that day. What about WTC 7? How do you explain that buildings collapse? What about the pentagon? Reports of explosion INSIDE of the building prior to the official time of the &quot;plane&quot; hitting it. Also, it was impossible for that size plane to fly that low and that fast into the building. As explain by pilots both military and commercial. If there were explosions inside the pentagon, which have been reported by first hand witnesses, that couldn&#39;t be a rag tag group of radicals, that would require inside access, ie. inside job.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>on the front page right now, people are saying that the CIA shot those two cops in ferguson without any proof. how is that more believable than some anti-police protestors shot into the group of cops? crime happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agent provocateurs, happened in the Maiden riots of Ukraine. They did it to justify their actions. Not saying I BELIEVE that is the only explanation, could&#39;ve been a random protestor. But we&#39;ve seen this type of action before. So we must entertain the idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>during the charlie shootings in paris, people were saying that there wasn&#39;t enough blood in the point-blank shooting of the cop. the government is smart enough to pull off this elaborate conspiracy, but forgot the fake blood? his family never said anything?</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a real gunshot wound the head at point blank? You can find videos on liveleak and trust me they are NSFL. Look at some of those, and compare to the Hebdo shooting of that officer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people thought the ISIS beheading videos were fake because it didn&#39;t look real to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They sure don&#39;t, once again go to liveleak or other places and see what a real saudi or AQ beheadings looks like. Then watch the IS films, yes I said films. They are propaganda videos released by one intelligence agency SITE. The father of the CEO of SITE (Rita Katz) was a spy for the Mossad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the government is evil enough to create ISIS and create wars where hundreds of thousands of real people fight and die, but are nice enough to too dumb to not actually behead the person at the risk of people like you catching them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t radicals over there killing people, there sure are. But the IS films released by SITE are propaganda. If they are these really evil people and barbarians, they wouldn&#39;t censor the deed. Like I said you can go watch some videos of REAL AQ or saudi beheadings. I warn you, it&#39;s not for the faint of heart, but you will see the difference.</p>

<p>I really do not think you have really looked into conspiracy theories. I think you may have just watched a few youtube videos, which most are bullshit. I suggest you look a little deeper into history of the government, the CIA, the NSA, the military industrial complex, the petro dollar, PNAC and the new pearl harbor. Most of us here are already well versed in it. You seem to have nooo idea. Gotta start some where though. </p>

<p>Whatever you want to believe it has to include the fact that the younger brother absolutely wandered into the crowd, put his bag down, left it when the first explosion hit and then it exploded. Those things happened in that order. Does that mean he had the detonator? Does that mean he knew there was a bomb in the bag does that mean he knew what was going on? No. But I can&#39;t hear any theories that don&#39;t accept what the video shows us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, those individuals were there and yeah they were running a drill. I listened to an episode of This American Life that investigated the shooting of their friend after wards.

<p>If you combine that with what Russian intel said about him... I think it is HIGHLY REASONABLE to assume that he was working at the behest of someone else. Essentially the CIA hires him outright or through a front agency. Either way - pointing out that his brother put the bomb down himself doesn&#39;t discount the theory that the CIA was behind it. Or that those craft dudes were involved. In fact if the younger guy set the bomb off himself he sure cut it close. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i never saw that man with a backpack after the bombs that definitely clears that up for me with the video where he is clearly running with a backpack. But I am still pretty skeptical about people there. There is a video of the same guy going into to help people and all of sudden he ends up in a wheel chair with white bandaging around his leg? There definely is some inconsistencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, man. And bravo.</p>

<p>What you are seeing the actual, live-action embodiment of them construction reality right in front of your face, except you no longer have their Matrix filter on and you can <em>see</em>.</p>

<p>This is how my night went:
In-laws:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Jim, did you see the video about the bombing. Shows the video you keep bitching about. He&#39;s guilty as fuck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah? Great. I can&#39;t wait to check it out</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>watches video</em></p>

<p>Me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meh, it shows him with a backpack that doesn&#39;t match the descriptions and images of the exploded backpack, in the vicinity of the blasts. We all knew he was here. You don&#39;t see him drop his bag, it actually cuts a few times, and after the first explosion there are a few people around him who start to slowly GTFO just like him, because they&#39;re not idiots like 4/5 if the other humans in the video. Then the explosion goes down away from frame, and we cut to him (and everyone else) running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, Jim, you&#39;re such a <em>conspiracy theorist</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I cracked another beer, and watched the kids play. Because they&#39;re far more sleepy than I thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>serious question. you don&#39;t believe people were actually hurt? do you think everyone was faking their injuries? i&#39;m actually curious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there were some real injuries and some fake ones, like that dude in the wheel chair who had both legs blown off. He should&#39;ve died within minutes. I think him, and the cowboy hat guy were crisis actors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this video is less than a minute, take a look. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWAD8VrQxms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWAD8VrQxms</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve already seen that and most, if not all the other videos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you think all those first responders and regular people there are all in on it? wouldn&#39;t they notice the injuries were fake? how are they all keeping quite? how has no one talked?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I don&#39;t think they were ALL I think some of them were, like those who helped the wheelchair guy WERE in on it. Plus the normal people there don&#39;t have to be in on it. The shock of the event and seeing &quot;blood&quot; would make most people not think it was a set up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more interested on WHO planted the actual device. That is why I said release the whole video uncut after the blast. I&#39;d like to see if Dzhokar&#39;s bag is still there. Because if it is, then the explosion was from a different device. And if it was a different device, who planted that one (I think the gov). Just my opinion.</p>

<p>edit: By another device I mean this one: <a href="http://www.tidalwave23.com/uploads/3/0/7/6/3076800/4973213_orig.jpg">http://www.tidalwave23.com/uploads/3/0/7/6/3076800/4973213_orig.jpg</a> look in front of the gate.</p>
