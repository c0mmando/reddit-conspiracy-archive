        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbwvChN8dQg">This</a> is Alex Jones back when he had it all figured out. His story at the time was that the bombs were detonated by remote and the government was going to blame patriots. He points out the SEAL guys in hats, he mentions the drill. He goes through a lot of intriguing theories. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o">This</a> is the video showing the younger brother dropping off the second bomb, running and the bomb exploding all in one shot. </p>

<p>A lot of things have happened in the trial - the defense attorney stood up and opened with &quot;he did it&quot;, this video was released, we heard about a bizarre note written on the side of the boat. All of this is really juicy interesting stuff to chew over but jones hasn&#39;t weighed in. Why? Because the video they released proves his theory absolutely wrong.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you can reasonably watch the video and argue that the kid didn&#39;t at least put the bomb there. i&#39;m willing to admit he didn&#39;t know it was a bomb, hell maybe he didn&#39;t even detonate it. But the footage speaks for itself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones is an interesting guy. He built a little media empire purely on the strength of his personality. He&#39;s paranoid and has never met a political conspiracy theory he didn&#39;t like. He&#39;s often completely wrong, but will never admit to being wrong. He has the emotional maturity of a small child, he&#39;s a bully, a blowhard, a braggard, and a coward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah, this changed for me yesterday too after seeing the footage. I always kind of felt this way since I was literally 2 blocks away when it happened. 
But it&#39;s pretty impossible to deny that A) the Tsarnaev&#39;s were involved, B) Real people got hurt. There were literally thousands of cameras there. The people filming the race turned and video&#39;d the entire thing. They didn&#39;t run, there is no setup.</p>

<p>Turn to like 1:05 in this video. There are at least 5 photographers seconds after the blast snapping pics. There is no time to setup this elaborate movie scene that is the basis for a false flag.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s so black and white. You could argue the kid didn&#39;t know there was a bomb in there or that he didn&#39;t set it off himself. But he sure as fuck put the bag down. </p>

<p>As for the whole story about it being staged with actors and stuff. That is dumb. I never bought that and never will. If you&#39;re the government staging a false flag you want a body count and you wanna make it simple. People have to actually die and as few people as possible are in on it. Way easier to just get some patsy to blow shit up than it is to have this elaborate ruse with actors and fake blood and a camera crew and so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Making your way in the world today takes everything you&#39;ve got. 
Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t you like to get away? </p>

<p>Sometimes you want to go...</p>

<p>Where everybody knows your name, 
and they&#39;re always glad you came. 
You wanna be where you can see, 
our troubles are all the same 
You wanna be where everybody knows 
Your name.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah nothing to do with the topic but I am hungover and can&#39;t get this out of my head...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that the brothers were working with the Craft team.
There were reports even on the MSM that Russia tried warning U.S. intelligence about the potential danger the brothers posed. So if that&#39;s the case, why weren&#39;t they being carefully watched by the government? A national security risk is allowed to just waltz right on into a crowded event with backpacks on? I&#39;m guessing a Craft spook that knew their language approached them with this plan, the older brother took the bait, younger one tags along. Unfortunately they didn&#39;t know they were just getting set up to continue the terrorist fear campaign we got going on. Or maybe they got forced into doing it. &quot;Do this or I&#39;ll kill your little brother and anyone you love living in this country&quot;. Patsies imo. Both of them.</p>

Here is a really great story about the older brother and his friend who was murdered by the cops. <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/519/dead-men-tell-no-tales">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/519/dead-men-tell-no-tales</a></p>
