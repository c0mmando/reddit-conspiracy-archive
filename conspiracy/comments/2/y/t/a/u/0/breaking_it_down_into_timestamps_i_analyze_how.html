        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o">The new video (evidence) shown in court</a></p>

<p><strong>0:14 - 0:51</strong>: <strong>Shows D.Tsarnaev carries his backpack loosely slung over his right shoulder, supporting the weight by holding the backpack strap with his right hand, leaving only his left arm and left hand free. In contrast to his older brother who wears it fully on the back leaving both arms and both hands free.</strong></p>

<p>0:51 - 3:39: Footage of 2 guys attending the Boston Marathon. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>3:40 - 3:47: D.Tsarnaev finds a spot to watch and sets down his backpack. In any crowded place where people are congregating, it is polite to put your backpack by your feet. Anyone who lives in a big city does this by habit while standing on bus, subway, or standing in a crowd.</p>

<p>3:47 - 7:42: Footage of a guy attending the Boston Marathon</p>

<p>7:43: Bomb goes off to the left of the camera. People seem to think D.Tsarnaev is the only one who doesn’t “react”. Actually, lots of people in the shot don’t react. The guy walking by in the white shirt/black jacket combo doesn’t react.</p>

<p>7:48: D.Tsarnaev starts to get the hell out of there, milliseconds before nearly everyone else does.</p>

<p>8:06 - 8:26: The older brother running (with everyone else), without a backpack. Frame by frame with a photo editor, this would be a very easy task for the clone-stamp (a tool that allows you to pick a piece of background and paste it on top of the layer). I could argue that the pixels look funny where his backpack <em>would</em> be, but I do not want to get into that.</p>

<p>@@@@_ <strong>IMPORTANT PART FOLLOWS</strong> _@@@@ (taking into account how D.Tsarnaev wears a backpack in 0:14 - 0:51)</p>

<p><strong>8:36 - 8:42</strong>: D.Tsarnaev enters the shot, running with everyone else. BUT WHY DO WE NOT SEE HIM SWINGING HIS RIGHT ARM? As a matter of fact, it seems like he is running with his right arm glued to his side (as if he were still gripping the backpack)</p>

<p><strong>8:43 - 8:45</strong>: D.Tsarnaev actually gets caught in the crowd for a second. For some reason he ONLY uses his left arm and left hand to maneuver through the people and if you pause it at 8:44, you see him maintaining that awkward pose where his right arm seems glued to his side with the elbow sticking slightly out and not swinging naturally (exactly what we would expect if he were still gripping the backpack strap with his right hand).</p>

<p><strong>8:59</strong>: A photograph. Right arm not visible. Right hand not visible. Right shoulder not visible.</p>

<p><strong>9:03</strong>: Another photo. Right arm not visible. Right hand not visible. Right shoulder not visible.</p>

<p>END OF VIDEO.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Older brother may or may not have had his photo manipulated. If, for arguments sake, there were no manipulation then we have a solid piece of evidence against him. </p>

<p>Younger brother, based on this video alone, was attending the Boston Marathon. <strong>There is zero VISIBLE evidence of anything else other than a millisecond head-start to flee the scene. Which <em>is</em> evidence, but significantly weaker evidence than solid proof of him not having his backpack while fleeing, of which there is zero evidence (in this particular video).</strong></p>

<p>..............</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This analysis is in no way trying to defend D.Tsarnaev other than looking at the video evidence from a 100% unbiased and purely analytical angle. If I were hired to defend him, this is how I would proceed. This is an important exercise to run through your mind for any controversial event. </p>

<p>By looking at the video from a 100% unbiased perspective, it is important to figure out how much <strong>solid and irrefutable evidence</strong> can be drawn from it. I think I have done that. Take that as you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good analysis. Again, nothing definitive here, just as many of us suspected. </p>

<p>The length of time it&#39;s taken to release this footage, the position of the left arm in the <em>post-drop</em> photos, certainly lends credibility to the idea that alteration was possible. </p>

<p>More importantly, the backpack that D. Tsarnaev is wearing does not even closely resemble the backpack in which the bomb exploded. </p>

<p>Which begs the question, is forgetting to grab your bag in the heat of the moment, evidence to incriminate you as the bomber? </p>

<p>Furthermore, a question I&#39;ve never seen addressed, let alone answered is how did they detonate the bombs? There is no evidence of D. Tsarnaev making any movements to indicate that he is detonating a bomb. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. For me, the biggest question (in relation to my post) is why are we being shown cherry-picked angles and shots that would beg a viewer to <strong>assume</strong>, without solid evidence, that he was without a backpack? </p>

<p>If that is really all that the government can come up with, then the lack of evidence would make one think they are intentionally holding back the majority of shots and footage. And why would they do that if they were actually interested in finding the truth?</p>

<p>I mean, we are the JURY level at this point and the only thing they can throw together is this half-assed slide-show/footage which cannot even seem to show the guy from the other side. The side that would be holding onto the backpack.</p>

<p>Every captured second of body movement (while he &quot;flees&quot;) is awkward and can be directly related to a person running with a backpack on their right shoulder. </p>

<p>Exactly. A single camera angle? This is a highly trafficked commercial street, there would have been literally dozens of stores catch this guy on camera. The only images we see are ones in which the alleged backpack isn&#39;t even visible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I really can&#39;t wrap my head around the detonation aspect. It doesn&#39;t appear he opened the backpack at all, so was there some kind of radio transmitted detonator? If not then it was on a timer. When did he set that timer? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Repost of a comment I made on another thread this morning):</p>

<p>Totally agree. I personally have never bought into the &#39;smoke bomb&#39; theory, or the &#39;crisis actor&#39; theory (though I can&#39;t explain how Jeff Bauman didn&#39;t bleed out). Real bombs went off, and real people were injured. But I am absolutely certain that what we have been told and what actually happened are two totally different stories. There were Craft International operatives on site, plain as day; that tells me that this event was an &#39;op&#39; without needing any further evidence. I&#39;m really surprised that so many people here are basically saying, &quot;Case closed.&quot; Remember, CNN announced that an arrest had been made, and later retracted the announcement. Look, the FBI likely had every surveillance video within a mile radius in their possession within the hour. They&#39;ve had two years to construct their narrative. Two years to sell this kid as the culprit. The kid&#39;s lawyer even said he did it (the logic behind this is so ridiculous it merits its own discussion). At this point, all they had to do was put this kid within a block of the explosion and he&#39;s guilty. The video <em>does not</em> show him dropping the backpack, as everyone is claiming. The video <em>does not</em> show the explosion go off right where the kid was standing, as everyone is claiming. If you watch the video a few times, the flash clearly comes from the left of the screen, out of frame. Ask yourself this question: If you have just planted a bomb, are you going to remain standing within 5 five feet of it up until 5 seconds of it detonating? Fuck no, you&#39;re going to drop that bag and get the fuck out of Dodge. Also, note that the video stops just as the blast goes off, obfuscating the precise spot in which it detonated. If that video ran another 10 seconds it would be plain as day that the explosion happened out of frame. Watch the video again, and then mentally edit out the circles that highlight the &#39;suspects&#39;. In that context, all you have is a kid watching a race. As soon as you circle them, everything they do becomes suspect; people&#39;s minds are primed to accept that, &#39;THIS IS THE GUY&#39;. There are too many inconsistencies in the story for these kids to be anything other than patsies.</p>

<p>EDIT: To further speak to one of OPs main points, it would have been exceptionally easy for this video to be edited, especially given the two-year window.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on! And as far as I am concerned, everything that happened after the fact (police chase, etc...) absolutely does not immediately point to guilt.</p>

<p>Imagine if you came home after attending the Boston marathon and the entire world was calling you a terrorist who just killed men, women, and children. </p>

<p>Most <em>sane</em> people would NOT turn themselves in after realizing that the US government has decided you were guilty, they would try to run because they would realize that nothing they could say or do would change that.</p>

<p>If I turned on the TV right now and saw my face all over it and the narrative of me being a terrorist already manufactured, I would immediately head to Mexico or Canada by car.</p>

<p>I would THEN, when in a semi-safe place, begin to work out how I could prove my innocence. But going directly to the police, or calling anyone, or trying to clear my name while half of Boston wanted to skin me.... no way. Innocent or not.</p>

<p>And I totally agree with you points about how disturbing it is that millions of people somehow believe the video shows him &quot;planting the bomb&quot; or the backpack exploding in the place where he put it down. It all has very much to do with psychological suggestions: like putting the guys in a bright circle and saying &quot;just look at these guys&quot;.</p>

<p>I can remember how crazy it was, on reddit, hours after the explosion. The US government suddenly said &quot;hey everyone, these guys did it&quot; and the only proof at the time was a picture of two guys (with a circle around them) attending the marathon.</p>

<p>And that was enough for 90% of reddit to go &quot;YES IT WAS THEM OMG!&quot;</p>

<p>I was arguing with people about it, literally in real time as that was happening. I was asking what happened to make everyone suddenly believe they were guilty and I was not given a single rational answer, just downvotes by the hundreds.</p>

<p>Nobody could explain what changed between not knowing who did it, and a picture of two guys with a circle around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you really run though? Is that really what you think most people would do? If you were legitimately innocent, then what would you have to run from? Just turn yourself in and clear your name. I&#39;m sure that most people would agree that running just makes someone look guilty. I honestly think that most people would just turn themselves in and try to clear their name, especially if it was the FBI after you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only argument I am making for running is that it is very easy for the average person to say &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have run if I was innocent&quot;. But that is about as accurate as someone who says something like &quot;If that bully picked on me then I would have just roundhouse kicked him in the face&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a huge difference between <em>imagining</em> yourself in a position and <em>actually</em> being there. And it is human nature to simplify things and then jump to the conclusion that you would do the &quot;correct&quot; thing logically. </p>

<p>Lets think about it for a moment, *<em>really</em> think about it.</p>

<p>For the sake of this argument, you have to assume that you are actually innocent:</p>

<p>1) You spend your day at the Boston Marathon and you are close enough to the explosion that it is still fresh in your mind. You saw blood and body parts. You are traumatized, it has been a REALLY bad day. You just want to be somewhere safe (like your house).</p>

<p>2) You turn on the TV, you are still shaking from the experience. You get up to make some tea and you hear your name. You think you are imagining this. You then look at the TV and you see your face on it. You see your brothers face too. The TV is telling you that YOU committed mass murder. The TV is telling you that YOU are a terrorist and there is a man-hunt to find you.</p>

<p>3) Suddenly the doorbell rings and you are FUCKING panicking. This cannot be real. This must be a horrible nightmare. You are afraid to even answer the door. You look out the window and see your brother.</p>

<p>4) He enters and you are both panicking. He says that both of your names and mugshots are all over the TV and internet. </p>

<p>5) Maybe you think about turning yourself in. Then your brother says &quot;Dude, this is BIG deal. We were both there. We both had backpacks on. Think about it. We are both Muslim. We were not born in this country. The FBI is after us&quot;</p>

<p>6) So you say &quot;But listen, we are innocent. We have nothing to worry about, lets just go turn ourselves in to the police.&quot;</p>

<p>7) Then you begin to think about it. Do you walk to the police station? Your mugshot is everywhere. Do you drive there? What happens when you enter the station? The minute you show your face outside of the house, people are going to start screaming bloody murder. The minute you step into a police station, guns are going to be drawn and since you are terrorist murderers who killed women and children, the chances of not getting the shit kicked out of you in custody are small.</p>

<p>8) In addition to everything else. You have to realize that you have WAY bigger questions to ask. Why did the most powerful government in the world say that you did it? At that point, they have no proof. Did they just pick your names from a hat? Did they just say &quot;Hey these two guys fit the bill&quot;? What led them to pick you? Something much bigger must be going on. How do you turn yourselves into the same government that just literally FRAMED you for murder?</p>

<p>A government willing to frame you for murder must be willing to do just about anything. Will they kill you in custody? Are they already working on fake evidence? Once again, how do you <em>reason</em> with a government willing to lie to 350 million people? </p>

<p>Or maybe they are just wrong, they made a mistake. So the question is: are they going to admit their mistake? Are they going to go on TV and say &quot;Hey American, oops. We picked out the wrong guys. Sorry. The real terrorist are still out there. Anyways, have a good one&quot;? No, probably not.</p>

<p>You are in some seriously deep shit right now. Probably the deepest shit that anyone can be in, EVER. And now the question comes down to basic human instinct. FIGHT or FLIGHT.</p>

<p>Do you try to fight the charges. Something that you will probably get the chance to do after rotting in prison for 2 years while waiting for a court date? Or do you run? The Canadian border is starting to look really good right now. The clock is ticking though. The difference between one hour and the next could literally change your entire life.</p>

<p>WHAT DO YOU DO????</p>

<p>/end</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t think it is an obvious decision. Life is just more complicated than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think most people would turn themselves in. I understand that it&#39;s speculative, but if they were two random guys like you and me who happened to be framed, why would they think they could outrun the FBI and the Boston P.D? I wouldn&#39;t have the resources to do anything of that, and I&#39;m assuming most people don&#39;t either. I just think running like that is a lot more incriminating than turning yourself in. </p>

<p>Also, if they were framed, how could the government had guaranteed that they&#39;d be at the marathon and both have backpacks? The general consensus seems to be that this was all a false flag operation, but what was it a false flag for? I can understand 9/11 being a false flag, but what would be the government&#39;s motivation for the Boston attack?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok before captain reddit seizes the day with his impenetrable logic. The Tsarnaev brothers were already intimately involved with the FBI as double agents. This is a standard operating procedure, going back to Lee Harvey Oswald (which was botched actually). Nowadays the neatest way to end the operation is to have the patsies run and then you kill them, then America goes back to sleep. Working out the patsy is the most important part of the whole operation. The major clue lies in the fact that the Tsarnaevs were already connected to the CIA as double agents long before - just like Oswald, just like Bin Laden. From their it&#39;s simple for a handler to give them some sort of information (true or false) that would induce them to run. Nothing fancy, nothing new, just standard operating procedure. But then, does this make sense to you? Doubtful.. </p>

<p>Then shit <em>goes down</em>, they GTFO of dodge, stop and get some local Whole Foods, and head back home to eventually fins out they be the <em>terrorists</em>, and it&#39;s time to get out of dodge.</p>

<p>I fell into this trap for awhile dude (no offense meant in the slightest). Stop thinking about the motivation/qui bono/etc. It&#39;s fun to think about, sure. But the main focus should be comparing</p>

<p>what the official version is</p>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what evidence had been presented</p>

<p>Who gives a shit about motives. Just start above and see where you end up.</p>

<p>My response is &quot;who cares,&quot; besides to scare the American public, slowly integrate Islam with lone wolves and Chechnya (that&#39;s close to Russia, Right?) and you&#39;re all set.</p>

<p>And now - you will notice - that this lawyer&#39;s decision to open with <em>he did it</em> was actually a planned attempt at implanting a thought in everybody&#39;s mind prior to this video leak.</p>

<p>Think about it. Through the discovery process she has to have seen this video, and know their would be public demand for it. So she opens the case with </p>

<blockquote>
<p>of course he did it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because her main job is to fight against the death penalty. Did you know she was the defense attorney for Zaccarias Moussaui, Jared Loughner, Ted Kaczasinski (the Unabomber), etc. </p>

<p>But now because we know <em>he did it</em> according to his fucking lawyer, of course <em>you&#39;re going to see him doing it</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually creepy, predictive programming if you think about it.</p>

<p>Laugh all you want about mind control shenanigans - but MKUltra happened. And what color was that dress again? Did the media, over a course of a day, show you it could be white/gold or black/blue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and it seems like they WANT to make that connection because they show him also &quot;fleeing&quot; without a backpack. So why not strengthen the case with more evidence, like him dropping his backpack. </p>

<p>Also, as a professional graphic designer, if I were given the job to photoshop out the backpacks, it would be a piece of cake. Every photo used as evidence has one of the brothers clearly framed against a solid backdrop (whether it is a brick wall or the smooth concrete of the road). Using the clone stamp against those back drops would be a cake-walk.</p>

<p>In contrast, had we seen one of the brothers framed against the crowd, it would have been MUCH more difficult to achieve the effect of making the backpack disappear. Because you would need to &quot;recreate&quot; actual body parts, and faces, colors/shadows, etc...</p>

<p>Of course, that can also be done. But it is just telling for me that we only see shots of them, without backpacks, against universal surfaces.</p>

<p>Yes, and even the blurred out images are from scenes after the bystanders have fled the scene, and the smoke has dissipated. Leaving enough time for the amputee crisis actors to get into position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying whether you are right or wrong, but all of this is outside the realm of my post. </p>

<p>My biggest concern is that the evidence (or lack of evidence), and the strange way the younger brother moves, hints at the fact that he <em>did</em> leave the event with a backpack. If he did leave with a backpack, then we are seeing cherry-picked angles and shots to make us <em>assume</em> that he didn&#39;t, without any real evidence.</p>

<p>I find it concerning that after all of the videos and cameras that were shooting that day, we are NEVER offered a shot of the younger brother&#39;s right side (logically the side which holds his backpack).</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that a little too convenient?</p>

<p>The biggest and most well funded government in the world cannot show THE JURY stronger evidence? To me, that reeks of foul play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry guys. I don&#39;t buy it. It&#39;s clear as day to me that he sets the bomb down. Maybe before or after he is texting his brother because his brother has the bomber timer set to a watch. Tsarnev knew he had about 5 seconds to get out of the blast radius. It was an obvious bomb plant. Tsarnev had no reason to be there.he literally runs right before the bomb exploded. How could he possibly have known an improvised pressure cooker bomb was at his feet a mere couple of seconds before it exploded? Do you see where I&#39;m going with this. The fact that he is clearly running away from the backpack that he planted on the ground and him texting his obvious clues to anybody with half a brain that they were extremely suspicious. Both wearing dark trench coats and hats attempting to obscure their faces on purpose. It&#39;s getting to be pretty funny how y&#39;all are attempting to say it&#39;s a government setup. I don&#39;t see it like that at all. You don&#39;t think fbi harrassment can cause somebody to snap and plant a bomb? These guys are Chechen radicals. Why would the government edit out a backpack? Do you really think they would risk everything by photoshopping it? seriously? Photoshopping out a backpack? He ran from the scene of the crime. He ran away from the bomb blast because he knew the bomb was about to explode. Pasty don&#39;t run before bombs explode. They don&#39;t blend in when they run. Craft international and countless other agencies were holding drills anticipating and scouting out the crowds. There&#39;s a really good chance the fbi was anticipating a bomb blast. The craft international run the air and test for bomb blasts. The high level of activity was specificly for the drill. You really can&#39;t stop these type of homegrown terrorism without a large undercover police force like the dhs. At public events you should be prone to more government surveilance after this terrorist attack. This video has proved my opinion further that he is guilty along with his brother. Shows them at the scene of the crime. Shows them texting one another anticipating the timing of the bomb. And it also shows tsarnev running away from the bomb blast far more then &quot;miliseconds&quot; as the op claims but a very good 4-5 seconds of running threw people to escape the blast. Again op I commend your effort for trying to portray conspiracy theorist in a negative light on purpose. The more people who think the Boston marathon bombing was set up and the tsarnevs are just pastys are literally painting us as crazy people. You cannot deny the evidence this video has shown proves without a doubt that tsarnev antcipated an explosion. He wasn&#39;t running to the finish line people he was running because he planted a bomb.</p>

<p>You spelled backpack wrong. Most people set down their backpacks when standing in a crowd. It is not a strange thing to do, at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would the government edit out a backpack? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously to support the narrative that he left it. Which further supports the narrative that it was a bomb.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sorry but you are just inventing a new reality at this point. Click on the video. Use the pause button. There is not even a full 1 second between him running and everyone else running.</p>
