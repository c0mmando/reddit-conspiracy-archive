<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ytqp5/historians_such_as_david_irving_aggressively_deny/">Historians such as David Irving aggressively deny the large extent of the holocaust. How can they justify this in the face of the huge well of evidence?</a></p>

<p>My answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Why are you trying to get people banned here? If you even hint at the notion that you deny the holocaust in any of the history subs, it&#39;s an automatic ban. Hence why you haven&#39;t received an answer. I would direct you to specific subs to research this more, but I can&#39;t because I don&#39;t want to get banned.</em></p>

<p><em>To the mods: I did NOT deny the holocaust in this post. Don&#39;t ban me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few minutes later....</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>you&#39;ve been banned</strong></p>

<p>Correct, technically, but your denialist agenda is fairly easy to find, and we don&#39;t appreciate you trying to not so subtly introduce it into the subreddit.
Have a nice day!&quot;</p>

<p>Precisely, which is why I wanted to test it out to see. Sure enough, removed. Just because they don&#39;t want to talk about nazi&#39;s doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll just be erased from history. Operation Paperclip is a huge topic which should be discussed. Which is why I&#39;m posting it again, reworded though.lol.</p>

<p>You really need to drop the superior attitude and acknowledge that these are human beings, just like you, no better or worse. Too often in our society we take the shortcut and assume people who think differently to us are &quot;crazy&quot;, or &quot;stupid&quot;, or &quot;evil&quot;.</p>

<p>This might help you understand what these people are actually saying, as opposed to what is said <em>about</em> them:</p>

But now a days, and thanks to a few conversations I&#39;ve had with less judgemental souls than you, is that in some countries, you can&#39;t even look up info, speak about it. That&#39;s bs.

<p>So do Holocaust revisionists. We just point out that the gassings part of the Holocaust is, for numerous reasons, a physical impossibility, and has not been proven to contemporary legal standards -- and point to evidence contradicting the gassings narrative.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve taken the first step in understanding that this is not being argued &quot;because they&#39;re Nazis&quot;, why not go one step further and actually listen to what the best revisionist scholars are saying?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will be honest. The only revisionist &quot;scholars&quot; i&#39;ve heard that I&#39;ve actually listened to, are on this sub lol. </p>

<p>I know, that&#39;s so spoon fed, but you gotta understand that there are white power nazi groups that use revisionism as a recruitment tool, so I really avoid those sites. Out of presumption, I fully agree. And that does make an ass outta me. But I am my only fliter. </p>

<p>But I get what is being said on the camps, that they were work camps, so ppl wern&#39;t being mass gassed. When I tried to find absolute proof of gas chambers, I found none. That shook me, no lie. But I also know that such machinery would be easy enough to disassemble and unload for a military machine as effiencent as the nazis. So, there still could&#39;ve been gas chambers in my view. </p>

<p>I can give the doubting mind that, and still point to the physical and mental experimention that modern brain science, heck overall new and complete understanding came of the human body, because the nazis were disecting ppl alive, and studying them. This is a fact. So at best, it was a work camp that preformed super villian level science experiments. That&#39;s still not a great place to camp out. </p>

<p>Also, I know not all nazis were evil bastards. If we take Ann Franks diary as ligit (i know some don&#39;t, just presume with me for the moment, and you can go back to your original conception after the presentation), then we see even the nazi solider that loaded her up seemed quite upset. Gave them all a bucket of water for the trip in the truck that took them to the train. He cared, but what could he do? &quot;Run lil Jews while I hold off 20 guys!&quot; This isn&#39;t an action movie, this is real life. I feel for that poor guy. Being a nazi in germany at that time, doesn&#39;t make one evil, most of em just needed bread in thier bellies, and for the first time in some time, they were being fed. </p>

<p>So yeah, Hitler was awesome to the germans, cause they stopped starving to death. If he never went on to be a genocidal manaic, I bet real money he&#39;d be concidered the greatest leader in the history of the world with his recovery program in Germany. Too bad he got greedy and started taking over other nations in the name of white superiority. e.e </p>

<p>That&#39;s why being a nazi today isn&#39;t kosher. Because back then, atleast they had an excuse of living conditions so we can kinda see how they fell into the pit fall. Today? What&#39;s someone&#39;s excuse, anyone&#39;s, be it nazi, extreme zionist (cause most of us don&#39;t believe in death, but extremist ya know, they like to kill ppl that don&#39;t think like them.), religionist, whatver, what&#39;s the reason to cause harm to someone else for not seeing your world view? And that&#39;s where I come to odds with modern nazis and white power groups of today, or any power group based on race, really. It&#39;s just so foolish. </p>

<p>So if we wish to discuss and uncover the truth about history, i&#39;m in. If we&#39;re here to harm anyone in any way, nope. That&#39;s the enemies tactics and I shant lower myself to such a standard.</p>

<p>I know this post presumes alot, but you gotta understand, my first stormfront vid showed me some amazing things about class division and how even the 50 to 80% th are being screwed, like royally. So I&#39;m in, I&#39;m like yeah, that&#39;s fucked up! Then all I head about his Jew this, kill that. Burn burn burn. <em>smh</em> it&#39;s sickening. I can&#39;t get onboard with that, and it was one of the bigger disappointments of my life to find out that ppl so intelligent, could also be so full of hate. </p>

<p>If I&#39;ve discovered anything, it&#39;s knowledge brings peace.</p>

<p>Yeah, and this also frustrating to the real historical revisionists -- they act like they own the research, when they have contributed almost nothing to it. (But, one thing I recognized, when I started to engage with this topic, is that &#39;white nationalists&#39; aren&#39;t the same thing as &quot;neo-nazis&quot; or &quot;white supremacists&quot;. Ethno-nationalism is something I&#39;m still trying to get my head around: common ancestry, language, culture (etc) was once the traditional basis for what constituted a &#39;nation&#39; -- so this is more of a reactionary movement, rather than a &quot;racist&quot; one.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What? No... these were structures, not devices... we&#39;re talking about giant crime scenes, where there should be forensic evidence... cyanide residue... enormous mass graves full of cremains and ashes... land disturbances detectable by ground-penetrating-radar, etc...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In all of the documentation captured, there is no evidence of a Hitler order, or that he had any knowledge. Quite the contrary. Same with the Goebbels diaries. There is plenty of evidence showing that the NS policy of explusion never changed into one of extermination.</p>

<p>Cool. Nobody is going to get hurt. But some people are going to get upset. That&#39;s unfortunate. The WWII generation is almost all gone, so it&#39;s time to get started undoing their mythologization of history.</p>

<p>Sorry I accused you of feeling superior; you&#39;re far more knowledgable and open-minded than I (stupidly) assumed. [edit typo]</p>

<p>This is a short documentary by a French historian who is about to go back to prison for a second time -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjqf-vNq6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjqf-vNq6I</a> -- I think it&#39;s fairly representative of the tone of most historical revisionism.

    <div class="md"><p>I will be honest. The only revisionist &quot;scholars&quot; i&#39;ve heard that I&#39;ve actually listened to, are on this sub lol. </p>

<p>I know, that&#39;s so spoon fed, but you gotta understand that there are white power nazi groups that use revisionism as a recruitment tool, so I really avoid those sites. Out of presumption, I fully agree. And that does make an ass outta me. But I am my only fliter. </p>

<p>But I get what is being said on the camps, that they were work camps, so ppl wern&#39;t being mass gassed. When I tried to find absolute proof of gas chambers, I found none. That shook me, no lie. But I also know that such machinery would be easy enough to disassemble and unload for a military machine as effiencent as the nazis. So, there still could&#39;ve been gas chambers in my view. </p>

<p>I can give the doubting mind that, and still point to the physical and mental experimention that modern brain science, heck overall new and complete understanding came of the human body, because the nazis were disecting ppl alive, and studying them. This is a fact. So at best, it was a work camp that preformed super villian level science experiments. That&#39;s still not a great place to camp out. </p>

<p>Also, I know not all nazis were evil bastards. If we take Ann Franks diary as ligit (i know some don&#39;t, just presume with me for the moment, and you can go back to your original conception after the presentation), then we see even the nazi solider that loaded her up seemed quite upset. Gave them all a bucket of water for the trip in the truck that took them to the train. He cared, but what could he do? &quot;Run lil Jews while I hold off 20 guys!&quot; This isn&#39;t an action movie, this is real life. I feel for that poor guy. Being a nazi in germany at that time, doesn&#39;t make one evil, most of em just needed bread in thier bellies, and for the first time in some time, they were being fed. </p>

<p>So yeah, Hitler was awesome to the germans, cause they stopped starving to death. If he never went on to be a genocidal manaic, I bet real money he&#39;d be concidered the greatest leader in the history of the world with his recovery program in Germany. Too bad he got greedy and started taking over other nations in the name of white superiority. e.e </p>

<p>That&#39;s why being a nazi today isn&#39;t kosher. Because back then, atleast they had an excuse of living conditions so we can kinda see how they fell into the pit fall. Today? What&#39;s someone&#39;s excuse, anyone&#39;s, be it nazi, extreme zionist (cause most of us don&#39;t believe in death, but extremist ya know, they like to kill ppl that don&#39;t think like them.), religionist, whatver, what&#39;s the reason to cause harm to someone else for not seeing your world view? And that&#39;s where I come to odds with modern nazis and white power groups of today, or any power group based on race, really. It&#39;s just so foolish. </p>

<p>So if we wish to discuss and uncover the truth about history, i&#39;m in. If we&#39;re here to harm anyone in any way, nope. That&#39;s the enemies tactics and I shant lower myself to such a standard.</p>

<p>I know this post presumes alot, but you gotta understand, my first stormfront vid showed me some amazing things about class division and how even the 50 to 80% th are being screwed, like royally. So I&#39;m in, I&#39;m like yeah, that&#39;s fucked up! Then all I head about his Jew this, kill that. Burn burn burn. <em>smh</em> it&#39;s sickening. I can&#39;t get onboard with that, and it was one of the bigger disappointments of my life to find out that ppl so intelligent, could also be so full of hate. </p>

<p>If I&#39;ve discovered anything, it&#39;s knowledge brings peace.</p>
