        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As most of you can probably tell there has been many posts related to the Holocaust on the front page of reddit. In just about every post I&#39;ve seen some mention of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> being a horrible place full of crazies. I&#39;d like to know the truth (about your opinions) instead of some random redditors telling me about it. After looking through some of the top posts of all time on here, to me at least, you all seem to make some pretty good points about police natl security stuff (I didn&#39;t see any Holocaust stuff) so you don&#39;t seem to be circlejerky as far as I can tell from skimming. </p>

<p><strong>I&#39;ll start off.</strong> 9/11 was not an inside job per say but a result of neglecence on behalf of the US Govt employees. I am in full belief that the US had enough information to have prevented 9/11 but didn&#39;t because the workers were incompetent and the heads were uninterested. </p>

<p>I believe the Holocaust did happen, and there is more than enough info to support it. However, I do not believe the US should continue to baby Israel is it has been for many decades. </p>

<p><strong>I don&#39;t mean for this to be like an attack on your beliefs, I am genuinely interested in learning and knowing the truth instead of joining the anti-r/Conspiracy train without knowing anything</strong></p>

<p>Edit* feel free to discuss other stuff too like Russia and middle Eastern stuff going on. I&#39;d like to have a good discussion.</p>

People here haven&#39;t got all the answers, but we have got plenty of questions.
There are some very good movies posted in this sub which can explain things far better than I can.
Remember that most people here came from the same place as everyone else until one event or spark showed them the rabbit hole.
There is fuckery afoot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11:</p>

<p>A lot of skeptical folks share your view, that 9/11 was caused by negligence, rather than malice. Unfortunately, while this viewpoint is psychologically &quot;safe&quot;, as it requires no re-evaluation of fundamental worldviews, it doesn&#39;t hold up to even basic scrutiny. Simply put, 2 jets can&#39;t knock down 3 towers, all in symmetrical near free-fall collapse. Can&#39;t happen. To paraphrase Joe Rogan, a retarded 6yo could see through that story.</p>

<p>Explosives, of some sort, were planted. It logically, therefore, <strong>must</strong> have been an inside job. I&#39;m sorry, but your worldview is due for a radical restructuring as you learn who the complicit parties necessarily must have been.</p>

<p>Once you understand 9/11, you&#39;ll need to re-evaluate the Holocaust ... and indeed WW2 ... and indeed all of history ... and indeed reality in that light. Good luck.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>9/11 – there was some other reason for the towers falling than being hit by planes and the ensuing fire</p></li>
<li><p>Holocaust – someone is lying about some aspect of it</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;d say the general consensus is that, at the very least, the US gov&#39;t allowed 9/11 to happen.  It is much more likely, though, that rogue elements of the government and the Military industrial Complex played a pivotal role in the event.  This is mainly because of the extreme scientific improbability that the 3 buildings could have all collapsed so uniformly, all of them collapsing near or at the speed of freefall.  There is a MOUNTAIN of science to back this up, done by a myriad of qualified professionals.  On the other hand, NIST, the organization officially responsible for explaining the collapse has not released ANY of their data from which they drew their conclusions.  As we all know, peer-review is the cornerstone of good science.  Without turning this post into a book, one last point about the collapsing buildings is that NIST eventually admitted that WTC 7 fell at the speed of freefall for at least a couple seconds.  This is extremely important because freefall is only possible with absolutely no opposing force to stop a collapse, this only ever occurs in controlled demolitions.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that the majority of us that have arrived at this conclusion have only done so after spending many, many hours researching the subject.  I obviously understand your skepticism, I was skeptical too, until I watched the entirety of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M">The New Pearl Harbour.</a>  Yes, it is 5 hours long, but it will quite literally address any skepticism you might have about the subject.  </p>

<p>I think nearly every single person here knows the Holocaust happened.  You would have to be delusional to deny that the Jewish people endured great suffering during the war.  The argument is not about whether or not the Holocaust happened, it is over the extent of the casualties.  Now, it might seem petty to argue over the numbers of this event but there are a couple logical reasons for doing so.  First is the current Israel-Gaza conflict; regardless of who you believe is &quot;right&quot; in the situation it cannot be disputed that Israel has committed War Crimes in this conflict and has killed many, many times more Palestinians than they have lost.  What I&#39;m saying is that they should not be free of scrutiny.  Anyone who is willing to bomb and oppress an entire population of people should be heavily scrutinized.  Secondly, it has recently come to light that many historical events may not have occurred exactly as we were told, a good example of this is the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which was the catalyst for the Vietnam War. </p>

<p>Now, onto the 6 million number.  There is actually a large amount of evidence showing that it would be EXTREMELY difficult for the Nazis to exterminate this many people while also fighting a War.   A lot of this evidence comes from what we know about the Auschwitz camp, which had 2 main cremation buildings with 3 furnaces each.  More crematoriums were built but it doesn&#39;t appear that they operated more than 2 at a time.  Aerial photographs during the War confirm this.  The first big problem with exterminating this many people is it would take thousands of tons of coke (coal) to do so (human bodies are 70% water, they require a huge amount of fuel to be fully cremated), there would need to be a constant supply of coke delivered by train daily to these camps, we have no photos or other forms of evidence showing this happened.  It is not even known where the Germans could have mined this much coal.  Next: the logistics of exterminating this many people just don&#39;t add up.  I&#39;m going to be EXTREMELY generous here and say all 5 crematoriums burned 2 bodies an hour (extremely exaggerated, it&#39;s more likely it was 1 body every 2 hours, modern furnaces can&#39;t even do this) in each of their 3 furnaces 24 hours a day for 3 years straight (most of the individual crematoriums were only in operation for 1-2 years).  That would end up killing a little more than 800,000 people, STILL hundreds of thousands less than the official estimates of 1.1 to 1.5 million (original estimates were 4 million).  Similar things would have to be happening at the other smaller camps, too. I have nothing against the Jewish people at all, I just have a very analytical mind, and it seems very improbable that the Nazis were capable of killing that many people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is. The only thing we all have in common, is that we question everything we are told, and come to our own conclusions based on research and evidence.</p>

<p>As well demonstrated throughout history, governments and powerful people lie for their own benefit. Believe it or not, these billionaires are not saints who spend all their time trying to help the poor. It would seem perfectly healthy, to question what we are told. </p>

<p>You are probably most interested in 9/11, being a recent event. This is the best video on the subject (as linked by the poster above): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1GCeuSr3Mk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1GCeuSr3Mk</a></p>

<p>Other events are also just as obvious, such as the Kennedy assassination.</p>

<p>Congratulations on not laughing with the herd. You may research and still disagree with us, but at least you did the research :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9-11 in my opinion was set up by more than just the US govt. Saudi govt had there hands in along with Israel as well. Plenty of other buildings have burned for way longer and stood. Molten steel still present weeks later. Passports on the ground. Explosions heard most of the day. Guys with boxcutters defeating our defense system 4 times in one day. To much to ignore. Does anybody think that just maybe the govt. might throw there own &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; at us just like we do to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that 9/11 was a U.S. and Israeli false-flag, psychological operation to move the Zionist Middle East agenda and the Jewish banking cabal&#39;s global government agenda forward. Both the U.S. and Israel are controlled by Jewish financial and political power. There may have been other much lesser facilitators  in this 9/11 scam.</p>

<p>The holocaust is a false narrative. The Germans had work camps and no extermination program. Many different Germans died at the end of WW2 from disease, starvation, and war against civilians mainly do to the criminal actions of the allied forces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, that actually makes a lot of sense! I&#39;ve watches a few of the videos now and I&#39;ve got a whole new outlook on the Holocaust. Makes me want to more research on this whole thing </p>

<p>Edit* to be clear I meant a new outlook on the theory itself not my own opinions. I am saying that the arguement, at least in that specific video makes more sense than people make it out to be. In another thread the Holocaust theory was compared to the film black dynamite, in its conveluted way of arriving to conclusions. This however seems to be a lot more realistic than that of the film, obviously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The film is 4 hours long, but when you look at the burial space in the camps it&#39;s obvious. When the guy was talking about how you would need 41 of those pits its the same as as saying you would need a single pit the size of an olympic swimming pool, but a quarter mile deep -- and that&#39;s with perfect packing efficiency!</p>
