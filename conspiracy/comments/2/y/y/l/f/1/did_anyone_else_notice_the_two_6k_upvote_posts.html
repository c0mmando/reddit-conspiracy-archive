    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines do have risks.  It&#39;s very low. On the order of 1 in millions like a lottery.  But the parents of those few get very upset and vocal. That&#39;s really the debate.  Do you give your child a treatment with chances of damage on the order of a lottery (but still real), or do your social duty against an invisible threat that may not happen? The more rare the disease the less attractive the shot looks. You Don&#39;t hear much anti talk about the flu because it&#39;s common and more realistic.  But measles is obscure so they don&#39;t see the benefits. </p>

I.e., if left to it&#39;s own devices, the user base of Reddit would never naturally arrive at those results. I&#39;m not saying that Reddit is a bastion of actually free thought, but that, actually, what we can assume is that the Reddit community wouldn&#39;t normally produce those results, which I guess is a kind of silver lining to this cloud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment highlights my point. The &quot;deniers&quot; are trolls to me, that don&#39;t represent everyone&#39;s opinion here. They are easy to dismiss because of how ridiculous their reasoning is (amongst several other groups here). </p>

<p>Nothing will ever be gain by debating with them. It&#39;s like they are designed to be ridiculous for the sake of ridiculing/discrediting an entire group here; which is usually seen in front page posts, where most of this sites manipulation would fall under. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been to r/conspiracy, but couldn&#39;t last more than 5 minutes due to how ridiculous it is&quot;
&quot;yes, they are just a bunch of Holocaust deniers. You can see because it&#39;s upvoted there&quot;
&quot;yup, it&#39;s a good think we are on a site that is immune to manipulation. Yup no evidence of manipulation here.&quot;</p>

<p>Usualy how it goes. Never a thought that it&#39;s a discrediting tactic; which makes it even more suspicious. </p>

<p>Be honest -- you have no idea what the reasoning is. You&#39;re just reacting without thinking or analyzing <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/articles">the skeptical arguments</a> -- because you&#39;re easily influenced by a hostile crowd and want normal redditor idiots to approve of you.

    <div class="md"><p>well some just say that the claim has been exaggerated 2-4 million instead of 6. but have you ever wondered why other similar mass killings of the same time period are almost completely ignored, while you can know Literally everything facet of the holocaust. There are movies, books, documentaries etc etc but can you name one person who knows anything about the soviet genocide? How about the Armenian genocide that happened literally at the same time. In fact the American&#39;s killed about 4 million germans After the war ended. Kurt Vonnegut wrote about it. This is why, Israel uses the holocaust to justify their actions against the Palestinians, if the masses forget about the atrocities that happened to the jews they might be more prone to dissent from support of their terrorist state.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s not about respect, it&#39;s about knowledge. WW1 and WW2 were such integral parts of our history that <em>not</em> to mention them would leave massive gaps in the timeline. The results of those wars are still being felt today, and so why we got involved (and what caused it) are simply being discussed in the classroom.</p>

<p>Russian, Chinese, and Rwandan genocides are not. It&#39;s not about respect, it&#39;s about US history.</p>

<p>If I may interject -- for some reason the guy you&#39;re talking with thinks that German deaths <em>after</em> WWII were from &quot;bombing&quot;. This is pretty silly. Rather, it was starvation (of civilians and POWs) and &quot;revenge killings&quot; (i.e. unpunished murder-theft sprees) on the geographical fringes of Germany and in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>James Bacque&#39;s two books, &#39;Crimes and Mercies&#39; and &#39;Other Losses&#39; are a good starting point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Germans were provoked into responding, and it took them over 6 months to do so -- the British started the bombing of civilian targets, as soon as Churchill got into office. They had the airforce to do so, as well -- larger strategic bombers -- whereas the Germans mostly had an airforce of smaller tactical support bombers.</p>

<p>There is an enormous asymmetry in civilian losses from intentional bombing in WWII, and it&#39;s in slightly bad taste that anyone would ever try to justify the mass murder of German civilians by referring to &#39;The Blitz&#39;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most striking similarity, at least as far as I can tell, is that in both cases, the evidence provided by the &quot;mainstream narrative proponents&quot; to the &quot;denialists&quot; was not strong enough to convince them scientifically, so the officialists sued for the price money in front of court, where &quot;the truth&quot; was determined to be the &quot;mainstream narrative&quot;, on grounds of self-evidence according to Californian law in one case, and the Ravensburg one seems to have been decided according to an expert witnesses&#39; testimony (and Lanka announced to appeal the ruling).</p>

<p>Again, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but the holocaust one was about evidence of gassings, and the title was misleading: there was no &quot;definitive proof&quot; brought forward but an autobiography and the photos and newspaper articles it contained. And Bardens did not isolate a measles virus and show it under a microscope - he collected scientific papers and had mainstream science expert witnesses (foremost Prof. Andreas Podbielski) testify in his favor. I could find no news source, be it German or foreign, specifiying <em>which</em> papers and <em>what</em> evidence Bardens offered, it&#39;s all just gleeful happiness that the court ruled against Lanka. Paradoxically, the best source was <a href="http://blog.gwup.net/2015/03/12/masern-prozess-bardens-gewinnt-lanka-muss-zahlen/">GWUP</a>:</p>

<p>Podbielski admitted that the groundbreaking work by Enders/Peebles suffered from methodolical errors, because the experiments were never verified. So Lankas lawyer asked if that has been done in the meantime - Podbielski just said &quot;why would they?&quot;; because 10.000 papers were peer-reviewed and published since based on Enders/Peebles, any inaccuracies would have been uncovered; therefor, the Enders/Peebles paper from 1954 does not need to be tested anymore. WTF? And of course Lanka <a href="http://www.gesundheitlicheaufklaerung.de/masern-virus-prozess-wer-recht-hat-hat-immer-recht">stressed</a> that Podbielski claimed that there can be no <em>proof</em> in biology and medicine, as there is in physics and mathematics - only <em>evidence</em>.</p>

<p>Another thing in dispute seems to be the existence of ribosomes, according to Lanka admitted by the Robert-Koch institute, but denied by Podbielski, ruled to be merely an &quot;unknown property&quot; of viruses, not evidence against their existence. </p>

<p>All in all, in both cases, OP never delivered. A court ruled, but was scientific certainty achieved, irrefutable proof offered? No.</p>

<p>//edit: added Lankas source</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No prob. This sent me on a little more research...</p>

<p>It seems Lanka is inspired by &gt;70 yr old Hamer (of whom I read one book once), the inventor of the &quot;New Germanic Medicine&quot;, but based on his own research with algae viruses. They once were on the same side, but now they have some beef about different philosophical/political approaches. Hamer again is an interesting guy, he maintains that what we call &quot;viruses&quot; are simply inter-cellular vesicules to transport genetic information from cell to cell and that AIDS and cancer are caused by psychological trauma, provable in brain CT as so-called &quot;Hamer hearths&quot;. The other claim Hamer frequently makes is that da joos worldwide already use his approach in healing cancer and other &quot;infection&quot;-related illnesses, but don&#39;t want it called New Germanic Medicine, and therefor threw him into <del>jail</del> a french gulag for scientific fraud and forced him into scandinavian exile to bring him to give up the copyright - and now Hamer suspects Lanka is in league with them to call it &quot;New Medicine&quot; only and that the Ravensburg process is merely smoke and mirrors. It&#39;s one giant clusterfuck, but at the core of the whole thing is the scientific fact that up to today, nobody ever has isolated a &quot;virus&quot; and proved it is what infects a host, and Landgericht Ravensburg simply ruled that it is not necessary, because if that were true, someone would have noticed. </p>

<p>For the holocaust denial one, they never actually offered proof that anyone was gassed...only picture of an incinerator (which we all know could not have possibly cremated enough bodies) and a picture of piled up shoes.</p>

<p>The court ruled....doesn&#39;t mean jack shit. Courts can rule anything...</p>

<p>And the second one...they use an obviously mentally ill person as a strawman for the anti vaccine movement....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The court awarded him money for &quot;emotional distress&quot; and simply took &quot;judicial notice&quot; of the gassings -- this is a legal principle usually applied to things like the boiling point of water, that don&#39;t need to be argued with evidence. This is exactly what happened from the very beginning, at Nuremberg, where a single Soviet affidavit sufficed to prove that 4m (!) had been gassed at Auschwitz. No forensic investigation was undertaken or required. All &quot;trials&quot; after Nuremberg also took judicial notice of this historically and technically unprecedented crime. The gassings have never been proven in a court, and given the lack of direct evidence that exists, never will be.</p>

Also some are deliberately paid!
