       Google 'kitchenware revolution'. Almost all media coverage was outside of the US.
In short, the people of Iceland peacefully overthrew the government and instated an entirely new body of politicians, and also began writing a new constitution. It began in 2008 after a national economic crash due to banking fraud very similar to what happened in the US.

       Not to the world's economy,
       <em>
        moron yourself
       </em>
       , but to Iceland's economy. The banking sector in Iceland had swelled disproportionately  and by some measures outgrew the rest of the economy. And the government still managed to jail the CEOs and take over many of the private banks. The result was a short period of contraction and then period of rapid recovery, which is how any decent government can solve a financial crisis if it wants to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US government didn't coddle American banks because the politicians in charge cry at night thinking about how their actions might negatively affect the world economy. They coddled them because they sleep in the same beds and dine at the same restaurants and golf at the same country clubs.

       Yes, they were and are. But that's an extra incentive to fix them once and for all instead of letting the problems fester and spread. The world economy didn't immediately go into recession after Wall Street crashed in 2008. It took a couple years to really hit Europe and Asia. The trouble is that they've stayed down since, with little recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point is that those who made the decisions about the banks in 2008-2009 weren't concerned about the world. Letting your biggest financial institutions run on fraud without punishment isn't preserving stability, it's creating enormous risks down the road and rewarding criminal behavior. The market can't run without trust and fair rules.

       I didn't saw that either, but acting smug and superior, because a tiny comparative country was able to take different actions during the worse of the recession, and wondering why other countries can't just all cookie cutter it the same way.

       The reason there was a media blackout (for all intents and purposes) in the U.S is because our government prefers to bail them out with taxpayer money. "Too big to fail."  It's a matter of privatization of profit and socializing the losses. It's apparent who really runs the U.S. Government.

       The blackout was because our ruling elite don't want us to know just how easy it is to recover economically with uncorrupt (yeah, it's not a real word, but it gets my point across) politicians and bankers in control.

       Well! this is quite some time ago and the same goverment that was overthrown is back in charge again. Also I may add that we were in so much debt that no other then the IMF took partly control of our money here. This looks like "Fuck you NWO" to you guys, but is faaaaar from it.

       Sure... It was the Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn) that was in control until the "Kitchenware Revolution". There was left wing party that got elected after that. But during the election of 2013 they gained again more seats at the parliamentary.

       not 25 common people... 2 of the Left wing oppositions partys took control. And about the constitution... we made really few changes. Mainly about big issues being turned to a national vote.

       That the people revolted with at least some success
       <em>
        is

       indeed impressive.  What opalextra said above and what their response was to you right here is quite a bit tempering, however.

       Proponents of Communism often use the excuse that "it was never given the right conditions". Yet can never explain why the capitalist system that replaced it succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, it's a paper theory, it doesn't work in reality (not yet anyway). Anyway, it requires very heavy state control and propaganda, something I thought conspiracy theorists were adverse to.

       Most countries share similar systems, yet have arrived upon them independently, and by the same trial and error. It's nothing to do with control, its to do with development. State control of the means of production and collectivization just didn't work very well, everyone just ended up poorer, so most countries switched to better systems and methods

       All instances of communism were implemented in countries with a rapidly growing or bad economy because it was made to look good by politicians. In current historical reality, all communism attempts have failed due to three reasons. Political greed, unstable economy, and size of nation causing an uneven distribution of effort per point of effort given.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypothetically, a country could adapt communism if they could base income off of effort/ output, which would require a heavy infrastructure that would have to have near perfect judgement of work per person. This would give society a reason to put effort into work, making less slackers. The country would also have to be resource rich and able to import and export based on the needs of the people. Finally the country would need a rapidly moving political system with a relatively well informed voting population so that those serving in office would not be able to affect society in ways that would help them specifically(increase wage for senate, etc) and the best people could be placed in government as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget that the economy can't grow rapidly or the wealth distribution could be skewed based on which business is more important. And also that the more people, the harder to distribute wealth. Also pay scale has to change with the profession(reason for education and hit peak jobs, etc) and all prices be stabilized across the nation, or pay scale change from location to location to avoid rural vs urban prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Communism is almost undoable in this day and age. Maybe at the point where infrastructure is so high that not everyone needs to have a job for a productive society would be the tipping point where communism beats socialism and capitalism, but perhaps not. I cannot say.

       You're reading directly from academic works,there interest is in maintain status quo by not telling the whole story. No change of system will work while a dominate power is in effect around the world and yes it is control, control over populations to maintain the dominate system called capitalism. We're are going in circles here as you can see. Wake up from that dream world

       It's not a James Bond film. Capitalism is just an economic system, the private ownership of the means of production. You set up a lemonade stand - that's capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       However if the government collectively controls all the lemonade stands in the country - that's essentially Communism
      </p>
      <p>
       The latter has been shown not to work so well.. because we thrive best in competition. Simple human nature.

       Perhaps one day, Communism will work, but so far it hasn't.

       My great grandparents were born peasants under Communism. They lived to a ripe old age their own parents never got to. Their children became artists and scientists. Some of them got repressed for political and other nonsense reasons, yes, and we condemn that, but that doesn't erase the progress brought by Communist governments the way your post tries to do.

       ? Capitalisms feudalists murdered a hundred million peasants.  Every damn thing the anti-racists did they did out of spite at anything that threatened their fantasies of replacing medieval peasantry with a new medieval caste slavery (workers etc). Your great grandparents were just animals.

       It's a completely mainstream, accepted idea, at least outside of the US, that there has never been an example of a proper communist society yet. If you look at Marx's ideas about the stages of economic/social development it's pretty clear that the soviet union only got to the socialism / workers revolution phase, but never true communism, which would be the functioning end goal.

       Outside of the US it is generally accepted that communism has never succeeded, it's only really communists in wealthy countries who believe that it either is brilliant but has never happened or that it worked well and it is all just a massive coverup.

       It's not that I'm lazy at all.  It's quite obvious that it's not hard to google.  Do you really think that people on reddit are so new to the internet that they don't know how to google?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about you use that brain and think a little deeper.

      <p>
       I'll help you out - He's trying to inform us about something that happened years ago and at the same time he's also condemning the US media for not covering this story.  He provides zero links to support his claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can cause numerous issues with people reading contradictory sites/articles.  You should read the comments in this thread and you'll see that the story is not nearly as cut and dried as the OP makes it sound in his post.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT'S what's annoying as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...next time you feel the urge to jump on someone - pause and think deeper.  You don't win any internet points for being a jerk.

       There's a line between being informed and being paranoid, if you try to limit how people express information to a point where their afraid to do it, your hardly different from what your where trying to distance yourself from in the first place.

       Well, it wasn't a revolution, so that shouldn't have even been in the title. I'm not trying to limit people spreading information, but from spreading MISinformation. Maybe something like "The people of Iceland replaced disgraced politicians in the next election cycle so now they hold no power?" A revolution is where a regime is REPLACED, not altered.

       Revolution - "a forcible overthrow of a government or social order, in favour of a new system."
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that is exactly what happened here, it's hard to not call it a revolution. It's even known as the Kitchenware/Pots and Pans Revolution - indicating that while it may not be the type of revolution that we might all envisage, it was definitely still one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, calling the OP out for a "sensationalist title" when it is referred to as a revolution literally everywhere is like nonsensical at the very least.

       It was not a revolution. There were some protests and the parliament decided to have an election early. There were no changes to the constitution or anything like that.

       Literally 2% of the population were involved involved in the protests that democratically-overthrew the government. Almost 3% of the adult working population.  the equivalent number in the US is 9 million.  I wonder if 9 million in DC can accomplish anything so revolutionary?

       No, what I'm saying is that when profits are threatened the billionaires pay their employees, aka Congress, to change the system so it stays in their favor. Maybe you'd like to paint a more complete plan since you seem to believe in one. Knock yourself out.

       What I'm saying is, if you're not taking your time to make &amp; communicate plans — then what are you even bothering to do?  We have very limited time and energy in life, and it's made more thin by comparison to people that have these resources.  Don't waste your time restating the problem; propose solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe in solutions, then what are you doing here?  Nihilism?  Why don't you drop off grid, stop paying taxes and other involvement in the system?

       It's not so much a conspiracy as a cover up. Western governments don't want people to see that this can actually happen. By government I mean corrupt politicians,  lobbyists and special interest groups.

       That's true in a sense, but in all reality those news sources as well as the nightly news, are becoming irrelevant very quickly.

       Iceland is a very small country which can easily be erased from msm. If something like that happens in another major european country, I foresee fun times, and chances are moderately high that greece could be one such country. Time will tell.

       There's a line between being informed and being paranoid, if you try to limit how people express information to a point where their afraid to do it, your hardly different from what your where trying to distance yourself from in the first place.

       They're still breaking it systemically, just paying to prevent anything from going to trial, e.g.

        Look this is a vicious circle. We have a very entrenched system of control all over the world that makes it very difficult to implement new ways of creating a society to the point that most movements become compromised by these control mechanisms.

       Most countries share similar systems, yet have arrived upon them independently, and by the same trial and error. It's nothing to do with control, its to do with development. State control of the means of production and collectivization just didn't work very well, everyone just ended up poorer, so most countries switched to better systems and methods
