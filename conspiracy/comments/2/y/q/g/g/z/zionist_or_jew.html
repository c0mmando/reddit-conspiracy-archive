    <div class="md"><p>The man in the video makes the same point I have made here repeatedly. When speaking about the Jews, I use the word &quot;Jew&quot; because it is the most accurate term, despite the fact that it is politically incorrect, and that SJWs are constantly attempting to make those of us who use the term &quot;Jew&quot; switch it to &quot;Zionist&quot;.</p>

<p>You will notice that Jews and white liberals have no trouble at all talking about the evils of &quot;white America&quot; or the historical crimes of &quot;white Christians&quot;. Were all whites involved in the slave trade 200 years ago in Georgia? All white Christians? No, of course not.</p>

<p>The attempt to prohibit the term &quot;Jew&quot; and replace it with the narrower term &quot;Zionist&quot; is a ploy. It is a slippery slope that Jews very much want us all to slide down. &quot;You can&#39;t talk about Jews when you mean Zionists,&quot; they say. Fine, we&#39;ll talk about Zionist Jews. &quot;You can&#39;t talk about Zionist Jews when you mean Israeli Zionist Jews.&quot; Fine, we&#39;ll talk about Israeli Zionist Jews. &quot;You can&#39;t talk about Israeli Zionist Jews when the crimes are being committed by the leaders of Israel.&quot; Fine, we&#39;ll talk about the leaders of Israel. &quot;You can&#39;t talk about all the leaders of Israel, some of whom are not hard-line Zionists and don&#39;t agree with current Israeli policy.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you see how this works? We have no trouble talking about Catholics as a group, or the Irish, or Mexicans, or women, or men ... yet the cultural Marxists who are trying to control what words we use don&#39;t want us talking about Jews as a group, even when &quot;Jew&quot; is the most accurate term for us to use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s the cycle of euphemism. You can&#39;t win that game, because they don&#39;t actually care about fine distinctions between &quot;Jew&quot; &quot;secular Jew&quot; &quot;Zionist&quot; &quot;Israeli&quot; etc.</p>

<p>As soon as you use one term, they will make that &quot;politically incorrect&quot; and call you a &quot;racist&quot; or an &quot;anti-semite&quot; for using it. The actual purpose is to censor any criticism of the Holy People under any name.</p>

<p>We used to use the term &quot;Negro&quot; - a perfectly good word with no bad connotations. But then that became &quot;politically incorrect&quot; and we had to use the term &quot;Black.&quot; But then that went out, then you had to use the term &quot;Afro-American.&quot; But that was bad, so now it is &quot;African American.&quot; What&#39;s next, &quot;Nubian-Earther?&quot;</p>

<p>That is the entire point of the euphemism cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if what I said above here is correct, then it would seem that Zionist is more of a political designation than a religious one.  This isn&#39;t to say that Zionism doesn&#39;t use the bible as a huge foundation for the atrocities it&#39;s responsible for, but there is enough bleed over and cross over atheistic Zionism, etc in the ranks of Israel and its supporters that I don&#39;t think Zionism can be said to be strictly or exclusively a religious designation.</p>

<p>&quot;Ignorance&quot; means you don&#39;t know something. Usually, someone becomes &quot;racist&quot; against some specific group due to <em>actually knowing and living around them</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that more than a handful of Ashkenazis are actually religious.</p>

<p>Racists paint all people of a certain type with one brush - which is <em>entirely</em> ignorant of how HUMANS as a whole are regardless of whether the ignorant racist in question happened to grow up around a specific group that had some &quot;general characteristics&quot; which the racist ended up (ignorantly) applying across the board.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t.  That&#39;s...kind of the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do they even call themselves a &quot;Jew?&quot; Why not just be another white person?</p>

<p>That&#39;s what <em>I</em> would personally ask as well, but they themselves prefer to be looked upon and referred to in that manner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not that more than a handful of Ashkenazis are actually religious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this issue goes beyond simply religious doctrine alone, however.  Many who do not call themselves &quot;religious Jews&quot; still very much comport themselves in accordance with many of the tenets of the religion nonetheless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, why the &quot;Jew&quot; identity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would imagine that this is something for a Jew to answer and not I, but it seems to me that there is an insular pride (as is the case with almost every group) wherein Jews simply WANT to be identified as such.  <em>That&#39;s</em> why.  And I don&#39;t fault them or anyone with wanting to be identified in a specific manner.  Sure.  Fine.  Go ahead.  More power to them.  I draw the line, however, where that identity also happens to involve a feeling of racist superiority over any other person.</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p>Racists paint all people of a certain type with one brush - which is entirely ignorant of how HUMANS as a whole are regardless of whether the ignorant racist in question happened to grow up around a specific group that had some &quot;general characteristics&quot; which the racist ended up (ignorantly) applying across the board.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is hilarious to see white people desperately try to distance themselves from that slur, &quot;racist.&quot; Let me give you a hint - are you white? If so, then you are &quot;racist&quot; no matter what you do or say. You could marry a Black woman, and you&#39;d still be a &quot;racist.&quot; Give up, even white babies are &quot;racist.&quot;</p>

<p>The fact of that matter is, it&#39;s the white people claiming so hard to be &quot;not racist&quot; that are in fact ignorant of what the &quot;anti-racist&quot; movement actually is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but they themselves prefer to be looked upon and referred to in that manner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, because they are Zionists. That&#39;s the point.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it funny how some are so defensive about the Jewish Identity, and will defend the right of Jews to their own identity.</p>

<p>Yet if I identify as &quot;White&quot; - I get called an &quot;ignorant racist.&quot;</p>

<p>Funny, that.</p>
