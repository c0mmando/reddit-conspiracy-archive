       I rail against racism of all types, and some in this subreddit definitely know this, as I have called various individuals out very directly on their ignorance and racism.  At the end of the day, I am against
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       that disparages any individual or group of people based upon their race or color of their skin, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've have drawn the distinction between “Zionist” and “Jew” for some time now - understanding that although
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       Zionists
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       Jewish, it still does not necessarily apply to
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I just saw
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S10Aotp_tvo#t=16m08s">
        <strong>
         this
        </strong>
       </a>
       right now, and have to admit that everything that is being said on this topic is very, very valid still.

       The man in the video makes the same point I have made here repeatedly. When speaking about the Jews, I use the word "Jew" because it is the most accurate term, despite the fact that it is politically incorrect, and that SJWs are constantly attempting to make those of us who use the term "Jew" switch it to "Zionist".
      </p>
      <p>
       You will notice that Jews and white liberals have no trouble at all talking about the evils of "white America" or the historical crimes of "white Christians". Were all whites involved in the slave trade 200 years ago in Georgia? All white Christians? No, of course not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attempt to prohibit the term "Jew" and replace it with the narrower term "Zionist" is a ploy. It is a slippery slope that Jews very much want us all to slide down. "You can't talk about Jews when you mean Zionists," they say. Fine, we'll talk about Zionist Jews. "You can't talk about Zionist Jews when you mean Israeli Zionist Jews." Fine, we'll talk about Israeli Zionist Jews. "You can't talk about Israeli Zionist Jews when the crimes are being committed by the leaders of Israel." Fine, we'll talk about the leaders of Israel. "You can't talk about all the leaders of Israel, some of whom are not hard-line Zionists and don't agree with current Israeli policy."
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see how this works? We have no trouble talking about Catholics as a group, or the Irish, or Mexicans, or women, or men ... yet the cultural Marxists who are trying to control what words we use don't want us talking about Jews as a group, even when "Jew" is the most accurate term for us to use.

       Yes, it's the cycle of euphemism. You can't win that game, because they don't actually care about fine distinctions between "Jew" "secular Jew" "Zionist" "Israeli" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as you use one term, they will make that "politically incorrect" and call you a "racist" or an "anti-semite" for using it. The actual purpose is to censor any criticism of the Holy People under any name.
      </p>
      <p>
       We used to use the term "Negro" - a perfectly good word with no bad connotations. But then that became "politically incorrect" and we had to use the term "Black." But then that went out, then you had to use the term "Afro-American." But that was bad, so now it is "African American." What's next, "Nubian-Earther?"
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the entire point of the euphemism cycle.

       Zionist is a religious designation, Jew an ethnic one. A secular or atheist jew isn't a zionist because, it is assumed, he doesn't subscribe to the Judaic eschatology.

       I thought that a Zionist is one that supports the apartheid state of Israel - Jew or not.  That alone isn't necessarily religious per se.  As such, it doesn't matter if they're atheist or not.

       Well, if what I said above here is correct, then it would seem that Zionist is more of a political designation than a religious one.  This isn't to say that Zionism doesn't use the bible as a huge foundation for the atrocities it's responsible for, but there is enough bleed over and cross over atheistic Zionism, etc in the ranks of Israel and its supporters that I don't think Zionism can be said to be strictly or exclusively a religious designation.

       How do you suppose they justify their 'atrocities'? Because whatever they do is done in the name of god in fulfilling the prophecy in the bible. God will restore the House of David and the Temple of Jerusalem (Zion).
      </p>
      <p>
       A secular Israeli can be supportive of the actions of his country's government without being a Zionist. That's just being an Israeli. The indoctrination and propaganda they have endured is second to none in modern times, I'm sure.

       I think this issue goes beyond simply religious doctrine alone, however.  Many who do not call themselves "religious Jews" still very much comport themselves in accordance with many of the tenets of the religion nonetheless.

       I would imagine that this is something for a Jew to answer and not I, but it seems to me that there is an insular pride (as is the case with almost every group) wherein Jews simply WANT to be identified as such.
       <em>
        That's
       </em>
       why.  And I don't fault them or anyone with wanting to be identified in a specific manner.  Sure.  Fine.  Go ahead.  More power to them.  I draw the line, however, where that identity also happens to involve a feeling of racist superiority over any other person.

        them

       under the bus just because they're Jews.  If there are a few Jews that are AGAINST Zionism, then I'm willing to not lump them in with all the Jews and Zionists that

       racists.

       Yet I'm somehow some "white guilt" feeling "marxist warrior" or whatever the fuck it was you said because I'm not willing to say "Down with all fucking Jews!"?

       What he is talking about in the lines you quoted is that, in the minds of the SJWs, the far-left liberals, the academic Jews, and blacks, all whites are by definition racists, because they are white.
