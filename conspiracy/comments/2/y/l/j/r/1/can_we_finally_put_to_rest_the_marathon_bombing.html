       This video clearly shows the two Brothers arriving with backpacks and leaving without them. It's as clear as day. Please watch the whole video before commenting.

       I like conspiracies, and I agree with a whole bunch of them. I believe in aliens, sacred geometry, and I'm definitely open minded about how this planet came together. I also think that the government is about as corrupt as can be. I hate Monsanto, and I think the whole planet is run by bankers who are part of a secret society. So don't ridicule me as some sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, from someone who was at the RedSox game that day and was around all this chaos, I find it offensive when people who have never been to Boston tell me that it never happened. Or that they were not responsible for it, or that the government did it so they could practice martial law.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was there, it did happen. As a community Boston came together. We looked towards our local government to find these pricks, and they did. IMO we have some of the best police in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no doubt in my mind that the Tsarnaev Brothers at least psychically committed this crime. Whether or not they were brainwashed, or blackmailed into this. That can be debated if need be.

       Sir, you do realize that they were conducting unlawful searches of people vehicles/properties right? Would you deny a locked and loaded swat force in full tactical armor from entering your home? I'm willing to bet from your responses that you wouldn't. The footage/images don't lie. It's not difficult to do a google search and witness how unconstitutional these searches were. "There was no pointing of guns" is your opinion and far from fact.

       no one kicked down doors, yes guns were pointed at houses covering the squad in case someone was to attack. It's how they are trained.

       Well your comment didn't differentiate between the two.  It was your claim that no guns were pointed by police that I took issue with since there are literally dozens of pictures from that day showing otherwise.

       They treat it like a real life situation as if someone may shoot back at them. If you were them you would do the same.

       Looking through your past posts has painted a pretty clear picture about how angry you are at the world. You sir are no hippy. Hippy basher maybe. You are a big ass loving, yet fat shaming, racist, gay bashing, insecure ball of hate. Jesus man, you're like a kid going through puberty. Woosaaa.

       I know for a fact you don't live in MA because it's not a " free" state, you live no where near the northeast.  You drive a v8 pickup with a nobama sticker, play too much COD, and judging by the frequency of posts, are "in between" jobs. Am I close?

       This is the last reply you will get from me. I'm pretty sure you yell at people over the internet for a living. We are truthers at the opposite side of the spectrum.

       Anyhoo, I'm sorry photographic evidence proving you are at best delusional and brainwashed, at worst a manipulative liar pushing an agenda with your blatantly false nonsensical version of events made you sore, but there's no need to pull out THE BIG GUNS and insult my username, brah.

I know for a fact you don't live in MA because it's not a " free" state, you live no where near the northeast. You drive a v8 pickup with a nobama sticker, play too much COD, and judging by the frequency of posts, are "in between" jobs. Am I close?

       No they didn't, the owner of the boat found blood on the boat and tipped the cops off. So much for martial law and the cops kicking doors down. That was martial law practice, as Ram Rod Emannuel says "never let a crisis go to waste". They did not have to do what they did, but they pounced on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw that he put the bag down, but I didn't see if THAT bag exploded, I just saw an explosion. A device could've been planted there and he didn't know because maybe he thought he was apart of a drill. There was a drill going that day. Once they realized it wasn't a drill, and there was explosions. They high tailed it out, they were getting framed for it. Could be no?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to see the video feed after the fade to black. Why are so many videos fading to black these days. After the video fades to black it should show the evidence of damage. They need to release that, before I make up my mind. His demeanor is too casual about have a bomb on his back. One shoulder strap? You'd think he be little more "protective" of it.

       edit2: In the pictures that show his face, he is standing in front of the tree, yet the video always shows him behind the tree. What's up with that? So we have him standing there with his back turned, and they show us still images of him from the front in a different spot. What's up with that?

       Also, they didn't literally kick down doors either. You have no idea, you aren't from this area. It's easy to make assumptions when you are just watching this shit on TV. the only people who cared that they were searching houses where people like you watching from your basement. The people in the community did not give a damn. They just wanted these guys captured. We took care of our own business. That is why we wanted him to get prosecuted here and not have him locked up in Cuba.

       So you have no problem with them pointing automatic weapons at people as they stood inside their own homes, ordering them outside? Because they 'literally' didn't smash the doors off their hinges. Fuck you. This entire post of yours is bullshit. Especially with your beginning attempt at a claim of solidarity

       Ordering people out of their homes at gunpoint and the threat of violence is abusive. I don't know what sick fucking fantasy-land you live in but there is nothing "calm" about a stacked column of heavily armed and armored assholes coming to people's front porches, back yards, pressing against doors and windows, aiming automatic weapons at people filming, and barking orders at families inside their homes to comply or face the consequences. And to look to one's right and left and see the same thing happening to neighbors? Oh yes. So calm. Officer Friendly with a few benign questions, right? Must be so.

       They are and they aren't. A job of a conspiracy theorist is to act like a detective and question all angles. If something is off in your gut, you need to look at it. His demeanor is off to me, would you be carrying a backpack which they say had an (touchy too) explosive device in it like that? I wouldn't, that makes me question. The fact that they didn't show footage after the explosion also makes me question. Because then we could see the area of where he dropped his bag. If it was his bag, it wouldn't be there. But unfortunately for us, they didn't release the full clip. That's a little suspicious. I'm not saying nothing happened that day, I'm just questioning.

       He looked calm prior to the explosion, after the explosion he was too far away to see what he looked like. What are you talking about? Being framed comes in after finding out it was a setup way after the explosion and way out of camera site.

       You said in your first post that maybe he thought it was a drill and bailed once the explosion happened. Implying that the reason for him being calm is that he didn't know anybody was going to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       If framing him was apparently the plan from the beginning then it's directly linked to him looking calm in the theory you created. How are you having trouble keeping up with a theory you made up?

       No, what I said was that a device could have been planted that he didn't know about. He had a prop in his bag, (ie being calm) and careless with it. He dropped his bag (dud bomb), next to the real thing he didn't know about. He heard the first "explosion" got the cue to start walking away from the next "explosion". Later they find out, this shit was real and freaked the fuck out. That's my theory as I stated. Maybe I wasn't clear, my bad. Whether it's true or not, idk. I'd really like to see the video after it fades to black, that is where the "evidence" would be.

       Either way you are still putting forward a pretty complex theory with the main piece of evidence being that he was too calm.

       It's just a theory man, a mind exercise. I think something was off on that day, and I have a gut feeling these guys weren't the culprit, but the government could be behind it (ie. they were patsies). Just my opinion. They could be and if proven they are, I'd admit I was wrong all along. But something is off with the whole thing. Until then, I'm not buying the official story. They have lied to us too many times. Agree to disagree till more evidence comes our way?

       Great. The most crucial part, I'm telling you, is what happens after that fade to black. That will prove/disprove so much shit. Let's see if they release it.

       it doesnt matter how much evidence u uncover to the contrary, there will always be someone in here who refuses to believe it and will argue till they are blue in the face that it was a false flag operation and the goverment that staged it.

      <p>
       Absolutely nothing that happens in the world these days is down to genuine terrorism or nutters, it is always a conspiracy of some sort.

      <p>
       Really, if the world governments are really that corrupt and spend all their time cooking up fake bombings/school shootings/terror cells etc etc etc, then instead of coming on here an whinging about it, do something about it.

       Don't get me wrong, i don't see the world thru rose tinted spectacles, but most of the conspiracies that appear on this website (including this one) are paranoid bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't ask me to name them, cause i'm not interested in spending the next 2 years arguing with you about whichever conspiracy you believe was cooked up by Obama in his lunch break to justify send troops somewhere or funding some organization or other.

       The younger one was not old enough to be a CIA "asset."

       Whatever, at least you are admitting that they were involved. Which is more than most.

       I love how many times you got rekt in this thread, on this account, and your other account where you tried to submit the same bullshit.

       It gives me hope when I see there's still enough critical thinkers in this sub to call out your obvious bullshit.

       other account? Oh is this your conspiracy? I'm posting from multiple accounts?

      <p>
       You are crazy. I would not waste my time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video evidence is clear. You can choose to ignore it and make conclusions that are way more far fetched. Maybe they were brainwashed, but they definitely are responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only go off what people told me. Yes the photos show officers pointing guns at houses and windows. But that is what they are trained to do. It's not like they were pointing them at people who opened the doors and let them in without giving them grief. What my friends who live in the area told me is more valuable than the stories you make up in your head.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest mistake was posting this on a subreddit filled with people who no matter what think everything is a conspiracy. I'm all for some of the topics, and most the people here are reasonable. But some of you are just out of it. If one thing is proven wrong then you just change your approach and find another angle. I guess that it's good that someone questions everything, but we would come off ass better as a whole if some of us didn't go completely off the deep end. Stay within reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize no matter what I say someone will twist it around and present a completely different angle and attack. So this is it I'm done.  Have a blast.

       Yes, seems he was the one who planted the second bomb.
