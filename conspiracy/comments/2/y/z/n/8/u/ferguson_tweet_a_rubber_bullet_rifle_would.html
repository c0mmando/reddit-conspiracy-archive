<p>1st comment by &quot;Reformed Savage&quot;:</p>

<p><strong>A rubber bullet rifle would explain a lot. The sound. The accuracy. The miraculous recovery time. And of course the motive</strong>.</p>

<p>2nd comment by &quot;Reformed Savage&quot;:</p>

<p><strong>Shot in the face and released hours later? I wonder if the officer got shot in the face with a rubber bullet</strong>.</p>

<p>edit: another commentor states journos and witnesses say the shots were fired 125 yards away...here are some direct links to various comments:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This would be a very interesting case if they were in fact rubber bullets. If they find the culprit, can they charge attempted murder if the person used rubber bullets? I feel like they cannot without tacitly admitting that every time they shoot a rubber bullet at someone, they are trying not to subdue the person, but kill them.</p>

<p>What would a rubber bullet shooting be classified as? It really shouldn&#39;t be attempted murder or even assault with a deadly weapon, as the whole reason they are allowed for use by police is they are considered non-deadly force. Would it just be assaulting an officer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I interpreted the comments as leaning towards a SET UP in which shots were fired by authorities (or some provocateurs) in an attempt to frame the protestors in a bad light and cause public opinion to blame the movement. not sure if you are familiar with <a href="http://www.freedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/Black%20Liberation%20Disk/Black%20Power!/SugahData/Government/COINTELPRO.S.pdf">COINTELPRO</a>, but there was some crazy F&#39;ed up things in the 50&#39;s, 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s which J. Edgar Hoover (FBI) was in charge of. </p>

<p>as for the possible charges:  I would definitely think firing a rubber bullet at a person would be attempted murder--it could hit someone in the eye. </p>

<p>more charges would be added on if the attempt was on an officer. </p>

<p>even more charges if it was in front of a large crowd. </p>

<p>even more more charges if it was a situation involving race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would probably be assault with a deadly weapon technically speaking since it&#39;s a less-than-lethal projectile. they&#39;ve been used to subdue/break-up rioters in a non-lethal manner so I&#39;d like to see them argue their own logic. </p>

<p>The prosecutor would definitely push for attempted murder regardless of the type of bullet since the victims have badges and the police union would have their head if it was a lesser charge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think shooting a rubber bullet at anyone would be considered attempted murder.  Rubber bullets are not considered non-deadly.  They are considered &quot;less lethal&quot; meaning they are not as deadly as a real bullet but still have the potential to kill someone.  I am pretty sure they categorize all of their non-firearm weapons like that (Tazers, flash bangs, beanbag rounds, etc).  They do that to cover their asses because they know all of those things can kill people.</p>

<p>What the police admit when they shoot someone with a rubber bullet is that they tried to subdue the person with less lethal force but if they die... &quot;well, hey at least we tried&quot;.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to think- and I didn&#39;t at first- that this inside job scenario is a possibility. Why haven&#39;t they caught the shooter yet? There were tons of cops around, and they haven&#39;t idea who it is? Are they trying? Cops released in a few hours, one after being hit in the face.... The motive is certainly the for an inside job; it makes the cops the victims again and the protestors violent, even though all eyewitnesses say that the shooter wasn&#39;t amongst the protestors (of course he wasn&#39;t; if he was then protestors would have singled him out). But the police chief immediately said the shooter was &quot;embedded in those folks,&quot; which is a lie. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know, but there could be something shady here. Or possibly not. Let&#39;s see if they ever come up with a suspect.</p>
