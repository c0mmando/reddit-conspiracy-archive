       This would be a very interesting case if they were in fact rubber bullets. If they find the culprit, can they charge attempted murder if the person used rubber bullets? I feel like they cannot without tacitly admitting that every time they shoot a rubber bullet at someone, they are trying not to subdue the person, but kill them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would a rubber bullet shooting be classified as? It really shouldn't be attempted murder or even assault with a deadly weapon, as the whole reason they are allowed for use by police is they are considered non-deadly force. Would it just be assaulting an officer?

       I interpreted the comments as leaning towards a SET UP in which shots were fired by authorities (or some provocateurs) in an attempt to frame the protestors in a bad light and cause public opinion to blame the movement. not sure if you are familiar with

       , but there was some crazy F'ed up things in the 50's, 60's and 70's which J. Edgar Hoover (FBI) was in charge of.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the possible charges:  I would definitely think firing a rubber bullet at a person would be attempted murder--it could hit someone in the eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       more charges would be added on if the attempt was on an officer.
      </p>
      <p>
       even more charges if it was in front of a large crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       even more more charges if it was a situation involving race.

       It would probably be assault with a deadly weapon technically speaking since it's a less-than-lethal projectile. they've been used to subdue/break-up rioters in a non-lethal manner so I'd like to see them argue their own logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prosecutor would definitely push for attempted murder regardless of the type of bullet since the victims have badges and the police union would have their head if it was a lesser charge.

       I think shooting a rubber bullet at anyone would be considered attempted murder.  Rubber bullets are not considered non-deadly.  They are considered "less lethal" meaning they are not as deadly as a real bullet but still have the potential to kill someone.  I am pretty sure they categorize all of their non-firearm weapons like that (Tazers, flash bangs, beanbag rounds, etc).  They do that to cover their asses because they know all of those things can kill people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the police admit when they shoot someone with a rubber bullet is that they tried to subdue the person with less lethal force but if they die... "well, hey at least we tried".

       I'm starting to think- and I didn't at first- that this inside job scenario is a possibility. Why haven't they caught the shooter yet? There were tons of cops around, and they haven't idea who it is? Are they trying? Cops released in a few hours, one after being hit in the face.... The motive is certainly the for an inside job; it makes the cops the victims again and the protestors violent, even though all eyewitnesses say that the shooter wasn't amongst the protestors (of course he wasn't; if he was then protestors would have singled him out). But the police chief immediately said the shooter was "embedded in those folks," which is a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't know, but there could be something shady here. Or possibly not. Let's see if they ever come up with a suspect.
