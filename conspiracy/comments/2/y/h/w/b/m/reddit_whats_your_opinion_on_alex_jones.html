       Personally, I like his alternative view on things, even if I don't agree with some aspects.
      </p>

       I don't care for how ranty he gets sometimes, and wish he could be a bit more cool-headed.  It would get his point across better.

       He's a clown. He peddles hysteria and bullshit to get ratings. He won't touch anything actually controversial and has the effect mostly of discrediting any real stories he talks about.

       Take for example how when he jumped on Michelle Obama being transgendered rumors. Eventually he came back and apologized for it saying that he went too far. He gives people enough info to draw them in, but withholds enough to keep them loyal, wanting and waiting for more. It's through this tactic he gains popularity and acts like a clown to discredit himself and the conspiracy theorists so nobody takes them seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's actually a theory he's hired by the government to do this and the vast amount of merchandise he claims to sell is merely a cover to mask the source of his wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's even a theory that he's long dead comedian Bill Hicks but that's a little farfetched.

       Alex Jones is often used as a straw man by shills. If you question the official story, then shills accuse you of listening to Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       When this happens, challenge the shill by asking what they know about Alex Jones. Tell the shill that they either listen to Alex Jones and know what they are talking about, or they dont and dont...
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask the shill what they think of Alex Jones connection to Stratfor and Zionists, and if these connections are the basis of their "conspiracy theory" about Alex Jones being a disinformation shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then ask them why they listen to a known disinformation shill.

       I think like 6 years ago he actually spoke the truth about a subject:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpzo7p1ZlMg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpzo7p1ZlMg
       </a>
       . After that he shut up about it and continued the TPTB agenda as a "fringe alt/militant news" gatekeeper. Just like how Glenn Beck is a "faux libertarian/conservative" gatekeeper.

       This is why many say he is controlled opposition/disinformation. He was compromised. He has good journalists working for him, but the man himself and the company are gatekeepers. Sad really.

       With all media you have to take everything with a grain of salt. I'm not saying shut out infowars, they do have good pieces. Just get your info from as many sources as you can. Fox, Cnn, MSNBC, Al Jazeera, Press Tv, Haaretz, RT, literally everywhere. Unfortunately, we have to piece to together ourselves. That has always been the case. The more sources, the bigger the picture gets. Because each piece has a perspective and truth, just got to weave it together. As the Bohemian grove says "Weaving Spiders, Come Not Here" (TPTB reference, sorry), you must be that spider and weave it all together. They are counting on you to not "weave" it together.

       Gotta roll up them sleeves and pants and do it. Only way we can do it. Get our hands dirty, because journalism is dead. TPTB want that. They expect us to be lazy, we must be vigilant. My mind is like a sponge, I have no problem with it and I say "bring it the fuck on".

       You should, we should all get mad as hell, all people need to see this. Idk where you are from but the US is docile. I see shit going on in Europe, and our people scatter like rats at the first shot of a smoke grenade. Yet, we call them pussies? lol.... I watched a protest in Greece, they picked up a pepper shot, put it in a solvent to neutralize and threw it back. Land of the skeet home of the afraid.

       He's always selling something on fear,  his website sites itself as sources occasionally,  he yells and screams about documents that he  can't produce.  That's enough to at least question what he's all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try James Corbett's The Corbett report,  Greg Carlwood's The Higherside Chats, Red Ice radio, and No Agenda with Adam Curry and John C Dvorak. Corbett lays out very well researched and sourced material,  as does No Agenda (who focus more on media).  Carlwood has all of the fringe stuff,  and is open to considering any angle,  having some people on he doesn't agree with to show you another side. Red Ice radio is no nonsense,  and tackles really touchy subjects (Holocaust).  Listen to all of these,  Alex Jones,  anything you can.  Make your OWN decisions and conclusions,  that's what it's really all about.  Don't let people piss on your head and tell you it's raining

       He's controlled opposition. He tells us some truth, but he associates that truth with a ranting red face guy hawking all sorts of fear porn and survival gear. So, then if you tell the same truth to somebody who's not awake, they'll associate you with a ranting red face guy and that truth will be dismissed on an emotional basis.

       Alex Jones is controlled opposition, for the reasons already given. So you have to look at that group that runs together and sus out their roles, if any. Sam Harris is a "science" and "secular" guy who steers us away from spirituality and spreads the official narrative in "science" area. Then Joe Rogan gives him a microphone to the public on his top 3 podcast. Joe Rogan is a modern day Renaissance Man, seems like a really good guy and quite a role model for young men. His association with Alex Jones gives him an air of benevolence, if slight looniness. The result is that you won't associate Alex Jones with Zionists; he's one of your buddies! Then when you tell your friends about something Alex Jones told you, they will dismiss it emotionally.

       I agree with you on Alex Jones. Overall, he is a bit of a kook and a brief listening lends one to believe he's there for profit. It gets old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sam Harris is just what you said, "science" and "secular", and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that at all. I like him because he steers us away from spirituality because there is no need for that, and overall it doesn't really exist. God isn't real, in my opinion, so his opinion is great. He's a hippie who get a degree in philosophy, dropped from school to go do acid in India, then came back to get a degree in neuroscience. He runs a company with his wife. There's nothing weird or wrong there. You can disagree with his opinions, but that doesn't make him "controlled opposition", because his views are important in a world where criticizing religion and "spirituality"(whatever that means) is becoming taboo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't really agree with your assessment of Joe, either. He's just a stoner, stand-up comedian who happens to be the voice of a very, very popular sport. His podcast popularity has nothing to do with Alex Jones, and honestly, the dude doesn't really "associate" with him at all. He doesn't talk about him on the show. Joe also doesn't push any Zionist agenda at all, so the attempt to associate him with Alex and whatever association he might have, is weird and nonexistent. Joe is an atheist(or agnostic) himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one cares what Alex Jones has to say, overall.

       I disagree. Maybe they are human, simply victims of their emotions. But you have no evidence that proves they have ulterior motives. Alex, and Joe I do believe are friends and run in the same circles. I would never have thought Graham, and I don't see his connection. But Bill hicks was also a part of the circle, I believe him and Alex were friends. I grew up watching Alex's six hour documentaries, where he would take road trips and confront real people. And I grew up on Bill Hicks comedy. As much as I disagree with much of Alexs platform, and delivery nowadays it doesn't take away from how much of a difference he has made in peoples lives like mine. And it hasn't been easy growing old while being aware of the ideals these men promote, but I'm thankful for the perspective. And I know they are like me, mostly operating from the gut, they just have influence. I don't like Rogan, never have. But I give him much credit as anyone else, and the same I expect. And with all the schills out there spouting disinfo, I would need solid evidence to believe these men are knowingly spreading lies.

       It's just weird that the original poster suggested those people were in "that group", or that they have any real association with one another. Like I said, that person chose specific people they don't like, and then attributed a negative title to them
       <em>
        just because
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The only vague connection is a lot of them have been one Joe's show, but that's because it's one of the biggest podcasts out there. That's not really weird, and there's no "ultimate agenda" being pushed by any of the dudes.

       The issue I have is people smearing Harris and Tyson, especially when they(the OP of this thread chain) have nothing real to speak on.

       Sam Harris is a high science guy who thinks 2 planes can knock down 3 towers. So people believe that smart people don't question the official 9/11 narrative. He also spreads anti-Islamic propaganda. He is controlled, for sure.
      </p>

       Joe has Alex Jones on the show all the time and has been friends with him for years, or at least that's what he indicates on JRE.

       Sam is a "high science" guy because he is a scientist. He actually doesn't spread any anti-Islamic propaganda, at all. He only speaks on facts and statistics, and you saying otherwise is an odd attempt to smear him. He talks about a belief system - Islam, and the negatives within the belief. That's an objective point, and any amount of research lends to that. It's not anti-anything to talk about the negatives within anything, especially a belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joe has
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of people on his show, especially people he disagrees with. I don't think having Alex on his show really lends to him believing or pushing that guys agenda.

       A tool. I never believed everything he claimed but when he started with the Bill Hicks bullshit i lost all respect for him. Attention seeker who obviously has no respect for either the late Bill Hicks, his family or himself. It more and more comes across like he is desperate for attention. Bohemia grove and Kony were good points for him, as was the unauthorized nuke movement a couple of years ago but other than that he has only served to damage any truth movement  and make himself look like a ranting idiot.

       The more and more I've watched him the more it comes across as counter productive, i followed Bill Hicks all of his life and found it beyond insulting when he played along with the conspiracy that he was Hicks. It was grossly disrespectful and he seemed to love it. I used to have a lot more respect for Alex Jones than i do now anyway, but i would agree that sometimes he has relevant and important stories and information.

       Just a shame that he seems to have mastered the art of making a tit out of himself.

       I don't think he played along with the conspiracy of him being Bill Hicks. I saw his satirical totally sarcastic video parody he made claiming it was true but anyone can see it was humor and not meant to be taken seriously. I'm a huge fan of Hicks and I think it's ridiculous people on the internet claiming it's real, and Alex is making fun of those crazy people online. I don't think it's disrespect towards Hicks at all. It's satire.

       I enjoy his guests, interviews, and when he sends reporters out to the scene. I don't care for the AJ personality but he has some legit guests on his show and their on-location reporting is better than any local/national mainstream news and it's on par with independent networks like AlJazeera

       What Really Happened with Mike Rivero is a pretty good show, he seems like a good bloke too, worth a listen if you want a calmer perspective.

       for a whole bunch of different hosts, some of them are boring but quite a few are good and interesting to listen to. KBS, Popeye, Joe Joseph, Aaron Dykes &amp; Melissa Melton (ex Infowars employees) are some of the better shows.

       I listened to his podcast for a couple months a couple years ago. Always up to date like the new feed on this sub, but he would get super aggressive on his rants and shoot off on tangents too often. Then he'd bring it down, apologizing because he was so concerned, then shoot off again. It's a rollercoaster but if you're level headed you can follow the subjects. Plus all the plugs and the ads got annoying. The people that sub in when he's gone follow the same strategy too and that's when I stopped, just a personality like Rush Limbaugh or Bill O'Reily .

       That he doesn't talk about aliens shows me something about him? Especially when like it's hard to ignore.

       He mentions occasionally that he has some wild stories, but won't talk about them on air, as he doesn't want to focus on that sort of thing, as it may discredit him.

       He is a shill. He Makes money peddling health foods, male vitality junk, weight loss supplements, all of which he claims to consume. Here is a conspiracy for you: if Alex Jones takes all of these health and weight loss supplements, why is he still fat after all these years? I stopped listening to his half truths a long time ago.

       Have you seen him recently? He's a lot slimmer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying his stuff works, but he looks better.

       (except for the iodine. I've had a cheap brand of iodine supplement and that stuff was great.  His is probably better.)

       You should, we should all get mad as hell, all people need to see this. Idk where you are from but the US is docile. I see shit going on in Europe, and our people scatter like rats at the first shot of a smoke grenade. Yet, we call them pussies? lol.... I watched a protest in Greece, they picked up a pepper shot, put it in a solvent to neutralize and threw it back. Land of the skeet home of the afraid.

       It's just weird that the original poster suggested those people were in "that group", or that they have any real association with one another. Like I said, that person chose specific people they don't like, and then attributed a negative title to them
       <em>
        just because
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The only vague connection is a lot of them have been one Joe's show, but that's because it's one of the biggest podcasts out there. That's not really weird, and there's no "ultimate agenda" being pushed by any of the dudes.

       The issue I have is people smearing Harris and Tyson, especially when they(the OP of this thread chain) have nothing real to speak on.
