    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, about 200 k rabid morons out of 350 million Americans. That&#39;s a lot of people who are crybaby liberals that worships the ones who done much worse in the past.</p>

<p>But it does not matter that Hillary, Holder and Obama were all directly involved in felonies via email accounts at the same time.</p>

<p>Nothing will happen to any of them. It&#39;s all grandstanding. The WWF political style.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your use of the word liberal as a pejorative is telling. It is as if you still believe there is a difference between the political parties. </p>

<p>I look at people like you with pity and derision. You&#39;re like the guy down at the bar picking fights with random people after your wife cheats on you.</p>

<p>Your wife is fucking a banker, not a democrat. The guy who took your job is a banker, not a democrat. You&#39;re a chump who is fighting against his own best interest in the form of a made up enemy who is exactly the same as the politician you support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have pity for you if you can&#39;t see the difference in belief systems of the different ideologies on the level of the populace.</p>

<p>You are assuming I am part of a particular party, when reality is I am personally a political atheist. I don&#39;t buy into the WWF of political systems that is rigged so that all of the followers lose.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the type of guy that hits on my wife outside of a bar, but rather a local store or mall because we don&#39;t go into bars. You did (do not) not care that she had a wedding ring and had no sense of who it might hurt (Like kids) as long as you get a piece of ass. Then you cry wolf, claiming it was someone else that made you do it because you were not treated fairly as a child.</p>

<p>My wife is <strong>my</strong> banker because I provided the money to start the bank that WE own and she runs. Nobody can take my job because I am the job creator. In essence, I am the bank.</p>

<p>I am the leader who fights against tyranny, and considers not only my interest, but the ones who depend on me, including my employees and the companies I use to operate my businesses.</p>

<p>I easily recognize the created ideologies that are a threat to my life, my family and way of life that are dictated by moral standards that you would be crushed by, simply by pondering them.</p>

<p>I call a spade and spade, and you are a spade, as are the ones who signed the petition when they blindly follow known felons and continue to support them both politically and financially with the tax dollars I provided the government and they were given by the government, just as Republicans do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called personal responsibility, you should try it.</p>

<p>If you were 1% the man I am, you would know that I give republicans the same assault when they step out of line as these morons have.</p>

<p>My contempt for liberals is the same as for republicans. You should learn to use common English, it does not make you any smarter by attempting to make yourself look smarter. Using words like <strong>pejorative</strong> simply shows your ego while lacking any substance to back it up.</p>

<p>You lack understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still bin opponents to Republicans into a blanket term &#39;liberal&#39; after taking the time to write all that? You know Republicans aren&#39;t even republicans, right? Today&#39;s Republicans are far right wing leaning toward crypto fascism. Today&#39;s Democrats certainly aren&#39;t liberal. They are just left of center in a few cases but on the whole and by their accomplishments they are dead center conservatives. There are no liberals in office, and there certainly have not been any liberal moves in our government on over a decade.</p>

<p>The words you use are loaded, and inaccurate. Use the google &#39;define: &#39; function.</p>

§ 953. Private correspondence with foreign governments.
Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.
This section shall not abridge the right of a citizen to apply himself, or his agent, to any foreign government, or the agents thereof, for redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such government or any of its agents or subjects.

    <div class="md"><p>you want to change?  Make the campaign something all people can get behind.  Vote them out. Every last crook, pedo, theiving bastard in government.  Dem, Rep, there are no more party.  there is one party, the fuck the people over party.  Frum pta to city council, senators, vote every incumbant out.  get &quot;none of the above&quot; on your ballots in case its two dipshits.  Supreme court epheld that for a ballot.  Cant even see the baby in the bath water any more.  These tools have shown all they can do is fuck shit up, waste time imbezzel money.  Get new blood in. then the next election, same thing.  after one term they are curropted.  even if they dont get caught, dont mean they havent done nothing.</p>

<p>Old german saying, beat your kids every day, if you dont know what for, they will.    Beat these clowns out of office every last incumbant.  Incumbant, next</p>

    <div class="md"><p>quite a bit gets done by government. If you are directly reffering to the current state of affairs in the legislative branch of the United States it&#39;s quite dysfunctional right now but you don&#39;t even have to look back very long ago to see it has been extremely effective. Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich did amazing work as well as Ronald Reagan and Tip Oneal. So just because things are bad, RIGHT NOW, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad system overall.</p>

<p>Second, the terms are 6 years in senate, 2 in the house, and what are they getting done being there now?  You like the job there doing?  Think they are helping the people?  </p>

<p>I have meds, but yours are obvioulsy better than mine, can you hood me up with your doctor, or some of what you have?  My life would be so much easier.  here is an up vote, for the simple fact you made a point, a weak one, but didn&#39;t resort to name calling or disrespect.  That still means something to me.</p>
