<p>You should&#39;ve read the context for it then. Here it is: </p>

<p><em>&quot;We&#39;re unlikely to ever be within the same solar system as other intelligent life - So no visits from aliens.&quot;</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to saying &#39;totes none whatsoever&#39;, but bring down the 100% certainty a notch. </p>

<hr/>

<p>There&#39;s as much proof for ET visits, as there is for the various gods. If I adjust my fedora slightly, it means it would be so improbable it&#39;s not worth taking seriously - UNLESS you&#39;ve got some solid evidence to suggest otherwise. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I said was debatable. Whether or not aliens have visited &quot;recently&quot; which is the conspiracy theory behind area 51 or are here currently. That&#39;s my debatable argument. I&#39;m not saying I agree nor disagree, it&#39;s simply debatable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So how are you coming to your statistics to form a probable number? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s statistically probable, just like how it&#39;s statistically probable that because of the vastness of space, their is life somewhere else. BTW, where the hell are you getting your numbers to be so certain it hasn&#39;t? Because many scientist believe that it IS statistically probable of life in the universe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could I then suggest that the probability of various gods existing, is reasonably certain? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You sure could, depends on what you think god is or who the gods are. They very well could be ET.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re unlikely to ever be within the same solar system as other intelligent life - So no visits from aliens.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Billions of years is a long time, how do we know we were not closer to another solar system or that there wasn&#39;t life within our solar system BILLIONS of years ago? That argument has no merit what so ever. Simply because we do not know, nor do we have the data, because recent science is what few hundred years old and we are a few thousand years old.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s as much proof for ET visits, as there is for the various gods. If I adjust my fedora slightly, it means it would be so improbable it&#39;s not worth taking seriously - UNLESS you&#39;ve got some solid evidence to suggest otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the point, we don&#39;t have solid evidence because we can&#39;t. As I said, human science is in it&#39;s infancy compared to the age of Earth and we&#39;ve simply haven&#39;t been here long enough to TRULY know. So it is more probable than improbable of ET visitation. </p>

<p>I am aware of the Drake equation, even if it does consist of quite a bit of guesswork.  </p>

<p>However those scientists think it probable for there to be life elsewhere, tend not to believe we&#39;ve been visited. I agree with them. </p>

<p>I like to have reason to believe we&#39;ve been visited, before believing we have been. </p>

<p>Unicorns could&#39;ve been roaming the Earth amongst the dinosaurs, but till I have reason to believe that, I won&#39;t believe it or think it probable. </p>

<p>Human infancy doesn&#39;t have any bearing on the probability of ET visits - (Unless you think ET visits are contingent upon human advancements)</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, i believe aliens exist. Its the question of whether they have visited us before that baffles me.</p>

<p>On one hand, sure, we might have some pretty good explanations and theories, but none without holes. There can always be two different explanations (one for, and one against the existence of ET) for any argument or claimed evidence. </p>

<p>Its not until we look deep into out past where things get much more difficult to understand. Civilization doesnt just rise up overnight. This is something i dont think is possible. Unless there was an intervention of some sort amongst seperate societies.</p>

<p>I believe that for any given piece of evidence supportive of the existence of aliens, it could serve just as well as supportive of the notion that another humanoid species developed alongside (or before) humans, and were more intelligent than we were. It might also be possible that this &quot;other&quot; society is actually 100% human itself, it just had a few more geniuses in it, and they happened to figure stuff out quicker. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, religion is also another avenue of my research. All of the abrahamic religions stem from the same events, characters, and essentially the same ideology (originally). And it happens that this line of myth, legend, or history (depending on your views) all typically coincide with more ancient theologies and ideologies, such as the greeks, the egyptians, the sumerians, etc. </p>

<p>Whatever the case, something big happened 12000 years ago that deduced the collective memory of the remaining human population into an anxiety-ridden amnesia, differring interpretations thereof, i suspect, is the root cause of all international conflict.</p>

<p>Extraterrestrials need not be a part of this equation, but there had to have been something to fill the variable. </p>

<p>So, as of my current progress in my research to answer your question, ive placed less importance on what, exactly, &quot;they&quot; were, and have tried to delve deeper into where they might have went, and what they were doing here. </p>

<p>Extraterrestrials? An ancient lost society of humans? Another subspecies of the Homo line? What does it matter? The truth is we do not know. All we can say for sure is something was there, and might still be around.</p>

It also falls in line perfectly with the description of aborted fetus as described in the 2000+ year old Nag Hammadi library and also all of the recent accounts of grey aliens.</p>

<p>While I am not 100% convinced I would say 90-95% that it is authentic.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the one about  Billy Meier who  claims to have contact with Pleadians since the age of five,  two of which he calls by name and relates books worth of conversations with them.  He has  a massive trove  of video and photographs to back his claim.He relates how the Pleadians construct their &#39;beam ships&#39; so that they don&#39;t have to spend light years in space in order to travel that far. The description of those ships  sounds to me like it lust might work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life doesn&#39;t happen by accident, plain and simple. God created us.</p>

<p>The entire concept of aliens is propaganda for the pseudoscience that keeps people deceived into thinking otherwise. The universe did not evolve into its current form and creatures do not spontaneously generate from rock soup. These are fairy tales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He would have told us about them.</p>

<p>God created the heaven and the earth. We are on the earth and what you see above you is the heaven. No man hath ascended up to heaven and only angels of God come down.</p>

<p>The popular depiction of aliens is that of fallen creatures, like ourselves. This is indicative of the fallen angels which abide here on earth; being cast out of heaven.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t another fallen world out there a midst vast, dangerous, desolate space. I believe the image of space drawn for us is itself entirely imaginary. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s &quot;out there&quot; and we can&#39;t go anywhere, anyways.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/we-are-in-a-special-place/planck-satellite-confirms-wmap-findings-universe-is-not-copernican-26f88f17a732">Scanning the cosmos has demonstrated it all points back to us</a>. The entire universe, however big you think it is, was created solely for this world to exist. We live in a finite realm within a finite span of time created for a specific purpose that is near fruition.</p>

<p>I agree that there are certain unexplained phenomena. I agree that the interpretation of those in light of secular doctrine logically brings one to the conclusion of extra-terrestrial intelligence. I do not, however, agree that the underlying doctrine is correct.</p>

<p>The same phenomena fit another interpretation; being certain knowledge and technology is being kept secret from the general population. We&#39;re not educated properly to discern the truth when those in power are the same that write the books. Fortunately, we have one which provides a light unto the rest.</p>

<p>Remember the movie <em>They Live?</em>  </p>

<p>There are people gathered unto the house of the Lord. They can provide you with a set of glasses to properly see the world. The powers that be don&#39;t want you to have those glasses to see beyond the world they&#39;ve constructed for you. It takes someone smacking you over the head with a bible and beating you into submission before you&#39;ll ever put them on, and even then people still resist. It&#39;s the job of the curious who stumbled in and discovered himself to bring these glasses to the people and wake them up.  </p>

<p>The entire thing is an allegory to the Bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You talk about the powers that be controlling the information and making it so we aren&#39;t educated enough to make a judgment of certain things. </p>

<p>Could the bible not be also manipulated by these same groups of people/power to fit how they want people to see things?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying what is written in the bible is true or not but how could that be a possibility to everything else but not the bible? </p>

<p>Could it have been originally true word of God but have been changed over time to help people stay in control and manipulate populations but still have a original truth to it but has been changed? How can people be sure that isn&#39;t what has happened? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How can people be sure that isn&#39;t what has happened?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A study of the Bible can relieve you of this doubt. There are an exceeding number of extraordinary confirmations as to the validity of the text.</p>

<p>The Bible has indeed been attacked, but God preserves His word. Those who seek the truth will see the tampering for what it is rather quickly. Clues and truths are scattered throughout to create a tight package that is a complete, integrated work from a single source outside of time. The end is told from the beginning, and references cross back and forth throughout time itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a puzzle. If you&#39;ve ever put a puzzle together, you can treat the Bible the same way. First you find all the edges, then you flesh out the middle. If the puzzle you&#39;re working with has damaged pieces, you&#39;ll be able to tell from the context. The King James only folks have a lot to say in this regard.</p>

<p>So how do you know? Study.</p>

<p>The groups that are in power try to tell you what the text says. It&#39;s important to be able to discern its teachings yourself. Beware of &#39;higher criticism.&#39; False prophets are everywhere you look teaching lies mixed with truth. <em>Take heed lest ye be deceived.</em></p>
