       So, you are probably less than 100 years old and you say, that a planet which is billions of years old, it's never been visited? You realize that is statistically improbable, right? Sorry if it shatters your cognitive dissonance, but you cannot make that statement. If you do, you are lying to yourself or are afraid of what that entails.

       If you think it is absolutely certain Earth has been visited by ET, why did you say in your own post

       My claim is based on this very simple thing: Where if there's no reason or evidence to believe we have been visited, then i'll think we havn't been.

       I think it more likely that my house will get burgled tomorrow, than for aliens to visit us, but if I see no reason or evidence in favor of a burglary, i'll think I wasn't - And rightly. so.

       What I meant was recently (IE. area 51), sorry I wasn't clear on that in my post. The stats come from the scope of Earth's existence and the probability of ET visitation. Billions of years is a long time, not to mention the written history of ancients. To overlook the stories/history, add that to the age of Earth and the vastness of the Universe, would be foolish.

       You should've read the context for it then. Here it is:

      <p>
       <em>
        "We're unlikely to ever be within the same solar system as other intelligent life - So no visits from aliens."

      </p>
      <p>
       It's similar to saying 'totes none whatsoever', but bring down the 100% certainty a notch.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       There's as much proof for ET visits, as there is for the various gods. If I adjust my fedora slightly, it means it would be so improbable it's not worth taking seriously - UNLESS you've got some solid evidence to suggest otherwise.

       That's what I said was debatable. Whether or not aliens have visited "recently" which is the conspiracy theory behind area 51 or are here currently. That's my debatable argument. I'm not saying I agree nor disagree, it's simply debatable.

       It's statistically probable, just like how it's statistically probable that because of the vastness of space, their is life somewhere else.

       Billions of years is a long time, how do we know we were not closer to another solar system or that there wasn't life within our solar system BILLIONS of years ago? That argument has no merit what so ever. Simply because we do not know, nor do we have the data, because recent science is what few hundred years old and we are a few thousand years old.

       That's the point, we don't have solid evidence because we can't. As I said, human science is in it's infancy compared to the age of Earth and we've simply haven't been here long enough to TRULY know. So it is more probable than improbable of ET visitation.

       However those scientists think it probable for there to be life elsewhere, tend not to believe we've been visited. I agree with them.

       You're arguing with someone unaware of the infinite probabilities the size and age of our universe creates. You would have to attempt to describe the vastness of reality to even come close to getting them to understand your logic. That's a ocean of knowledge they are going to have to jump into of their own free will, and any attempts at convincing them are most likely in vain, sadly. Same as most other people...

       It's quite impressive how successful all the brain washing has been when you really think about it. TPTB are quite good at their job. It's unfortunate.

       Yes but infinite "time" provides infinite space for technological advancement/understanding. You exclude possibilities that humanity hasn't reached yet, when in comparison to the universe we are quite young. There may be civilizations that are millions of years older than us who have solved the "great distances" problem. You're subjectively limiting the possibilities based on your own human existence/experience. Read some hawking or something.

       Personally, i believe aliens exist. Its the question of whether they have visited us before that baffles me.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand, sure, we might have some pretty good explanations and theories, but none without holes. There can always be two different explanations (one for, and one against the existence of ET) for any argument or claimed evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not until we look deep into out past where things get much more difficult to understand. Civilization doesnt just rise up overnight. This is something i dont think is possible. Unless there was an intervention of some sort amongst seperate societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that for any given piece of evidence supportive of the existence of aliens, it could serve just as well as supportive of the notion that another humanoid species developed alongside (or before) humans, and were more intelligent than we were. It might also be possible that this "other" society is actually 100% human itself, it just had a few more geniuses in it, and they happened to figure stuff out quicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, religion is also another avenue of my research. All of the abrahamic religions stem from the same events, characters, and essentially the same ideology (originally). And it happens that this line of myth, legend, or history (depending on your views) all typically coincide with more ancient theologies and ideologies, such as the greeks, the egyptians, the sumerians, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the case, something big happened 12000 years ago that deduced the collective memory of the remaining human population into an anxiety-ridden amnesia, differring interpretations thereof, i suspect, is the root cause of all international conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraterrestrials need not be a part of this equation, but there had to have been something to fill the variable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, as of my current progress in my research to answer your question, ive placed less importance on what, exactly, "they" were, and have tried to delve deeper into where they might have went, and what they were doing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraterrestrials? An ancient lost society of humans? Another subspecies of the Homo line? What does it matter? The truth is we do not know. All we can say for sure is something was there, and might still be around.

       I think it would be foolish to think there isn't life outside of earth. I also think it would be foolish to think that we haven't been visited or aren't being visited. People who deny this (IMO) don't want think about what that truly entails, so the cognitive dissonance shuts down their mind. Because if it was the case, then their religious, social beliefs, and social structure would all come crashing down in a second. They would go mental. ET's do exist, statistically they have to. Whether they have visited/are here, is debatable.

       I have watched this more times than I would like to admit and if this is a hoax it is absolutely the best hoax ever. I studied the movements of this being and I have not seen CGI or animatronics that looks anywhere as close to as natural as these movements are. It also falls in line perfectly with the description of aborted fetus as described in the 2000+ year old Nag Hammadi library and also all of the recent accounts of grey aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I am not 100% convinced I would say 90-95% that it is authentic.

       There's also the one about  Billy Meier who  claims to have contact with Pleadians since the age of five,  two of which he calls by name and relates books worth of conversations with them.  He has  a massive trove  of video and photographs to back his claim.He relates how the Pleadians construct their 'beam ships' so that they don't have to spend light years in space in order to travel that far. The description of those ships  sounds to me like it lust might work.

       God created the heaven and the earth. We are on the earth and what you see above you is the heaven. No man hath ascended up to heaven and only angels of God come down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The popular depiction of aliens is that of fallen creatures, like ourselves. This is indicative of the fallen angels which abide here on earth; being cast out of heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't another fallen world out there a midst vast, dangerous, desolate space. I believe the image of space drawn for us is itself entirely imaginary. We don't know what's "out there" and we can't go anywhere, anyways.

       I agree that there are certain unexplained phenomena. I agree that the interpretation of those in light of secular doctrine logically brings one to the conclusion of extra-terrestrial intelligence. I do not, however, agree that the underlying doctrine is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same phenomena fit another interpretation; being certain knowledge and technology is being kept secret from the general population. We're not educated properly to discern the truth when those in power are the same that write the books. Fortunately, we have one which provides a light unto the rest.

       There are people gathered unto the house of the Lord. They can provide you with a set of glasses to properly see the world. The powers that be don't want you to have those glasses to see beyond the world they've constructed for you. It takes someone smacking you over the head with a bible and beating you into submission before you'll ever put them on, and even then people still resist. It's the job of the curious who stumbled in and discovered himself to bring these glasses to the people and wake them up.

       The entire thing is an allegory to the Bible.

       You talk about the powers that be controlling the information and making it so we aren't educated enough to make a judgment of certain things.

       Could the bible not be also manipulated by these same groups of people/power to fit how they want people to see things?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying what is written in the bible is true or not but how could that be a possibility to everything else but not the bible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it have been originally true word of God but have been changed over time to help people stay in control and manipulate populations but still have a original truth to it but has been changed? How can people be sure that isn't what has happened?

       A study of the Bible can relieve you of this doubt. There are an exceeding number of extraordinary confirmations as to the validity of the text.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible has indeed been attacked, but God preserves His word. Those who seek the truth will see the tampering for what it is rather quickly. Clues and truths are scattered throughout to create a tight package that is a complete, integrated work from a single source outside of time. The end is told from the beginning, and references cross back and forth throughout time itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a puzzle. If you've ever put a puzzle together, you can treat the Bible the same way. First you find all the edges, then you flesh out the middle. If the puzzle you're working with has damaged pieces, you'll be able to tell from the context. The King James only folks have a lot to say in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do you know? Study.
      </p>
      <p>
       The groups that are in power try to tell you what the text says. It's important to be able to discern its teachings yourself. Beware of 'higher criticism.' False prophets are everywhere you look teaching lies mixed with truth.
