       So awhile back a user asked me to ask this question to the group, as we were both struggling at the time (my apologies to whoever you are - it was weeks ago). Chime in if you're reading, please.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the question.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How do you guys do it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I struggle every day with basically being two people. The first one, I'm just going through the motions, making small talk at work, and watching people mindlessly consume both calories and information that's just
       <em>
        no good to for them
       </em>
       . Nobody
       <strong>
        questions anything
       </strong>
       anymore, and they just take what the news and the TV and the government tell them, and that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the other Jim is the one you know, who at least thinks
       <em>
        he knows what's going on
       </em>
       , and can reasonable talk the pants off of almost anyone in the room about most things of geopolitical significance, including gas pipelines, to ISIL, to Ukraine, this whole Iran thing, the Smith-Mundt Act, the history of propaganda social manipulation, financial manipulation, the military-industrial-complex, the banking system, 9/11, Sandy Hook, the Boston Marathon, the Ottawa shooting, the Sydney Siege, the Ebola Crisis, all these farcical beheadings, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no one knows I know that stuff, because either no one wants to hear it (because it is uncomfortable to confront a known falsehood) or people just have no idea. They don't realize that when you stop caring about Football and baseball and stressing about work, the free time to actually learn things and question things is easy to do. But people don't want to question things, and are so amped up with propaganda and nationalism lately that I have to hide
       <em>
        this Jim
       </em>
       from most people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone know what I'm saying? How do you cope with knowing the things that you know, and realizing that most are blindly flying in this roller coaster of 'Murica fuck-yeah and the tracks aren't gonna last forever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any insight would be helpful.

       I don't worry about trying to convince people of anything anymore, including on reddit. I just go with my own life and think about what i'm going to have for my tea (evening meal) each night, which i generally cook. I enjoy that. To be able to put on a talk show or music and make food for my girlfriend and then maybe watch a film. I don't rant half as much as i used to but it wouldn't surprise me if many here did rant. The frustration eventually goes and you learn acceptance. There are probably a couple of dozen Buddha quotes about it in one form or another but all you need to really do is find your own space and place. There is no real truth that is separate from the things that you are seeking and the idea of a wake up call for a couple of billion people to me now exists only in the realms of fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just enjoy your own time and what will be will be.

       In the Summer and Fall here in New England it is much better, cooking food we grow in the monster garden we started. That'll help for sure.

       Personally, I do it by simply not
       <em>
        having
       </em>
       “two halves”.  I’m always “on”.  That’s not to say that I’m trying to shove conspiracy-oriented subjects down everybody’s throat that I come across, but I don’t hold my tongue even a little bit if someone asks me a question about anything.  This makes everything a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       easier.  My life is pretty simple that way:  I don’t fuck around.  I say what I feel and don’t worry
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       much about how I come across to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m also respectful to everyone I speak with even if I am saying something that might come across as inflammatory, however, so people don’t usually get upset with
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       per se for whatever I say.  They actually stop and think about it usually.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing is that you have to be okay with not really having too many if any friends.  You have to be okay with the possibility of not being very popular - with being ostracized.  In my case, I don’t really have many if any people I talk to regularly.  Never have.  I’m generally by myself, and am okay with that at this point, so I have very little problem with the possibility of being rejected for something I feel because I’m generally by myself all the time
       <em>
        anyway
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If one is the type of person that wants to be accepted by the people around them and wants to “fit in”, then I imagine they might feel like they
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to live a double life because they’re scared that if they speak up and speak the truth about what they know/feel to others, then they might be rejected…and they don’t want that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being respectful while at the same time also not giving a single fuck about whether anyone rejects you or not for what you understand helps you be able to not worry about what anyone thinks about what you say and feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       It helps me anyway.

       I dig it a lot man. Unfortunately I need to be likeable at my job (it's how I got it), and going against the grain publicly is usually not a good idea (or for my personal long term goals), so I have to let it bubble up here for a few hours a day to
       <em>

      <p>
       I imagine that this might be a kind of difficult situation to be in - i.e. if someone needs to be likable or happy or smiley all the time, etc.  I’ve kind of cultivated a bit of a “give no fucks” modus operandi in this life, and my surroundings I guess have generally mirrored this.  It’s a balance, and there are pros and cons to everything.  For me, the con is that I don’t have as many material possessions and “toys” etc as the average person (big house, nice car, fancy clothes, etc).  The pro, however, is that I have been able to live independently and by myself for coming on 18+ years without ever having had a 9-5, daily grind type of job, haven’t had ANY job in over half a decade, and I get to generally give zero fucks about what I say or do.

      <p>
       This is a very poignant and telling statement here because, at the end of the day, your actions are all about what your PERSONAL LONG TERM GOALS are.  If those PLTG are important enough to possibly sacrifice being able to speak the truth as you see it in life, then I would say you’re where you want to be.  If they’re
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       , however, then you can always reevaluate things.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you have avenues that allow you to “balance out”…and you actually DO end up getting balanced out, then that seems like a not horrible thing.

      <p>
       I never have had many friends - not because I wouldn’t have minded one, but because I’ve connected with very few people in this life sufficient to refer to too many (if any) as such.  Not sure if a degree in Philosophy helped or hindered this.

       I’ve gone from being a generally reluctant introvert early on in this life, to being a comfortable enough and embracing one now.

       I'm so, so, so fucking glad you are posting this. I was going to post something like this tonight. I need to know too. I feel the exact same way as you. It's like living two lives. Sadly, I drink. I know it's not good for the long run, but it makes this shit a little easier to swallow. I'm looking forward to hearing the community. Because, god, creator, deity, ET, spaghetti man, what the fuck ever I need it. I'd give you gold if I wasn't unemployed and knew that this shit hole of a site doesn't deserve pan handling, while be back by the wealthiest few.

       I used to smoke copious amounts of weed; I don't think it helped my hyperactive mind. Lately, I stopped smoking &amp; I may take a break from this subreddit. I've been following this sub for 9 months(?) but all the info can be overwhelming. It's enough to make me cynical.

       A lady in my office today just bought a $25k piano.... on credit.
Our society has a long way to go before we wake up.

       Yea, it is overwhelming. I have an over active brain/imagination too. The only thing to shut it up was alcohol. It has it's pros and cons, mostly bad on the body, but I react differently to it. I'm thinking of moving into the realms of weed. But, my imagination runs wild under any influence, and I experienced weird shit in HS under the influence. I can control liquor, but not weed, not sure why. I'm kinda thinking absinthe, lol. Wish they sold the true shit here (land of the free, huh?). And now I'm on a tangent. Any ways. Yeah, shit is heavy here. And knowing all that, then knowing a lady just bought a 25k piano, man, the world is fucked. Lemme get another, German imported beer. I need to go on a nature walk or some shit, it's beautiful out here.

       Ive found that everybody reacts to weed differently. Some of the folks i used to blaze with in college would do a few g's at a time and be balling. I could pinch off a tiny bit of a dime and get to the same place. I found im a lightweight when it comes to weed (though at the time i was capable of outdrinking just about anybody).

       If you decide to try it again, try a very little, and work up. This way, you can find that happy medium where you get the third eye opening effects, while still maintaining a great deal of control.

       I know this sounds pretentious but I'm lucky in a way because I have a considerable size advantage over most people. I think because of this people tend to listen to what I'm saying. I'm also lucky to have a girlfriend and close family who think similarly regarding conspiracies.

       Maybe for yourself you could post a few flyers around stating some of your beliefs (you have amazing writing skills) which might catch some peoples attention and start up a small grassroots resistance group. That would inevitably attract like minded individuals which would give you an outlet to talk about this stuff besides the internet.

       How do I do it? First of all, I personally made a choice to surround myself with nature. Each and every day I'm around vast amounts of jungle, gardens, coffee trees and an edible food forest. That eventually evolved into my full time job. If anything is in tune with the current energetics and fully accepts me without judgement- it's nature. I have made a lot of sacrifices to live a simple life. And it was worth every perceived sacrifice to live this life. We grow most of our food, hunt, fish etc. And we spend a lot of time together as a family, and that too is a big part. Self sufficiency and community sustainability are key to my personal sanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I am very involved with my local community. We have and host many events. Things like beach cleanups, seed swaps, movie nights with home brew/wine tastings, community potlucks to feed and involve the temporarily houseless in finding work and homes, volunteering to set up gardens, music concerts, working with the local food bank etc. The list goes on and on. Forming this trusted community of like and open-minded individuals has been like rediscovering the family I always wanted. It's amazing just how priceless a true community is. And really amazing the many things that can be accomplished with more helping hands. We all come from different backgrounds, areas and countries, have diferent views and beliefs. And we all teach eachother a lot because of the diversity we represent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone will have their own perceptions and ways to be here now and "do it". For me it's family, nature, sustainability and community.

       i put the fun in functional alcoholic !  the only tv i watch is comedies. i stay away from anything that isn't porn or r/conspiracy. i play my guitar, a lot.   if and when i get into a conversation with anyone about this stuff i stick to facts, the ones that are easiest for anyone of average intelligence to understand- operation northwoods was real, and when a hammer hits a nail, it slows down, it doesn't speed up.

       I buy a lot of beers for the "pave the Middle East" crowd to make up for flipping their easy talking points on their heads. I do retract and refresh with the spouse and cat and books. I'm not a different person in real life than I am here and sometimes I'm scared that I'll be talking smack and someone will make the connection because I know people in town are on this sub because I see them spill over from here to there and cross-reference things. I meet fellow travellers all the time, though, so it's kind of cheering. The dumb pave-the-earthers are the outliers, not the norm, but unfortunately a lot of people are tired and go with the propaganda for social talking points...

       I've toiled with the idea if hitting up the bar scene again, and even got my old college roommate to tag along for a few weeks. I unloaded some things in him he definitely wasn't ready for and we haven't really spoken since. I feel bad about it, but we'll connect again at some point.

       I just go with the husband, I'd want to kill people if I went alone, and if I went with a girlfriend I'd probably never talk to anyone else around me out of politeness. And he's good at knowing when to lead me away from a fight, haha. When we eat out, we typically hit the bar if spots are open vs grabbing a table. Hard to do with kids, though, I guess, but that seems to be changing...lots of family-friendly brewpubs popping up all over the country.

       It's weird that people don't tend to talk to their neighbor unless alcohol is involved or an Australian's afoot, but it is what it is, I guess...:/

       Gotta let it go. Humans gonna human. They're going to start wars and do all this stupid monkey power-games shit, and that's just how it is. Doesn't mean you can't try and change things, doesn't mean you can't speak your mind. It's just a realization that there's like a 1:1,000,000,000 gear ratio between your actions and the state of the world, so you can't assume you'll change the world or else you will go insane. Just change your little part of it as best you can, and stop worrying while you're at it.

       Personally, i comparmentalize. Ive gotten used to the idea of saving a thought for a later time to digest. Observstions, sometimes, arent worth analyzing until it is safe to do so.

       I think r/conspiracy is so popular due to its anonymity. Something that real life cant truely offer, when it comes to discussing the state of things. Thus, most folks on here probably have these two personas, similar in fashion to how you desrcibed. Judging by the responses so far, it seems to be true.

       My "RL" STK goes to work everyday, and is a fantastic worker. He puts himself in autopilot, as he works in local government and notices corruption at a personal level. Politics can be brutal, even if you are not directly involved.

       At the end of the day, he works out. He has tsken martial arts classes for almost 15 yrs, in several styles. He has already changed his diet, and deleted some of his worst habits (drinking, for the most part, and smoking completely). Slowly building up his survival skills. In the meantime, its autopilot.

       The few minutes a day, the "other me" gets a chance to type up shit on his phone, keeping up with current events, and trying to learn just a little bit more each day about something he didnt know before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Day by day, autopilot and comparmentalization. Thats how i do it.

       My favorite response so far, one that I try to do but struggle with often. If you can do it buddy, no reason I can't (and I don't mean that in a negative way at all).

       All it takes is a little at a time bro. If you make sure to do a slight bit more thsn you did yesterday, thats progress. Perpetual progress is success, imo.

       His response reminds me of the Japanese concept of having "multiple selves". If you ask a Japanese person "what they're like", they will generally respond "Well, at work I am like X. At home I am like Y. With friends I am like Z." and so on.  They let each part stand individually. I think this is kind of like letting go of clinging to a unified concept of "self" because it does not truly have well-defined spatiotemporal edges upon thorough examination, like as is said in Buddhism, which may be where this Japanese attitude comes from.

       It is unwise to answer these types of "how do you feel" questions on any surveilled site -- police state fact.

       Second, it is just generally true that people don't know what others know.  You have your focal points, and they theirs.  To say that your focus is more correct implies you are suggesting a correct way to live.  That is a rabbit hole.

       Fuuuck that.  Don't be afraid to speak your mind, man.  Don't be afraid.  It's even
       <em>

       unwise to live in fear thinking that what you feel might be heard and not agreed with by others.

       Wise thoughts, and this is the reason I delayed this post for awhile.

       At this point, for me - I don't care anymore.

       I've chosen my words very carefully on this site. These were no different.

       Ive found that everybody reacts to weed differently. Some of the folks i used to blaze with in college would do a few g's at a time and be balling. I could pinch off a tiny bit of a dime and get to the same place. I found im a lightweight when it comes to weed (though at the time i was capable of outdrinking just about anybody).

       If you decide to try it again, try a very little, and work up. This way, you can find that happy medium where you get the third eye opening effects, while still maintaining a great deal of control.
