       So I make a point, and then this guy just attacks me viciously for disagreeing with him and tries to suggest that i'm crazy, without actually making any points relating to my argument. I find it depressing that someone upvoted him for saying I was "dropped on my head as a baby", thinking that somehow weakens my argument.

       Hooky fucking Christ I didn't read all of that but I saw a very common pattern. The quoting and then smearing tactic without addressing the actual conversation is exactly what I'm taking about. I've engaged a few of these people before I realized I was experiencing what so many posts on this sub were talking about. Now you have as well. It seems to be related more to key words like they are searching until there's a hit and then engage in a seemingly benign debate until they've been proven wrong. I defended someone on a comment about Jewish control because it was an objective, well written comment, despite not necessarily agreeing with it. I made no mention of my own beliefs. What followed was one of the worst, most relentless and verbally abusive attacks I've experienced on the net. Stonewalling and character demeaning are common. After stating I was defending him, it still persisted. Someone even gilded one of his comments that had nothing to do with the original debate and only contained text that was personally diminishing and slanderous toward myself. I after a couple more of these conversations, I try not to even read about racy subjects much less comment on them. I'm trying to learn and constructively debate things because I enjoy learning. When it's not enjoyable anymore it's not worth it.

       This is exactly what i'm talking about, the guy makes no attempt to address my argument, or even to state one of his own, he just attempts to attack my character, and categorize me.

       That's why you just don't engage them. After I experienced it I understood that the claims of people with agendas attacking others were not just very real, but also very common. One guy went so far as to prove my point exactly without meaning to.

       By the way the rules of the sub say no accusations of rule violations in the comments. It's literally rule number 2. You should learn to read.

       And punishing a little boy for making his pop art into a gun shape or pointing his finger at someone and saying "pow pow" is teaching little boys not be little boys. Sit down, be quiet, sit still... like a good little robot.

       Well some people responded to it. I think you just get a kick out of shouting "NOT" at people like you're the master of the internet or something. Well whatever man, if it makes you feel like a big man.

       By the way if you had actually read the rules of this sub it says no accusations of rule violations in the comments. Hypocrite.

       erm so you then fall foul of that rule right?
