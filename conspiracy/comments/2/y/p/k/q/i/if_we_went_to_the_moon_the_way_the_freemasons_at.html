        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...then perhaps someone can explain to me how it&#39;s possible that there&#39;s no time lag between mission control speaking and one of the astronaut&#39;s speaking in any of the Apollo transmissions.</p>

<p>The Apollo craft was supposed to have been well over 220,000 miles away upon reaching the Moon. Assuming speed of light travel (around 186,000 mile per second), the radio waves carrying the sound should have taken about 1.2 seconds or more to reach the Moon, and then a reply from the astronaut would take the same amount of time to come back. There should therefore be a definite, obvious, even annoying pause of over 2 seconds between Mission Control speaking and an astronaut replying.</p>

<p>But there isn&#39;t. The only pauses are natural pauses, while someone thinks or is distracted - most of the time the two groups are speaking in real time with no lag whatsoever.</p>

<p>So again: how is this possible?</p>

<p>This is the biggest smoking gun. If we were able to safely send men through this toxic radiation. Why haven&#39;t we been back to study it? Why are other manned missions, like potential Mars expeditions, hindered by this very same problem that was <em>allegedly</em> no problem at all in 1969?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the Van Allen Belts (and NASA&#39;s often conflicting/problematic comments about them over the years) are probably the smoking gun.  I just made this post to point out some of the other glaring pieces of evidence that I&#39;ve found over the years pointing to Apollo&#39;s official story being a load of bunk.</p>

<p>Another good one off the top of my head is that in most (if not all) of the transmissions, the lunar module was supposed to have been firing at near full blast mere feet from the astronauts and their microphones - how is it that you can&#39;t hear this at all in any of the recordings?</p>

<p>Most of the rest of the confusion in this video (which could have been 20 seconds long and contained all of the same assertions) is based on a lack of understanding of the differences in the missions. This mission can&#39;t use the same technology as Apollo for a great many reasons, but the most important and the most critical is that the electronics being used are far more sophisticated than those on Apollo, and are therefore far more susceptible to interference via EM radiation.</p>

<p>If they just used Apollo&#39;s shielding, everyone would be dead in the craft not long after the electronics began to wink off...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Other than experts at Nasa acknowledging it? </p>

<p>&quot;The inner Van Allen belt consists largely of highly energetic protons, with energy exceeding 30,000,000 electron volts. The peak intensity of these protons is approximately 20,000 particles per second crossing a spherical area of one square cm in all directions. &quot;</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that a human body can not survive encounters with radiation levels several hundred orders of magnitude less than this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the sort of radiation that will likely kill a human instantly, but that combined with the EM outside of the VA is pretty lethal. You do need shielding, but it&#39;s a more or less trivial problem to solve, compared to some of the other challenges.</p>

<p>Apollo solved it, but the Orion mission has more complex circuitry that requires heavier shielding, and at the same time they&#39;re trying to use lighter weight materials, so the whole thing has to be completely re-tested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The position that Jay Weidner presents in Kubrick&#39;s Odyssey and the one that I find to be most credible is that we have gone to the moon (and possibly could still be there) but the footage from &#39;69 and all of the Apollo programs are frauds.
Some of the potential motivations are that during a cold war, you don&#39;t want to unveil UFO technology to the Russians if you can claim to get to the moon by rocket, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard this as well but what have you seen that convinced you this is the case?  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, and in fact I&#39;d go so far as to say that <em>if</em> we&#39;ve ever gone to the Moon it was definitely using some sort of exotic technology, but there&#39;s nothing to suggest this that I&#39;ve found.</p>

<p>To me it&#39;s always seemed like people who&#39;ve looked into the Apollo Missions, found an abundance of bullshit in the official story, but still <em>want</em> to believe that humans made it to the Moon and so they just do based on nothing but wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Am I wrong?  I&#39;d be happy to look into this more, and I even believe that more exotic technologies/forms of propulsion exist, but I&#39;m just not convinced that humans can make it there.  The Van Allen Belts are to me the main hindrance.</p>

We went to the Moon, either found some stuff that didn&#39;t want to be found or had to hide some stuff that would be too weird for everyone, and now there&#39;s a big hologram type of projection over it, concealing... something.
The minor difference would basically be - and this 100% my understanding so I hope everyone looks into both Kubrick&#39;s Odyssey and Crrow777 themselves to form their own opinions - that the Kubrick&#39;s Odyssey take implies we did succeed in going to the moon at some point, though there is no official account, and Crrow777 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQVVOAyu3vs">doubts</a> we even leave low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>I wish.  Unfortunately this topic seems to be one that a lot of people have trouble with, even in the face of what&#39;s (in my mind) a huge amount of evidence pointing to the fact that the Apollo missions were almost totally a hoax.  I&#39;m not convinced that a human has ever made it out of low-Earth orbit personally.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Definitely possible.  I&#39;d say if we <em>did</em> go, a more exotic type of propulsion/shielding technology would&#39;ve needed to be used to do so.  I&#39;ve heard a lot of ideas about this but I&#39;m on the fence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>luckily for you, you&#39;re not getting the <em>beat down</em> i got when i posted a question about this, i also question the validity of the moon landing. </p>

<p>i read that it&#39;s easier to get people to believe a <em>BIG</em> lie than a small one:</p>

<p>“<strong>If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it</strong>. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”<br/>
 Joseph Goebbels </p>

<p>and the US moon landing would be considered a <em>BIG</em> lie. (one of many, btw)</p>

<p>Freemason here. A few astronauts were Freemasons (we make a big deal about that, of course) but it&#39;s not &quot;Freemasons at Apollo&quot; who make the claim that we, Americans, went to the moon, it&#39;s NASA, every scientist who has ever studied the data, every scientist that has ever studied the samples, the government and non-government scientists who worked with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter which was able to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_17#/media/File:Apollo_17_LRO.jpg">image the tire treads of the buggy, descent stage and other details of the landing site</a>, etc.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just such a wealth of data from NASA and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings">from third parties</a> that it became absurd in the 70s to make the claim that it never happened, let alone today.</p>

<p>Freemasonry has no interest in faking mountain hikes, much less trips to the moon.</p>

<p>It may sound cliche but I try to stay away from &quot;beliefs&quot;.  There are things I know, things I think, and things I don&#39;t know, but once you start giving yourself over to <em>believing</em> in something or someone, you&#39;re giving your mind away.  You&#39;re taking things on faith and faith alone.</p>

<p>Everyone has a belief they want to push on people, everyone thinks they have the big &quot;IT&quot;, the secret.  I&#39;m not infallible enough to think that I&#39;d &quot;believe&quot; the correct thing and so I try to stay open to everything and understand where people are coming from regardless of where that is.</p>

<p>That link is interesting as well though, never heard of cargo cults before.</p>

<p>Edit: To answer your question though, the Van Allen Belts are to me the main reason why humans never have nor will make it to the Moon.  At least not using conventional propulsion methods (and I&#39;m doubtful even with exotic ones).</p>

What I said is true for every single one of them.  The rest was just applying simple math and logic.  Which part do you not understand?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also if the moon landings were fake the soviets would have said</p>

<p>This is an assumption and one I don&#39;t agree with considering East and West collusion starting since at least the Bolshevik Revolution and going on through both World Wars, etc.</p>

<p>But that has nothing at all to do with the question posed in this OP, let&#39;s stay on topic.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, which I doubt you can digest anyway because you don&#39;t understand the difference between how light, radio waves, and sound travel, the Soviet Union <em>at the time</em> would have known with certainty whether or not the Americans really did what they said they did and and could prove it. If the Soviet Union could have proved the American moon landing was a ruse, they would have done it.</p>

<p>That the Soviet Union didn&#39;t out the American moon landing as a ruse is among the most compelling evidence that it was real.</p>

<p>Wrong again. Sound travels at the speed of sound and actually is a disturbance of matter that your ears detect. The speed with which sound travels varies with the density of matter available, along with other factors. The speed of sound is different at sea level than it is at 60,000 feet.</p>

<p>But there isn&#39;t enough matter in space to convey that disturbance, so nobody can hear you scream in space. Sound doesn&#39;t travel through outer space.</p>

<p>Light and radio waves (which are not sound) travel at the speed of light and can travel through outer space.</p>

<p>This has nothing at all to do with this discussion.  Are you suggesting that Apollo &quot;modified the speed of light&quot; somehow to allow it to transmit audio instantaneously across hundreds of thousands of miles?  Can you explain how?</p>

<p>The burden of proof is on Apollo to prove they actually completed the missions in the way they claimed.  These transmissions are a piece of evidence suggesting they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Do you have any evidence of NASA ever doing or claiming to have done this with its &quot;live transmissions&quot;?  Because that would then make them liars for claiming they were &quot;live&quot;, no?</p>

They use a specific wavelength, and filter out on the receiving end whatever wavelength is too far off from the expected energy levels, they also have time gates as they know more or less when to expect the return photon. They readily admit some natural photons matching their expectations get through the filters and bias their results, however it seems to be of the utmost importance that the laser is aimed right, they don&#39;t explicitly mention it but it seems to me this insistence means one of two things, either they don&#39;t get as many photons when they are not aimed right, which would indicate there is a mirror... or... it&#39;s so hard to aim right you need &quot;experts&quot; to man the gun... there aren&#39;t many of these guns around the world so this second option is potential for shenanigans.</p>

<p>I just wish we could get some super high res pics of the moon. It seems like everything we see is doctored in some way or is way less resolution than you&#39;d expect.

    <div class="md"><p>This is incorrect. In fact, There are telescopes powerful enough to see the things we allegedly left, but NASA will not reveal their exact locations. Now why would they care about that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What telescopes?</p>

<p>I&#39;d be surprised, frankly, if we had scopes big enough to resolve ~1m on the moon from LEO/Earth&#39;s surface. I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d sent anything that big up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 10 minutes, they receive a few dozens of photons for 6k laser shots. They use a specific wavelength, and filter out on the receiving end whatever wavelength is too far off from the expected energy levels, they also have time gates as they know more or less when to expect the return photon. They readily admit some natural photons matching their expectations get through the filters and bias their results, however it seems to be of the utmost importance that the laser is aimed right, they don&#39;t explicitly mention it but it seems to me this insistence means one of two things, either they don&#39;t get as many photons when they are not aimed right, which would indicate there is a mirror... or... it&#39;s so hard to aim right you need &quot;experts&quot; to man the gun... there aren&#39;t many of these guns around the world so this second option is potential for shenanigans.</p>

<p>edit: does seem to be the first option, here is a comment of an otherwise interesting thread on how to make your own -&gt; <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qw30x/can_an_amateur_astronomer_test_the_lunar_laser/c410sn9">https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qw30x/can_an_amateur_astronomer_test_the_lunar_laser/c410sn9</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>luckily for you, you&#39;re not getting the <em>beat down</em> i got when i posted a question about this, i also question the validity of the moon landing. </p>

<p>i read that it&#39;s easier to get people to believe a <em>BIG</em> lie than a small one:</p>

<p>“<strong>If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it</strong>. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”<br/>
 Joseph Goebbels </p>

<p>and the US moon landing would be considered a <em>BIG</em> lie. (one of many, btw)</p>
