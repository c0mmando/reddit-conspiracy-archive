        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>REDDIT STOP DELETING THIS POST</strong></p>

<p>Since there&#39;s a lot of confusion about C-51, let me try to explain.</p>

<p>The intelligence services of Canada, UK, Australia, NZ and USA have a deal where they spy for each other and on each other&#39;s citizens. Each country has some laws against spying on its OWN citizens, but no country has laws against spying on foreigners, but each intelligence service is interested in data on both foreigners and local citizens. </p>

<p>So Canada spies on US citizens, and gives the data to the NSA for free, while the USA spies on Canadians, and gives the data to CSIS for free, and no one has - technically - violated the law.
By &quot;spying&quot; it is meant &quot;records everything you do on the internet&quot;. Every email, every webpage, every internet comment, everything.</p>

<p>So any time CSIS is interested in any Canadian, they can get everything you do on the internet through a sharing agreement with the NSA, even though it would be illegal to collect it directly.
That&#39;s already in existence. Bill C-51 allows CSIS to share that info with any other government of Canada agency, and allows all those agencies to share it with anyone else they want to. It also allows your tax records to be shared with any other government agency.</p>

<p>So, nutshell: Canada will be maintaining a large internal database, secret from you but available to any Canadian governmental agency, which controls border entry, citizenship applications, flying on any airplane (possibly train travel in near future), and assesses your general reliability level based on your internet activity, bank records, taxes, travel, ethnicity, and so forth. Should the government have any reason to use that information against you, it will be available to any governmental agency.</p>

<p>That program will be sold as being &quot;to fight terrorism&quot; but mostly it will be used against environmental protesters, people who embarrass or oppose the government, and the like. C-51 lists nine separate reasons why your info might be shared. Terrorism is just one of the nine.</p>

<p>For instance, British MP Galloway was denied entrance to Canada because he spoke against Canada&#39;s involvement in the Afghanistan war. This is how it works in practice:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/20/george-galloway-banned-canada">http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/20/george-galloway-banned-canada</a></p>

<p><a href="http://rabble.ca/news/2010/09/what-galloway-court-decision-means-free-speech-canada">http://rabble.ca/news/2010/09/what-galloway-court-decision-means-free-speech-canada</a></p>

<p>And yes, it will be shared with other countries as well, so if the NSA wants your Canadian tax records, they can get them. Sure, most Canadians won&#39;t be of interest to the intelligence agencies of other countries, but those who are, will have their info sent off.</p>

<p>No, none of this requires a warrant or judicial application. Not one bit of it. And yes, it&#39;s all secret from you - you won&#39;t know what&#39;s going on or, why, for example, the U.S. border turned you back (because Canada said you were an an environmental protester, but you won&#39;t know that and you have no recourse at law).</p>

<p>The feeling of helplessness is by design.  It is also false.  We may be in a prison of sorts, but like a prison, the inmates can take over any time they wish.  All we have to do is decide.  Hopefully, it will be a peaceful revolution.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a <a href="/r/protestcanada">/r/protestcanada</a> sub right now but I&#39;m not sure anything will come of it, and frankly the only thing I expect to come from participating in a protest of this bill is to end up on a watch list.

<a href="/r/canada">/r/canada</a> you guys are in serious trouble, its way past the point of feeling helpless, you got to get organized now. Find out your local town hall, get a flyer going, pass it out with the metting details once you get the event going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All local municipalities have their own newspapers around here that circulate weekly, and should have a community events page/op ed section where a well articulated couple of paragraphs can get the ball rolling.</p>

<p>You then repeat this process with slightly different language to send to the bigger news papers that cover the county/chunk of the state, and specifically mention STATE representatives/senators and urge them, as he is represented <em>by you</em>, to attend the meeting and here the grievances and concerns that will be discussed.</p>

<p>If they ignore it, and you have a significant following, they now know they representative isn&#39;t really paying attention, and <em>now his job is up for grabs</em>. And guess who&#39;s gonna take it? Anybody. Could be you.</p>

<p>Fuck, you organized everyone together, clearly articulated points, most will surely agree with you, and you can then start having <em>regular meetings</em> (you know - democracy?) with your community where you can organize fundraisers for good causes, organize get together, and promote local businesses so that you&#39;re actually a community again.</p>

<p>And you turn your one voice bitching on reddit into a throng of concerned and educated citozens, just by taking that one first step.</p>

<p>And the worst case scenario is you burn a few days figuring out logistics and nobody&#39;s interested. Well then guess what? That&#39;s the will of the people, and you&#39;re the minority like I am now, almost a decade-and-a-half into the PATRIOT act and all of it&#39;s ilk.</p>

<p>But I was just a kid then, with a shitty internet connection and didn&#39;t know fuck all of the world. </p>

<p>But now, as an American time-traveler of sorts, this is that one big step after a series of insignificant steps that lead you down a road you do not want to be on.</p>

<p>Their security apparatus is too good now, and I think time is of the god-damn essence.</p>
