    <div class="md"><p>WAT?</p>

<p>The ASVAB was taken in high school. I doubt it was even anyone from the military correcting it. I am sure it was just a proctor. </p>

<p>And if it&#39;s all just a recruiting scheme, why would they only alter the scores of one random student?</p>

<p>I also scored the highest in my class on the SATs and the ACTs. Did the military alter those as well?</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t the military fake my overall avg? I graduated with like a 72%?</p>

<p>I got my ASVAB back. I could see the questions that I got correct and incorrect. . . I would have known if any of my answers were changed. I had everyone else&#39;s test in the class to compare it to.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t need to change my score on the Auto Mechanic part. I don&#39;t know shit about cars or internal combustion engines. </p>

<p>Maybe they altered all the questions and all the answers to everyone&#39;s exam after the fact, all in an elaborate recruitment scheme. Which failed. Miserably. </p>

<p>Maybe there was no exam, and it was all just PsyOps.</p>

<p>Maybe I never even went to High School.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just speculating and playing devil&#39;s advocate, you said you were in the 94th percentile but that could easily just be bullshit since there&#39;s no way to confirm that without knowing the scores of every other person who&#39;s taken it.</p>

<p>My point was simply that I wouldn&#39;t put it past the military to lie and scheme and do whatever possible to convince people to enlist.  I don&#39;t know anything at all about their recruitment methods so I don&#39;t know if this test could be part of it, but I do know that if there were some way to manipulate it that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. It&#39;s just a multiple choice test though. </p>

<p>I am sure they know the scores of everyone else who has taken it. I am sure all the scores went into some sort of government file.</p>

<p>And I said 94 to make it sound more believable. I think my overall was actually more like 98th percentile. I crushed basically everything. Except for that grease monkey bullshit. </p>

<p>But my scores were in line with all my other test scores, in comparison to my class. I graduated in a very small class, so everyone knew what everyone else got. There were plenty who couldn&#39;t figure out which way all the gears turned when you spun the crank. </p>

<p>I passed most classes with a 65 (the bare minimum), and got the highest score on almost all the standardized tests. I don&#39;t have any reason to suspect any sort of manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is this propaganda?</p>

<p>In fact, every time something negative comes up about India in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, it&#39;s always the same </p>

<p>&#39;stupid western propaganda against India&#39;</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>&#39;look at Pakistan! They&#39;re even worse!&#39;.</p>

<p>These Indians that are doing this are too pussy to face up to their own problems, which is why their country is the way it is now.</p>

<p>Not at all.  They&#39;re simply very good at sorting out your particular deficiencies and calling attention to them.  &quot;Negging&quot; LOOK IT UP.</p>

<p>Yeah, pretty much.</p>

<p>Given all that, it&#39;s nice of you to think so, but I do have other fish to fry.</p>

<p>Not for nothing but why the hell wouldn&#39;t they if they thought it would get them more recruits?  Are you saying they <em>couldn&#39;t</em> alter the test results?  How would you have any idea whether they did or not?</p>
