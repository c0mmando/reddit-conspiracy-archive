       They hire faculty with fake Phds, submit fraudulent "research" to the Thai government, and the Indian administrators are using student tuition to travel and study in France instead of doing their jobs. And that's just the tip of the iceberg... purely revolting.

       U.S. veterans are one of their top recruiting markets because many vets have toured in Thailand, and think sure why not go back for a degree and use my G.I. bill funds... yah they say they are non-profit but its bullshit, just exactly like a for-profit diploma mill

       You can't lump every vet together.  Some are good guys.  I wouldn't go so far as to say most, but, I will say, you play the cards you're dealt.  And if a good guy is dealt a bad hand, that doesn't make him a bad guy.

       Because that's how the recruiters roll.  They build up your hopes while tearing down your character.  "You did pretty good!  Awesome, in fact, except for this ONE THING you personally suck at."
      </p>
      <p>
       Old pick-up artist trick called "negging".  Military recruiters are past masters of this art.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it sounds familiar because, a long time ago, recruiters were chasing me.  Hell, the army offered me FREE SOCKS with the word "ARMY" stenciled on them!  It took a lot of willpower to pass up a deal like that.

       You're suggesting that, the military (from all branches) conspired to alter the test results of a single random student, as some recruitment scheme?

       And that they made one category low on purpose, because they treat recruits like 12 year old boys treat girls?

       Not at all.  They're simply very good at sorting out your particular deficiencies and calling attention to them.  "Negging" LOOK IT UP.

       WAT?
      </p>
      <p>
       The ASVAB was taken in high school. I doubt it was even anyone from the military correcting it. I am sure it was just a proctor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it's all just a recruiting scheme, why would they only alter the scores of one random student?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also scored the highest in my class on the SATs and the ACTs. Did the military alter those as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't the military fake my overall avg? I graduated with like a 72%?
      </p>
      <p>
       I got my ASVAB back. I could see the questions that I got correct and incorrect. . . I would have known if any of my answers were changed. I had everyone else's test in the class to compare it to.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't need to change my score on the Auto Mechanic part. I don't know shit about cars or internal combustion engines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they altered all the questions and all the answers to everyone's exam after the fact, all in an elaborate recruitment scheme. Which failed. Miserably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there was no exam, and it was all just PsyOps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I never even went to High School.

       I was just speculating and playing devil's advocate, you said you were in the 94th percentile but that could easily just be bullshit since there's no way to confirm that without knowing the scores of every other person who's taken it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was simply that I wouldn't put it past the military to lie and scheme and do whatever possible to convince people to enlist.  I don't know anything at all about their recruitment methods so I don't know if this test could be part of it, but I do know that if there were some way to manipulate it that I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

       Fair enough. It's just a multiple choice test though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure they know the scores of everyone else who has taken it. I am sure all the scores went into some sort of government file.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I said 94 to make it sound more believable. I think my overall was actually more like 98th percentile. I crushed basically everything. Except for that grease monkey bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my scores were in line with all my other test scores, in comparison to my class. I graduated in a very small class, so everyone knew what everyone else got. There were plenty who couldn't figure out which way all the gears turned when you spun the crank.
      </p>
      <p>
       I passed most classes with a 65 (the bare minimum), and got the highest score on almost all the standardized tests. I don't have any reason to suspect any sort of manipulation.

       not yet, I'm just saying take this with a grain of salt because i actually have experience with some of the people the article named and they are good people, the whole "the campus is racist" is utter nonsense

       I don't think it's so much, "this campus is racist" as, "webster tends to look the other way as long as the money doesn't change." I get the feeling they are  more ignoring the international students' complaints and not trying to stop corruption in Thailand.

       Not at all.  They're simply very good at sorting out your particular deficiencies and calling attention to them.  "Negging" LOOK IT UP.

       Not for nothing but why the hell wouldn't they if they thought it would get them more recruits?  Are you saying they
