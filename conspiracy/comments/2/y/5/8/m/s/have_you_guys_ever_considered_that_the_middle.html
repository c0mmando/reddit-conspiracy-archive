    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.  Historically it was <em>always</em> considered Northeast Africa.  It wasn&#39;t until the turn of the 20th century that this new term &quot;Middle East&quot; was invented and its borders and definitions have changed multiple times in the century or more since.  Instead of just throwing out incorrect statements maybe you should research the subject a bit?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>always historically a part of Africa</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont think this is accurate. Im sure certain areas were considered africa in historic times, but others were considered asia instead. To be honest, i think even in historic times the vast majority of this region was always thought of as seperate from africa and asia and europe, no matter what demonym they used to describe those peoples. </p>

<p>But, arguing only semantics makes my response worthless, imo. So, ill now turn my focus on a &quot;what if&quot; scenario: What if they used the term &quot;Middle East&quot; for a specific purpose?</p>

<p>Well, this term is inherently ambiguous, unless we consider the entire globe. However, the globe is a sphere, so how can we do that?</p>

<p>I recall a point in northern egypt (actually, Giza IIRC) as being the center of all landmass on the globe. Thus, this could explain the use of &quot;Middle&quot; in &quot;Middle East&quot;. But what about the &quot;East&quot; part?</p>

<p>This is where a more unilateral decision was likely made, consciously, for a certain reason. What constitutes East versus West, on a sphere? (North and South are quite easy). To be honest, it makes more sense to me to consider the longitude of Giza (the center of all land mass) as the dividing line between the western and eastern hemispheres. Yet, it is that this longitude is in Greenwich, United Kingdom, aka the Greenwich Meridian.</p>

<p>Considering this, it woukd be more logical to label the Indian Subcontinent region as the Middle East, as it is right in the middle of the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p>This leads me in two directions, wherein i will pause for awhile at the fork:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The europeans, most likely the British, are the originators of this term. For brevity, ill save consideration of purpose for later comment. However, i would make a small bet that says it has something to do with Greenwich and the designation of the Prime Meridian.</p></li>
<li><p>The Westerners (most likely the Americans, with strong influence from the British in regards to this topic) came up with this term. For this to make any sense, semantically speaking, we could surmise that by labelling the Middle East as such, it was from the American continent&#39;s perspective, which would mean europe would be, more or less, the near east (reasoning that the European continent would still be considered the &quot;East&quot;. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Version 1 might have more malintent than the 2nd, imo.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but this just isn&#39;t right, this region was always considered Northeastern Africa throughout all of antiquity although its names and borders have always changed depending on who controlled the area during different time periods (and this has been by far the most contested region on the planet throughout history).  But again - it was always considered a part of the African continent.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right in saying that was somewhat distinct from &quot;mainland Africa&quot;, but it would&#39;ve been called something like &quot;Northeast Africa&quot; as opposed to being totally distinct as its own place as it is now after being dubbed &quot;Middle East&quot;.</p>

<p>You may find it interesting to hear that this continent was referred to as &quot;Eden&quot; in antiquity (the Hebrew word for paradise) before the Romans came along and renamed it to their equivalent of &quot;Africa&quot;, but that&#39;s a bit outside the topic of this discussion.</p>

<p>If you want some good reading material on this, I would recommend a book called <em>Is There a Middle East</em> and perhaps an even better one called <em>London and the Invention of the Middle East</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if they used the term &quot;Middle East&quot; for a specific purpose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Check out those two books I mentioned, particularly the second one, and you&#39;ll find that this was most definitely the case.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are correct, although the reasons are far more numerous than just the one you mentioned.</p>

<p>Edit: If you asked 50 people where Egypt is, 48 of them will probably tell you &quot;the Middle East&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, how far back are we talking about? I would assume that before widespread geographical knowledge was a thing, these areas were described as individual regions that make up the whole. It would only seem logical, imo, for one to be able to label this as one region versus another, and in reference to another, if they were privvy to all of the surrounding areas as well. </p>

<p>This, to me, would make it seem as if this conversation is only relevant to the time periods of continental conquest was a thing. In ancient times, for example, europeans didnt know much about africa (other than northern africa) at all, save for a few trade routes. And prior to the age of discovery, many europeans considered egypt as a part of asia. (Concluded via rudimentary research in the past hour)</p>

<p>Are there any free pdfs for those books, by any chance? Id like to look into this more. I respect you, but i dont see where you are coming from, so this makes me feel like i am missing something...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far back as you can imagine, this region has been contested for as long as humanity has records.  Mesopotamia is called &quot;the cradle of civilization&quot; - where was this located?  Modern man will tell you &quot;the Middle East&quot;, but this is deceptive.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the Suez Canal is totally artificial and didn&#39;t exist until the 19th century, before it existed there was nothing at all separating Egypt from Jerusalem.  This is all part of the picture.  There was nothing foreign about the trade routes or civilizations or empires or terrain between the two regions, they were both part of the same continent.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How ancient are you talking about here?  I mean the Bible writes about these places, the Romans write about these places.  Pretty much as far back as there are written records these regions were known about and fought over.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And prior to the age of discovery, many europeans considered egypt as a part of asia. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to see a source on that because it is definitely false.  I mean you can just look at a world map and see the obvious, that Egypt is literally sitting there as part of mainland Africa.</p>

<p>Forget about the &quot;middle East&quot; for a second, just look at a map and you&#39;ll see that <em>at least</em> Egypt is clearly a part of the African continent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I respect you, but i dont see where you are coming from</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where I&#39;m coming from is that this was a deliberate Euro-centric deception that&#39;s been perpetuated over the last century.  If we had lived 150 years ago, this debate wouldn&#39;t exist - it was common knowledge that that area was a part of Africa.  As is clear of Europeans (the leaders and royals of course, I&#39;m not trying to insult anyone), they&#39;ve gone to great lengths to place themselves at the center of all great world events and accomplishments.  I think this is all part of it - it just wouldn&#39;t do to have people associating some of the most profound historical events/periods/civilizations as being &quot;African&quot;.  No, no, that&#39;s &quot;the Middle East&quot;.  It all happened in the &quot;Middle East&quot;, this fictional term invented in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, as far as free versions of those books?  I&#39;m not sure.  I was introduced to this subject by a friend who had one of them and I purchased the other one myself because I found this subject so intriguing and with such far reaching implications/consequences.  And it seems to be a pretty closely guarded secret which is another thing that always interests me.</p>

<p>But only from an observer who already knows the larger picture. Many civilizations around the era of the age of discovery only knew of geographical boundaries in their locale. They certsinly have gained word of other lands (from traders, and other adventurers), but my main point, here, is that its all in perspective. Many viewed egypt as part of the then widely held vision of asia, which didnt go far beyond turkey. China and other far east regions were almost fiction for these people, as they only knew of its mysteries and its treasures. </p>

<p>Basically, the people of that age only graphed the northern fringes of africa. Egypt, as you said, was still connected to the areas of jerusalem and that region. Egypt was considered a part of that area, while the north western region of africa was known as (Maghreb)[<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Africa">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Africa</a>], and also called Barbary. </p>

<p>This is the timeframe of the Muslim conquests (or maybe just prior) and the Barbary Corsairs (aka Barbary Pirates) along with their slave trades. These Barbary peoples were known for their fierceness, amd often conducted raids up along the atlantic coast of europe to get white people slaves to sell to subsaharan regions. I believe this is the origination of the term &quot;Barbarian&quot;, btw. These folks knew much about africa, but the europeans, especially before this time, didnt know much at all of the greater african continent.</p>

<p>This is why i suspect that egypt was considered a part of asia, as was other areas of the mesopotamian region, and that it is all about perspective.</p>

<p>However, i will concede that after the age of discovery, terms were more defined to suite the european interests/standards. But this could only have been accompkished by them after they have thoroughly charted the entire african continent, which again, happened during the age of discovery. </p>

<p>We say they considered it as a part of africa, while they say they considerdd it a part of asia, while at the same time, they didnt even have any real distinction from tue two continents as their knowledge of these kands at that time were rudimentary. </p>

<p>Like you said, i bekieve the terms became more important in the later centuries, whem geographical knowledge encompassed almost the entire world. </p>

<p>But back to the main points in your OP, to what purpose would they re-label this area? How does it benefit them, if other than maintaining their views (the europeans) of being the center of everything?</p>

<p>Amd for those books, woukd you mind just paraphrasing the main points? I trust you wont be disingenuous..</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Yes but the point is that nothing separated the two regions in antiquity, they <em>were</em> known.  They shared trade routes, languages, ethnicities, geography, etc.</p>

<p>At no point was Egypt ever considered part of Asia in any research of that time period that I&#39;ve done is all I&#39;m saying.  For instance, it&#39;s quite clear in the Bible that they aren&#39;t referring to Asia when you read it so at least by then this knowledge was widely held.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe this is the origination of the term &quot;Barbarian&quot;, btw.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is.  And the origin of the word &quot;slave&quot; refers to the fact that &quot;slavic people&quot; (aka whites) were historically the main ethnicity of slaves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These folks knew much about africa, but the europeans, especially before this time, didnt know much at all of the greater african continent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But now you&#39;re just saying that Europeans thought it was Asia because they didn&#39;t know what they were talking about.  That may be true (I&#39;m not sure it is, but it might be), but that doesn&#39;t change the reality that what&#39;s now &quot;the Middle East&quot; was part of the same continent as what&#39;s now &quot;Africa&quot; to the people that lived in those regions.  And certainly by the time of the Greeks and Romans it was well established that this region was a part of the African continent (which like I said was referred to as Eden before the Romans came along).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is why i suspect that egypt was considered a part of asia, as was other areas of the mesopotamian region, and that it is all about perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can have the perspective that 1+1=3, it wouldn&#39;t make me correct.  You seem to be saying that Europeans&#39; mistaken interpretation of what this region was is proof that it was part of Asia.  They may have <em>thought</em> that (again I don&#39;t know that they did), but to the people who <em>actually lived there</em> it was all one continent.  The people living in Egypt knew about the people living in what&#39;s now Ethiopia and the people living in what&#39;s now Jerusalem and they knew they were part of the same continent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like you said, i bekieve the terms became more important in the later centuries, whem geographical knowledge encompassed almost the entire world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I agree.  And this is where the study of the origin of the term &quot;Middle East&quot; comes into play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But back to the main points in your OP, to what purpose would they re-label this area? How does it benefit them, if other than maintaining their views (the europeans) of being the center of everything?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the first point is the one you just glossed over - all of European supremacy is thrown into question if we start acknowledging that the first civilization, first empire, foundation of most modern religions, original science, the pyramids, the Hebrew Language (and thus the Bible itself) etc., etc. all came from Africa and, by proxy, from <em>Africans</em> (not from white people, not from Europeans, not from &quot;Middle Easterners&quot;).</p>

<p>The other aspect is that Israel needed to be forcibly separated from Africa in order for what&#39;s gone on there in modern times to happen.  This is where the Suez Canal came into play, literally creating an artificial barrier between the two regions that could be pointed to to say, &quot;Hey, these are two different regions, separated by this body of water.&quot;</p>

<p>Mecca was cut off from Africa, the Sinai Peninsula was cut off from Africa, Mesopotamia was cut off from Africa, the Bible itself was cut off from Africa despite almost every place mentioned in it was (and is) part of the African continent (I mean, King Solomon married a Queen of Ethiopia - doesn&#39;t get more blatant than that).</p>

<p>Do you begin to see the implications of some of this stuff?  Not to harp too much on &quot;keeping the black man down&quot;, but the consequences of a deception like this are pretty far reaching if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think i see where the differences in our thought have provoked this in depth conversation. Essentially, if i understand what youre saying by now, we are almost presenting the same case, with the minor difference of what the early europeans <em>thought</em>, (from my perspective, i suppose im considering only the average person&#39;s extent of knowledge) concerning the placement of egypt and other regions. </p>

<p>In any case, the middle east, asia, africa, mesopotamia, maghreb, they were all &quot;other&quot; regions, amd classified as such. But the classification, from the europeans perspectives, couldnt be done evenly, for the reasons you mentioned. This made it necessary to stratify their labels, even to isolate the &quot;undesirables&quot; (africa) from the holy lands. This makes sense now that i think about it, as religion has always been a strong factor in power-mongering and the persuant conquests and manipulations. </p>

<p>This may explain why the &quot;now&quot; Middle East includes egypt, as egypt is (and was) a major player in the affairs of the holy lands... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, exactly.  By conflating that entire region with this new concept of &quot;the Middle East&quot;, its historical relationship to Africa is obfuscated.  So when people think of Africa today, <em>no one</em> considers Palestine as part of it, despite the fact that it very much was in antiquity to the people who lived there.  Hell, most people today would tell you that Egypt is also part of &quot;the Middle East&quot;, and thus ancient Egypt must have been as well, despite this region always being part of the African continent (and still to this day).</p>

<p>My argument is that this was done not so much out of lack of knowledge but was done deliberately by western powers (in this case specifically by Great Britain) to obscure these links that are quite obvious when you go back in history and read something like the Bible.</p>

<p>The overall point is that the region that is now considered &quot;the Middle East&quot; is and has always been the most contested region on Earth bar none, and if this post inspires even one person to delve more deeply into the history of that region then it was worth it.  There is a lot to uncover when it comes to the history of this planet and humanity and I think a lot of it starts with the study of that area of the world.</p>

<p>I had a moroccan boss at a large period of my life. I also worked with a white, jewish, african (he was from south africa).

<p>Haha I know, see?

<p>&quot;Middle East&quot; is a term with no strict definition, and the boundaries of this region change (and have changed) depending on who you ask and when you ask them.  It&#39;s a vague, ambiguous term - which is usually a sign that there&#39;s something more to the story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess im realizing now that the term middle eastern has more to do with culture (religion is a big part of this) than geographical positions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, precisely.  In my estimation it has quite a bit to do with deception as well.  As you know, words are powerful, symbols are powerful, things like &quot;the Middle East&quot; don&#39;t spring up organically, which is why I always find it interesting looking into stuff like this - more often than not, there&#39;s more to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, check this out. My last reply to you made me ask why morocco wouldnt be considered the middle east as well, if it indeed was a cultural thing.</p>

<p>So i looked into it for a moment, and the wrotten history of morocco starts with the phoenicians, who originated from the canaanites. The land of Canaan is essentially the levant, so i was puzzled that they werent included. Then i found this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where it is thought to refer to a class of merchants or <strong><em>to non-monotheistic worshippers</em></strong> in Israel or neighbouring Sidon and Tyre</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe morroco isnt considered the middle east because their ancestors, during the same period as we discussed in our recent transactions, werent of the same faith, and thus, might have been considered &quot;undesirables.&quot; </p>

<p>I wonder if the same pattern can be found for the indian subcontinent areas that share similar cultures and are informally (if ignorantly) considered &quot;middle easterners&quot;...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can get into a whole different tangent about the Kingdom of Morocco, but that&#39;s a discussion for another thread.  Short answer in my opinion is yes: the current ruling powers in the west have done quite a bit to diminish the legacy of Moors in the average American person&#39;s mind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, I think so - and another thing to remember is that the majority (or at least many) of the people in those regions <em>don&#39;t</em> refer to themselves as &quot;middle Eastern&quot; or &quot;from the Middle East&quot;.  It&#39;s a term invented and used pretty much exclusively by the west, which is probably why the definitions are so fluid.  Who chooses which countries constitute &quot;the Middle East&quot;, ultimately?  It certainly isn&#39;t the countries themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... Well the point i was trying to get is that people in the middle east dont refer to themselves as middle easterners. This was more true not too long ago than it is now, and this is one of the points.</p>

<p>The OP is positting that the term was originated by the europeans, which it was. The post is also suggesting that there is a reason for this... For political manuevering, more or less. </p>

<p>Whether you agree with it or not, some theorists (myself included) acknowledge that by manipulating the definitions, meanings, and use of words allows you to control the people who depend on those definitions, meanings, and usage -- with an advantage that this takes effect fairly subtly. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there are some conspiracy theories that concern this type of &quot;War on Words&quot;. This thread is pointing out one front of this &quot;war,&quot; which happens to have a lot of cultural and religious connections, which ultimately connects to other theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Africa originally only referred to north Africa and has never referred to Asia (which originally only referred to the middle east i.e. to todays &#39;western asia&#39;).  In Jewish tradition one of the reasons the Israelis destroyed the Canaanites was that they were trespassing in the land that God had given to the descendants of Shem and not to the descendants of Ham (the Canaanites) who God had given the land of North Africa west of Egypt to.  </p>

<p>This reflects wiki page on Africa </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Afri was a Latin name used to refer to the Carthaginians, who dwelt in North Africa in modern-day Tunisia. This name seems to have originally referred to a native Libyan tribe; however, see Terence#Biography for discussion. The name is usually connected with Phoenician afar, &quot;dust&quot;, but a 1981 hypothesis[8] has asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) &quot;cave&quot;, in reference to cave dwellers.[9] The same word[9] may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.[10]</p>

<p>Under Roman rule, Carthage became the capital of Africa Province, which also included the coastal part of modern Libya.[11] The Latin suffix &quot;-ica&quot; can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in Celtica from Celtae, as used by Julius Caesar). The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.</p>

<p>According to the ancient Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while &quot;Asia&quot; was used to refer to Anatolia and lands to the east. <strong>A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85–165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa.</strong> As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the middle east (today&#39;s western Asia or western Orient) is not the central asia that is to the east of it or the far east that is to the east of central asia what part of Asia (i.e. the orient) is to the <em>west</em> of the middle east (or Western orient / east)?  Israel now according to some,   maybe the once Hittite Turkey although they are mongolian asians descendants now?</p>

<p>But  Asia: east of Suez.  </p>

<p>Africa: west of Egypt.  </p>

<p>Europe: north west of Turkey.</p>

<p>Egypt is the anomaly.</p>

<p>Duh.</p>
