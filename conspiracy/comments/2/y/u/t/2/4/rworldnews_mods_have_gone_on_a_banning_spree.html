    <div class="md"><p>There is also a difference between stupid and ignorant.  I think there is definitely a bottom percentage who would just go to the biggest crowd or to have one principal interest satisfied...such as abortion or gun control, i think they are easily spotted and easier propagandized.  But nearly half of people just need to be better informed and educated.  It&#39;s hard to have an opinion on a scientific matter with no understanding of science.  If a person has no capacity for science, then they have to trust their emotional response to the topic.  Emotions are easily played, that is evident in watching mainstream media.  It is an emotional roller coaster of programming, with nearly no scrutiny.  Whatever infotainment will make the most money or manipulate the narrative desirably is what we from <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6">these six</a> corporations.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi verylongusernamewow, I know mod explanations are not welcome in such outrage threads, but I&#39;ll give it a try anyway. Sorry, this will be a tad bit long and I don&#39;t really have a good TL;DR.</p>

<p>The reason for your recent comments not showing up is your negative karma. That is a measure applied by many subs against downvote trolls and spammers. It occasionally also hits new users with very unpopular opinions who exclusively post against the grain across all of reddit.</p>

<p>In your case it was mostly <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2y0eaq/a_report_outlining_the_extent_of_russias_military/cp59jye">this comment</a> in which you claimed</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is just as bad being gay in the US as in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is of course a very controversial opinion and was thus met with a huge number of downvotes.</p>

<p>Your recent posting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> might have been enough to offset the negative karma collected in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, so you&#39;re probably fine to post in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> at the moment. If you notice any difficulties, just send us a modmail.</p>

<p>We&#39;re aware the mood in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> can be a violently anti-Russian circlejerk at times, and we as mods welcome anyone who presents a different opinion so as to foster an actual discussion, but you&#39;ll also have to understand that you&#39;re not making any impact if you don&#39;t cater your comments a little to the general opinion. You&#39;re just reinforcing the view that there can only be one opinion on the matter and everyone else is just a lunatic. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the reason we won&#39;t lightly grant anyone an exception from the negative karma rules. We want those with an opposing opinion to be forced to formulate their point in a way that is more probable to be accepted a a valid opinion statement by the majority, so that they are having an impact instead of merely reinforcing the existing stereotypes.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of such an approach being valued by the community and leading to an actual discussion:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2yfpko/russian_president_vladimir_putin_has_revealed_he/cp95o8i">https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2yfpko/russian_president_vladimir_putin_has_revealed_he/cp95o8i</a></p>

<p>kindofa TL;DR:  You are not banned and welcome to contribute. Just try to work yourself into the positive overall karma range or message the mods to get comments approved. Also for the sake of supporting your political position: Consider formulating your points in a way that is more likely to be accepted by the community, such an approach is much more effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if downvote brigades accomplish their job with new accounts, they actually get rewarded and you won&#39;t see their comments? Thats hilarious. How about you just, you know, let the down votes and up votes decide what shows up, like how reddit was designed? Is this another case of &quot;we mods know better than you, let US take care of hiding comments so YOU don&#39;t have to!&quot; this shit is getting more and more ridiculous every day. Just, for fucks sake, stop trying to sugar coat it. The admins and a group of mods are trying to censor reddit. We get it. No need to put lipstick on a pig.

    <div class="md"><p>This makes a great deal of evil sense if you consider this from the perspective of a marketing monkey running a multi-user/multi-subreddit posting campaign.  Especially a campaign that uses more than one post working together ... just look at the sex doll pics followed up with a convenient AMA ... anybody who mentioned the frequency of sex doll posts (and how they fought their way back to the top over and over again) in that 24 hour period quickly disappeared ... just one of many.  Shit was paid for YO.  Reddit made at least $20,000 off the initial campaign and god knows how much will come from actual sales in the next 90 days (20% commission on those dolls is no joke).  Serious gravy there and this is just one campaign.  The gaming going on is tremendous.  I wonder how many long games are being played with many posts working together on one campaign?  Just look at the posters on <a href="/r/awww">/r/awww</a> and how quickly some of the same reposts are rising to the top followed up with brand loyalty posts related to the cute puppy.  I wonder if there are multiple layers of bots fighting each other outside of direct reddit control.  I bet the analysts are losing their minds combatting the indirect gaming.</p>

<p>Every one of the dead had friends and family, and they will demand and deserve justice. I honestly don&#39;t know whether the propagandists, who are complicit in <em>mass murder</em>, will be hanged or imprisoned or completely forgiven. But frankly I don&#39;t see why they should be forgiven, and I don&#39;t know whether I could.</p>

<p>They were okay with a puppet government when it was controlled by the Russians, jackass. Don&#39;t try to paint it like this war can be reduced to &quot;good vs. evil&quot; because that&#39;s not the case, although I don&#39;t expect a useful idiot like you to comprehend how complex this whole conflict is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The western press is framing it all as Russian aggression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that&#39;s what it is, a Russian aggression which is a reaction to US trying to take over Russia&#39;s unofficial playground. Nothing surprising in here, I can imagine Israel would go apeshit too if a major pro-Palestine force appeared in US congress. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the US public is okay with slaughtering civilians because they have no idea what&#39;s really happening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This coming from someone who is completely uncritical of what Russians did in this conflict is plain hilarious. You&#39;re probably one of those chucklefucks who dismiss any evidence/reports that contradict your views with the &quot;US/western propaganda&quot; card. That said there is definitely a lot of shit going on and you are at least partially right, not many newspapers/sites decided to publish the information about pro-Russian civilians being burned alive in Odessa as it would screw over the oversimplified narrative. In a sense, you and the western media have much in common.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Ukrainian military is bombing, shelling, shooting, and burning to death their own citizens. This has created a massive refugee crisis in which 1 million people are fleeing for their lives. </p>

<p>Russia is not only doing its best to address the matter with defense, aid and relocation, but they are the country in the best position to do so because of their geographic location, they can bridge the language barrier, and they have the logistical capabilities and the military means to distribute aid and provide protection, and the best part is they are being demonized for it. </p>

<p>Not only that but to add insult to injury, the same scum who caused the crisis are threatening and bullying the victims and those offering aid, but that is just standard behavior for the neocons. They commit the crimes then point fingers at someone they have prepped the public to hate for months and decades in advance. (Keep an eye on Venezuela now for this reason. The good thing is the Maduro gov has caught on to the destabilization game and is talking about it loudly, and that&#39;s why they are getting slammed in the press and by the Whitehouse, but even the media is starting to call out the government PR scum for their blatant lies.)</p>

<p>Who else do the neocons, the media, and the world expect to address the humanitarian crisis? No help, solutions or alternatives are being offered by the west, just media cover up of the refugee crisis and sabre rattling and irrational condemnation. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s the narrative they need to justify a potential US intervention so US corporations (such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil) and Joe Biden&#39;s and John Kerry&#39;s sons with the help of their Ukrainian fascist oligarch lapdogs can sell the Ukrainian people out to the IMF for 15bil in loans and steal their oil and natural gas.</p>

<p><strong>The reason for your recent comments not showing up is your negative karma</strong>. That is a measure applied by many subs against downvote trolls and spammers. It occasionally also hits new users with very unpopular opinions who exclusively post against the grain across all of reddit.</p>

<p>In your case it was mostly <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2y0eaq/a_report_outlining_the_extent_of_russias_military/cp59jye">this comment</a> in which you claimed</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is just as bad being gay in the US as in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>which is of course a very controversial opinion and was thus met with a huge number of downvotes</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this the policy, then? Controversial opinions equate to downvotes, which translate to invisibility? Why not just remove this from <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, to ensure that voices cannot be effectively silenced by brigades and against the grain thinking.</p>

<p>You do understand, coming from this board to yours, can be quite frustrating (for myself and others I see try and start dialogues and are quickly at -20 because they simply think Putin didn&#39;t start he holocaust or something).</p>

<p>If you truly do want to improve your sub, this should not be <em>baked in</em> to your visibility settings.</p>

<p>This is especially juicy since they now know that they&#39;re not moving comments to the bottom of the page any more, they&#39;re making them disappear altogether.</p>
