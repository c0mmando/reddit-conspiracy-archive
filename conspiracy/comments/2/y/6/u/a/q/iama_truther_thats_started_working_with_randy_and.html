        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi r/conspiracy, I&#39;m Noah Watenmaker, and I&#39;m doing this for my own safety. This whole expos√© needs to be in the open because the forces we&#39;re dealing with have the ability to generate false arrests, imprisonment, and defamation at will. The Quaids have accused my Father, Alan Watenmaker of the Estate Planning firm Hoffman Sabban and Watenmaker, of writing a fraudulent living trust that allows bankers and asset managers at the top of the Hollywood Elite to siphon royalties off artists. </p>

<p>This is tied into densely networked Police Media Corruption that uses false arrests and trials to manipulate the value of artist to increase profits for the elites and control who has access to power.</p>

<p>If you want to update yourself on the situation, look at the documentation provided by Evi Quaid here:

    <div class="md"><p>Spendthrift trusts and trust clauses that strip the mentally unincompetent of their ability to access funds are perfectly legal and have nothing to do with Hollywood.  Evi Quaid is a nothing and a nobody.   Randy Quaid is a third tier character actor.  They are both patently mentally incompetent and likely drugged out of their skulls.  They need help, and if you&#39;re a barred attorney, you&#39;re doing them a disservice and should be stripped f your status.</p>

<p>Second, while I was struggling with whether or not and to what extent this spontaneous AMA would be policed under the new AMA rules, I went to Evi&#39;s twitter page and saw what appears to be a tweet from the person the OP claims to be (presently unverified).</p>

<p>In a nutshell, there&#39;s a tweet on Evi&#39;s page which appears to be from Noah Watenmaker implicating his dad. OP claims to be Noah, doing this AMA for &quot;safety&quot; in some way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This system can be slipped into place behind any celebrities back by any estate lawyer and business manager collaboration. This particular circle also involves Courtney Love Kobain and her daughter Francis, dealing with Kobain Estate defrauding and character defamation campaign. Other artists are expected to come out when they find the same issues with their living trusts.</p>

<p>When celebrities reach a certain status they are usually brought by there manager to a specific boutique Estate Planning firm for a living trust to be written up. From that point on the &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;spendthrift&quot; backdoors have been created, legally buried in the fine print of the living trust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The corruption looks to be pandemic across elite Hollywood Banking and Estate Planning for Celebrities. The entire .01%er attorney/banker/asset manager class in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara (likely everywhere) appears to be in on this legal scheme to harvest artists&#39; royalty revenue via living trusts and launder money through artist assets and real estate holdings. </p>

<p>We are dealing with an industry designed from the ground up to legally defraud creators of revenue and drive profit to bankers, lawyers, media moguls, and other showbusiness executives. </p>

<p>This is not a small group of people. This is business as usual for the estate industry. The same living trusts written to &quot;protect&quot; artists and their creations have language hidden in them that makes it easy for business managers and lawyers to seize control of assets and revenue streams.</p>

<p>Look at the documentation posted in Evi Quaid&#39;s twitter taken from her will as written by Hoffman, Sabban and Watenmaker. Specifically the &quot;crazy clause&quot; that allows control of the trust to be seized from any parties deemed &quot;mentally unfit&quot; to handle spending money. Quantifying these claims is easily done with television broadcasts of trumped up charges and false arrests provided by TMZ and their network of on-call crime stagers and arresting detectives. There is also a &quot;spendthrift&quot; clause used to revoke control if any party is overspending that is equally simple to activate.</p>

<p>The evidence is in plain sight, this has been happening for decades and it is done in full disclosure. The whole process is legal and vetted. It will be difficult to prosecute the methods, but we&#39;re hoping to turn out a few whistleblowers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. The videos are funny and informative, but far too easy to discredit or ignore.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see the Quaid&#39;s put in the effort become common-law sovereign entities and return to America to take these accusations to a people&#39;s tribunal in the middle of Downtown LA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The specific claim I&#39;m addressing is that the Quaid Living Trust was designed to defraud the Quaid&#39;s of royalties, revenue streams, and control over assets. </p>

<p>By inserting officer revocation clauses and new trustees into the trust, the Starwhackers create a legal loophole system to siphon wealth.</p>

<p>There are claims of Police Media Corruption, wherein TMZ/WB has operatives within certain Police Departments and Judicial Systems who can create false charges and defamation campaigns against artists in order maniulate revenue streams for studio/manager/attorney profit. The Quaid&#39;s have paper evidence of foul play from tabloids and the Marfa, TX PD before their false arrest on 9/24/09. They also have evidence that bogus news stories were generated to cover up all the real developments in their case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The starwhackers are those who involve themselves in the legal usurpation of artist royalties and assets through backdoors written in the living trusts of celebrities. Randy and Evi accuse specific attorneys, producers, and business managers of wrongdoing, but this is a cultural problem rapant in Hollywood, and is built into standard estate planning.</p>

<p>I only started working on this project yesterday. I am working to investigate who created the fraudulent trusts and what can be done to remedy the situation and end the corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Randy and Evi Quaid have accused a particular group of people and have been showing specific forged documents showing the pilfering of their assets. Check out their videos for specific allegations, names and such. They are also alleging that the Jackson Estate and the Cobain Estate are being manipulated by the same group.</p>

<p>My role in this is to spread awareness and to find a solution and help create an alternative system for celebrity and artist trusts and asset management, because what we are seeing in Hollywood is institutionalized, totally legal corruption and character assassination, which almost everyone has been brainwashed to think is impeccable.</p>

<p>The present system simply needs to be dropped entirely. Details don&#39;t much matter when you&#39;re have to empty a horrifically overflowing septic tank of a society filled with shitty false-idol slave based institutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in total agreement with you on the last part. I&#39;ve seen some of the Quaids&#39; videos and the people they mention aren&#39;t on my list of heroes. Rather, anything but. I wish them the best as well as yourself. It&#39;s a dangerous game exposing corruption and indignities on a large scale. Most of the population gets it in medium to small doses as well. So I hope that by opening this up and punishing people for all these inhumanities we can expose more and really clean up this world of the selfish viruses that plague humankind. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my direct experience with Evi and my investigation into their behavior, I have not found them to be mentally disabled. On the contrary, they provide coherent narratives and documentation to back them up. I am personally dealing with a real crazy, meth-addicted celebrity couple right now, so I know what to look for. I am seeing none of the delusional, manipulative behavior one typically sees in a paranoid, drug-addled artist.</p>

<p>Yes, the Quaid&#39;s are an eccentric couple, but completely harmless. From what I can tell, the accusations of ultraviolence, insanity, and meth addiction are bogus. </p>

<p>And, they are definitely more mentally sound than the sociopaths who engineered the legal system that steals their assets and revenues.</p>
