Of course, I&#39;d still need the internet for bill pay, email, etc. But really want to journal, read books and take a huge step away from social media and news of any sort. Sometimes, I feel like this sub feeds more anxiety, egotism (I KNOW WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING, I CAN CONNECT DOTS...) and just plain disinformation into my life. Sometimes, I think I&#39;m apathetic to my personal goals, because it all seems overwhelming or pointless. </p>

<p>Has anyone gone offline for an extended period of time? Did it help? How soon did you cheat? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do it. I started reading for fun and it has been very therapeutic. I&#39;m reading some scifi, kind of allows you to keep in touch with the conspiraital thought.
I read enders game last week and it was entertaining. Reading Oryx and Crake now and it is very good.
Edit, also, no TV has been way easier to adjust to than I thought it&#39;d be. Been off of TV for almost a year now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;d recommend maybe <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em> to start with (that&#39;s the one that Blade Runner is based on), or Ubik perhaps.  Some of his stuff is a little bit harder to pin down so these are a bit more accessible until you get a feel for where he&#39;s coming from with some of his later and more esoteric stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did this about 4-5 years ago for maybe 6-7 months i think (for me playing basketball helped a lot), i felt like i woke up from a dream and before this time passed so fast i did not even realize how old i was lol after i started using the net again i realized just how pointless and powerful it was at the same time and from that day i never look at the net the same way... in the end its just a tool and you are the one that is suppose to be in control and learn from it not being consumed by it . I value my time and of others very greatly from that day on.</p>

<p>Little advice, don&#39;t think about how long to go &quot;offline&quot; just enjoy, live, have fun maybe find some healthy activity and you&#39;ll see what really matters and when/if you want to come back lol you will see things in a very different way but remember no one is perfect and there is always room for improvement !</p>

<p>I highly recommend documenting the entire process; it&#39;s easy to forget and many of what you can learn happens upon review &amp; reflection.</p>

<p>Also, if you find that you &quot;can&#39;t&quot;, won&#39;t or don&#39;t, take that of that too...big lessons there.</p>

<p>this sub feeds</p>

<p>I agree but lol it gets so much worse out there on the internet.  This place is rather ... idk predictable?  Anyways yes back to your question yes.  Yes it is good to take a break.  77% of devlp&#39;d nations are internet-users now.  We all, every single one of us, need to take a break from time to time.  There is a lot of positivity out there in the world, and inside of you.  In this sub, sometimes what we is like amplification and recirculation of something negative.  We can witness first-hand how a small thing, some negativity, some positivity, can be put into this system and become a huge thing.  </p>

<p>On the internet it is really easy to meet negativity with even more negativity.  There&#39;s almost no consequence to &#39;name-calling&#39; for the caller or the callee.  Other sites out there, good lord the comments section...  but on reddit we have etiquette at least.  Not so negative here in a direct, vulgar way, like other &#39;comment sections&#39; –  LESS SHOUTING and all that, but still, negative talk.  Face it, take any of the stuff that people say in this sub, and then say it out loud in a group of people and BAM they&#39;re gonna tell you to stop being a downer.  AKA negative.</p>

<p>The net result us of dealing with all of this <em>fucking</em> ”negativity“ is that we end up in a state of neutrality.  Maybe you&#39;re more worried about becoming neutral than you are negative.  Because we have to fight that as well only it isn&#39;t so easily recognized.</p>

<p>I know a lot of people who are still woodfolk with very little internet/mobile exposure and I would have to say they are the most positive people that I know, to be around.  They seem to take the time-honored approach to life of where you just throw up your hands and say &quot;oh well.  I don&#39;t know about all that.  we&#39;ll see.&quot;  I&#39;m not suggesting you cut the soles off your shoes and go live in a tree and play a flute or nothing, it&#39;s just that I would highly recommend the occasional extended internet break to anyone.  Most especially some of our fellow prospiricy-hypothesists here on this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook has set about experimenting on you and your interactions with your friends. They time distort your communications and use heuristic triggers for experience shaping which their marketing psychologists have determined will alter you and your friends behavior in ways that benefit them. I say evict that poison from your life and learn to connect with people in person again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got rid of Facebook at the end of 2014.  I reactivated it twice soon after to see what I had been &quot;missing&quot;, and it was all meaningless bullshit.  Sometimes you need to take a step back and look at life from a different perspective in order to determine what&#39;s important in life.</p>

<p>I can tell you this much - Facebook and the word &#39;important&#39; should never be in the same sentence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I neglected all media/internet for three months once and continued to read my philosophy books. One day I wanted to take a break, didn&#39;t know what to do until I remembered I had access to television, hooked it up...and laughed at everything this box was portraying as I channel surfed. That lasted for about twenty minutes before I dismantled it to go for a walk. The feeling was that of sobriety while media outlets try <em>so</em> hard to intoxicate you, involve you in something that essentially is b.s..</p>

<p>Nowadays I would say that it sounds like you should go camping or take some sort of an outdoor trip of some kind. That&#39;s what I&#39;m currently putting together to do and hopefully learn to do more frequently so, that in those days the fits of stress or depression are too great, I can just grab some food, my pack, and leave. It also helps teach you about bushcraft and survival should you ever need the skillset in the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s your decision. I realized the toxicity of this sub during the DC truckers strike. So many bullshit pics being posted and many from respected members of the community. </p>

<p>I found a hobby myself. Lego and haven&#39;t looked back. My tinfoil hat still gleams as you see I come here. The difference is I realized its a form of entertainment not information. </p>

<p>We haven&#39;t watched the news in 3 years at my house. We have Netflix and amazon plus an Xbox 360. Some games and a basement of lego. I don&#39;t see a need to drop off the map for a while unless you feel its taking too much time from your life.</p>

<p>As I said you realize the main point. You can bet people will still be bitching and fighting in here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legos, huh? I crochet and craft, I&#39;m involved in several community groups, but what I really want to be doing is WRITING. I&#39;m waiting for Stephen King&#39;s memoir On Writing, and I&#39;m going to read his suggested 100 books for writers. Of course, I&#39;m online now, also listening to my Roku... So.much.wasted.time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really watch the news, but hear stuff here, on fb, on the radio. I was screaming at NPR the other day (I leave the radio on for the dog when I&#39;m not home... Fuck NPR, they sold out!), I can&#39;t see news now without getting enraged at the utter bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally don&#39;t like the idea of reading &quot;how to write&quot; books.  To me the best thing to do to become a better writer is to just read everything you can get your hands on, all genres, all writing styles, all authors, all time periods, etc.</p>

<p>Just my opinion.</p>

<p>But having said that, I&#39;ve always liked this <a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/so-you-want-be-writer">poem by Bukowski</a> that kinda talks about this - it&#39;s always resonated with me, perhaps it will for you too.</p>

<p>This is exactly what I have been trying to express and no one gets it. They say &quot;writing takes work&quot; and &quot;just push through your block&quot; and other bullshit. </p>
