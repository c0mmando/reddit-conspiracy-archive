The bigger the money, the bigger the evil, the more the body count, to obtain profit, industry, resources, for pennies on the dollar.  Research it.  Thats the reason for russia and Isreal being &quot;stripped&quot; of clothing recently. </p>

<p>Its the government, but more so their sponsers above and in the shadows that are not to be trusted. Our government, the neocons, Isreal, England, and are puppets of these agencies.  As fucked up as this sounds, Russia&#39;s  government is more for the people than ours.  The good guys today,  As odd as this sounds are Isreal, Syria, Iran, and Russia.   Bad guys, the ones pulling the strings at big evil.  including the FED. </p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s a good thing  there are more than just &quot;school&quot; books out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We cut off japans war supplies we were sending them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A perfectly legal, reasonable and normal thing to do.</p>

<p>Especially in the face of increasing militarization and aggression. I.e. bombing China. Invading Indochina.... The back of these invasions were held up by guess what, US Oil.</p>

<p>Sanctions were to be lifted upon Japan&#39;s withdrawal, but guess what Japan didn&#39;t do... England even went so far as to try to <em>appease</em> Japan by limiting trade with China. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sold war supplies to thier enemys</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also known as our allies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>froze their money in us accounts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A perfectly legal, reasonable and normal thing to do.</p>

<p>Especially in the face of increasing militarization and aggression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>leaked the intelligence to them where our ships would be</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow it&#39;s almost like misdirection and intelligence are an important part of security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you know what wasnt at pearl harbor, our carriers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes because they were busy doing things.  One of them was en route to Pearl Harbour and due to arrive the day before, but slowed by weather.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We did also have the japanese code broke, we did know they were coming, we did allow it to be attacked</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was literally zero, none, zilch quality source on a definite PH attack.</p>

<p>Basic logic would suggest a Japanese attack <em>somewhere</em> in the pacific, and as luck would have it- US mobilization in the pacific reflected this. Their general belief (and also as logic would dictate) was that an attack would come <em>somewhere</em> in the thousands of  square miles of Southeast Asia or Philippines area. It was also thought that an attack would come much later, like spring, not December.  One can easily see the brash, arrogant oversights in defensive posture exhibiting by Gen. MacArthur.</p>

<p>Generally intelligence messages about PH were dismissed as noise or unimportant, and in the situation of FRUPAC had to deal with the massive clusterfuck that was  OP20G bureaucracy.  Simply receiving basic information does not mean that basic information becomes quickly and accurately disseminated among the relevant officials.  It wasn&#39;t as though there was an empty office with a bored clerk that got a phone call saying &quot;Japs attacking Pearl Harbour eta 3 hours&quot; and then he could have gotten on the horn to the President and told him. People were weeding through piles and piles of information, a lot of it completely useless or irrelevant which then had to be interpreted, verified and passed through a chain of command- who then had to organize a response.</p>

<p>None of the more circumstantial evidence including hawaii-to-tokyo information on fleet strength, nor the hawaii consulate destroying papers indicate an attack on PH, only an increasingly antagonistic posture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is the rule to getting a population behind war. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The population had &quot;been behind the war&quot; for some time, seeing as how millions of tons of supplies and aid were being doled out to their allies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The America people wanted nothing to do with WWII after the death and treasure cost of WWI</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the fall of France, many Americans believed war with Germany was both inevitable and prudent.  Shortly thereafter the lend-lease program began and extended its naval security zone deep into the atlantic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Study history</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>hahahaha. Good one.</p>

Money.  They sold weapons to both sides, loaned both sides money to pay for those weapons, and war costs, at interest, didn&#39;t care who won, because both sides were on their payroll, the losing countries who ever they were were in financial ruin, their industires were bought for pennies on the dollar, by the same ones selling arms, loaning money,  then when it was over, they cashed in and the populations of all sides where indebtet to those banks and  such, to pay back what the governments  borrowed from them at interest.  They dont give a fuck about facisism, communism, capitolism, or religion.  They care about money.  There is no bigger racket than war.  The made money on the death and destruction of the peoples, and on the backs of the survivors to repay them.  Win win for them.  Lay down and like it for the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, look into how hitler came to power, ther real interests behind it.  I did not see you other response, I will look at it, please do the same as far as hitler goes.  I like debate, welcome it, we learn from each other as far as what things are,  the one piece of advice I give, is to not accept any one source as gospal, without verifing it.  The Warren commission, is the prime example. Taken at face value, a convienent neat tidy investagation, in a shiny cover, with impressive names on it.  One or the biggest books of bull shit ever recorded neck and neck with the official 911 commission report.  If you accept those load of shit, I have no time and other efforts i need to do that will fall on open intelligent minds, not nieve by choice closed ones.  Your opinions on those will tell me which you are.  Fair enough?</p>

<p>The real interest behind being in power is being in power.</p>

<p>Then stop talking out of your ass and replying arbitrarily. Why would you respond to something you didn&#39;t read? That sounds like the same way you do &quot;research&quot;.</p>

<p>You want a list of sources that aren&#39;t youtube documentaries?</p>

<p>Allen. W. S. 1984. The Nazi Seizure of Power</p>

<p>Broszat, M. 1987.Hitler and the Collapse of Weimar Germany </p>

<p>Spotts, F. 2013. Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics</p>

<p>Turner, H. A. 1985. German Big Business &amp; the Rise of Hitler</p>

<p>Barnhart, M.A. 1988. Japan prepares for total war</p>

<p>Turner, H. A. 1997. Hitler&#39;s Thirty Days To Power</p>

<p>Tooze, A. 2008. Wages of destruction</p>

<p>Evans, R. J. 2005. The Coming of the Third Reich</p>

<p>Try those. I believe they are all readily available.</p>

<p>or one can parse the <em>Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression documents</em> or  the <em>Documents on German Foreign Policy</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>or are not bright enough to google hitlers sponsers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see how reliance on quick google searches had brought you to your conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>prescot bush was one of the few. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vogler, Thyssen, Krupp, Farben, Hugenberg, among others. Bush owned <em>a single share</em> in a company of 4000 shares of a bank which held shares in over a dozen other companies... <em>one</em> of which happened to be located in Germany.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the bush name should look familiar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TIL multi-national corporations with thousands of shareholders existed before the 90s.</p>

<p>JFK to 911 Everything Is A Rich Man&#39;s Trick
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jfk+to+911+a+rich+man%27s+game">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jfk+to+911+a+rich+man%27s+game</a></p>

<p>That is the best documentary and accounting I have seen on JFK. its long, 3.3 hours, I almost turned it off the first time I watched it when the narrator said 8 teams of shooters.  Glad I didn&#39;t.  The theory on JFK, (some the other info is soso) this guy knocked out of the park.  5 of 5 on JFK info.  I can say I am 99.8% sure this is what happened. I think a grand jury would issue an indictment with the evidence, and presentation.  Lot of new good info, and analyisis on JFK.  I would say case closed on JFK, no loose ends.   the only reason I dont say 100% because the guy is alive, and this info got out.  Only shadow of a percent of a doubt.  Worth the long watch.</p>
