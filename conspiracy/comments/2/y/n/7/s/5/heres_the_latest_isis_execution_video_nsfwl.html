      <p>
       Happens at around 9m or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this one, it is said that an ISIS youngster is putting a bullet through the head of an Israeli spy or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just looks so damn well-produced, etc.  I’ve seen a LOT of Mexican cartel beheadings, murders, etc…and they don’t look
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       like this.  Even using a camera filming at a shit ton of frames per second, I would think that the bullet hole in the head of the person who is shot would have ruptured a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       more of their head/skull and not have been such a perfectly clean little hole with almost no blood coming out of it as is the case in the video.  Also, I recall little if any real kick back of the dude’s head as the bullet lands, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway…It might be real.  I'm not saying it's definitely not…but there’s just so much b.s. and fuckery that’s been going on with this whole ISIS shit that it’s turned into a “Little boy who cried wolf” sort of thing with me where even if a real execution at the hands of ISIS
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       indeed take place, my first reaction would be to doubt the veracity of it at this point regardless.  TPTB are full of so much bullshit that one would be a fool
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also...this ISIS member putting a bullet through the head of an
       <em>
        Israeli
       </em>
       spy??  I mean...if this
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       happened...wouldn't Israel and Nutbagyahoo go fucking ape shit crazy and just start carpet bombing Palestine to no end or whatever?  He's obviously fucking insane already and bombs with little provocation.  Yet ISIS "murdering a poor Israeli!!" isn't all over the MSM?

       It's a strange one. Did they get the alleged spy to engage in that dramatic reenactment for the cameras (middle of the video) or do they follow all their recruits with a camera? Either way,

       Your perception of entry bullet wounds comes from Hollywood crap. It's a small caliber bullet and the exit wound is the one that rips out a larger hole, not the entry one. Also up to a certain caliber there is little or no blood right as the bullet enters in the flesh, blood would start pouring out after a short delay. Also forehead consists of the skull bone, not much flesh in front.

       No it doesn't.  It comes from watching dozens upon dozens of actual shootouts and assassinations online.  Didn't I mention that in the OP?

       But there was no "larger exit hole" anywhere.  It's not like the back of his head had a bigger hole or anything.

       Regardless, nothing in what I mentioned above said "This is a fake for sure!"  I was just posing questions is all.  As I said, it might be real.  Regardless of whether it's real or not, however, the great production value in it actually works
       <em>

       its believability.

       This one is real. Look how the blood pours from the nose and mouth as he lays there. Trust me it's real. And no, at close range with a FMJ bullet the entry wound would react just like his did. Clean entrance with a slightly larger exit because full Metal jackets don't expand which would be pretty clean. It's definately real.

       Yeah.  I was definitely thinking about that in particular.  The way the blood was pouring from the nose and mouth was a definite indication of at least some legitimacy.

       That being said, your analysis seems valid, and I slightly lean toward this perspective over thinking it's a definite fake.

       I understand your concern. I'm probably the most cynical ass around but that execution is real. That said, the production is definately doctored for dramatic and cinematic effect. I think this is to appeal to the low IQ idiot recruits who they know will watch it and then want to join.

       What's worse about the entire scenario is that, again, ISIS is
       <em>
        at the very least
       </em>
       funded and supported by the US/Israel to a significant extent.  The blood on ISIS's hands is blood on the US/Israels' hands.  Of course they don't care about this, but they're still drenched in red nonetheless.

       The guy calling for a "wave of nukes" for mass extermination of the human race that doesn't see the world the way he does is calling
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       lost! The slow and ignorant "Nazification" of the world is unfolding before our eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently jokingly posted about the boston bombing being staged and to my amusement it manifested all the things you would suspect. Hatred, name calling, attacks on my character, no discussion, the usual. It's like pulling a lever on a machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       That guy is a lever on the machine. An agent created out of the hypnosis of the spectacle. Ready to hold his flag high as the bombs drop worldwide, like a good little Satanist space monkey.
