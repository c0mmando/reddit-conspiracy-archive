I know, &quot;just look up&quot;. I see them, but the more i learn about contrails and atmospheric conditions, the more i realize that it is POSSIBLE that we may be wrong on this one.
So go on, let me have it, but i gently challenge you to spend two or three hours googling and reading and listening to the &quot;evidence&quot;, not just reading the titles but really examining it. For me it was a real eye opener.
Peace to all.

If you really want to be sure for yourself and base your decision on evidence, than you should wait for a day of heavy persistent contrails and collect the rain water that will surely follow 2 or 3 days after the trails have made the entire sky a dull white-gray haze.</p>

<p>Test that water and you will find absurd amounts of Aluminum, Barium, and stromium. This has been proven over and over again and you should do it for yourself if you don&#39;t believe it. Whether or not it&#39;s intentional really shouldn&#39;t matter.

    <div class="md"><p>Speculatively, and this is pure speculation based on what is planned and what has been researched and developed in the past but is denied vehemently to occur in the present day, it would be a result of clandestine geo-engineering and SRM (solar radiation management) using stratospheric aerosols added to jet fuel. Well that, and good old fashioned cloud seeding. Unfortunately, you would have a fair amount of normal contrails misidentified as such, and a plethora of crackpot theories surrounding them used to discredit anyone who addresses this type of black / special access project and research.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure how you carry out collecting rain water wrong. Maybe using a dirty cup...As far as mis-representing the data, everywhere I looked had a scan of the actual lab results. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha this is funny, I have also been a confirmed conspiracy theorist for years, but I&#39;ve never believed in chemtrails. I&#39;ve seen the lines in the sky before but never really paid any attention. Only last week did I come around to the idea. I woke up to an absolutely beautiful clear blue sky, and I decided to go run some errands. On the drive to the grocery store, I noticed a plane flying overhead with a fine, thick line of &#39;exhaust&#39; coming out its rear. Over the course of the five minute trip, this &#39;contrail&#39; spread out into a perfect ribbon of mist. It kind of piqued my interest. I parked and went into the store, and was in there for maybe half an hour. When I came out, there were literally a dozen plus new ribbons crisscrossing the sky. The realization that these were chemtrails kind of stunned me. It was like having cold water splashed on my face. I actually took a picture of a couple of the trails, and caught one of the planes circling back around:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/OHSKZj0.jpg?1">http://i.imgur.com/OHSKZj0.jpg?1</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to tell in tell in the picture, but it&#39;s not a jet and it&#39;s not a passenger plane; it&#39;s a cargo plane. I went home and made lunch, and within about an hour, the beautiful crystal clear sky had been completely overtaken by a thin haze. Not clouds. Haze. I&#39;m convinced. I don&#39;t know <em>what exactly</em> they are spraying, but <em>they are spraying something</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4WhYKP83zo">On July 15th, 2014, citizens from Northern California rallied to create the largest attendance ever at the Shasta County Supervisors chambers (400+, chairman Les Baugh confirmed this attendance record at the start of the meeting). The primary purpose of this meeting was to present information that proves there is a very dire heavy metal contamination and UV radiation issue across the Shasta County region (and the world). A list of 10 experts presented data to the board to confirm the legitimacy of the concerns being addressed. At the end of the presentation, the board voted unanimously to investigate the heavy metal contamination and passed resolutions accordingly.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont understand why, because some planes left contrails, you suddenly think these are chemtrails?</p>

<p>Did you look the aircraft up on any free flight tracking app? Its clearly not a military plane, you can easily identify what aircraft it is and what it does. So what if its a cargo plane? Do you know how many cargo aircraft there are transporting mail etc? I&#39;d like to see you guys doing the <em>slightest</em> bit of research and telling us the flight or tail number of these aircraft! Its very easy!</p>

<p>Exactly, That&#39;s why I don&#39;t listen to those dirty shills who say things like &quot;Oh science tells us the earth revolves around the sun&quot; or &quot;Whales evolved from land mammals!&quot;. Bullshit! The sun rises and falls around us and whales live in the goddamn water. I trust my own eyes! </p>

<p>They say things like &quot;a single persons perspective is inherently flawed and subject to their bias and amount of knowledge&quot; and that I should &quot;understand that scientific progress comes from a deeper analysis of cumulative knowledge that sometimes defies initial perception&quot;. That&#39;s shill talk! The only true path to truth is stubbornly rejecting any evidence that contradicts your initial perceptions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I&#39;m on your side! Those dirty shills can&#39;t trick us with their &quot;science&quot;. I look at the sky and say &quot;those clouds look bad&quot;. I know I&#39;m right, those science-dicks can&#39;t tell me otherwise. </p>

<p>I see a contrail slowly turn into a cloud. Obviously this is evidence that the NWO is finally coming for us. But then some asshole says &quot;actually, contrails can work as an unintentional means of encouraging cloud formation, as supercooled water vapour in the atmosphere requires a trigger (engine exhaust) to freeze. Which is why contrails can spread into clouds resembling Cirrus or Cirrostratus from time to time, when the conditions are right&quot;. We both know that&#39;s mumbo-jumbo. I mean, meteorologists are all a bunch of shills. Every single one of them. When I talk about the criss-crossing patterns, they brush it off with &quot;because planes go different directions and try to stay out of each-others contrails&quot; and then go on about how chemtrails theories require the cooperation of millions of people around the entire planet with no whistleblowers to speak of. Good thing we see through their crap.</p>

<p>And with building 7, I obviously know it was a controlled demolition. You know how? Because I watched hundreds of controlled demolitions and every. single. building. fell down. What happened to building 7? It Fucking Fell Down. Any further analysis is evidence of a cover-up. Sure, there were no sounds of explosives and no access to structural columns before hand, but we all know that it fell because of those charges that I saw on season 2 of Breaking Bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen anything that&#39;s convinced me, thus far, that the chemtrail conspiracy is a real phenomenon, and in the absence of hard evidence, I am inclined to think that the cost, logistics (and risks) that would be necessary for widespread chemtrailing by commercial airlines, don&#39;t seem to confer obvious benefits to those airlines, their employees, or any other specific group (eg the global elite). After all, we breathe the same air and eat the same agricultural products. </p>

<p>There are much more cost-effective and better targeted ways of poisoning populations, if that is your objective.</p>

<p>At the same time, I acknowledge that this is not an issue I am particularly engaged in, and so I haven&#39;t looked into it as deeply as many other conspiracy theories. I am therefore keeping an open mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly don&#39;t follow this subject and have no evidence one way or another, so take this FWIW.</p>

<p>What are they spraying?  I assume some sort of liquid?  How much would be required to be effective?  That&#39;s a <em>lot</em> of extra weight on takeoff, something airlines <em>hate</em>. Because every pound consumes more expensive fuel. </p>

<p>Where is it being injected? The jet engines?  Aircraft engineers are not absolutely perfect but they certainly are obsessive about reliability.  An extra system which did not help generate thrust, and could potentially foul the engine, would be pretty much a non-starter.</p>

<p>I would think airplane mechanics would be discussing such systems.  They&#39;re in airports all over the world.  I can&#39;t imaging that every single one of them has been successfully sworn to silence.  There are plenty of cynical mechanics out there, with plenty of stories about fucked up systems and work performed by other... less-skilled... mechanics.  If there were superfluous systems tacked onto jet engines I can only imagine they would have snarked about it by now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying yea or nay on the subject, just speculating about the likelihood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the most fascinating fact was from a PBS Nova about pollution in the atmosphere interfering with weather pattern, it was called &quot;The Dimming Sun&quot;. They had a part about the days after 9/11 and noticed that since there was no-planes flying they saw an increase 2 or 3 degrees in temperature. This is what made me realize what they really intended with chemtrails. I came to the conclusion that they are trying to mask the effect of global warming. I came to the US in 95 and I remember this was the first time I had seen a chemtrail as I thought the airplane was in distress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to tie the really serious issue of geoengineering with so-called &#39;chemtrails&#39; is as pathetic as it is deceptive. Geoengineering trials are taking place every day and none of the chemtrail believers are interested in stopping it. They sit there posting photos of the sky and agreeing it&#39;s &quot;Disgusting&quot; while the dangers of geoengineering go on unchallenged because they are all looking in the wrong fucking place.
Geoengineering, with the barium and the sulphides and stuff, is being experimented on in the Stratosphere at  80,000 feet where you can&#39;t see it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called Stratospheric Aerosol Dispersal.  It&#39;s only experimental at the moment; small payloads of reflectants carried up by balloons and rockets.  But there are people who want to seriously mess with the weather. Any attempt to mess with the atmosphere will have serious and unexpected consequences. Forget about Chemtrails, THAT is where the threat to the planet is happening. 
Contrails coming off airliners - so-called &#39;Chemtrails&#39; -  happen at half the altitude of Stratospheric Aerosol Dispersal at 25 - 40,000 feet in the Troposphere. They are not part of any geoengineering scheme and they&#39;ve been happening ever since man was claver enough to fly high enough, in 1922.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bang on. I&#39;ve never put stock in contrails. A lot of the conspiracies posted here are fake, or just play on the laypersons lack of understanding around certain topics. </p>

<p>For a community that prides itself on &#39;being aware&#39; I tend to find more &#39;sheeple&#39; here there anywhere else. I was well into all the conspiracies (and I still think 9/11 was a false flag because... Well obviously) but as soon as you start to actually look at the research and think about it logically you realise how much of it is bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After going back and forth on this issue, I think I&#39;ve come down on the spraying taking place, but it is being done to stabilize the climate and bolster the atmosphere&#39;s ability to shield us from solar radiation. </p>

<p>I think the nuke tests of the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s punched more holes in the ionosphere than were sustainable, and they didn&#39;t resolve themselves at the speed that was expected. I think the ionosphere is too high up to work appropriately, so instead the lower atmosphere is being seeded to create a higher albedo level. </p>

<p>I believe this is why the revelations showing up even in the MSM (briefly) about the spraying that is going on; anyone else notice that the MSM seemed to reverse it&#39;s position about chemtrails once it was revealed that the sun is actually entering a period of quiet instead of the expected CME heavy solar maximum?</p>

<p>I think that data predicing a solar maximum has been around for some time and an action plan was created and funded to passively counteract the expected effects of one massive or several smaller earth facing CME&#39;s. </p>

<p>As per the acknowledged side effects: Side effects</p>

<p>The techniques themselves may cause significant foreseen or unforeseen harm. For example, the use of reflective balloons may result in significant litter,[65] which may be harmful to wildlife.</p>

<p>Ozone depletion is a risk of some geoengineering techniques, notably those involving sulfur delivery into the stratosphere.[66]</p>

<p>The active nature of geoengineering may in some cases create a clear division between winners and losers. Most of the proposed interventions are regional, such as albedo modification in the Arctic.[67]</p>

<p>There may be unintended climatic consequences, such as changes to the hydrological cycle[68] including droughts[69] or floods, caused by the geoengineering techniques, but possibly not predicted by the models used to plan them.[70] Such effects may be cumulative or chaotic in nature, making prediction and control very difficult.[71]</p>

<p>Not all side effects are negative, and an increase in agricultural productivity has been predicted by some studies.[72]</p>

<p>That link also does not contain any information about China using artillery rounds to create clouds in clear skies, or using aluminum in their weather mod activities.  It describes the sort of activities I talked about earlier, none of which are equivalent to geoengineering.</p>

<p>Geoengineering is defined as &quot;the deliberate and large-scale intervention in the Earth’s climatic system with the aim of reducing global warming.&quot;  That&#39;s not the same thing as cloud seeding for local weather modification.</p>

<p>You can tell me what I&#39;m supposed to see all you want, but I trust my own eyes</p>

<p>Exactly, That&#39;s why I don&#39;t listen to those dirty shills who say things like &quot;Oh science tells us the earth revolves around the sun&quot; or &quot;Whales evolved from land mammals!&quot;. Bullshit! The sun rises and falls around us and whales live in the goddamn water. I trust my own eyes! </p>

<p>They say things like &quot;a single persons perspective is inherently flawed and subject to their bias and amount of knowledge&quot; and that I should &quot;understand that scientific progress comes from a deeper analysis of cumulative knowledge that sometimes defies initial perception&quot;. That&#39;s shill talk! The only true path to truth is stubbornly rejecting any evidence that contradicts your initial perceptions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is GMO not as evident as JFK??? Im with you when it comes to Greys(the alistor Crowley demon represented as an alien now...) Lizard people and such things. Since when does the entity involved in the conspiracy have to come out and validate it. Have some faith an ad not like a christian because the bible says &quot;Faith is the EVIDENCE of things yet to be seen and the substance of things hoped for&quot; If you have Evidence then your faith is real.</p>
