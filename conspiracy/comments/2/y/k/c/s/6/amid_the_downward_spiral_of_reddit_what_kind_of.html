With the posts of mods censoring people and content an idea has been brewing in my head. People say, why don&#39;t you make your own website? Well, I can, so I&#39;m reaching out to our community for ideas on what you think would make for a great alternative. What kind of website would make you jump ship from reddit? Any and all ideas are welcome, I have many ideas myself and I&#39;m in the beginning stages of research.</p>

<p>Would you guys like to see a site &quot;just like&quot; reddit, but with various transparency measures and other things in place?. Like people can create sub communities and the website would just be a vast place of communities? Would you like a website only about news? What about a website only about conspiracies? I personally only use reddit really for news links and discussion. I occasionally hop on the front page to see what the &quot;internet&quot; is talking about, when I get overwhelm here or need a good laugh.</p>

<p>Please let me know what you think. Thanks! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A site in a similar vein as reddit. With specific zones or subverses of subreddits where users could cultivate their own front page, of sorts.</p>

<p>However. There would be only very few rules, and the users are, in this model, not the actual product. The fostering of critical thought is.</p>

<p>Here me out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pseudo anonymous website much like this one. However, when users link content, they are beholden to <em>steward</em> their thread and watch for insightful discussion (which is the main drive for the site - the community of comments that made this site so great when I joined).</p>

<p>If a user reads linked content and finds a flaw in the piece (say, pointing out am inaccuracy in a NYTimes article, providing links to source material in a professional and helpful way), the site and OP can reward this user with both Karma (or whatever you want to call it) and monetary compensation (bitcoin users - rejoice!).</p>

<p>In this incentivized system, a critical thinking, question-everything approach, that anyone can do with an open mind, a smartphone, and the internet.</p>

<p>Users can be given quests to travel into other Zones/Subverses/Subreddits and have legitimate and positive discussions with those of different views, and hopefully learn something from the other side of the ideological aisle, as well as gain XP from finding flaws in articles with professional references.</p>

<p>Users will also be able to self post and advertise their specific content, but not allowed to link their stuff to the main boards (I think this will eliminate the flooding issue).</p>

<p>The result will be a front page and aggregator of content that will be fact-checked the world over, and users can view what is out out as <em>news</em>, while simultaneously connecting with the 18-34 demo this would be geared for, with the hope that one day they can connect in real life and work towards positive change in their local communities, and ultimately bring this level of consciousnesses and awareness both politically and mainstream-y.</p>

<p>And it could be up and running I&#39;m a few months, if I could get up off my ass and start it. I think.</p>

<p>Does that make any sense? We can cut through bullshit propaganda, interact with a community, and hopefully level up in the community as well as IRL.</p>

<p>Yeah - I think employing a political element into it (users voting in mods for terms, coming up with rules/legislation), fuck even taking on titles (See Jim, of House Pardon) would be silly and fun and just another layer of it.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort, I&#39;m just a professional student turned professor with insomnia and a wish to <em>do something</em>. I&#39;ve dabbled in classes on ways to find inaccuracies in news relating to my field but want to expand my experiment (in a way). No experience with a business, with developing, etc. But I do have ideas on how this could actually <em>be a thing</em>, and could be <em>huge</em>. Fuck, it could called prooffreadit and that would work I bet.</p>

<p>The point is to cultivate an environment of respectful cynicism and raise the threshold for truth in the all important Millennial Generation. </p>

<p>Winston Smith said if there were any hope, it lies with the proles, and we&#39;re about to have a whole new generation of them slam into the real world. And I want to show them they can get paid by questioning things, citing proper sources, and taking back their lives, communities, and so, so much more.</p>

<p>You can even integrate and internet radio service on site, and have users converse and podcast, and get add revenue from the podcasts and front page (if necessary).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>..it&#39;s the start of something like it. Yes. But you need a medium and a market. And I think this will create just that.</p>

<p>And I still haven&#39;t told you the best part.</p>

<p>Exactly, this pretty much sums up what I want to do with everyone. People need to wake up to this shit before it&#39;s too late. The best way to do it, is to develop the platform we are talking about.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is how society can make a turn for the better. Completely agree.</p>

<p>Definitely a good idea, I could see that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how this problem can reasonably be avoided on any site that&#39;s a.) anonymous b.) user/vote driven c.) frequented by people looking for soundbytes who will just take a &quot;debunker&#39;s&quot; word for it at face value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds cliche, but the Truth always finds a way.</p>

<p>For an extreme example of what you&#39;re hypothesizing, take a 9/11 post for example. We&#39;ve all seen and participated in arguments in various subreddits here with varying degrees of success, I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>In a site like this, I would argue each statement needs to be backed up by a source (that the other users can then verify), much like scientific literature (related to what I do in my day-to-day).</p>

<p>If the users themselves who initially migrate to a spot like this are respectful, open-minded, and genuinely want to <em>learn</em> things, I think shills can be kept to a minimum. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are plenty of solutions for bots as well. The target would be the 18-34 bored millenial, with a smart phone, a wifi connection, and a solid attitude.</p>

<p>With the tip/vote dual system, you can maybe even implement a two-tiered sorting system where users can sort by karma (reddit traditional) or those with a high level of tips (financial).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the main obstacles I see to free thought/free flow of information on the internet going forward.  How long until an army of AI sockpuppets are upon us?  Hell, how is there any way to know it isn&#39;t happening already?  The entire point of a true AI is that we wouldn&#39;t recognize it if we saw it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I wish I had solutions instead of just mentioning various problems that I see - I&#39;m not trying to be negative here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re not being negative you&#39;re point out real issues going ahead. I appreciate that. And it&#39;s kind of scary to think about that and it makes you think of what the future of the internet is going to be or currently is. I remember reading an article on here where a scientist created the first AI which past a test of some sorts to fool a human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep you&#39;re probably referring to the Turing test, where a participant converses with an &quot;entity&quot; via written text and after a series of questions tries to determine whether they were talking to a human or an AI.  I think it was last year where this test, for the first time, resulted in the AI fooling over 30% of the judges.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s an impressive result but still not quite convincing enough, assuming that&#39;s what you were referring to.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s only what&#39;s known about publicly, my assumption would be that if an AI or quantum computer like this existed (and was planned to be used for nefarious purposes) that the general public wouldn&#39;t really be made aware of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do.  But now I&#39;m led to my next concern which is that the nature of discussing/speculating/examining/researching conspiracies is very often an exercise in what <em>isn&#39;t</em> there so much as what is, about connecting dots in one&#39;s own mind and inferring what is <em>most likely</em> the case based on the relevant details.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is that what&#39;s evident to me may not be evident to you, may not be evident to someone else.  Personal bias, history, upbringing, open-mindedness - all of these things and more come into play when it comes to acquiring knowledge.</p>

<p>As an example, to me personally the Hermetic street layout of Washington DC is beyond dispute - it&#39;s in my mind a proven fact.  But I know without asking that many people, definitely most people, would automatically disagree with this no matter what I showed them based on principle and their own bias alone.  The official story of 9/11 being obvious and complete bullshit is another example.  Or satanic cults/organized pedophile rings involving the rich and powerful.  All of these things are to me proven but to someone else impossible.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just being pessimistic - I&#39;d definitely be interested to see how it actually played out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the thing to keep in mind is that the reason why sites like Reddit are so popular is because they can host any kind of content. The format of Reddit is why the content came here. It was a blank slate of sorts to begin with, but the subreddit format is so adaptable that hundreds and thousands of different communities came here to make their homes. This is something your site would need to be able to accomplish as well, and getting the migration of all those disparate communities would certainly be a feat</p>

<p>Reddit is a CORPORATION <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond%C3%A9_Nast">owned by an advertising company</a> that poses as an &quot;indie forum&quot;.</p>

<p>Look at the bullshit popup when you hover over &quot;help support reddit&quot; gold button on the sidebar.</p>

<p>The admins work for corporate interests and the &quot;mods&quot; are selected by them to run all the big subs. Just check <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> to see all the shady shit that happens here. </p>

<p>Know about the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/search?q=modtalk+leaks&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">modtalk leaks</a>? What&#39;s that tell you about who runs things when <em>bad</em> mods aren&#39;t getting removed?</p>

<p>Hell, you can literally <a href="http://www.buyredditvotes.us/buy-reddit-votes">BUY upvotes now</a>. Ever wonder why stupid shit seems to go viral? Why commercials hit the front page? Its one big fake advertisement platform disguised as user content.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.voat.co">www.voat.co</a> is the exact opposite and EVERYTHING is transparent. </p>

<p>There is no &quot;Default subs&quot;. </p>

<p>Upvotes and downvoting are limited to established accounts to deter manipulation.</p>

<p>There are limitations to who mods what</p>

<p>There are public lists of who was banned.</p>

<p>And the top admins are NOT part of a corporation and are against the crap that goes on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a replacement would need a voting system that allows 
different opinions.  </p>

<p>Currently in reddit I get completely downvoted, when I suggest that something might be wrong with an established idea. I don&#39;t mind people not wanting to see alternative opinions, but I do mind it when people that want to see them can not find them.</p>

<p>That means that upvoting and downvoting should be changed into flags that can be active simultaneously. </p>

<ul>
<li>agree, like, good article, funny.<br/></li>
<li>disagree, dislike, poor article, trolling.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>So in philosophy I would often vote: disagree, like, good article.<br/>
And in other parts I could vote: trolling, funny.  </p>

<p>Some subs might require the person to comment to activate the vote or to be subscribed to the sub. Or maybe even to choose some kind of popular perspectives (multiple /none).<br/>
This allows to view the sub from a certain perspective.  </p>

<p>The depth of the sub might be reflect in the possibilities that are given.</p>

<p>Most people in &quot;funny&quot; want to press like/dislike.  </p>

I want it to be a community of free thought, but if we are to have sub communities gotta take the bad with the good. This is where hashing out ideas of a site is key. What is the direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting! Yea, makes perfect sense. I like the idea. This is very similar to what I was thinking too. I also have ideas on how to make it more transparent and more of a democratic-republic.</p>

<p>And it could be up and running I&#39;m a few months, if I could get up off my ass and start it. I think.</p>

<p>Are you a developer? I&#39;d love to collaborate. I just feel like I need to do something for good in this world with the skills I have and software development and design are my skills. I want to see a website where people can learn, discuss and find out alternative sources of media, not just the crap MSM puts out.</p>

<p>edit: Like collaborative citizen journalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The major question I have with that idea is with regards to the obvious and widespread influence of paid shills and online propagandists whose sole purpose with a site like that would (most likely) be to provide multiple &quot;debunkings&quot; to any explanation anyone gives and generally just promote as much doubt and discord as possible.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how this problem can reasonably be avoided on any site that&#39;s a.) anonymous b.) user/vote driven c.) frequented by people looking for soundbytes who will just take a &quot;debunker&#39;s&quot; word for it at face value.</p>
