       I'm just fucking disgusted. Is this an episode of the blacklist? I swear it's like I'm living in a movie. I still can't believe all this tf all about the "rich and powerful" involved in these pedophile rings. Clinton.. those 2 cute scared kids that came forward and explained themselves in great detail. What the fuck people, I know the Kardashians are that much more important. But what in the fuck man.. this shit can't just die out

       Your 100% right. It's almost to huge for me to even grasp.. I mean, the amount of fucked up corruption in this world is beyond ridiculous. I wish I was some kind of superhero with the superpower to detect any fuckery and corruption. Magically teleport these sick fucks into a crater and wait for another fucking asteroid. I can't tell you how pissed and disgusted I am right now. I just watched a blacklist epipose where a billionaire had "slaves" , stolen art, kids, etc... for sale and it got me thinking. Went on a 3 hour research binge about epstein, Clintons involvement, uk's ring, and allllllll this other nonsense and fuckery that's floating around. I mean WHAT-THE-FUCK... I can't wrap my head around it. I knew some of these rich and powerful people and billionaires were some creepy fucks. I can't tell what's more mind blowing, thinking about ridiculous shit about the universe or thinking about these sick fucks walking around the planet

       still to be fair the powers that be do control the state the media and every institution inbetween... heck all we've ever heard is lies crafted to make us the dumb slaves we are. Modern science is all about the money.  Carbon tax rules our understanding of climate ignoring the suns affect alltogether and blaming carbon that makes up less than .4% of the  atmosphere for every turn the weather takes. Modern medicine is practically worst than that of the middle ages ignoring real cancer cures for chemo profits. The media is a farce the news is nothing but propagandist. Same goes for the rest of it music sports movies all fake all contributing to the same propaganda. 
jus sayin the games kinda rigged against us why do you think they demonize people like conspiracy theorist. Never talk about things like the banking system being slaughtered recently in a canadian court.

       I met a lady from Quebec living in a homeless shelter.
She said she had to leave her home because she uncovered too much stuff about what was going on in the foster homes there.

       She specifically mentioned pedophiles rings.

       While I have no reason to believe or disbelieve that "any" pedophile rings exist, I am just pointing out that the original commenter'a supposed evidence in support of that assertion has no reliability.

       It's not like it's a secret that pedo-rings exist, they get busted often, and sometimes link to Global Elites, politicians, and other rich people.

       You're pushing a red herring. Even if the messenger is not mentally ill, an anecdotal, anonymous, hearsay report of what one unnamed lady mentioned some vague time in the past does not constitute evidence.

       I'm pretty new to this sub and I guess I'm seeing what generally makes conspiracy theorists different from others. Whereas most people require significant evidence to reject a null hypothesis, you seem to be willing to accept any old assertion in support of whatever crazy claim comes about.

       And now, of course, you are directing your ignorant kneejerk judgment towards me. I have stated no position, whether rejection or acceptance of the overall child abuse conspiracy - just pointed out that , with zero evidence, you have accused someone of being Schizophrenic. Maybe you should take a look in the mirror.

       For what it's worth I highly doubt she was schizophrenic. I had to live with her for three months or so, in that time many mentally ill people came and went from the homeless shelter. She was one of the stable ones.

       What struck me was that at the same time I was doing a lot of reading up on and talking to native people (some in my own family) about the human trafficking in BC. It seems like an open secret that native children get sold into prostitution and the native communities are too poor and disenfranchised to do anything about it.

       Wondering this myself.  Either it has happened to so many people that the subject is too painful to hear about, or a short attention span because of the constant blitzkrieg of fucked up information that is spewed upon us on a daily basis.

       It's alittle of both, I even admit I forgot about it for atleast a week or 2. It's just fucking ridiculous... how the fuck is this shit going on. The spider Web of tangled corruption is so intertwined and tangled up, it's almost impossible for it to be unraveled and fixed. We just have to shed some light and bring as much noise to this issue as humanly possible. Someone somewhere has the heart and power to do something about it. I just want to see justice

       Right there with you. I've been following the 2 kids from the UK story. Satanism, murder, blood ritual, sacrifices; what if this is connected to the political pedophiles mess discovered after Jimmy Saville's death? What if this a systematic conspiracy from the police, state workers, politicians &amp; the Royal Crown &amp; church to cover it up? This could very well be the crime of the century. I believe THIS would have the potential to galvanize the people &amp; make them rise up &amp; organize. Power to the people, I say...

To support this "civilization", there is a tacit deal that is made to not watch how the "sausage" is made i.e. not inquire about conspiracies and why children go missing.

       I agree with you 100%.  And I am sure these people feel powerful like a baseball player who hit the game winning home run or the guy who won the lottery.  Its all chemical reactions in the brain.  Trouble is, that power is false.  Just like the evil force deceives with the same false power.  Power or not, it will all be usurped in the end.

       So I guess I'm going to get called a pedophile on the internet today, but I think it can be justified in some way. Drawings are victimless. Stories, drawings, cartoons...the imagination has to be the last refuge of the truly twisted. I'm sure there's a long debate to be had about escalation vs. placation, and I'd rather not do the whole thing, but the absolute worst thing about those subs, IMO, is that they attract people who would try to peddle
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       child porn, with real victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually especially galling in this thread, about actual child molesters who are not limiting their experience to drawings.

       Gateway drug theory is a false paradigm. Life doesn't work in a linear progression always. We don't live in a utopia where "people who merely have such evil thoughts shouldn't exist.", they do exist. I'd rather have a boxer keep punching a punching bag than going around hitting people.

       I've heard it is a treatment for dangerous conditions. I think people with psychopathic tendencies are sometimes urged to draw their ideas on paper to get them out of their system. But I think you're right in that reddit is no place to treat such conditions. These people should be drawing images in the presence of a psychiatrist who can give them therapy. By making a social gathering out of this it might encourage them to act on their 'fantasies'. That said I would not be surprised if half the people on there are FBI honey pots and that the other half having their activities monitored regularly. Such people are low hanging fruit for law enforcement.

       It doesn't even have to be related websites, it can be an image board you loaded once that happened to have some seriously questionable content. You didn't look through the thread, but those 3 or 4 visible posts could do you in. Even popular porn sites have illegal content uploaded to them from time to time, they eventually get taken down but you have to wonder how many people would be guilty without even knowing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm of the opinion now that no matter who you are, or what you do or don't do, anyone with the means and desire will find a very real and viable way to ruin your life if they want to.

       I harassed the fuck out of them until they cried to reddit that they didn't like being called "child molester" for talking about how "hot" a drawing of a tiny toddler being screwed was, and two accounts of mine were banned.

       The whole reason child porn is illegal is because it harms real children, not because people find it disgusting. Drawn child porn doesn't hurt anyone and is therefore in my opinion a rather ethical outlet for pedophiles.

       This is presumably the reason why it's legal in many countries.

      <p>
       99.9999 of pedophiles realize children are not matyre enough for sex and never commit any crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Child Molestation is what is wrong and evil.

       I never implied it is okay to have any sexual relation with or simply abuse children. That's just common sense. I'd argue that it is okay to have a certain attraction, as long as you don't do anything unethical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, an attraction (in this case pedophilia) on its own is never the actual problem. Sociopathy and compulsive disorders amongst other things are. Combine these with pedophilia and their actions happen to be horribly pedophilic in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though there are no numbers on this because it is impossible to get them, common sense tells me a lot of pedophiles actually don't offend. Some of these even have miserable lives because people like you promote negativity even to the most ethical of people.

       I can't believe I will offer a counterpoint, but here it goes.  I hate even the idea of pedophiles as much as you do.  But, should everyone who has ever fantasized about hurting or killing someone be exterminated though they have never acted on it?   It is not our thoughts that define us but our actions.  Temptation will always be there in whichever form it may take.

       You don't find the idea of rounding up and killing people based on a psychological condition the least bit disturbing? Who exactly would you trust to make such decisions, and by what criteria? Your cure strikes me as far more terrifying than the disease.

       If the situation is as it seems, the truly horrible ones occupy positions of power, so would offer up some sacrificial scapegoats and walk away scot free. I get the impulse, but without a sound strategy I don't see what you expect to get.

       There is no "sound" strategy when you're talking about purging elements of society. Many innocent people will die along with the guilty. That's the way things work. The purging simply stops when people get tired of killing innocent people. Give it a decade or so of guillotines in the streets.

       THEY ARE DRAWINGS. Nothing is wrong in a drawing because it is fucking not real. You are basically saying people should he arrested Because of thought crimes. Because if thats true they millions of people are going to jail for thinking about beating the shit out of someone.

       INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. Or is that not how the law works anymore? He not done anything to say he had ever hurt a child or even wants to. Many people have fetishes that would be gross or unappealing and they would never do in real life.

       You damn well know that its also ILLEGAL. Its not "art", its kiddie porn. You damn well know that its wrong.

       Its a very short jump from that to you having actually abused children.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a fucked up freak pedophile and the world would be a better place if you offed yourself before you attack more children.

       I SEXUALIZE DRAWINGS! Emphasis on the drawing part. There is a big difference between drawings and reality. Children are gross in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have already made the comparison. Both are crimes IRL but mean nothing when only done in fiction. Bith are equally terrible crimes in the real world. You are just too stuborn to listen.

       Well steven king must be a serial killer. Its only a small jump from writing about murdur to actually murduring someone

       You are a fucked up biggot that advocates suicide. You are a terrible person and I hope you realize that some day. Some people are just trying to live their lives and happen to have a weird fetish. Its people like you that ruin the fun.

       you really cant tell the difference between a drawing and an action.

       If 50-60k people are really being sacrificed in America alone. And they managed to keep it under wraps. Then holy shit. 800k people go missing a year in the U.S.. So that number is possible. Thats roughly 1/16 of the people.

       In 2010/11, 91 per cent of missing incidents reported to the police were closed within 48 hours, with 99 per cent of all missing cases solved within one year.

       Why did you think that?  First of all, the FBI doesn't track any statistics for missing children.  The closest they come is tracking some statistics for people under 18, of which hundreds of thousands go missing each year.  Of these, the vast majority have their entries "removed from the database" but this says nothing as to whether the person was actually found or not, just that the entry was removed for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm wondering where you got that percentage from.

       I'm asking you specifically where you're getting this information from because "cases removed from the database" is not the same thing as "cases solved".  They can be removed simply by being removed, at least for the FBI numbers.  Perhaps it is different in the UK but without a source for your claim I'm going to assume not.

       Ok no worries, assume whatever you want. On every article ive read over here the reports are that the majority are found within a week, with references. I dont know if you can see the link, i jst found that now. I cant find anything about the UK removing tens of thousands of missing children from the database but id like to see some data

       That provides no information about the number of people who were "found" and at the bottom it says in clear English that all of these numbers are very likely
       <em>
        underestimates
       </em>
       .  Thanks for the link but this isn't conclusive, it's very similar to the FBI data which is equally inconclusive and vague.

       It does provide information of those who were found. Plain english, i did understand that, but underestimates are not the same as what youre claiming, youl have to be patient, im trying to compete in the sarcasm competition that is reddit so give me some time.. !
      </p>
      <p>
       Why am I the one making the "claim" when all Im saying is that the UK isnt systematically covering up tens of thousands of missing people? And that the majority are found? Or at least, il believe it when i see some evidence. Thats a bit silly really, to say im making a claim. The majority are found, out of all those hundreds of thousands - and it makes sense, i know people who were teens and ran away. The data shows 15-17 year olds made a massive percentage. There are statistics every year by the relevant authorites that say as much, that the majority are found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is this evidence that kids are removed from the database on a massive basis? I have one stance, yea, but if i see something like this then il change my opinion.

       I don't know about for the UK, but this is the way it goes with the FBI's statistics which is the main reason I'm skeptical about the UK's.

       You'll see that a huge majority of the cases were "canceled" or "removed" but that this can be done at the discretion of the authorities and that no further details are provided for any of these specific cases.  When we're talking about over 600,000 missing people, many of them undoubtedly children, this is pretty significant in my opinion - especially in light of

       Because it's so old, a lot of people think this is just a blind-alley distraction TPTB trot out when they need it. It's not that there's nothing to it; it's just that they are certain you can't go anywhere with it. Remember that they employ the best psychiatrists to make such calls regarding a public opinion.

       I think many older people are very causes of claims of mass child abuse or pedophile rings after what happened in the late 70's in Europe and later late 80's and early 90's in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are too young to know what I am talking about or just never heard about for what ever reason here is a run down.  In the late 70's in Europe some people with in the Church started to push the idea that Europe was infested with satanists that were abusing and killing children.  After investigations  found no proof of it the idea fizzled out.  Then some religious people in the US started to make the same claims.  This lead to a big witch hunt that had some small town courts putting innocent people in a jail.  Then the FBI started to take notice and reviewed the cases.  Most people were later found to be innocent after going to a higher court.  Then came the people making claims they were abused by satanic cults, they made their rounds through the talk show circuit.   Most of these people that claimed to be abused had gone through some form of hypnosis to find suppressed memories.  Hypnosis used in this way was latter discredited much like today gay conversion therapy is.  Latter most of the people that claimed they were abused by a satanic cult admitted they had lied, but thought lying about it would bring more people to Jesus and lead to satanist all over the country being locked up.  This period of time is also called the great satanic panic.

       I remember the Great Satanic Panic. It sucked balls because evangelical nuts claimed D&amp;D and heavy metal lead to Satanism. Good thing my parents were too busy to notice these little things. The child molesters were caught but not really Satanic.

       How long did it take before people in general, let alone catholics, could admit that the clergy were raping alter boys and then covering it up? This is the same thing. These people are trusted, elected (sometimes), famous and rich. It will be really hard to convince the average person that someone who rapes and murders children can be all of those things. It is even more difficult to convince them that there is a whole ring of elites who having been doing this for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally it makes sense to me. The intelligence agencies have been making power grabs for years and by having dirt this big on political elites or corporate leaders they can pretty much control the government or major industries as they see fit. So they let these scumbags live their sick demented lives without punishment in exchange for near absolute power over their countries. In the eyes of MI6 or the CIA it is probably the lesser of two evils, a few kids are sacrificed but they can do so much more good by having the reigns of power taut in their hands. I wouldn't be surprised if they even tried to compensate parents at first and then eventually just turned to orphans and street children. This world is so disgusting sometimes.

       You mentioned, it feels like your watching a movie. Oddly enough, this is not far from the truth. Everything "big and important" that happens in this world is well thought out and planned years, if not decades in advance. It to point where you can't even call them events, they are theater.

       The pedophile rings are enjoyed by the "elite" for a few reasons. The most important being they can control each other into subordination with blackmail.

       If more people stood up, fought back... How, I don't know... I'm struggling myself. But hell, I've heard it said before. Pedophilia is the elites Achilles heel. They steal money, Or print it out of thin air, Keep us debt slaves, feed us GMO garbage. Throw us in jail for profit, Find faster ways to kill us... Nobody does a thing.

       Ritually abuse children? They should be hung. Sandusky and Jimmy Savile were thrown under the bus and thats all she wrote, Pedos caught, Abuse is stopped! Nothing to see here! No. The royals are involved, Clinton is connected, Jeffrey Epstein had 21 numbers to contact him FFS. Ya can't tell me Clinton knew nothing or saw nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I mentioned hanging them. Thats terrible. But at the moment I just cannot feel love or forgiveness for them. Its something to strive for, to live life that way. But from stories I've read, Ridding the planet of their ilk suits me just fine. I would not shed a tear or look away in disgust watching them swing from the gallows.

       Is it just me or has the word 'posterity' gone right out the window? 
Nobody has time to worry about the future of this planet OR others when the bills keep rolling in and each pay checks spending power erodes away year by year. I love reminding my dad about his granddaughters future when he goes on a conservative rant about global warming being fake or a pro-ripping open another forest rant that will benefit big corps and not him in any way shape or form. Why do these people defend such things? Its beyond me. Sorry about the rant.

       What makes this pedophile ring different from any other pedophile ring? What makes these pedophiles different from any other pedophiles?
      </p>
      <p>
       You want people to do something, you need two options for people:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Rape/child abuse is bad and widespread. Let's address the problem generally. Here's what we can do:"
       <br/>
       "Making these
       <em>
        specific
       </em>
       people accountable for their actions is important because:"
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the because is. If I want to stop kids from getting molested I don't see a particular reason to go after these people specifically. There's plenty of monsters to choose from, throughout society - it's not a class thing. If you want these people stopped, you're going to have to articulate the because.

       Funding. And a lot of them are paid by the people, we're indirectly funding the rape and abuse, possible sacrifice of infants. There's much more bought out secrecy, black-mailing and potential with more assets, if nothing else. There's certainly more going on here than with the "neighborhood ring", as sad as this is all to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, these are our leaders and enforcers of "constitutional" law. How can we so have agencies apparently so fervently seeking out pedophilia among the citizens and not enforce the same among the  politicians?

       But this has been going on for eons before you became aware. It's not to say it's okay, just that this is the way the world is. Some people live and die never understanding they live in the matrix. Others wake up, realize it, get mad, try to do something and either go back to sleep or wait.  Finally enough people are waking up and realizing it can be changed but not yet. So they wait. They're not liking it, they're not agreeing with it... they're just waiting for the time to change it.

       I think mainstream did a small report on it for a shirt period of time. The most coverage I've seen done is on RT News with anna kasparian, she's been on joe.rogans podcast. They did quite a good job but still it died pretty quickly. Not sure about other news channels or outlets, I don't watch much tv myself

       People are saying that the people can't stomach it. The reality is that the establishment want to keep it hidden because it is the establishment involved in it. A lot of people couldn't stomach 9-11 but it served the establishment goals of creating fear very well so was pushed in the media ad-infinitum.

       These kids have seen some shit in the same way that kids during the satanic ritual abuse scandals of the 80s saw some shit. This is a 100% fabrication. The only issue is that these kids guardians are involving them in their messed up agenda.

       You know when I read about this pedo ring and all the elite that were involved with it and it's connections with satanism; I can't help but recall some posts in the past suggesting that 9/11 was a satanic ritual on a grand scale (perpetrated by TPTB).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be honest - I thought it was an interesting hypothesis, but total horseshit (the ritual part, I still believe 9/11 was an inside job).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with these pedo revelations coming out and the completely fucked up things that were allegedly done to kids in these rituals - the whole "9/11 satanic ritual" doesn't seem so far fetched...
