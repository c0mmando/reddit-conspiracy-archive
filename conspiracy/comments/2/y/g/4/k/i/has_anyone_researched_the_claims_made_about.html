       I have watched the documentary twice now, and it is incredibly eye opening regarding the claims made about religion.  I have never been much of a religious person, so I was wondering if there are people on this sub who know more than I do about it and what their thoughts are regarding the claims made in the film.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  I have done some limited research into Horus/Jesus but most of what I have found are sites that say the comparison is BS, and then go on to quote scripture, which leads me to assume the authors of such sites are very religious and are fighting tooth and nail to preserve their version of religion.

       Comparative religion is a fascinating subject.
It opens your eyes to a world of alternative viewpoints and blows open many preconceptions about the world.
Try The Golden Bough by James George Frazer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be warned though,you are entering into a esoteric subject that requires a HUGE range of knowledge to fully grasp it.
Greek mythology,Ancient Egypt,Ancient Babylon,Sumeria,Druids,Norse mythology,Christianity,Islam,Buddhism,Hinduism,the occult,Zoroastrianism,Ancient languages,math,history of art,architecture,geometry,astronomy,metaphysics,astrology and the Zodiac.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically you will need to initiate yourself into the Ancient Mysteries.
You will have to go down the rabbit-hole unguided and you WILL hit dead ends,be lead astray by bad interpretation,suspect theory and all sorts of incomprehensible stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fascinating subject though and when you start off on your journey you will find you no longer look at the world the same way.

       Its also equally fascinating to learn about the hundreds of creation stories developed by almost every ancient society. There's one (I forget) where they believe humans were first made in giant pea pods. And of course the Norse creation myth, about Ymir the father of giants who would drink milk from the cow Audumla every day or something.

       Very strange but it just goes to show how so many groups of people strive to describe the origin of life, and its so vastly different based on culture and geographic location

       Personally,i'm fascinated by the Pyramids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just those of Egypt but the Ziggurats of Babylon,the Pyramids in South America and,a fact not known by many,the Pyramids of China.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact such diverse populations built such similar monuments is a mystery.

       If you actually are curious about this, check out a book by Alvin Boyd Kuhn called
       <em>
        The Lost Light
       </em>
       .  The short answer is that Zeitgeist is correct on the "general gist" but gets some of the details wrong and embellishes other ones.

       The problem with Zeitgeist isn't the overall message, necessarily, but that it gets a lot of simple things wrong which undermine a lot of the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The easiest example is the whole "Son God becomes Son of God" thing which, unless you believe everyone in Egypt and Israel were speaking English where the words Son and Sun sound identical, is staggeringly stupid.

       I feel like it did a pretty good job at pointing out errors in the logic behind zeitgeist. For instance the birth date of the Egyptian god Horus, which zeitgeist claims is December 25th in an attempt to connect Horus to Jesus. But that isn't right. Horus wasn't born on December 25th.

       Everything he says is true.

       Do NOT allow this to diminish your relationship with God.  It's true, you were lied to about God in many, many ways, and the biggest reason is to control you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you still are a child of God, and you always will be.  This means you have all the abilities of a priest, if you will it to be.  For example; you can create holy water just by "blessing" the water by speaking kind words to it (words that you actually mean).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prayer works, but not the way the "priests" of today tell you.  For example; when something horrible happens in a neighborhood, such as a child being murdered, the "priest" will gather everyone together for a group prayer while they are all in anger and mourning.  This is actually very damaging to the spirit, as they all are projecting together feelings of anger and mourning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything they do is meant to destroy your spirituality in order to create a world of chaos where they lie and convince you that they are needed.  Another example; Catholics have their people view the image of a man being tortured to death, then have them drink his blood and eat his flesh.  Once a year they rub ash into their foreheads to symbolize the blinding of their third-eye.  It's almost all Satanic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is you are a child of God as much as anyone else, with the same abilities and rights.  As such, you shall bend no knee to anyone or anything.

       This is one of the most fascinating comments I've read in the sub for a good while. Do you have any videos/links to learn more about the subversion of spirituality?  Also, what do you personally believe of Jesus?  Was he a saviour through sacrifice as portrayed in the church or as an example of pure spirituality?

       Personally, I do not believe Jesus ever existed.  I believe he's a creation from the Roman state to cause man to freely give up their rights.  "Hey, let me tell you about this guy that loved you very much, now look at this image of him dying BECAUSE OF YOU...now pray."  It's bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "He's THE ONLY son of God", yet again, more bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all are children of God.  What happened, was God began as a thought.  God was, simply because God wanted to be.  Then God decided to experience itself, so to better understand itself.  Yes, even God wonders "why am I here?"  So, God split itself into many different pieces, and each and every one of us are those pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, every single one of us has every right to live and be happy.  To hurt another is to not only hurt yourself, but is to hurt God.  Eventually all these pieces will form back into God, our Maker, hence; "I am the Alpha and the Omega."

       I don't believe that the Romans made Jesus up, seeing how it was hundreds of years before it was accepted by the state. I think the story of Jesus being sentenced by the Jews and then the Romans carrying out the sentence is probably accurate

       I am familiar with the rest of your comment in terms of God splitting to experience himself.  The question I have which no one seems to have a good answer to is what happens after death.  Is tgere a choice or is it simply a wild ride where we have no control of what happens next?

       What I know is what I've learned from several years of research.  I'm sorry, but there's no one video I can link that tells what I believe, at least, not one that I can think of at this moment.

       Once you get into meditation and a healthy diet, you will develop what people call your "third-eye".  This is a feeling upon your forehead, like someone is pressing a finger on it.  It's a sign you are connected to the universe and therefor God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further signs are feelings in the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet.  This is why they show Jesus with nails in those areas.  It's all to scare you into not accepting who you really are.

       Imagine if everyone knew they had the ability to make this world a wonderful place....what use would we have of churches when the world would be a church?  What use would we have of priests when everyone was a priest?  What use would we have of police when no one is causing pain?

       The implication being that some sort of literal knowledge/power is derived through this cannibalistic ritual, yet when you try to make the link between this idea and Satanic ritual abuse/organized pedophilia and torture of children, people would rather turn the other cheek and pretend like there's no possible connection there.

       I think the idea of we are all priests is beautiful. We shouldn't depend on an orginization to feed us spiritually. Because when you do that what your getting is a knock off, watered down version of the real thing. I do think it's wonderful for people to come together in a spiritual environment but these mega churches... Most if not all has a foundation in greed. You want to get lectured in tithes? That's how you get lectured in tithes.

       The religious part is both meant to shock you and feed you misleading information, in order to condition you to verify things you see on YouTube/documentaries/news/etc, something most are not used to doing.

       Few realize this, however.

       Yes.  I would argue the most important thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Zeitgeist is so brilliant.
      </p>
      <p>
       You watch part 1 and go:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wait a minute - that can't be right...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And you go off on a quest to verify shit - and eventually realize that it isn't exactly right - but there's some strange similarities and maybe this religion thing is something else altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you watch part 2 and go
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wait a minute - that can't be right...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And you go on to whatever depth of a rabbit hole your comfortable with and will most likely end up at the position that
       <em>
        at the very least
       </em>
       , things that went down on 9/11 did not go down the way the
       <em>
        Official Version
       </em>
       ™ says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you watch part 3 and go
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wait a minute - that can't be right
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And you realize that the privatized central banks of central governments are corruption of a fantastic magnitude, and who knows if that leads you to history or legislation or you just need a break.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then,
       <em>
        some day
       </em>
       , you hear something on the news and go
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wait a minute, that can't be right
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And the spell is broken, and you are now forever changed. Maybe this wasn't what Peter was ultimately going for but that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

       Great argument, makes a lot of sense! On the other hand many people watch part 1, then try to do some research and finally end up on some apparently really well researched "debunker" website and accept
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       as truth. Personally I find
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-Lvv1f5Qu4">
        this

       the best approch to "educate" people about questioning things: satire.

       I would argue that's just one more speed bump people need to experience and come out on top of. If the spell is truly broken, a
       <em>
        debunker

       website will not snap you back.

       I agree.The good thing about being awake is that it gets increasingly difficult to fall asleep again (contrary to nature's logic... interesting...). But I still wonder every day if there's a greater conspiracy that we haven't understood yet... let's say something like a "spiritual" conspiracy or a "scientific" conspiracy... The overall truth remains yet to be discovered.

       Just so I am clear on what you are saying, do you mean that the documentary is presenting misleading information on purpose?  And by doing so they are somehow conditioning the viewer to do their own research?  That seems sort of backwards for a proper documentary.

       I really didn't think people thought Zeitgeist was a documentary, as a lot of the religious stuff is kinda bunk.

       It's a mix of truth and exaggeration in Zeitgeist. A lot of the religious stuff comes from a woman named Acharya. She is basically repeating a lot of the claims made by a 19th century writer called Gerald Massey who really was coming up with ideas using nothing more than his imagination. Some of the broad claims are absolutely true, ie: how Christianity was changed by Emperor Constantine into a sun worshipping cult based around Apollo (with Constantine the stand in for Apollo) but most of the claims about how these deities repeat in different religions are strained. The stuff equating Mary with Meru for example is just garbage. There was no global religion. There are probably broad global archetypes that most religions draw on. Zeitgeist is repeating a 19th century obsession with seeing the religions of the West as originating with India, but these really are very different species. Until you get to Gnosticism at which point, all bets are off.

       I wasn't making a statement about this specific debunker (although User_defined didn't claim the videos he posted debunked Zeitgeist either). I was just saying that in general I find that debunkers, especially ones explicitly debunking specific sources, tend to cite sources more than people making claims. I thought the general-ness of my statement would have been clear when I started the post with "In general"

       Your statement seems to suggest that there is no way to separate truth from lies then. If you believe what you're saying, how do you distinguish between the two?

       Though I never actually researched the claims after watching Zeitgeist, I had already read/heard/seen all of the religious claims in the film when I went through my early teen diehard atheist years.  I don't claim any of those sources were great since I was young and didn't really know how to verify them, and I was pretty biased .  I guess what I'm getting at is none of the claims were original to Zeitgeist, so yes sources are available.  Whether or not they are accurate I can't say.

       Once you start researching Esoteric interpretations, and secret societies, you won't turn back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you start with "The Kybalion", and "Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius"
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hermetica-Hermeticum-Asclepius-Translation-Introduction/dp/0521425433">

       </a>
       . This will give you a good base of understanding the source of mystery religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading these books you are going to need to decide on what your morals are, and what are your goals for learning the material? Are you learning to be wiser, and closer to God? Or to serve yourself? There are many schools and societies for both.

       Short answer: a few details may be off, but the gist of it is correct. Pretty much all religions have borrowed heavily from those that came before them. Christianity was no different, even after being codified during the

       I personally believe that Zeitgeist was put out for the Illuminati agenda to expose there own system in order to bring in the the NWO system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figured it out when I watched Zeitgeist 2. Which was completely hypocritical and brainwashing people to accept the very thing Zeitgeist 1 was telling you to be aware of. I didn't make any sense.

       Interesting idea you've got. I never really thought much about the info in Zeitgeist 1 because I'd heard much of it years prior - the whole messiah born of immaculate conception, with 12 disciples being ripped off from previous, more ancient belief systems etc..

       Could you elaborate on what Zeitgeist 2 said to be so hypocritical since I don't remember much of this one?

       Zeitgeist was one of the videos that woke me up a lot and then when I started watching Addendum, I got very confused and just kept saying to myself why are they supporting the very thing they exposed? The video is designed to condition the agenda. The whole Green movement and the phoenix project. It is so obvious. And the only way to bring in the Illuminati agenda is to expose everything to bring in the savior.

       I've found comparisons of the Jesus allegory to that of Osiris and Dionysus to be far more compelling, though not entirely convincing either.

       Personally,i'm fascinated by the Pyramids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just those of Egypt but the Ziggurats of Babylon,the Pyramids in South America and,a fact not known by many,the Pyramids of China.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact such diverse populations built such similar monuments is a mystery.
