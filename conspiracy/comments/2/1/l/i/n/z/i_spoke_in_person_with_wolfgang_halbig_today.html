        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>He is as legitimate as they come. I&#39;m just a young college guy who has a fervent interest in conspiracy and I just wanted to 1. Hear his voice on the other line, and 2. Compliment him on being a true American hero.</p>

<p>He spoke with me for 15 minutes about his efforts, the obstacles, and the conspiracy community as a whole and what it will take to bring us all together. He sounded deeply upset that Sophia Smallstorm and other prominent members of the community are choosing not to accompany him to Newtown even though he is offering to pay their transportation and hotel fees, but we came to the conclusion that all people within the community have their specific roles to play. </p>

<p>Wolfgang has the ability to rock our government all the way to its dark and vile core. We need to stop berating the messenger, and latch onto the message. His FOIA requests are the only real weapon we have against our government&#39;s efforts of terror, and he will have a camera crew documenting him nonstop in Connecticut so we will be seeing him on camera soon enough.</p>

<p>Speaking of &quot;Seeing him on camera&quot;, I know this is a point of contention for Sandy Hook Truthers who doubt Wolfgang&#39;s legitimacy. His response to my question regarding his lack of videos is that<sup>paraphrasing</sup>  &quot;I&#39;m a 70 year old man that looks nothing like I did back in my police day photos. And I don&#39;t think they make a camera with a wide enough angle lens for my head. I&#39;ll be on camera in Newtown and a we&#39;re going to be making a documentary of the entire journey.&quot;</p>

<p>Furthermore, a more streamlined website is on the way that will allow for visitor Q and A I believe.</p>

<p>He and his questions are the best weapon we have. We can&#39;t waste this opportunity.</p>

<p>let&#39;s see, account is only a few days old, came to derail a sub into yet another sandy hook conspiracy. </p>

<p>no actual proof of anything, just trying to create a circle jerk that many people were tired of since LAST YEAR.</p>

<p>this is just a red herring. just like the mainstream obsession with a malaysian plane and celebrity arrests. fuck off.</p>

<p>wtf? I&#39;m just honestly interested in this topic and I am making sure attention is payed to it because new information and efforts are being made every day. I mentioned that Wolfgang is going to Newtown May 5th through the 7th and the case is being built so this is incredibly pertinent to the entire conspiracy community. THIS IS CURRENT NEWS.</p>

<p>Also, I have said twice now that I acknowledge I am new to the community but I&#39;ve been lurking for years and I&#39;ve finally gotten interested enough in a topic to bring it up for all to discuss. Excuse me for trying to contribute and be passionate about a conspiracy that is getting real legal attention, I didn&#39;t know you in particular were already done with this &quot;circle jerk&quot;. Clearly others are still interested because the conspiracy has significant merit. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again. WTF. this sub is all about conspiracy so how am I &quot;derailing&quot; it by posting about legitimate conspiracy? </p>

<p>but don&#39;t worry, you are right, it IS current news, it IS important that halbig is doing this, and its great to that you have/had contact with him.</p>

<p>The reason I think gob is a tard is this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>since its not &#39;another&#39; conspiracy, and in fact isn&#39;t even really a conspiracy, its an attempt the get some questions answered ..which if GOB was genuine, he would want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t get legitimate legal professionals without paying for a retainer and then all the other fees. We all know how expensive lawyers are (just think of how many people take plea bargains nowadays) If this is going to be a legitimate effort Wolfgang will need a powerful legal team.</p>

<p>He has never forced anyone to donate, he just is honest about what he is doing and says we can donate $ if we are able. But more importantly we need to donate our voices and have his points known and bring this to the nations attention. It doesn&#39;t cost a dime to engage a stranger in conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you ask him if he even looked into having a lawyer take the case pro bono?  I am shocked that there isnt a lawyer (or team of lawyers) who are in the conspiracy community and wouldn&#39;t want to take this case.  Hell, even if they aren&#39;t conspiracy theorists themselves, taking on a case like this would surely get them a ton of publicity and when it comes to attorneys there is definitely no such thing as bad publicity.  The guys who help murderers walk free are regarded as great attorneys so I can&#39;t imagine that helping someone get to the bottom of Sandy Hook would be damaging to their &quot;image.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones also presents the situation as hopeless and unable to be overcome. He uses language of inevitability to discuss the actions of the elite, and never presents solutions or discusses actions that are being taken to create change. To hear him talk, we might as well already be dead or in chains and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it. He makes a point of screaming how &#39;they&#39;re going to kill you&#39; at least once per show. </p>

<p>I find this a deeply skewed perspective and highly disempowering. It promotes hopelessness and despair and actually serves to strengthen apathy since listeners feel like nothing can be done anyway. It is my opinion that Alex Jones represents an attempt to co-opt and control the dissent and channel it into non-productive avenues. </p>

<p>Awareness of what is going on is good, but not when it comes at the expense of action and planning for positive, productive change. </p>

I understand that you are taking me at my word in this post, specifically my 4 day old accounts word, but I wasn&#39;t  even thinking about that when I called him this morning.

<p>I agree I need proof, and I am sorry I cannot provide it for this interaction in particular. But I swear on my personal integrity and honest interest, if that means anything in this online universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you created this thread to prove he&#39;s real and mention that during your interaction Halbig  commented about his lack of recent photos but didn&#39;t take a photo of him or you and Halbig together?  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Where did you meet him? (Public place, his/your home, random encounter, Match.com or Skype)</p>

<p>Was this a scheduled meeting or did your paths randomly cross? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I called him. I called his home phone in FL. I realize I didn&#39;t provide any proof of my call and I regret that now. I intend on calling him again and recording our conversation in full. He is easy to reach because he is a regular 70 year old Joe who is passionate about this... just like us.</p>
