        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Between 1965 and 1975, the FBI opened more than 500,000 intelligence files on more than one million Americans, according to a Congressional report.... Among the Bureau&#39;s targets: Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement, anti-Vietnam War Groups, and the underground press.&quot; - Center for Investigative Reporting<sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>J. Edgar Hoover issued directives for COINTELPRO, a codename for Counter Intelligence Program, in 1956. The original intent was to monitor the Communist Party USA but quickly expanded its scope to infiltrate and marginalize a variety of groups such as the American Indian Movement, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and the Black Panthers, as well as targeting high profile individuals such as Martin Luther King, Jr. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Purpose of counterintelligence action is to disrupt the BPP [Black Panther Party] and it is immaterial whether facts exist to substantiate the charge.&quot; - J. Edgar Hoover<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI&#39;s stated motivation was &quot;protecting national security, preventing violence, and <strong>maintaining the existing social and political order.</strong>&quot;<sup>3</sup> (Emphasis added). They used harassment, wiretapping, psychological warfare, propaganda, and assassinations among other techniques to achieve their goals. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Fred Hampton</strong></p>

<p>On December 4th, 1969, the Chicago Police Department and FBI raided an apartment housing members of the Black Panther Party. At 4:45 am, the heavily armed police stormed the apartment, killing Panther member Mark Clark immediately, who was serving a security duty. Clark fired his shotgun, the only shot fired by the Panthers that day, while the police and FBI would end up shooting over 98 times.<sup>4</sup> Forensics and firearms experts determined that Clark&#39;s shot was fired from very near the floor, indicating that Clark had already sustained grave injuries.</p>

<p>The raid team would then assault the room of Fred Hampton, a rising leader in the Panther movement. Police would fire twice at Hampton, who was lying next to his pregnant girlfriend, hitting his shoulder. Court transcripts revealed the following conversation took place:<sup>5</sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s Fred Hampton.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Is he dead?... Bring him out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He&#39;s barely alive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He&#39;ll make it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two more shots were fired, point blank at Hampton&#39;s head.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s good and dead now.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/g53BeLt.jpg">IMAGE: FRED HAMPTON&#39;S BEDROOM CRIME SCENE</a></p>

<p>Over a dozen more Panthers residing in the apartment would be wounded, beaten, and then charged with attempted murder of police officers. The next day, the media largely defended the FBI&#39;s actions. The Chicago Tribune published photos showing holes purported to be from bullets fired by the Panthers, but forensics would later reveal these holes to have been made by nails.<sup>6</sup> </p>

<p>Documents released by the Freedom of Information Act include a sketch of Hampton&#39;s apartment drawn by an FBI informant, used by police and FBI in the assassination. The informant received $300 from the FBI for providing the information.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/8BZDM9K.png">IMAGE: SKETCH DRAWN BY INFORMANT</a></p>

<p>The FBI had tried other methods before resorting to assassination, including sending a bogus letter to a rival Chicago gang leader in hopes of provoking a violent retaliation which read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Brother Jeff: I&#39;ve spent some time with some Panther friends on the west side lately and I know whats been going on. The brothers that run the Panthers blame you for blocking their thing and there&#39;s supposed to be a hit out for you. I&#39;m not a Panther, or a Ranger, just black. From what I see these Panthers are out for themselves, not black people. I think you ought to know what their (sic) up to, I know what I&#39;d do if I was you. You might here from me again. Signed, A Black Brother You Don&#39;t Know.”<sup>8</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The use of bogus letters for sabotage and attempting to provoke violence was widely used by the FBI throughout COINTELPRO. </p>

<p>Why was Fred Hampton targeted? He was a rising leader in the Black Panther Party and was in the process of uniting various gang, including the Puerto Rican &#39;Young Lords&#39; and the Caucasian &#39;Young Patriots&#39; into a political coalition. He had the potential to drastically change the political landscape of Chicago by channeling the youth unrest that had previously been directed against other gangs and instead direct it at the political establishment to fight against police corruption and to generate socially constructive energies. </p>

<p>This type of action was directly antagonistic to one of the primary directives of COINTELPRO put forth by J. Edgar Hoover himself, which read:<sup>9</sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Prevent the coalition of militant black nationalist groups.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same document also contained another relevant directive:<sup>10</sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Prevent the rise of a &#39;messiah&#39;”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fred Hampton had the charisma to unite large groups of young men and the attitude of social welfare and community development that had the potential to gain the support of the broader progressive community. His assassination prevented his career from escalating to these heights.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Subverting the Black Panther Party</strong></p>

<p>The FBI waged a wildly successful campaign against the Black Panther Party throughout the &#39;60s and &#39;70s. By the late &#39;60s, the Black Panther Party was the most prominent African American political force in the United States. They advocated a 10 point socialist program for black self-determination, provided free food and healthcare to communities, fought against hard drugs, and formed legal armed street patrols to deter violence from the KKK and other antagonistic organizations. They also advocated for community control of police, schools and other institutions. Today, these points are largely ignored in favor of the racist caricature promoted by the Bureau. The operations the FBI took to subvert the Panthers is truly astounding.</p>

<p>For example, there is the Black Panther coloring book, created by the FBI and distributed by Bureau informants to black children in an attempt to marginalize the Party within the black community.<sup>11</sup> It is directly related to Hoover&#39;s directive: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Prevent militant black nationalist groups and leaders from gaining respectability&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The goal was not to influence the children of these communities, but to marginalize the Panthers within the white community. The coloring book aimed to do just that, and would certainly be shocking to anyone who saw it. Once marginalized, the public would support increasingly repressive policies against the Panthers and their leadership, such as the Fred Hampton assassination. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/65TLB">IMAGES: THE BLACK PANTHER COLORING BOOK!</a></p>

<p>To J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, it did not matter what the activities of the Black Panther Party consisted of. In 1969, an FBI special agent sent Hoover a memo detailing how his investigation of the Panthers has only turned up pacifist activities such as feeding breakfast to children.<sup>12</sup> Hoover shot back a memo saying that the Agent&#39;s career ambitions were directly related to supplying Hoover with information supporting his view that the Panthers were &quot;... a violence prone organization seeking to overthrow the government by revolutionary means.&quot;<sup>13</sup></p>

<p>To prevent the unification of the Black Panther Party and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, popularly known as SNCC, the FBI resorted to fostering splits between the leadership of the two organizations. The FBI targeted Stokely Carmichael by using a technique known as &#39;bad jacket&#39;: they forged documents indicating that Carmichael was a CIA informant.<sup>14</sup> It worked.</p>

<p>The FBI also had the policy of arresting Panther members for any reason, even just on suspicion of crime without evidence, for the purpose of exhausting the Party&#39;s funds to pay bonds. The Panther&#39;s attorney said in 1970:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In a period of two years — December, 1967 to December, 1969 — the Black Panther Party has expended in bail-bond premiums alone— just the premiums, that is, money that will never be returned — a sum in excess of $200,000! How many breakfasts or lunches for hungry children, how much medical attention sorely needed in the ghetto communities would that $200,000 have furnished?...In the same two-year period, twenty-eight Panthers were killed.”<sup>15</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In instances where dozens of Panthers were arrested, the bond requirements were too high to pay and members sat in jail for weeks, or even months, a common COUNTELPRO tactic used against other groups as well. By 1974, the Black Panther Party had essentially collapsed under the weight of ruthless harassment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Martin Luther King</strong></p>

<p>In 1957, the FBI targeted the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as a “likely target for communist infiltration”.16 The nature of the group was entirely non-violent and focused on organizing the southern black vote. It was founded by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and several other southern black ministers. By 1964, Dr. King had given his &#39;I have a dream speech&#39; and had emerged as a preeminent civil rights leader and had also began to address social change that transcended racial issues. At this point, the FBI had marked King as a clear threat to the &#39;established order&#39;. Agent William C. Sullivan committed to writing: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We must mark [King] now, if we have not before, as the most dangerous Negro in the future of this Nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro, and national security...it maybe unrealistic to limit [our actions against King] to legalistic proofs that would stand up in court or before Congressional Committees.”<sup>17</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When it was announced that King would win the Nobel Prize, the FBI compiled an audio tape consisting of various fragments of conversations from King&#39;s tapped phones, bugged offices and hotel rooms. It was purported to demonstrate that King was a sexual deviant. It was sent to King with an anonymous note stating that it would be released to the press unless he committed suicide prior to receiving the award.<sup>18</sup> When King failed to reply, FBI Associate Director Cartha DeLoach offered the contents of the tape to various news institutions, including Newsweek, but the reporters nearly universally declined to report on the story.

<p>On April 24, 1968, Dr. King was assassinated. Although public memory has largely forgotten, King was in the process of organizing the &#39;Poor Peoples Campaign&#39;, aimed at uniting poor people of all races to rally for social change. It is likely that if King had not died, the campaign would have been wildly successful. The campaign also represented everything that COINTELPRO had been dedicated to prevent. Although there is no complete proof that the FBI was involved with the assassination, the jury of a 1999 Memphis civil trial came to the conclusion that James Earl Ray did not kill King, and that the real culprit was &#39;government agencies&#39;.<sup>19</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could try <strong><em>reading</em></strong> the article I posted a link to...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In September <strong>1917</strong>, the War Department&#39;s Military Intelligence Division (MID) opened a file on King&#39;s maternal grandfather, Rev. A. D. Williams.</p>

<p>As pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, Williams played a key role in Atlanta&#39;s black community. He was the Atlanta NAACP&#39;s first president in 1910 and an officer in the National Baptist Convention, the largest black religious organization of the time.</p>

<p>During World War I, Military Intelligence targeted black ministers and others as troublemakers or friends, depending on whether they worked as MID informants. Memphis businessman Robert R. Church Jr. supplied MID Maj. Walter H. Loving with names of prominent blacks in each major Southern city, intelligence files show.</p>

<p>One of the first items in Williams&#39;s intelligence file was a top-secret telegram sent to the Army&#39;s Southern Department headquarters in Atlanta. The telegram said in part:</p>

<p>&quot;It behooves us to find out all we possibly can about this colored preacher.&quot;</p>

<p>Later, a memo in Williams&#39;s file labeled him a &quot;radical Negro agitator&quot; for leading a campaign to create a black high school.</p>

<p>His NAACP involvement also earned him the attention of Army intelligence officers, who believed the civil rights group was &quot;an agitative pro-Soviet organization for propagandizing the Negroes,&quot; according to a 1926 report by Lt. Col. Walter O. Boswell, Army Intelligence executive officer at the War Department.</p>

<p>King&#39;s father, M. L. King Sr., eventually succeeded Williams as pastor at Ebenezer - and inherited his own Army watchers, Army Intelligence records show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI has never admitted to it as that would bring the book into the spotlight much more than it already has been. I searched long and hard while doing the original research to find sources that the coloring book was indeed a false flag operation.</p>

<p>What I found was that there are no primary documents to be found, but a largely significant amount of secondary sources beyond the conspiracy realm readily admit that it was an FBI operation. For example, Historian and FBI apologist Kenneth O&#39;Reilly admits to it in his book Racial Matters, although he largely downplays the fact.  </p>

<p>I found an excerpt of that paragraph on google books for you:</p>

<p><a href="http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=NpPWAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;amp;q=coloring+book">http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=NpPWAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;amp;q=coloring+book</a></p>

<p>Ward Churchill, the eminent COINTELPRO expert has come to the same conclusion, though I could see his bias attacked and opted for more opinions. </p>

<p>There is also the fact that skeptic forums and websites such as the Skeptic Project do not question the veracity.</p>

<p><a href="http://conspiracies.skepticproject.com/articles/us-government/cointelpro/">http://conspiracies.skepticproject.com/articles/us-government/cointelpro/</a></p>

<p>This page shows a 1969 newspaper article proving the Panthers &#39;repudiated&#39; the coloring book, and quotes Ward Churchill on its history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might want to add the fact that Hampton was drugged by an informant:</p>

<p>&quot;...an independent autopsy and blood analysis which were performed at the request of the Hampton family by Dr. Victor Levine, former chief pathologist for the Cook County coroner&#39;s office, and Dr. Eleanor Berman, a toxicologist and acting director of the Department of Biochemistry at Cook County Hospital, <strong>found a potentially lethal quantity of drugs in Fred Hampton&#39;s bloodstream -- a dosage which, at the least, would have induced a coma.</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>With up to <strong>nine informants inside the Panthers</strong>, including the resourceful William O&#39;Neal, <strong>the FBI had ample opportunity to have the chairman drugged. Informant Maria Fisher has asserted in a signed statement to the Chicago Daily News that one week before the killings, local FBI chief Marlin Johnson asked her to slip Hampton a colorless and taste-less drug which would put him to sleep so that the FBI could raid the apartment. She says that when she refused, Johnson told her she was &quot;being very foolish.&quot;&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/was-fred-hampton-executed?page=0,3">http://www.thenation.com/article/was-fred-hampton-executed?page=0,3</a></p>

<p>And that the informants tried to convince the Black Panthers to do more violent activities;</p>

<p>&quot;Not simply an informant, O&#39;Neal tried to provoke others into &quot;kamikaze&quot;-type activities. Former Panther member Louis Truelock has submitted an affidavit stating that during a visit to O&#39;Neal&#39;s father&#39;s home, the informer showed him putty, blasting caps and &quot;plastic bottles of liquid,&quot; enough material to produce several bombs. He proposed that they blow up an armory and later suggested robbing a McDonald&#39;s restaurant. Truelock and others who heard O&#39;Neal&#39;s provocative proposals rejected them as useless to the cause.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;William O&#39;NeaI&#39;s crowning achievement was his advance work on the December 4 raid. Two weeks before the attack, he provided the FBI with a detailed floor plan of Panther headquarters, complete with an &quot;X&quot; over Fred Hampton&#39;s bed. Most of the shots were fired at that spot&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first main point to take away is that the very core of FBI operations involved maintaining the status quo, socially and politically. While the name COINTELPRO may have been retired, the essence of this order has stayed intact.</p>

<p>The most relevant evidence of this is the wholesale manufacture of terror threats:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/opinion/sunday/terrorist-plots-helped-along-by-the-fbi.html?pagewanted=all">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/opinion/sunday/terrorist-plots-helped-along-by-the-fbi.html?pagewanted=all</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/16/fbi-entrapment-fake-terror-plots">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/16/fbi-entrapment-fake-terror-plots</a></p>

<p>They use entrapment, frequently of mentally ill people, to create a terrorism scapegoat, justifying increasing not only their own budget but the entirety of the Homeland Security and beyond. The &#39;deep state&#39; needs a domestic enemy, and the FBI is providing it.</p>

<p>Other parallels can be seen in the disruption of groups such as Occupy Wallstreet.</p>
