       So, we heard today that the boffins at INMARSAT have "recalculated" the where MH370 ditched because it was flying faster than expected (and therefore ran out of fuel earlier). The new site is 1,100 km closer to the last known radar contact at 02.14 (KL time). Sounds plausible at first glance.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/28/flight-mh370-search-zone-moved-based-on-planes-fuel-consumption">
        http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/28/flight-mh370-search-zone-moved-based-on-planes-fuel-consumption
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But, and this is a collosall clusterfuck of a BUT, we know from INMARSAT that the last ping sent from MH370 was six hours later, at 08.19 (KL time) - this has not changed. If the plane was flying FASTER during those 6 hours it was in the air, it would have travelled a GREATER distance during that time. The opposite of what they are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone see the problem here with the official story? Anyone.....?

       So much disinfo and weird shit going on with this flight. I can't tell if it's to cover up something that's actually important or if it's all just a meaningless distraction. Like a lot of other things, it's probably both.

       We may never know if MH370's disappearance is meant to be a distraction from some other event, but if 239 people have been murdered, I don't think it can be described as "meaningless". This is a major event in its own right.

       My guess is MH370 was just a beta test for a new malware like stuxnet, but this has a programmed destination.  Probably could compromise the airplane's electrical systems via usb port or wifi utilizing a smart phone or laptop.  Those planes can be flown via fly by wire anyways.  Dang, they could probably have the malware installed on anyone's phone without them knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the malware is in the system it could execute the following commands without any input from a user:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        disable the communications systems
       </li>
       <li>
        disable the transponder
       </li>
       <li>
        disable the flight controls
       </li>
       <li>
        disable the air systems to incapacitate the crew/people
       </li>
       <li>
        add destination in autopilot: South Indian Ocean
       </li>
       <li>
        task complete
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Piece of cake.

       Funny you should mention that. The FAA issued a warning in 2013 about Boeing 777's possibly being vulnerable to electronic attacks through the plane's internal network. It's a known issue with several 777 models.

       I dunno, a red-eye flight in the middle of the night seems like a good test platform.  They can test stuff as much as they want in a lab, but until it is proven in a live environment it can't be deployable.  But this is all speculation anyways.

       Seems like MH370 was a test run for something bigger.

       A vehicle with a fixed amount of fuel that travels faster, generally travels farther per unit of time but not as far for the whole trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jump in your car. Fill your tank. Drive 90 miles per hour until you run out of gas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now re-fill and drive back at 45 miles per hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first trip, you covered more ground per hour (90 miles vs. 45) but you drove probably about 3/4 the distance distance you did in the second trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there's a whole lot of bullshit, disinformation, obfuscation, and such going on over this flight. One certainly has to wonder what's really happening or happened.

       here is the time in the air, not the fuel or the speed.

       Imagine you drive for 6 hours. Your average speed is 90mph. You will travel 540 miles. OK?

      <p>
       Now we want you to drive for 6 hours at 100mph. You should travel 600 miles. Agreed?
      </p>
      <p>
       You now need to tell the MH370 search authorities, because they think the plane travelled for 6 hours at a higher speed and managed to travel a shorter distance. Their explanation is a mathematical impossibility.

       Remember all fixed wing aircraft will glide and so unless there was catastrophic failure the plane would continue in air without engine thrust unaided without fuel. I think a 7*7 plane's glide ratio is about 17:1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a huge difference and I can't math well enough to plug those numbers into an equation, would explain a gradual loss of speed though.

       Also, the final ping was a 'partial ping', although we all seem to be in the dark about what that means!

       That hinges on the plane being in the air for the same amount of time at either speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone actually know how long it was in the air? What speed it was traveling? Altitude? You would think that there are systems in place to acquire that sort of data for commercial flights, outside of just their black boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, if there were some sort of network like that, it would make the black boxes redundant, wouldn't it? The plane could just upload whatever it would have written into the black box to the network instead.

       Just playing devil's advocate here. What if it ran out of fuel, glided, and made a perfect water landing before sinking, and that's why it was able to be pinged 6 hours later. So, it could have still been intact, but stationary.

       I guess this is possible, but a (presumably, piloted) landing on water doesn't appear to fit with any of the "plausible" explanations of what happened (suicide pilot, hijack, fly-by-wire capture, military shoot-down etc).

       The problem is no one has ever successfully ditched something the size of a 777 in the ocean and had the plane remain intact. As oceans go the area they claim it went down is in rough waters. It would be a first.

       What I don't get is the whole INMARSAT situation. INMARSAT provides satellite data and communication (phone, internet etc.) service for the plane. Why didn't anyone, like the flight crew, just call out from the plane if it had INMARSAT? The official explanation is that the plane was equipped with INMARSAT satcom but Malaysian Airlines hadn't "subscribed" to the service and the INMARSAT satcom modem was just send keep-alive pings to the satellite. Why would Malaysian Airlines waste the money to install the INMARSAT hardware (which is the expensive part) and not actually "subscribe" to the service?

       The question I haven't seen asked yet in here is; How did the Australian Military radar not pick up the plane?  Given this new search area and the radar's range, you would think it would have picked something up.

       Agreed. Between the Australians and the US eyes-and-ears on Diego Garcia, it is pretty much inconceivable that MH370 wasn't picked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think the fly-by-wire hypothesis to Diego Garcia makes the most sense, and it's the only one with credible eye-witnesses for a mystery plane flying an unscheduled route (Maldives).

       I agree. The airspace around China is heavily monitored as part of our nuclear early warning systems. So either the official story is false or you can just fly nuclear bombers around the South China with complete impunity.

       As long as the search zone is on the final ping arc then it should be a legitimate place to search.  Presumably the new search zone is where the revised fuel range arc intersects with the final ping arc.  But surely a plane flying a slightly shorter distance at a slightly faster speed is going to hit that point of intersection before 8.11am?

       Precisely. The explanation does not make sense. This calls everything into question, including INMARSATs very sketchy ping data "analysis" which everyone is relying on. I don't think INMARSAT is actually telling the truth, so this search is a collosal red herring for the media to feast on.

       You're missing a couple of key points.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The plane did not travel in a straight line. It changed direction a handful of times.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The "plane was traveling faster than previously thought" is partially true. The newly discovered data shows that the plane was traveling faster than previously thought up to the point of the crucial turn that headed the plane towards the Indian Ocean.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Planes burn fuel the faster they go and the lower they fly. Without getting into the fine details, generally the plane was flying faster and lower prior to the crucial turn. It then flew slower and higher after the turn.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When the plane's fuel is exhausted it becomes a glider. The estimated gliding distance would be added to the estimated range that the plane ran out of fuel. I don't remember the ratio for the 777 but IIRC it was 250-300 miles of gliding if the plane ran out of fuel at cruising altitude.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The SAR is for any sign of wreckage at this stage. They are not actively searching for the black box at this point in time due to the size of the search area and depth of the ocean. The planed crashed into a violent part of the ocean three weeks ago. Floating debris has drifted significantly from the point of impact. Luckily the majority of the currents head towards land. Currents are hard to predict to begin with.
        </p>
       </li>

      <p>
       This is false. The authorities have known since day 1 when the plane changed direction, so they knew the speed MH370 was travelling. It's the period after it was lost by radar that INMARSAT has been analysing.

       Time equals distance divided by speed. The time is constant. If the speed increases, the only way for the time to stay constant is for the distance to increase by the same amount. But the northern search zone is closer to Malaysia. So if MH370 flew faster but ended up in the northern search zone at 8.11 it could only do so by flying further west towards Diego Garcia before cutting back south east, thus flying further but ending up closer to Malaysia. But in flying faster it would not have enough fuel to do so. This forces the assumption that MH370 flew faster back across Malaysia than originally thought, then flew slower and lower than originally thought after turning south east. The average speed for the whole flight would be slower, the distance flown would be shorter and the time would remain the same. Shorter and slower on its own increases fuel range, so MH370 must have also flown lower to run out of fuel between 8.11 and 9.10.

       When the plane crashes all the electrics are kaput. Except for the transponder on the black box, of course, but there's been no sign of that either. Almost like the plane never crashed, but landed somewhere like...Diego Garcia?

       I agree with that, although in this case, it is the search authorities who have produced an explanation of events that is self-contradictory.

       It is always said that a lie is much more work than telling the truth, because you can't be sure where it is going to take you. In this case, it appears that the authorities' lies have started to crash into each other.

       Why test it on a commercial flight with actual passengers (if indeed it was and if indeed they were/are)? Wouldn't it make more sense to test it in secret?

       Funny you should mention that. The FAA issued a warning in 2013 about Boeing 777's possibly being vulnerable to electronic attacks through the plane's internal network. It's a known issue with several 777 models.
