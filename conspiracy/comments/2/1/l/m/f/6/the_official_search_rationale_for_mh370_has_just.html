        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, we heard today that the boffins at INMARSAT have &quot;recalculated&quot; the where MH370 ditched because it was flying faster than expected (and therefore ran out of fuel earlier). The new site is 1,100 km closer to the last known radar contact at 02.14 (KL time). Sounds plausible at first glance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/28/flight-mh370-search-zone-moved-based-on-planes-fuel-consumption">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/28/flight-mh370-search-zone-moved-based-on-planes-fuel-consumption</a></p>

<p>But, and this is a collosall clusterfuck of a BUT, we know from INMARSAT that the last ping sent from MH370 was six hours later, at 08.19 (KL time) - this has not changed. If the plane was flying FASTER during those 6 hours it was in the air, it would have travelled a GREATER distance during that time. The opposite of what they are saying. </p>

<p>Anyone see the problem here with the official story? Anyone.....?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is MH370 was just a beta test for a new malware like stuxnet, but this has a programmed destination.  Probably could compromise the airplane&#39;s electrical systems via usb port or wifi utilizing a smart phone or laptop.  Those planes can be flown via fly by wire anyways.  Dang, they could probably have the malware installed on anyone&#39;s phone without them knowing.  </p>

<p>Once the malware is in the system it could execute the following commands without any input from a user: </p>

<ul>
<li>disable the communications systems</li>
<li>disable the transponder</li>
<li>disable the flight controls</li>
<li>disable the air systems to incapacitate the crew/people</li>
<li>add destination in autopilot: South Indian Ocean</li>
<li>task complete</li>

<p>What you are saying is not incorrect, but neither is it relevant to the issue. The <strong>constant</strong> here is the time in the air, not the fuel or the speed.</p>

<p>Imagine you drive for 6 hours. Your average speed is 90mph. You will travel 540 miles. OK?</p>

<p>Now we want you to drive for 6 hours at 100mph. You should travel 600 miles. Agreed? </p>

<p>You now need to tell the MH370 search authorities, because they think the plane travelled for 6 hours at a higher speed and managed to travel a shorter distance. Their explanation is a mathematical impossibility.</p>

<p>Does anyone actually know how long it was in the air? What speed it was traveling? Altitude? You would think that there are systems in place to acquire that sort of data for commercial flights, outside of just their black boxes.</p>

<p>Then again, if there were some sort of network like that, it would make the black boxes redundant, wouldn&#39;t it? The plane could just upload whatever it would have written into the black box to the network instead.</p>

<p>Just playing devil&#39;s advocate here. What if it ran out of fuel, glided, and made a perfect water landing before sinking, and that&#39;s why it was able to be pinged 6 hours later. So, it could have still been intact, but stationary. </p>

<p>I guess this is possible, but a (presumably, piloted) landing on water doesn&#39;t appear to fit with any of the &quot;plausible&quot; explanations of what happened (suicide pilot, hijack, fly-by-wire capture, military shoot-down etc). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t get is the whole INMARSAT situation. INMARSAT provides satellite data and communication (phone, internet etc.) service for the plane. Why didn&#39;t anyone, like the flight crew, just call out from the plane if it had INMARSAT? The official explanation is that the plane was equipped with INMARSAT satcom but Malaysian Airlines hadn&#39;t &quot;subscribed&quot; to the service and the INMARSAT satcom modem was just send keep-alive pings to the satellite. Why would Malaysian Airlines waste the money to install the INMARSAT hardware (which is the expensive part) and not actually &quot;subscribe&quot; to the service?</p>

<p>I still think the fly-by-wire hypothesis to Diego Garcia makes the most sense, and it&#39;s the only one with credible eye-witnesses for a mystery plane flying an unscheduled route (Maldives).</p>

<p>Precisely. The explanation does not make sense. This calls everything into question, including INMARSATs very sketchy ping data &quot;analysis&quot; which everyone is relying on. I don&#39;t think INMARSAT is actually telling the truth, so this search is a collosal red herring for the media to feast on.</p>

<li><p>The SAR is for any sign of wreckage at this stage. They are not actively searching for the black box at this point in time due to the size of the search area and depth of the ocean.

<p>Gotta cut this short- toddler is going nuts. Will come back to this later.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The plane did not travel in a straight line. It changed direction a handful of times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is already factored in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;plane was traveling faster than previously thought&quot; is partially true. The newly discovered data shows that the plane was traveling faster than previously thought up to the point of the crucial turn that headed the plane towards the Indian Ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is false. The authorities have known since day 1 when the plane changed direction, so they knew the speed MH370 was travelling. It&#39;s the period after it was lost by radar that INMARSAT has been analysing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without getting into the fine details, generally the plane was flying faster and lower prior to the crucial turn. It then flew slower and higher after the turn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not what INMARSAT have said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the plane&#39;s fuel is exhausted it becomes a glider. The estimated gliding distance would be added to the estimated range that the plane ran out of fuel. I don&#39;t remember the ratio for the 777 but IIRC it was 250-300 miles of gliding if the plane ran out of fuel at cruising altitude. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So MH370 would have travelled further than the original calculations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The SAR is for any sign of wreckage at this stage. They are not actively searching for the black box at this point in time due to the size of the search area and depth of the ocean. The planed crashed into a violent part of the ocean three weeks ago. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new data analysis has not been considering ocean currents, so this isn&#39;t relevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time equals distance divided by speed. The time is constant. If the speed increases, the only way for the time to stay constant is for the distance to increase by the same amount. But the northern search zone is closer to Malaysia. So if MH370 flew faster but ended up in the northern search zone at 8.11 it could only do so by flying further west towards Diego Garcia before cutting back south east, thus flying further but ending up closer to Malaysia. But in flying faster it would not have enough fuel to do so. This forces the assumption that MH370 flew faster back across Malaysia than originally thought, then flew slower and lower than originally thought after turning south east. The average speed for the whole flight would be slower, the distance flown would be shorter and the time would remain the same. Shorter and slower on its own increases fuel range, so MH370 must have also flown lower to run out of fuel between 8.11 and 9.10.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that, although in this case, it is the search authorities who have produced an explanation of events that is self-contradictory. </p>

<p>It is always said that a lie is much more work than telling the truth, because you can&#39;t be sure where it is going to take you. In this case, it appears that the authorities&#39; lies have started to crash into each other.</p>
