<p>Pretty good article with numbers attached:
<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-spoils-of-war-afghanistan-s-multibillion-dollar-heroin-trade/91">http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-spoils-of-war-afghanistan-s-multibillion-dollar-heroin-trade/91</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a question about where this stuff is coming from, but i don&#39;t know it would be possible to directly correlate usage with that trend</p>

<p>I think an interesting recent take on this issue is the Narcan drug that can be given to a user who has ODed.  Christie just authorized its administration by untrained law enforcement professionals in NJ.  While it sounds like an excellent, life saving idea on the one had, it might set an interesting precedent to police officers to be administering pharmaceutical drugs without the aid of a medical professional.  </p>

If we were involved with afghan supply we would be selling the dope back to users in the u.s,Canada, Mexico, russia, europe, and china. Damn this is a complex ring. Where are the other producers ?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about the same thing. Many of my friends have been bitten by the pain pill bug and they seem to be pushing them onto junk these days. </p>

<p>I like to search in news for OD&#39;s and confiscations. You can read about how the drug busts are larger than the cops have ever seen up and down the eastern seaboard. Big cities and small towns. </p>

<p>BTW, news about extra pure junk in the media attracts junky&#39;s to those areas. They are advertisements for heroin. Junky&#39;s want the purest shit, they just have to be told how good it is or they&#39;ll OD. </p>

<p>Heroin, unlike cocaine and weed, is used in much smaller quantities. It is conceivable for one man to carry in the day&#39;s supply of heroin into Manhattan in a single briefcase. </p>

<p>It would be difficult to tell. You&#39;d need variables and run a statistical regression, but with the right information you might be able to determine the effect news has on usage. You&#39;d need to look in trends in the news with demand. Demand, because it is black market, would have to be estimated. You would have to come up with your own ratio to represent this value. </p>

<p>Secondly, who is getting industrial supplies of fentanyl to cut heroin? The fact that it is cut with a high-grade hard to get pharmaceutical is even more suspicious to me. Both have a retail value, there is no reason to mix them, unless you want OD&#39;d junkies.  </p>

<p>Who knows how it gets in there.Corrupt doctors? All an employee at a processing plant would have to do is smuggle out an ounce or so to seriously alter the supply of a major market.</p>

<p>No reason to mix??? If you have shit product no one is going to buy it, dealers will chop in fentanyl to make it stronger. When they cut too much in you run into problems.</p>

<p>Quality varies, I live in Cleveland and have three staple dealers. One of them has great stuff, the other two is average. The difference?  The dealer with the good shit drives to Chicago once a week to pick up in bulk, the other two buy in bulk right in Cleveland.

That means they were stock-piling it somewhere to push onto the market and bring down prices. This might be what we are seeing. Kabul and Tehran have an epidemic of dope fiends because of the availability and individual hardship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heroin is getting huge in the suburbs of Chicago where I work. </p>

<p>These are not inner city disadvantaged youth. These are kids from very affluent families. Kids who parents own large businesses. </p>

<p>It crazy to say but one major traffic artery has been dubbed the heroin highway. Kids are ODing in record number and there is no end in sight. </p>

<p>Heroin is now mainstream with these kids. And the worst part is they have the money to feed the addiction. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like the opposite of what happened when crack was introduced into the slums and ghettos in the 70s.  This time the target is wealthy suburban kids.  A whole new type of control where they need it most, the places where people will one day have the means to make a difference. </p>
