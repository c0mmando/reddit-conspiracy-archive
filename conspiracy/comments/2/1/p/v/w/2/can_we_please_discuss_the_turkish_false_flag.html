        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So as most people will be aware of here, a leaked audio recording of various high level Turkish officials reveals they were discussing the implementation of an attack on themselves to start off a war in Syria which could possibly invoke <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty#Article_Four">article 4</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty#Article_Five">article 5 of NATO.</a> It has had quite a lot of coverage here but I&#39;m still flabbergasted at how little attention it has got all over Reddit considering how incredible of a revelation it is.</p>

<p>Here is the leaked audio converted to a transcript...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/turkey-youtube-ban-full-transcript-leaked-syria-war-conversation-between-erdogan-officials-1442161">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/turkey-youtube-ban-full-transcript-leaked-syria-war-conversation-between-erdogan-officials-1442161</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hakan Fidan:
&quot;I&#39;ll send 4 men from Syria, if that&#39;s what it takes. I&#39;ll make up a cause of war by ordering a missile attack on Turkey; we can also prepare an attack on Suleiman Shah Tomb if necessary.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is obviously the most damning part amongst other high level corruption which proves beyond doubt that a false flag attack was a consideration.</p>

<p>The next part of the post is the absolutely incredible wording (or the lack of wording) from some of the most &#39;trusted&#39; and widely used media sources from the US and UK.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2Q17420140327">Reuters - The account posted what it presented as a recording of intelligence chief Hakan Fidan discussing possible military operations in Syria with Davutoglu, Deputy Chief of military Staff Yasar Guler and other senior officials.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/27/world/europe/turkey-youtube-blocked/?c=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;page=1">CNN -  The Turkish government said its YouTube block came as a response to the leak of a conversation between top government officials purportedly discussing the possibility of going to war with neighboring Syria.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/youtube-banned-turkey-n63776">NBC - The ban comes after conversations implicating Erdogan of corruption were leaked on YouTube last month. Important local elections are scheduled to be held on March 30, 2014. A &quot;source at the prime minister&#39;s office&quot; in Turkey told Reuters that the ban was related to leaked conversations about a potential military operation in Syria and that it might be lifted if the offending videos were removed from YouTube.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-27/turkey-blocks-youtube-after-leak-of-syria-incursion-planning.html">Bloomberg - Turkey defended its decision to block YouTube after a leaked recording of a meeting where top officials discussed a possible military incursion into Syria appeared on the site.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/27/turkey-blocks-youtube/6958649/">USA Today - An audio recording leaked on YouTube appears to reveal that top Turkey officials were plotting to fake an attack against their own country as an excuse to wage war on Syria.</a></p>

<p>At least USA Today made it clear that it was going to be a false flag, I guess the writer didn&#39;t get the memo.</p>

<p><a href="http://bbc.com/news/world-europe-26773702">BBC - It relates to a discussion of possible military operations in Syria, which was apparently attended by Turkey&#39;s intelligence chief, its foreign minister and the deputy head of the armed forces.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/turkey-blocks-youtube-twitter-erdogan-ban">Channel 4 News - In the Turkish government&#39;s second online intervention in as many weeks, it has blocked the video-sharing site YouTube after a recording was posted on the site which apparently shows top security officials in Turkey discussing possible military operations in Syria.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/google-youtube-ban-turkey-erdogan">The Guardian - The move by the TIB came hours after an anonymous YouTube account posted a leaked audio recording allegedly of a confidential conversation between Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu, undersecretary of the foreign ministry Feridun Sinirlioglu and deputy chief of the general staff, Yasar GÃ¼rel, discussing possible military action in Syria.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/turkey-blocks-youtube-as-leaks-of-further-government-corruption-are-uploaded-9219271.html">The Independant - YouTube has been blocked in Turkey after alleged leaks of high-level security talks regarding Syria were uploaded to the site.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1233171/turkey-youtube-hit-by-internet-restrictions">Sky News - Thursday&#39;s recording purports to be of senior Turkish government, military and spy officials discussing a military intervention in neighbouring Syria - a hugely contentious issue in Turkey. The officials allegedly debate plans to stage an armed clash in Syria or a missile attack that would serve as justification for intervention. The context of the conversation is not clear.</a></p>

<p>Context not clear Sky News?</p>

<p>There&#39;s an obvious trend barring USA Today and that is all of them do not once mention the attacks would come from Turkey themselves or completely ignore it and frame the article around high level discussions or corruption.</p>

<p>I have some questions for people who don&#39;t find this incredibly strange...</p>

<p>Skeptics argue that the media only discuss things people are interested in and they post stories to attract views for advertisement purposes. With all the constant reporting on terrorism in these media outlets, why is this case being treated differently? The constant terrorism reporting obviously interests people if your argument is that they only cover things that people are interested in. Is this not enough drama to attract viewers attentions as well? it could be a plot for a Hollywood movie which again, people seem to be interested In. Why do they all use the same wording as if it comes from the same report although each writer differs?</p>

<p>Why is the USA Today article worded so that the reader gets the most important and explosive core of the article and understands that Turkey would be faking an attack on itself? What happened at USA Today that makes them stand out from the rest?</p>

<p>If there is any big mainstream source you&#39;ve seen that specifically point out it was a false flag, please post a link.</p>

<p>I have really lost faith in even respected press that I once trusted; jounals such as the Wa-Post and NYT.  I feel like I can&#39;t trust them to tell me what&#39;s really going on in the world anymore.

<p>I wanted to put the various sources in one place so people could see that it was the same style of reporting which to me is highly suspicious.</p>

<p>What makes it so important to point out is that some of these sources are the default news organisations that hundreds of millions of people get their news from. The BBC is often left out of these discussions and seen to be above all the others in terms of journalistic integrity when it&#39;s clear they aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crystal clear that pointing out Turkey was going to utilise a false flag was a big no no. Why are they scared of printing those two words? </p>

<p>I think you have to not be at either end of the extremes in terms of conspiracy or mainstream points. The truth is often somewhere in the Middle and you don&#39;t need to cite some obscure blog, it&#39;s available in either mainstream, academic or from the source anyway. If people complain about bad sources, start accommodating them by giving a source they find acceptable. That&#39;s how you get people on side.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A lot of people are lying to you, the only truth is the one you can confirm to yourself with your own mind using yours and other peoples material. Never take anybody&#39;s word as stated, that goes for anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot them do actually have news wires from Reuters but that doesn&#39;t explain why they nearly all chose to word it how they did. Why two little words that don&#39;t seem to be that interesting or important couldn&#39;t be printed is indication that they are the opposite of that. I think that the mere mention of it sets off peoples interest and then those people will Google the words and then what comes up is not good for the people that do it.</p>

<p>They also have plausible deniability by calling it a &#39;military operation&#39; which it is essentially but it doesn&#39;t paint the picture the way it needs to be. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit disappointed that this didn&#39;t blow up and become a massive thing. I don&#39;t really know what needs to be printed or announced on the news for people to really take notice and it seems the media are getting more brazen with their lies as well. That maybe to do with the fact they are allowed to do it now with no repercussions, not that they had any anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much OP for point out this needs more attention. It&#39;s because of the occasional gem like this that I stay subscribed to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. In trying to do further research I definitely wanted to see what Sibel Edmonds had to say about it. Her name should be well known for the work she did as a brave whistleblower exposing corruption in the US intelligence apparatus especially as regards its relationship to turkey.</p>

<p>Anyway her website has a piece which puts this whole thing in a bit more context. Definitely worth a read. <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2014/03/29/bfp-exclusive-turkish-power-struggle-impedes-natos-campaign-in-syria/">http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2014/03/29/bfp-exclusive-turkish-power-struggle-impedes-natos-campaign-in-syria/</a> </p>

<p>One quote of interest</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2014/03/29/bfp-exclusive-turkish-power-struggle-impedes-natos-campaign-in-syria/#sthash.vUrBGP4K.dpuf">The tape/audio has been heavily tampered with; if authentic, then they have taken statements/conversations from several different contexts and time frames, and then theyâve patched them together after sanitizing, censoring. For example: you donât hear any mention of US/NATO or the Pentagon, yet they left the part with the UN in there â¦</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment have a deep and profound way with words and their meanings. Don&#39;t forget they all use words and ancient symbolism that dates back to the early days. When these words are used in conjunction with Edward Bernays propaganda methods at targeting the individual&#39;s sub conscious mind the overall truth gets subverted. Language and words mean more than just the meanings we find in the dictionary.</p>

<p>We are kidding ourselves if we expect the media to give us the truth. One or two rogue stations might hint on the truth in clever wording but then it gets buried never to be shown again or the interviewee gets cut off.</p>

<p>Only reason I think USA today would do it is to keep us fighting with each other because we all have our own perception and different views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;My question is what would Turkey gain by wanting to go to war with Syria?&quot;</p>

<p>The protests were forming again.  The last time the people rose up in great numbers - over the planned destruction of a public park, no less - Erdogan and his people realized they came too close to being toppled.  Maybe this was meant to rally support for the current regime by creating a cause the country would rally around.  Thus, raising support for him.  </p>

<p>Or, more sinisterly, the reason for this could have been the latest step in a cooperative effort by the US and it&#39;s NATO allies to create the opportunity to go into Syria and topple Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>That would be a real good reason the US would want the information to be suppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watched bill mahr with my wife last night and I proposed the same question.  He brought up the fact that Turkey had banned YouTube and Twitter then opened up the subject to the panel.  I paused it and said, &quot;he just skipped over the most important part of the whole reason why they would ban those outlets.&quot;   He didn&#39;t even explain why they were blocked.  I know he isn&#39;t a &quot;reputable&quot; news outlet but it goes to show how these things are discussed amongst talking heads.</p>

<p>Nice work op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great observation, OP. Noticed the very same thing watching the CBC this a.m. Talking head mentioned the blocking of twitter and yt because of false accusations being spread on social media by foes of the gov...</p>

<p>period...end of story...next.</p>

<p>The entire 20sec bit could have been written by a Turkish official.</p>

<p>On their website it appears they took it from Sky.</p>

<p>The four are allegedly heard discussing a military intervention in neighboring Syria, a sensitive political issue in Turkey, although the context of the conversation is not clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The context is not clear&quot; is a cop out but you have to consider why they write what they write. They explain the story but dismiss it in the same paragraph. It&#39;s plausible deniability to post the article but basically say it&#39;s unsubstantiated. No one can complain it&#39;s not been covered but it has been dismissed as if the content wasn&#39;t immediately apparent. If you just read the transcript, which they don&#39;t link to, you can make judgement on that yourself. Most people won&#39;t bother looking for it which is why it isn&#39;t there.</p>
