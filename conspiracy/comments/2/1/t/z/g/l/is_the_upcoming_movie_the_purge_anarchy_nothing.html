<p>This movie is actually against everything anarchists stand for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saw the trailer yesterday, my thoughts exactly. Blatant propaganda with it&#39;s predetermined, disingenuous and always narrowing narrative. Demagogy, that is all.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say theoretically tomorrow there are no laws and no state power to enforce them, you really think everybody would go full Charles Manson, that&#39;s ludicrous.</p>

<p>Laws and it&#39;s entailed repercussions aren&#39;t really a deterrent, it&#39;s even proven scientifically: tougher laws (i.e., let&#39;s say bringing on capital punishment) doesn&#39;t factor in for sickos with anti-social behavior, they&#39;ll do what sickos do.</p>

<p>That is, unless we reshape society, mostly our socioeconomic conditions, even then, there&#39;s always gonna be sickos.</p>

<p>My point is, look at certain places where they have repealed road signalization, it not like it generates a sudden huge wave in car crashes.</p>

<p>Secondly, anarchy doesn&#39;t mean no rules, it means no rulers and if your are to analyze for what it is: a train of thought, or an attitude or something you do, I kinda like it defined as a human aspiration...</p>

<p>Anarchy is not wonton violence, it&#39;s basic principles are: egalitarianism, decentralization, true federalism, freedom from oppression (e.g., labor exploitation, racism, sexism...), self-organization/autonomy, free/voluntary-association, mutual aid, the opposition of coercive authority...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not helping us at all with your uninformed opinions.  The first movie was a direct plot to get people used to the culling of less fortunate members of society according to that idiot alex jones.</p>

<p>I watched it, ultimately it was a story about empathy and compassion for total strangers and how that can come back to help you in your own life someday.</p>

<p>There are plenty of GREAT stories and hopefully good brainwashing that can come out of Hollywood and it does happen all the fucking time.  Enough with the all-inclusive Hollywood is bad fallacy you just make us all look like freaks in the same vein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably. </p>

<p>I actually liked the first one, although it wasn&#39;t great. (After writing this comment and thinking about the movie more I recommend it)</p>

<p>What I thought was interesting was the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; built into the plot. It was very clearly laid out on a TV news segment within the movie.  Everyone I&#39;ve talked to has completely missed this bit from the movie or it went over their heads.</p>

<p>It gave a much more believable explanation of the purpose of the Purge and why it has effectively &quot;saved society&quot; than the somewhat ridiculous theory that the characters in the movie are being forcefed by the media on a daily basis.</p>

<p>The Purge hasn&#39;t saved the economy and eliminated crime and unemployment by letting people &quot;blow off steam.&quot; What&#39;s actually happening is that The Purge is a mass culling of the poor and weak members of society while the rich and powerful are safe in their barricaded mansions. That&#39;s why unemployment and crime are down.</p>

<p>A counterpoint, perhaps a deviously subversive one, to the &quot;official story&quot; of the movie.</p>

<p>The main characters are not bad people, but the media is constantly brainwashing everyone to not only accept the Purge but to participate in it. They roll out an endless series of experts and psychologists to tell people why it&#39;s a good thing, and perfectly natural.</p>

<p>The Purge hasn&#39;t just allowed people to &quot;unleash the beast&quot; and an organic bloodbath ensues, the population has to be whipped up into a violent frenzy by the media in order to be convinced to participate.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to watch this new movie to see if there are any similar clever little hidden themes.</p>

<p>Edit: For those who haven&#39;t seen it, spoilers incoming: the film ends with good triumphing over evil, but not by fighting fire with fire. The good guys &quot;win&quot; by holding onto their humanity despite the temptation to turn to barbarity in response to barbarity being visited upon them.</p>

<p>Edit2: even the title has a double meaning! I&#39;m liking this movie more and more!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you do end up watching it let me know what you think, I&#39;d appreciate it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely some dumb stuff in the movie. Like how big is this house that three people can become separated and lose each other ha. It stuck out to me that the layout of the house was intentionally obfuscated, so you&#39;ve got all these people walking around trying to kill or save each other and you have no idea where they are in relation to one another. I hate that in movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The powers that be want us all to think that we need rules and regulations to survive, and people to enforce those rules and regulations...that without them civilization will break down. This is not true. In fact, if our society ever &quot;broke down&quot;, I believe that we would pull together as a people and help each other out...the government wants us to think that if an extreme event took place, that your neighbor is going to rape your daughter and steal all your food. This is most likely not going to happen. </p>

<p>The definition of Anarchy completely changes when the Propaganda of the Deed is subscribed to...anarchy without the <em>Propaganda of the Deed</em> is much different than what the MSM simplifies it into and a more descriptive name for it is <em>ETHICAL INDIVIDUALISM</em>...for those of you interested in anarchy as a philosophy please read this. <a href="http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/Anarcy_index.html">http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/Anarcy_index.html</a></p>

<p>anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.</p>

<p>chaos? why? are you going to rob your neighbour just because there is nobody in congress or the senate?</p>
